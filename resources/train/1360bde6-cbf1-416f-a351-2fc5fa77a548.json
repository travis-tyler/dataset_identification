Older adults with preclinical and prodromal AD are often underdiagnosed and not treatment seeking, which underscores the need for screening strategies that can be deployed widely in a cost-efficient manner [2] .\nIn older adults, decline in cognition and functional abilities are important indicators of incipient dementia. Functional and cognitive decline are associated with AD pathology [3] [4] [5] and are predictors of future disease progression [6] . Furthermore, preservation of everyday function is important to patients and their families, and decline is associated with high caregiver burden [7, 8] . Cognitive and functional decline can be sensitively and reliably measured by asking a collateral source or study partner (SP). SP report is an integral component of many AD clinical studies, and can discriminate between, and predict progression from, cognitively normal status to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [9] [10] [11] [12] .\nSP report of decline is also reliably associated with magnitude of cognitive impairment determined from neuropsychological assessment [13, 14] . The same relationship is not observed as consistently for self-reported cognitive decline, where factors such as depressed mood [15] [16] [17] and lack of awareness associated with dementia limits its usefulness [14, 18, 19] . SP report of impairment is associated moderately with abnormal levels of AD biomarkers, such as positron emission tomography amyloid burden and hippocampal volume [3, [20] [21] [22] . Thus, SP ratings of functional and cognitive abilities potentially provide a sound basis for early identification of the disease. Furthermore, use of SP report provides the opportunity to identify decline in adults reluctant to seek care themselves, has low influence from cultural or educational backgrounds, and can be applied widely in the community without requiring any formal clinical setting [23, 24] .\nA number of validated SP-reported instruments exist, including the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale [25] , a semistructured interview incorporating self-report and SP report, which has been adopted as the standard benchmark to detect dementia [25, 26] . SP report cognitive and functional questionnaires administered in clinic or by phone, including the Everyday Cognition Scale (ECog) [27] [28] [29] and shorter screening instruments, have been developed and validated, with some studies also considering their utility in the context of remote assessment [12, 13, 30, 31] . Thus, SP report has great potential for both identifying early dementia and dementia risk, and ultimately improving health care outcomes in older adults.\nDespite the enormous growth of internet use among older adults [32] , little research has been directed at developing methods for exploiting Web-based instruments for identification of dementia [2, 33, 34] . Recently, we developed an online SP-rated assessment of cognitive and functional abilities and applied this within the Brain Health Registry (BHR), a global, internet-based registry with over 57,000 participants that aims to facilitate AD and other brain disease research. The BHR Caregiver and Study Partner Portal (CASPP) is a Web-based tool launched that allows an SP for each BHR participant to separately register and answer questions about the participant online, with data linkage between the SP and participant. In a large cohort of dyads comprising older adult participants in BHR and their SPs, we tested the hypotheses that (1) online SP-reported data collection from a large cohort is feasible, including in participants likely to have MCI and AD; (2) online SP report of participant cognitive decline is significantly associated with objective measures of participant cognition; and (3) online SP report is significantly associated with participant diagnosis."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Brain Health Registry", "text": "BHR is a public Web site and registry.

Exploratory analyses included the contributions of participant diagnosis and dyad relationship to the previously mentioned associations. Ordinary least squares regression or logistic regression (binomial family) procedures were used. Data for each cognitive test were modeled separately and included SP-ECog, participant age, gender, online participant Geriatric Depression Scale score [44] , and education as covariates. Education was parameterized as a three-level factor (less than, equal to, or more than 4 years of college). Geriatric Depression Scale scores omitted response to the question, \"Do you feel you have more problems with memory than most?\", because this question is closely related to outcome measures of cognitive status. Model fits were inspected by an analysis of the residuals. We also considered an interaction between SP-ECog and two dyad relationship variables: (1) number of years the dyad has known each other, parameterized as a two-level factor of less than 50 years or greater than 50 years; and (2) whether the dyad comprised spouses.\nEstimates, errors, P values, and R 2 values reported are from multivariable models. Welch's unpaired t tests were used to determine differences between ADNI and BHR ECog means in each diagnostic group; t tests (difference in means) or c 2 tests (differences in proportions) were used to determine differences between participants with and without an SP. Effect sizes (fx) were calculated as Cohen's d for t tests, 4 coefficient for c 2 tests, or the difference in means divided by the standardized SD (the square root of the average SD between groups) for Welch's unpaired t tests. For multivariable linear regression models, fx was calculated as the variable estimate divided by the residual error in the model. Effect size, fx, was categorized as small (0.2), medium (0.21-0.79), or large (0.8) according to Ref. [45] .

Taken together, the results support the construct validity of online SP-reported data using the BHR. Validated online SP assessment tools have the potential for high impact on the AD and Bold values indicate statistical significance of P , .001. *P , .001 compared with participants with study partners. cognitive aging fields by facilitating clinical trial recruitment and screening, as well as by improving screening of older adults for cognitive problems in various health care settings. We found significant associations between online SPECog and participant online Cogstate scores. This is consistent with previous findings using in-clinic or telephonebased SP report, demonstrating associations between neuropsychological test scores and SP-reported cognitive decline in AD, MCI, and CU [13, 14, 47] . The supervised version of the Cogstate Brief Battery has been well validated [38, 39] , and there is accumulating evidence for the reliability, sensitivity to disease state, and validity of the unsupervised version [40] [41] [42] 48, 49] , including in participants with MCI and AD [49] , and in BHR [43] . Our cohort is large, which could result in statistically significant associations (P , .05) that are not clinically meaningful. Therefore, we mainly evaluated the strength of associations based on fx, and the amount of variance that could be explained by the model (R 2 ) [45] . Online SP-ECog was moderately associated with participant processing speed (fx 5 0.44, R 2 5 0.292) and learning (fx 5 0.37, R 2 5 0.249) in the whole cohort, which included CU, MCI, and AD participants.\nBecause our cohort is primarily (84%) comprising CU older adults, many of who have SPs who report no cognitive decline in the participant, we hypothesized that the contributions of impaired participants were driving these associations. In support of this hypothesis, we found no significant associations between SP-ECog and Cogstate scores in a subset of only CU participants. Conversely, we found strong associations in MCI and AD participants. In MCI, the strongest associations were between SP-ECog and processing speed (fx 5 2.46, R 2 5 0.340) and attention (fx 5 0.67, R 2 5 0.254). In AD, associations were robust across cognitive domains with effect sizes between 1.00 and 2.48, and R 2 between 0.194 and 0.519. Interestingly, in CU with SMC, we found small to moderate associations between SP-ECog and Cogstate memory (fx 5 0.53, R 2 5 0.076) and learning (fx 5 0.005, R 2 5 0.224), but not other cognitive domains. Thus, in AD, SPs are able to detect changes in function that map to multiple cognitive domains, whereas in SMC and MCI the domains are limited. In MCI, SP-reported changes map to processing speed and attention, whereas in SMC, SP-reported changes map to learning and memory. This finding provides evidence of construct validity, because SMCs are specific to memory, whereas impairments in MCI are likely to encompass multiple domains. Our data also support previous studies demonstrating that SP-ECog, collected in clinic, is associated with memory and executive function [14, 50] . Thus these findings agree with past studies using traditional, in-clinic or byphone SP report, supporting the construct validity of our online approach. We found significant associations between SP-reported ECog and participant self-reported diagnosis of MCI, in agreement with previous in-clinic studies showing that SP can discriminate between CU and MCI [9, 11] . Contrasting findings using in-clinic SP report, online SP-ECog did not significantly predict self-report AD diagnosis, suggesting that online SP-ECog alone is not sufficient to categorize participants into diagnostic groups. This may be because of several factors. Our AD group is relatively small compared with other diagnostic groups, and is likely to be more heterogeneous than an AD cohort in an in-clinic study. Furthermore, the low burden of SP participation in BHR compared with traditional in-clinic studies may make potential SPs likely to agree to join BHR even if they do not know the associated participant very well and/or do not see them often. If this hypothesis is correct, we should find higher associations between SP-ECog and diagnosis in spouse dyads, which is what we find. Higher (worse) SP-ECog scores are associated with MCI and AD diagnosis, as well as higher risk for MCI, in spouses. Further evidence for the importance of dyad relationship comes from our finding that, in spouses and those who have known each other longer, the associations between SP-ECog and Cogstate are stronger (Table 3) . Ultimately, online SP-report information may be best used in combination with other remotely collected data, and taking into account variability associated with dyad relationship, as a tool to categorize participants by diagnosis. We have not confirmed the clinical diagnosis of BHR participants, which raises concerns about the accuracy of self-report, especially in participants with MCI and dementia [46] who may lack awareness of their diagnosis. Our results identifying Likely MCI participants using Cogstate scores and SMCs support underdiagnosis or a lack of diagnostic awareness of MCI; 18% of participants were classified as Likely MCI, but failed to endorse MCI diagnosis in their medical history questionnaire. On the other hand, we did not find evidence of over-report of MCI diagnosis. No participants who endorsed MCI failed to meet criteria for Likely MCI (Section 3.4.2). This issue can only be fully addressed in a population with BHR data linked to confirmed clinical diagnosis; such data will be available in the near future in cohorts coenrolled in both BHR and in-clinic studies [35] ."}, {"section_title": "=", "text": "This study allowed us to uncover important new information about online registry cohorts. SP-reported ECog scores in ADNI and BHR were significantly different across diagnostic groups, but the difference for CU and MCI is unlikely to be meaningful because of low effect size (CU, fx 5 0.09; MCI, fx 5 0.18). Thus, the data are similar between BHR and ADNI despite important differences between the two cohorts, such as the method of ECog administration and participant selection. For the AD group, BHR had lower (better) ECog scores compared with ADNI. This is not surprising considering the assumed selection bias for less impaired participants in an online registry, in which participants must be functional enough to use a computer and complete tasks online. Another important feature of our registry cohort uncovered in this study is gender bias. The general BHR cohort comprised 73.9% females [35] . Compared with those with an SP, the group without an SP had a significantly higher proportion of females (Table 1) . This raises the possibility that online SP-report data will exclude detection of cognitive decline in females, who are at greater risk for developing dementia [33, 51] . Although analysis of the contributions of participant and SP gender on SP-report outcomes is outside the scope of the present work, it will be crucial to address such contributions in future studies.\nLimitations of our study that affect generalizability include lack of racial/ethnic diversity, high education levels, and restriction to participants who can successfully complete tasks online. SPs of individuals unable or reluctant to volunteer online data are not represented. However, our results suggest that in the future, online SP-ECog could be used to help identify those with cognitive problems, even in the absence of cognitive data from the participant himself/herself. This model requires that an SP be able to initiate registry contact without the participant, a capability that we plan to enable in the near future. Finally, clinical diagnosis of MCI or AD may include SP report of cognitive impairment [52] , which could confound the association between SP-ECog and diagnosis."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Online SP-ECog is significantly associated with participant cognition and self-reported diagnosis. The associations depend on diagnostic group and dyad relationship. If validated, BHR SP data have many potentially high-impact applications in the aging and AD fields, including using such data alone or in combination with other, remotely collected data for routine screening of older adults in health care and research settings. Because BHR can be accessed remotely by a large number of individuals, it could also be used for longitudinal monitoring in clinical trials, lessening the in-clinic burden of participation on SPs, which is a known barrier to participation [53, 54] . These results are a first step to address the feasibility and validity of online SP data in BHR. Remote collection and analysis of SP-reported data from a large Internet-based cohort is novel."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "2.
