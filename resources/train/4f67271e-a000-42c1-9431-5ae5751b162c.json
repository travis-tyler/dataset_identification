MCI is not always a prodromal form of AD; it can be any type of dementia, and can remain stable over a long period of time 6 or may even be reversible. 7 For example, based on 41 robust cohort studies on MCI progression, 8 overall annual conversion rate was around 6.7% for all kinds of dementia, 6.5% for AD dementia, and 1.6% for vascular dementia. A considerable number of MCI cases were not progressed to dementia for more than 10 years follow-up. 8 Although memory deficit is generally considered an early cognitive alteration associated with MCI, other cognitive deficits are also widely observed in MCI. Notably, previous MCI studies have reported executive dysfunction [9] [10] [11] and frontal lobe alteration. 12 Executive function (EF) encompasses a set of topdown cognitive processes to support goal-directed behavior. 13 Consequently, EF and memory could influence each other. 14 As Seo, et al. 11 pointed out, memory and EF are closely related. More importantly, EF is an important cognitive domain in prognosis and dementia conversion. For example, previous works showed EF impairment years prior to MCI 11, 15 or AD diagnosis. 16 Compared to MCI with higher EF, MCI with lower EF is more often converted to AD after 1 year. 14 Moreover, EF test, not episodic memory tests, combined with regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMglc), has high predictability for conversion from normal to MCI or AD dementia. 16 Taken together, previous studies suggest the important role of EF as an early warning system in the clinical course of MCI.\nNevertheless, only a limited number of studies have directly investigated the functional neural correlates for EF impairment in MCI populations. One functional imaging study reported that connectivity strengths in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were associated with EF in MCI. 17 In terms of AD population, EF impairment was correlated with rCMglc in parietotemporal and prefrontal regions. 18 Findings from structural brain studies on MCI also suggested a correlation between parietotemporal and prefrontal regions and EF. 19, 20 However, little attention has been paid to the nature of EF impairment in MCI with pathophysiologies other than AD; i.e., MCI with low A\u03b2 burden. It is plausible that EF failure in MCI depends on different neural substrates according to their etiologies.\n[ 18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a valuable index of synaptic function that provides information to understand underlying neurodegenerative pathology. 21 It is a commonly used methodology for evaluation of the brain-cognition relationship and early detection of dementia. 22 A recent meta-analysis of nine FDG-PET studies suggested that hypometabolism in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus (PreCu) were the most reliable and robust markers for early detection of and tracking conversion from MCI to AD. 23 Hypometabolism in ACC was also related to clinical progression, but it was much less reliable. 23 These areas could be acceptable candidate imaging biomarkers of clinical progression.\nTherefore, this study aimed to identify the functional neural basis of EF impairment in MCI separately for A\u03b2 positivity. Furthermore, we explored whether the identified functional brain areas could serve as predictors for clinical progression."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data on individuals with MCI were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni. loni.usc.edu).

The diagnosis criteria for MCI in ADNI database were clinical dementia rating (CDR) 24 of 0.5, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores between 24 and 30, a memory complaint with objective memory loss as defined by logical memory test score but showing no impairment in other cognitive domains, preserved activities of daily living, and nondemented. 25 Therefore, MCI from ADNI database were all amnestic MCI (aMCI). The inclusion criteria for the current study were described previously. 26 Briefly, individuals with aMCI who had conducted [ 18 F]-florbetapir-PET and FDG-PET, as well as clinical and cognitive assessment. The final analysis included 498 individuals who received baseline clinical evaluation and PET scans between April 2010 and December 2013. Among these 498 individuals with MCI, followup diagnosis and CDR sum of boxes (CDR-SOB) at 1 year later, which were assessed between March 2011 and June 2014, were collected to obtain information on clinical progression. CDR-SOB covers six domains of cognitive and daily functioning, with a score ranging from 0 to 18. It is a useful tool for staging clinical severity. In addition, renewed diagnosis and CDR-SOB at 5 years later, which were assessed between March 2015 and December 2018, were also collected to obtain information on longer clinical progression.

Therefore, ADNI-EF score covered a wide range of EF components. The score was standardized with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, based on the 800 subjects in ADNI. 27 Higher score meant better EF in MCI. For everyday functioning, we included the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ), which assessed the instrumental activities of daily living with a score ranging from 0 to 30.

ADNI preprocessing steps of FDG-PET data were previously described. 25 Briefly, a quality control process was applied to all scans, which included assessment of image resolution and uniformity, checks for statistical noise, motion assessment across temporal frames, and visual checks for common artifacts. Then, using the original raw PET images, the different temporal frames were co-registered. All image sets, including dynamic image and single-frame averaged image sets, were reoriented to a common spatial orientation and interpolated onto a uniform image grid. To reduce inter-scanner differences (17 different scanner models from three vendors), the images were smoothed with a scanner-specific filter derived from each site's Hoffman phantom, and then provided a common isotropic resolution of 8-mm full-width at half-maximum resolution. 25 We further preprocessed for group-level analysis. These scans were adjusted for their origin, and spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI, McGill University, Montreal, Canada) space using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12) (Institute of Neurology, University College of London, London, UK) implemented in MAT-LAB (MathWorks; Massachusetts, MA, USA). They were then smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8-mm full-width at halfmaximum. Finally, global normalization using proportional scaling was performed, as it has a higher signal to noise compared to that of cerebellar count normalization. 29 A region of interest (ROI)-based approach was also applied to investigate the association between rCMglc and clinical progression. The automatic anatomic labeling (AAL) algorithm and a region-combining method were applied to set ROIs to measure regional brain metabolism in the bilateral ACC (AAL template No. [31] [32] , bilateral PCC (AAL template No. [35] [36] , and bilateral PreCu (AAL template No. 67-68). 30 "}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "The correlations between ADNI-EF and rCMglc were analyzed separately for aMCI A\u03b2-and aMCI A\u03b2+ groups using a multiple regression model with age, sex, education, and APOE genotype as covariates.

The rCMglc in bilateral ACC and AD-vulnerable brain regions were correlated with EF in aMCI A\u03b2-and aMCI A\u03b2+ groups, respectively. Moreover, rCMglc in ACC and PCC were associated with clinical progression in aMCI A\u03b2-and aMCI A\u03b2+ groups, respectively.\nAs expected, longitudinal courses differed clearly between the two groups. On average, aMCI A\u03b2-subjects maintained their level of clinical severity, whereas aMCI A\u03b2+ subjects showed clinical progression, suggesting that aMCI A\u03b2-subjects had a much longer duration of illness than did aMCI A\u03b2+ subjects. As shown in Fig. 1 , on average, aMCI A\u03b2-subjects showed no clinical progression. While some aMCI A\u03b2-subjects showed increased CDR-SOB (n=37, 24% of aMCI A\u03b2group), they numbered much less than aMCI A\u03b2+ subjects with progression (n=121, 47.8% of aMCI A\u03b2+ group). During 1-year follow-up, 2% of aMCI A\u03b2-subjects converted to AD dementia, compared to 13% of aMCI A\u03b2+ subjects. Our observations that much higher progression rate in aMCI A\u03b2+ subjects were largely consistent with previous reports on longitudinal studies of MCI, 31, 32 which have examined conversion rate separately for A\u03b2 positivity.

Our results support that, although MCI subjects were diagnosed using the same criteria and showed similar behavioral phenotypes at the time of diagnosis, underlying pathologies could to lead different clinical courses.\nThe relationship between brain function and cognition is important for the understanding of underlying pathology. Multiple etiologies could cause superficially similar symptoms; i.e., EF impairment in aMCI; however, the neural base for impairment may differ. We found clear differences according to A\u03b2 positivity in the current study. Our findings in aMCI A\u03b2-group suggest that bilateral ACC is a critical brain area responsible for A\u03b2-independent EF impairment. Similar to our results, a previous study reported that metabolism in ACC was correlated with EF measured by fluency test and declined with normal aging. 34 There is rich literature supporting the role of ACC in cognitive control, such as monitoring and evaluative processes. 35 Given that ACC is connected to DLPFC and parietal cortex 35 and serves as a hub in brain networks associated with cognitive control, 36 reductions in cerebral glucose utilization in ACC in our aMCI A\u03b2-subjects indicates that their EF impairment could be related to an inefficient brain system for cognitive control. On the other hand, our study also revealed that EF impairment in aMCI A\u03b2+ group was related to the default mode network (DMN), which was mainly affected by A\u03b2 pathology 37 rather than isolated dysfunction of EF-related brain system. Hypometabolism, particularly in PCC and PreCu, key areas of DMN, was the most robust feature in the progression from MCI to AD. 23 Previous studies reported that EF impairment in MCI and AD were correlated to both temporoparietal and prefrontal regions. [18] [19] [20] These reports and our findings altogether suggest that EF failure in aMCI due to AD may be the consequence of AD pathology, rather than pure EF-related brain systems. Taken together, the current findings indicate that, although the two subgroups were superficially in the same aMCI category, EF impairment process depends on completely different functional brain regions according to the A\u03b2 burden. Information on neuropathology is important to understand clinical characteristics and diverse patterns of clinical progression in MCI. 38 Another point worth mentioning is that we adopted a composite scoring system for EF, which was developed through factor analysis of the wide range of EF tests. 27 EF is basically an umbrella term encompassing decision-making, abstract thinking, planning, integrative attention, inhibition, maintenance, monitoring, set shifting, etc. 13 A single EF test covers only a subset of executive components. Therefore, combining results from multiple EF tests could be used to more precisely assess the neural substrates of EF compared to a single test.\nGiven that EF and its related brain areas can play an important role as an early warning system in clinical progression, 11, 39 the current study examined separately whether ACC, PCC, and PreCu were associated with clinical progression according to A\u03b2 positivity. ACC and PCC were associated with clinical progression at 1 year in aMCI A\u03b2-and aMCI A\u03b2+, respectively. However, ACC was no longer useful for the prediction of clinical progression at 5 years in aMCI A\u03b2-group, whereas PCC was still associated with clinical progression at 5 years in aMCI A\u03b2+ group. Our results indicate that ACC, but not posterior brain areas, can be a useful predictor for short-term A\u03b2independent clinical progression regardless of age, sex, education, and APOE genotype. Given that ACC is a main node of cognitive control network, 36 alterations in EF-related brain systems might play a role in the pathogenesis of A\u03b2-independent clinical progression. In contrast, hypometabolism in PCC in aMCI A\u03b2+ can be a useful predictor for both short-term and long-term clinical progression regardless of age, sex, education, and APOE genotype. This finding is consistent with those of a recent meta-analysis which investigated brain regions with hypometabolism to predict the conversion from MCI to AD. 23 Based on nine studies, they concluded that hypometabolism in PCC and PreCu were the most robust regions for early detection and disease tracking. 23 Previous studies considered PCC and PreCu as a single cluster, whereas this study used separate ROIs for these regions. In the current study, only PCC, and not PreCu, was a significant predictor of clinical progression. This finding might be attributable to the high correlation between PCC and PreCu (Pearson correlation, r=0.361, p< 0.001). We applied stepwise regression. After including PCC in the regression model, PreCu did not significantly increase the model fit. PCC is a key node of DMN 40 that is altered in AD dementia that involves very early stages of AD trajectory and leads to the neurodegeneration process in AD. 41 Despite its significant implications, the current study had some limitations and needs future improvements. First, sample size at the 5-year follow-up was small, since we excluded data if the evaluation interval times more or less than 5 years from baseline date. Consequently, the associations of rCMglc ROIs and long-term clinical progression were interpreted with caution. Further studies based on larger sample sizes for longterm clinical progression are advised to replicate our results. Second, we investigated the neural correlates for EF in terms of localizationist view. Given that ACC and PCC are the hubs of cognitive control network and DMN, respectively, further network-based neural correlate studies using functional and structural imaging are warranted to extend our knowledge of the mechanisms of underlying EF impairment in MCI.\nIn conclusion, to our knowledge, the current study is the first to separately explore the functional neural correlates of EF impairment in aMCI with and without A\u03b2 pathology. Given the role of EF as an early warning system and the pathophysiological heterogeneity in MCI, clarification of the etiologies and the nature of EF impairment in MCI are critical for disease prognosis and management. EF impairment in aMCI A\u03b2-was related to ACC, the main node of cognitive control network, whereas EF impairment in aMCI A\u03b2+ was related to the PCC, PreCU, and other AD-vulnerable brain regions. Moreover, ACC and PCC were associated with the clinical progressions of aMCI A\u03b2-and aMCI A\u03b2+, respectively. These findings suggest that, although MCI subjects showed similar behavioral phenotypes at the time of diagnosis, EF impairment and further clinical progression was associated with completely different brain regions according to their A\u03b2 burden."}]
