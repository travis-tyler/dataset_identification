[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic and 216 countries, areas or territories throughout the world are now actively monitoring the outbreak. The WHO situation report published on July 17, 2020 tells that the confirmed cases are 1,36,16,593 and 5,85,727 of deaths [1] . COVID-19 is a global threat and obviously to tackle the pandemic requires an urgent global effort from not only all countries or territories, but also the scientific communities across all fields and disciplines. Computational Epidemiology has become increasingly multidisciplinary field that uses techniques from theoretical computer sciences, machine learning, image processing and has led to novel computational methods are very useful for modeling, understand, analyzing and controlling disease spread of disease and also treat COVID-19 infected patients [2] .\nThe disease is spreading through outbreaks despite the availability of modern sophisticated medical treatment. With the rapid development of machine learning, image processing has been widely applied in the medical field for providing support to subsequent medical diagnosis.\nAccurate medical data analysis adds an advantage of early disease detection, risk prediction, patient care, and community services.\nThe remaining article is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the public datasets to apply machine learning and image analysis techniques. In Section-3, we present the research directions with proposed methodologies. Section-4 provides challenges and research opportunities. Finally, the article concludes in Section 5."}, {"section_title": "Datasets", "text": "Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic is the defining global health crisis. In this regard, there exist several open online datasets such as Chest X-Ray Images, Chest CT (CCT) Images, Risk factors and number of daily diseased with fatalities, datasets are available for researchers and health care professionals. For experimentation, the Chest X-Ray images of normal and COVID-19 infected patients can be collected from GitHub repository and other research articles [3] [4] [7] . The sample CXR images from the dataset as shown in Fig.1 . The CCT images normal and infected patients are available in the dataset [5] [6] . The dataset for timeseries disease spread and CFR forecasting is available in the Our World in Data by Hannah Ritchie [8] . The data on the coronavirus pandemic such as number of new cases, number of deaths, total number of cases, total tests and new tests etc., country-wise updated daily [9] [10].

Automated detection and classification are critical steps in CAD for early diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Once a chest x-ray image is loaded onto a computer, it can be used for automated detection and classification of diseases. The image preprocessing such as contrast enhancement, noise removal required before post processing and will improve the classification performance. In this study, the image augmentation operations, such as random clipping, up-down flipping can be performed on specimens to increase the number of training samples. Since the training dataset is small and CNN tends to overfit, Deep CNN (DConvNet) with Transfer Learning is developed for classification of chest X-ray (CXR) images. In this study, different pre-trained DCNN models (namely, Resnet50, VGG19, VGG16, DenseNet-161, Resnet 101, VGG-19, and Inception V3) are used via transfer learning technique for COVID-19 chest X-ray image classification. The SoftMax regression activation function is used to classify the chest X-ray images into two classes in the last layer of the proposed model. The proposed classification framework is shown in Fig.2 for diagnosis of COVID-19 using CXR. The performance measures sensitivity, specificity, F-score, MCC and AUC can be used for testing efficiency of the proposed one.

The first layer of CNN is basic patient features (risk factors). The second layer is the convolution layer, followed by the max-pooling layer for introducing Sparsity on the learned features. Thus, we implement normalized convolution as a layer in CNN to filter the sparse data for sparse inputs so that the model gains better performance, and risk prediction is still highly accurate. The fourth layer is a fully connected layer linking with SoftMax classifiers for risk prediction with output label as, C = {C 0 ,C 1 }, where, C 0 and C 1 indicates the patient is at high-risk and low-risk of COVID-19, respectively. The pipeline of the proposed methodology is -pre-processing, building training set, training the proposed deep learning model, and testing. "}, {"section_title": "Time Series Forecasting of Disease Spread and case fatality rate of the outbreak based on Deep Neural Networks", "text": "The reliable time series forecasting of COVID-19 disease is important for strategic preparedness to control case fatality rate (CFR) with proper preventive measures. In this work, we propose a Deep Neural Networks based on the Forecasting for Pandemic Case Fatality Rate (DNFCFR) for forecasting the numbers of infected cases and fatalities followed by CFT at a given time. The temporal features include fatalities, age, disease cases, etc., and the demographic features include density, population, hospitals, etc., which are used as input variables for the network, as shown in Fig.3 . In DNFCFR, we develop a two-branch neural network model, trained on both temporal and demographic features with multi-agent simulation, and use it to generate training data.\nThe LSTM (Long short-term memory) network is used to capture the dynamic temporal behavior of the observations and need sequences of the input features for training. The length of the sequence is optimal. Since LSTM fits on unscaled data and to speed up learning, and faster convergence, we normalized training data by with A merge layer is added to combine = { 1 , 2 , 3 ,...., }.

The main challenges in the development of framework using the ML and IA to fight against pandemic are: the generalizability of machine learning models, collecting multiple types of data in dataset, lack of the facilities/infrastructure to assess the deep learning models, imbalanced data in the datasets such as missing or null values corresponding to some attributes in risk prediction datasets, fatality prediction datasets, limited number of positive images of disease and more number of negative samples images and vice-versa in medical imaging datasets leads to false prediction while testing the model. In Fig.4 , some of the research opportunities and challenges are as shown [14] .
