In this regard, studies of combinatorial biomarkers may have greater ability to capture the heterogeneity and multifactorial complexity of AD, than a traditional single biomarker study [3] .\nPrior studies of subjects at risk for AD have examined the utility of various individual biomarkers, such as cognitive tests, fluid markers, imaging measures and some individual genetic markers (e.g. ApoE4) [1] . In particular, imaging markers such as hippocampal volume and shape, cortical regional volumes and thickness, and PET (amyloid imaging, FDG) abnormalities have all been linked in one or more studies to faster progression in at risk subjects [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , but are not yet optimally predictive at an individual level.\nMore recently, genome-wide association study (GWAS) data has been used to characterize several potential genetic risk factors for AD with several cross-sectional studies also correlating these data with imaging and fluid biomarkers [17] . However, no prior study, to our knowledge, has leveraged both GWAS SNP data, as well as high dimensional whole brain imaging data to examine their combined value in identifying subjects at greatest risk for progressing to AD. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the researchapproximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals to be followed for 3 years, 400 people with aMCI to be followed for 3 years, and 200 people with early AD to be followed for 2 years."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging", "text": "For up-to-date information see www.adni-info.org.'' 2.1.2. Study Sample. We considered 343 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1). These MCI patients were then followed over 48 months, with 150 participants progressing to AD (Table 1) . MCI converters did not differ from MCI noncoverters in gender, handedness, marital status, retirement percentage, and age (p-values>0.05), but as expected, differed from them in APOE4 status as well as baseline cognition (p-value<0.05) ( Table 1) . Mean follow up time was 75 days longer in converters (p=0.06). From them, we extracted high dimensional MR imaging and whole genome data, as well as routine neurocognitive and clinical data at baseline."}, {"section_title": "MRI and Hippocampus Image Preprocessing", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "MRI Image", "text": "These scans on 343 subjects were performed on a 1.5 T MRI scanners by using a sagittal MPRAGE sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2400 ms, inversion time (TI) = 1000 ms, flip angle = , and field of view (FOV) = 24 cm with a 256 256170 acquisition matrix in the x-, y-, and z-dimensions, which yields a voxel size of 1.251.261.2 .\nWe processed the MRI data by using standard steps including anterior commissure and posterior commissure correction, skull-stripping, cerebellum removing, intensity inhomogeneity correction, segmentation, and registration [40] . After segmentation, we segmented the brain data into four different tissues: grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\nMoreover, we automatically labeled 93 ROIs on the Jacob atlas [21] , and transferred the labels following the deformable registration of subject images [25] . In addition, we chose 23 ROIs, which may significantly influence MCI progression from the existing literature. [10] [22] [23] The 23 ROIs were bilateral entorhinal cortices, bilateral hippocampal formation, bilateral amygdala, bilateral caudate nuclei, bilateral putamen, bilateral posterior limb of internal capsule including cerebral peduncle, bilateral nucleus accumbens, bilateral lateral ventricles, bilateral thalamus, bilateral fornix, bilateral cingulate and the corpus callosum."}, {"section_title": "Hippocampus Image Preprocessing", "text": "We adopted a surface fluid registration based hippocampal subregional analysis package, [24] which uses isothermal coordinates and fluid registration to generate one-to-one hippocampal surface registration for following surface statistics computation. This software package has been adopted by various studies [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] .\nGiven the 3D MRI scans, hippocampal substructures were segmented with FIRST [31] and hippocampal surfaces were automatically reconstructed with the marching cube method [32] .\nWe applied an automatic algorithm, topology optimization, to introduce two cuts on a hippocampal surface to convert it into a genus zero surface with two open boundaries. The locations of the two cuts were at the front and back of the hippocampal surface, representing its anterior junction with the amygdala, and its posterior limit as it turns into the white matter of the fornix. Then holomorphic 1-form basis functions were computed [33] . These induced conformal grids the hippocampal surfaces which were consistent across subjects. With this conformal grid, we computed the conformal representation of the surface [24] , i.e., the conformal factor and mean curvature, which represent the intrinsic and extrinsic features of the surface, respectively. The \"feature image\" of a surface was computed by combining the conformal factor and mean curvature and linearly scaling the dynamic range into [0, 255]. Next, we registered the feature image of each surface in the dataset to a common template with an inverse consistent fluid registration algorithm. [26] With conformal parameterization, we essentially converted a 3D surface registration problem into a 2D image registration problem. The flow induced in the parameter domain establishes high-order correspondences between 3D surfaces. Finally, various surface statistics were computed on the registered surface, such as multivariate tensor-based morphometry (mTBM) statistics, [33] which retain the full tensor information of the deformation Jacobian matrix, together with the radial distance, [34] which retains information on the deformation along the surface normal direction."}, {"section_title": "The SNP data", "text": "The subjects' genotype variables were acquired based on the Human 610-Quad Bead-Chip (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) in the ADNI database, which resulted in 620,901 SNPs. To reduce the population stratification effect, we used 749 Caucasians from all 818 subjects with complete imaging measurements at baseline. Quality control procedures included (i) call rate check per subject and per SNP marker, (ii) gender check, (iii) sibling pair identification, (iv) the HardyWeinberg equilibrium test, (v) marker removal by the minor allele frequency, and (vi) population stratification. The second line preprocessing steps include removal of SNPs with (a) more than 5% missing values, (b) minor allele frequency smaller than 5% , and (c) Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p-value < 1e\u22126. Remaining missing genotype variables were imputed as the modal value.\nSeven hundred forty seven subjects and 504,095 SNPs remained.\nWe included information from all the 22 chromosomes. Since each chromosome contains a number of SNPs, we used principal component analysis for each chromosome and picked the first 2 principal components for each chromosome. We then used the PLINK package (https://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/data.shtml#plink) to perform quality control for the genomic data. The principal component analysis for each chromosome was conducted using ``svd'' function in R software."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Approach", "text": "A popular model used in literature is the Cox proportional hazards model (Cox, 1972) , which accounts for other covariates that are associated with the timing of the events. Covariates of interest include demographic information (8 covariates), the APOE4 genotype (3 covariates), the ADAS-Cog score (1 covariate), the hippocampus surface data (7 covariates for each curve, total ates for each chromosome, total 44 covariates) and the significant SNPs information (5 covariates). We used the R function \"coxph\" to implement the fitting of the Cox proportional hazards As a comparison, we also used the results obtained from Genome-wide Association Analysis (GWAS) to incorporate the genetic information. Specifically, we selected the top 101 significant SNPs by using a kernel machine method, [36] and then calculated their top 5 PCs and used them as predictors (significant SNP information). We fitted a third Cox regression model with demographic, imaging and significant SNP information, but without the ADAS-Cog score and chromosome-wise information, and then obtained parameter estimation and testing results. We referred this model to as the Traditional Imaging-Genetics Model (Model 3) from now on.\nWhen we fitted Cox regression models, we treated the left and right hippocampus surface data as functional predictors. For each subject, the radial distance was obtained from baseline hippocampal surfaces data, which yields two 15000 dimensional vectors denoting data from left hippocampus and right hippocampus, respectively. We applied functional principal component analysis (FPCA) [38] Since we do not have the validation data set, we investigated the predictive performance of the candidate models using the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve. In particular, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC), which is often used to measure the prediction of survival models. In particular, we first randomly picked 200 subjects for the training data and fit all the candidate models. After that, we used the remaining 143 individuals for the testing and calculated the AUC. 35 The method can be implemented by using the R function \"AUC.cd\". We repeated the above steps for 100 times, i.e. randomly separated the data for 100 times and obtained 100\nAUCs. The mean and standard deviations can be obtained using these 100 AUCs."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "We compared the predictive value of standard of care (clinical demographic variables, "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "These findings are the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of the value of combined whole brain MR and whole genome SNP data in the 48-month prognosis of subjects at risk for AD. Our finding support prior MRI studies of volumetric hippocampal changes in prodromal AD [8] [18] and extend them by finding that the possible prognostic value of combining information from high dimensional imaging and genetics may be superior to that provided by routine clinical-cognitive testing data.\nOur findings also confirm the association between APOE4 status and AD, and identify . [19] Our study did not examine any of these newer gene markers specifically but provides support to the notion that there is additional genetic heritability in late-onset AD beyond that accounted for by APOE.\nThere are some strengths and limitations to our analyses. ADNI is a national biomarker study that utilized rigorous standardized data collection procedures, and well established criteria to select MCI subjects. Rather than using the individual data on all SNPs, we used the more conservative statistical method of doing principal component analysis for each chromosome and picking the first 2 principal components for each chromosome. Our findings survived internal cross validation but need replication in an independent community based sample. We did not include measures of pathology (e.g. beta-amyloid) in our models since CSF and amyloid-PET were available only in a small subset of individuals in ADNI-1. However, a study of ADNI-2 subjects has shown a robust correlation between the APOE e4 \u03b54 allele and cortical amyloid burden [20] , suggesting that APOE e4 may have served as a surrogate for cortical amyloid plaque load in our analysis. It is important to confirm the above findings obtained from ADNI-1 in other independent data sets [37] .\nPrior PMD has received research grants and/or advisory fees from several government agencies, advocacy groups and pharmaceutical/imaging companies.
