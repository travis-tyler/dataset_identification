On the basis of current trends in the United States and abroad, what will be the relative U.S. position in the near term and in the longer term? Following a process similar to that established in Experiments in International Benchmarking of U.S. Research Fields, 2 the panel was instructed to perform its charge in a short time frame and with a limited budget. The group met in person once and otherwise communicated by way of teleconference or electronic mail. Thus, in order to adequately respond to its charge, the panel had to limit the scope of the benchmarking exercise to assessing the state of basic (fundamental) research as determined by the open published literature, the opinions of its peers, and other sources of easily accessible information. This benchmarking exercise was conducted based on the premise that evaluating this type of more \"academic\" research information would give a good estimate of the quality and quantity of fundamental research being conducted, which could in turn be used as an indicator of the competitiveness of overall U.S. mechanical engineering basic research. Thus, this exercise in no way presents a complete picture of the research activity in the field-particularly the industrial component. The quantitative and qualitative measures employed to compare U.S. mechanical engineering basic research with that in other nations included analysis of journal publications (numbers of papers, citations of papers, and most-cited papers), utilizing such sources as Thompson ISI Essential Science Indicators and Scopus. In addition, the panel asked leading experts from the United States and abroad to identify the \"best of the best\" whom they would invite to an international conference in their subfield. The national makeup of these \"virtual congresses\" provides qualitative information on leadership in mechanical engineering. The panel also examined trends in the numbers of degrees, employment, and research funding of U.S. mechanical engineering, relying heavily upon NSF Science and Engineering (S&E) Indicators 2006 and earlier years. The resulting report details the status of U.S. competitiveness in mechanical engineering basic research and its areas and subareas.

In 2005, the U.S. contribution to most-cited articles in the Journal of Sound and Vibration was 44 percent. The U.S. contribution is greater than 50 percent in U.S.-based ASME and Acoustical Society of America (ASA) journals, but 30 percent or lower in the internationally based Journal of Sound and Vibration and Journal of Fluids andStructures. Between 1999 and2005, the average percentage U.S. contribution to articles published in acoustics and dynamics journals increased from 34 to 41 percent. Based on the combined analysis of journal citations (30-50 percent U.S.) and VWC data (50 percent U.S.), the United States is among the leaders in acoustics and dynamics basic research.\nMechanical engineering design in the United States is especially strong and has been in a global leadership role since the emergence of the field in the middle to late twentieth century. There is a strong U.S. representation in the VWC for this area, where an average of 79 percent of the 532 speakers are from universities, government agencies, and industries in the United States, with universities being the largest contingent. Primary \nAn average of 49 percent of the 714 speakers identified in the VWC were from the United States (appendix Table D-1), but the results for the subareas varied considerably. For example, about 60 percent of invited speakers in the subarea of control methodologies and control theories were from the United States, whereas there were 40 percent in mechatronics and applications. The two leading journals in the field with strong methodology orientation are Automatica and IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control. In these journals, U.S. authors made up 23 and 36 percent of the authors represented in 2005, respectively. The difference in representation of U.S. experts as authors of publications in journals versus U.S. speakers at virtual congresses can be attributed to the broad scope of this discipline in terms of the number of researchers and the number of topics. In other subareas, the dominance of the United States is not as evident, but the United States is certainly among the leaders. This is illustrated by the U.S. contribution to the most-cited articles in IEEE Robotics and Automation, 8 of 54, 46, 38, 34, and 48 percent respectively for the years 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2003. In the subarea of mechatronics and applications, 40 percent of virtual congress speakers are from the United States. This is consistent with the percentages of U.S. authors in application-oriented periodicals published in the United States: IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology (49 percent), and IEEE-ASME Transactions on Mechatronics (37 percent). U.S. authors, however, represent only 10 to 20 percent in Control Engineering Practice (CEP), another application-oriented periodical. This may be attributed to the preference of U.S. researchers to publish papers in ASME and IEEE journals, which are regarded as premier control journals in the international community; CEP is published by Elsevier in the Netherlands. In the ASME Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control, which covers the broad discipline of dynamic systems and control, 34 out of 81 articles (42 percent) were contributed by U.S. researchers. Taken together, the VWC (49 percent U.S.) and journal results (30-50 percent U.S) indicate that the United States is among the world leader in dynamic systems and controls.\nThe VWC for the area of energy systems resulted in 68 percent of the 274 speakers being from the United States, which indicates a strong leadership position in this area. However, an examination of article authorship in seven journals (see appendix Table C-1) in this area showed the average U.S. contributions to be about 30 percent. U.S. contributions to the Journal of Power Sources are around 20 percent, while U.S. contributions to the most-cited articles in this journal average around 22 percent over the 1995-2005. The combined VWC representation (68 percent U.S.) and the journal article results (20-30 percent) indicates that the United States is among the leaders in energy systems with well-recognized researchers, and the lack of recent publications in this area shows a significant weakening of leadership.\nAccording to the VWC results, about 50 percent of the 389 speakers named were from the United States. This was consistent across all the manufacturing subareas. This leadership position is further supported by an analysis of journals in this area. In the ASME Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering, U.S. contributions to the top 50 most-cited articles amounted to about 70 percent. In addition, four out of the five manufacturing journals analyzed showed greater than 50 percent U.S. contributions on average (Appendix Table C-2). Together, these results indicate that the United States is the leader in manufacturing basic research.\nThe VWC results for mechanics of engineering materials show that U.S. organizers picked more than 70 percent U.S. speakers, while international researchers named 50 percent U.S. speaker's to participate. U.S. researchers in the mechanics of engineering materials publish in a widerange of journals, some focused on the area of mechanics, such as the premier mechanics journal, Journal of Mechanics and Physics of Solids (JMPS), and with significant presence in journals specific to fields of application, such as Journal of Biomedical Materials Research. In JMPS, U.S. authors publish an average of about 65 percent of the most-cited articles. In addition, researchers have begun to broaden the visibility of the field and its contributions with publications in top general science journals such as Science, Nature, and Nature Materials. Overall, U.S. authorship is at about 50 percent for all articles combined in relevant journals. Together, these results indicate that the United States is the leader in the mechanics of engineering materials research.\n\nThe VWC results for the area of thermal systems and heat transfer show that an average of 65 percent of the 562 speakers were from the United States. This is similar to the U.S. contribution to the ASME Journal of Heat Transfer. An average of 50 percent of the 50 mostcited articles for the ASME Journal of Fluids Engineering were U.S. authored. In 2005, an average of 40 percent of 10 selected journal articles in this area were U.S. authored (see appendix Table C-2). Based on the combined results of the VWC (65 percent U.S.) and journal analysis (30-50 percent U.S.), the United States is the world leader in thermal systems research.\nAn average of about 50 percent of the 471 VWC speakers in the area of tribology were from the United States. The other countries with large contributions of speakers include the United Kingdom, France, and Germany in that order. There are also significant numbers from Japan, the Netherlands, Finland, Italy, and Sweden. The United Kingdom is strong in all subsubfields, while France is strong in hydrodynamic phenomena and Germany is strong in the area of tribomaterials. Primary venues to publish tribology research contributions are the ASME Journal of Tribology, the Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers' STLE Tribology Transactions, Wear, Tribology International, and Tribology Letters. Many tribology-related articles are also published in physics, chemistry, and material science journals, as well as publications closely related to specific engineering applications fields such as transportation, environmental control, and manufacturing. Of the 50 most-cited articles in the journal Wear, an average of about 20 percent were by U.S. authors. U.S. authors appear more frequently among the most-cited authors than among authors in general in that publication. The reason U.S. authors appear less frequently in Wear than among the VWC authors may be that U.S. authors are more likely to publish in the two major U.S. publications in tribology-ASME Journal of Tribology and STLE Tribology Transactions. Wear is published in Europe. At the same time, about 30-50 percent of authors in the U.S.-based tribology journals mentioned above are from the United States, while in the British based journals, about 20 percent of the authors are from the United States. Tribology Letters has about 40 percent U.S. based authors.

Born from the semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) fabrication processes, MEMS technologies typically use deposition and etching of materials along with photolithographically defined mask patterns. Today, the fabrication arsenal has been enriched by several IC processes commercialized specifically for MEMS (e.g., deep reactive ion etching) and many non-IC processes modified for microfabrication (e.g., microelectrodischarge machining, electroplating into micromolds). MEMS is considered coming of age with a few commercial successes of high visibility (e.g., automobile airbag sensor, micromirror array for high-definition display, inkjet printhead). Although the success is most often viewed through applications, the fabrication technologies constitute the indispensable basis for the next wave of success across fields beyond electronics (e.g., biomedical). With the focus of funding shifted to application research years ago however, MEMS appears to have lost support in fundamental and core research rather prematurely. Despite dramatic miniaturization, MEMS is still within the realm of continuum mechanics. Nanotechnology (Nano) is poorly defined today, but it generally deals with engineering at the nanometer scale. Originally inspired by molecular engineering in its core intent (i.e., building three-dimensional structures molecule-by-molecule in bottom-up approaches), nanotechnology is currently dominated by material syntheses, thinfilms, and nanoscale ICs. To assess the current status of the U.S. contribution to MEMS/Nano, the following representative subareas were examined: \u2022 Fundamental Issues in MEMS and Nano. The physics unique to the scale are the main points of focus for the field. As an example for both MEMS and Nano, the surface-to-volume ratio is extremely large compared to conventional mechanical engineering devices and systems. The scale effects are prohibitive in some cases but enabling in others. Understanding the fundamentals allows one to avoid the problems and take advantages of the unique opportunities of being in the given scale. \u2022 Design and Modeling. Design and Modeling are based on the fundamental issues and allow one to design products and predict their performance, minimizing the trial-and-error development cycles. Modeling in MEMS typically requires simultaneous solution of multiphysics issues. Modeling for Nano often requires simulation at the molecular level, and the boundaries may be blurred between mechanical engineering and chemistry even for machines in nanometer scale. \u2022 Micro/Nano Process Technologies. The ability to fabricate objects in micro-or nanometer scale is a major obstacle. MEMS processes typically use top-down methods, forming the shape by removing unnecessary portions. Nano processes are said to be based on bottom-up methods, building by placing the minimum unit of materials one at a time. However, most nanofabrication methods today are extensions of known methods (e.g., embossing into molds having submicrometer features). \u2022 Micro/Nano Devices and Systems. The components or final products whose key functions originate from micro-or nanoscale features are Micro/Nano devices and systems. For example, an airbag deployment sensor is a complete microdevice or system, which in turn is a component of an automobile. The same can be said for a digital light processor (DLP) for high-definition television (HDTV) or the printhead of an inkjet printer. On the contrary, examples of devices are rare as yet in the Nano field.

However, excellent mechanical engineers throughout the world provide stiff competition for the United States. \u2022 In 2002In -2006 \nThe United States now holds a leadership position in most areas of mechanical engineering basic research.

Local talent will be hired, which will likely include international students educated and trained in the United States. \u2022 There will also be more international research collaborations (United States and other countries, between countries in the European Union, etc.) \u2022 U.S. universities will continue to reach out and offer educational opportunities abroad and online.

In addition, there will be continued importance of high-technology fields in which the United States maintains a strong leadership position, such as the design and manufacturing of civilian and military aircraft, healthcare diagnostics, and power generating systems. \u2022 U.S. academic mechanical engineering departments continue to attract international talent for graduate studies; however, the barriers to travel for international students and visiting faculty may impact the ability of the United States to continue to attract this important source of research talent. In conclusion, U.S. leadership in mechanical engineering overall will continue to be strong. The contributions of U.S. mechanical engineers to journal articles will increase, but so will the contributions from other growing economies such as China and India. At the same time, the supply of U.S. mechanical engineers is in jeopardy, due to declines in the numbers of U.S. citizens obtaining advanced degrees and uncertain prospects for continuing to attract foreign students.

At the elite research universities in the United States, access to such equipment is quite good, though in some cases usage fees can be excessive. Internationally, the same situation holds, where one potential difference is that in many foreign nations equipment is staffed by trained technicians who can facilitate the consistent quality as well as the speed of work. In addition to this equipment, access to large-scale, unique equipment such as synchrotrons is increasingly important. In the United States these facilities are run by the U.S. government and access for academic work is well supported. Characterization of materials often requires high-energy light sources-such as synchrotron and neutron sources-or other specialized facilities that need a significant level of funding to operate and maintain. These are typically available only at national facilities both here and abroad. Examples of important synchrotron sources include the following: Most research-intensive universities are well equipped with conventional micro-and nanofabrication techniques such as thin-film deposition (e.g. chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition), lithography, chemical etching, and electrodeposition, as well as characterization techniques such as electron microscopy, electron and X-ray diffraction, and probe microscopy that are used routinely to characterize small structures, small volumes, and thin films. However, the ability to characterize extremely small nanostructures or to tailor materials at an atomic level requires much more specialized equipment. The Department of Energy is now in the process of opening five Nanoscale Science Research Centers 3 that will provide just such capabilities. Four of these centers are listed here, and one is mentioned later in the discussion of biological capabilities. 1. The Center for Nanoscale Materials is focused on fabricating and exploring novel nanoscale materials and, ultimately, employing unique synthesis and characterization methods to control and tailor nanoscale phenomena. 2. The Center for Functional Nanomaterials provides state-of-the-art capabilities for the fabrication and study of nanoscale materials, with an emphasis on atomic-level tailoring to achieve desired properties and functions. 3.

MEL conducts research and development, provides services, and participates in standards activities related to mechanical and dimensional metrology. One particular area of success has been in lean manufacturing; many industrial success stories are available on the NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership website. 7 Similar facilities exist at universities, such as the NSF Center for Reconfigurable Machining Systems (RMS) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. \"[RMS) is one designed at the outset for rapid change to quickly adjust its production capacity and functionality in response to sudden market changes and customer demand.\" 8 Mechanical engineers are concerned with the calibration and quality control of measurement of instruments and manufacturing devices. Microcomputed tomography (microCT) is used for high resolution imaging. Another example is the use of micropatterning (Columbia University has three N.Y. state-funded centers for conducting this kind of research). NIST offers extensive measurement and standardization facilities. In the area of automation and dynamic systems and controls, many university centers provide important shared facilities, such as the Iowa Driving Simulator at Iowa State University or automated highway research facilities at the University of California at Berkeley. Physical prototyping infrastructure facilities allow researchers to rapidly produce prototypes of products as a means to better validate theoretical and applied developments. Although a small handful of rapid prototyping centers exist across the nation (e.g., Milwaukee School of Engineering, Georgia Tech, University of Louisville) and isolated prototyping machines at a large number of universities, there is very limited accessible infrastructure dedicated to providing researchers the ability to test and validate their advancements in design. Emerging quickly, largely because of digital advances and global market pressures, is the need for virtual prototyping, allowing researchers to create functional digital models of products and systems while also providing tactile feedback using haptic and virtual reality technologies. Although there are a small handful of design centers with virtual prototyping capabilities (e.g., Iowa State University, University of Iowa, University at Buffalo-State University of New York), and isolated researchers with haptic devices and visualization facilities, there is limited infrastructure dedicated to providing researchers the ability to virtually test and validate their advances in design research. In addition, more action is being taken to coordinate R&D in manufacturing across federal agencies, including joint solicitations through the efforts of the Interagency Working Group (IWG) on Manufacturing Research and Development. 9 One report that will be forthcoming from the IWG is related to manufacturing R&D in three specific areas: (1) nanomanufacturing; (2) manufacturing for the hydrogen economy; and (3) integrated and intelligent manufacturing systems."}, {"section_title": "Biomechanical Engineering", "text": "The need for biomechanical engineering facilities fall into three areas: (1) characterizing signal transduction (cells sensing external signals) such as effects of shear force, which requires multiscale computational power; (2) imaging at smallest length scales (i.e., nanometer) level; and (3) mimicking biological tissues-biomimetics (e.g., tissue engineering).

January 2007 On a still longer time scale, the supply of scientists and engineers overall depends on the current state of the U.S. K-12 educational system. Here, there have been ongoing concerns about K-12 math and science education in the United States compared with other countries, based largely on the results of internationally administered tests. In 2004, the NSF summarized the situation: \"U.S. students are performing at or below the levels attained by students in other countries in the developed world,\" and \"In international comparisons, U.S. student performances become increasingly weaker at higher grade levels.\" 17 More recent results reported by NSF showed a more mixed picture-where U.S. fourth and eighth grade students scored above average on the international tests, but U.S. 15-year-olds scored below average. 18 Because of the difficulties in locating quantitative data on mechanical engineering human resources at the international level, the panel concentrated on the trends in the number of U.S. mechanical engineering graduate students and Ph.D.s. The data shown in the following figures demonstrate that the numbers of U.S. graduate students and Ph.D.s have remained fairly steady over the past 10-20 years due to the growing number of foreign-born mechanical engineering graduate students and Ph. D.s. Between 1985 and2005 (Figure 3-4), there was a fluctuating, but overall steady, supply of graduate students enrolling in mechanical engineering. In the late 1990s, there was a decline in the number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents enrolling in mechanical engineering graduate programs that has begun to rebound more recently. Increasing enrollment of temporary residents has compensated for the declines in U.S. citizens and permanent residents. 18,000 20,000 1 9 8 5 1 9 8 7 1 9 8 9 1 9 9 1 1 9 9 3 1 9 9 5 1 9 9 6 1 9 9 7 1 9 9 8 1 9 9 9 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 3 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 A better indicator of current trends, however, is to look at first-time full-time graduate enrollments, because overall graduate student enrollments include individuals who began school up to five or six years ago.

Figure 3 -7, between 1975 and 1995, the number of earned mechanical engineering Ph.D.s in the United States more than doubled due to increases in the number of doctorates awarded to both U.S. citizens and temporary residents. Over the past 10 years for which data are available (1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005), the number of earned mechanical engineering doctorates awarded each year has fluctuated, but overall remained above 800 doctorates awarded per year.

In this final chapter of the report, the panel addresses the third part of its charge-to determine the relative position of U.S. mechanical engineering in the near term and in the longer term. In short, U.S. mechanical engineering is currently in a healthy position and will likely continue to be in the near future. Mechanical engineering makes many significant contributions to U.S. economic competitiveness and national quality of life; broad public benefits are now derived from past investments in mechanical engineering-for example, in the transportation, power generation, and aviation industries.

However, there will continue to be increasing competition from Europe and Asia.

Over the past decade, graduate enrollment and the number of new U.S.-trained Ph.D.s has been virtually constant, and federal research support for mechanical engineering research has barely kept up with inflation.

In 1980, there was about half this number of Ph.D.s. However, over this time, the number of U.S. citizens receiving mechanical engineering Ph.D.s has steadily decreased. The number of U.S. mechanical engineering graduate students has been maintained by successfully attracting international students to the United States. Many of these students often stay in the United States after graduation and pursue careers in mechanical engineering. Evidence of the attractiveness of the United States is the high percentage of foreign doctorate recipients who plan to remain in the United States for work after graduation (Table 4-1). However, with changes in visa policies as a result of the attack on 9/11 ( Figure 4-1) and global leveling of research capability, the United States may be losing ground. Following 9/11, international students and postdoctoral associates found it increasingly difficult to obtain visas for study in the United States and many traveled to Europe, Japan, and Australia for their graduate work. This has had a fairly significant impact on engineering disciplines compared to the sciences, which also holds for mechanical engineering as shown in Figure 3-5 (ratio of Ph.D.s to temporary residents decreased three years in a row for [2003][2004][2005]. Also, because of the growth of new opportunities for Ph.D. mechanical engineers in China, India, and elsewhere, more students who obtain a U.S. Ph.D. are increasingly likely to return to careers in their native countries or to other opportunities elsewhere. Thus, the United States is faced with increasing competition overall for attracting foreign graduate students and for retaining them in the U.S. workforce. It is not clear whether the United States can continue to attract mechanical engineering talent from the United States and abroad in the future. According to a background paper generated for the recently held NSF \"5XME\" workshop, 1 Many countries now emulate the very successful USA engineering schools and their science-based curricula, and are making investments that produce an order of magnitude more engineers, and of comparable quality. Global companies employ such world-class engineering talent, often at 20% of the cost in the USA and are moving manufacturing design and even research activities to such locations.

Major centers and facilities provide key infrastructure and capabilities for conducting research and have provided strong support for U.S. leadership in mechanical engineering. Key capabilities for mechanical engineering research include advanced light sources, scanning probe instruments, supercomputers, nuclear reactors and accelerators, and specialized facilities for biomechanics. U.S. facilities have instrumentation that is on par with the best in the world. However, rapid advances in the design and capabilities of instrumentation can create obsolescence in five to eight years. Large central facilities must continuously be upgraded and maintained. Sustained support is essential to compete with heavy capital investments by the European Union, Japan, Korea, and China. Federal laboratories and the national laboratories of DOE are critical in providing unique facilities for research; they have instrumentation no single university could afford to put in place. An important complement is the availability of world-class scientists who engage in long-term fundamental research and provide assistance through research collaborations with the user community. Although the United States has enjoyed a research and funding environment that has enabled the installation and operation of a diverse range of facilities to support leading-edge research in mechanical engineering, funding for needed infrastructure seems to be in continuous jeopardy. For example, U.S. research infrastructure includes major user facilities such as the National Solar Thermal Test Facility, the AZTRAK (AZimuthal TRAcKing) Rotating Platform system and the Combustion Research Facility (centering on improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions from energy conversion and utilization systems) at Sandia Labs, and NIST's Building Integrated Photovoltaic Testbed and Mobile Solar Tracking Facility. All of these are based on technology needs from the 1980s, and major facilities in Europe and Japan are overshadowing U.S. capability to demonstrate and gain experience in large-scale systems. A few examples include the Japanese High Temperature Gas Reactor, the European Solar Thermal Industry Federation (ESTIF) in Brussels, and the European Solar Test Installation (ESTI) in Ispra, Italy."}]
