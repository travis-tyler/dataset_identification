At the same time, the global energy sector is also profoundly affected by the epidemic. According to the statistics of IEA, except for the slight increase in the demand for renewable energy in the first quarter, the rest of the energy has declined to vary degrees, of which oil has fallen the most, reaching 9%. Moreover, electricity demand fell by 2.5% [3] . Some scholars have suggested that energy and medical care are equally important during the epidemic. Among these energy sources, electricity may be most relevant to people's lives. Many countries have issued policies requiring the power supply department to provide uninterrupted power supplies and allow users to delay payment [4] . In this case, the requirements for the power supply department to accurately allocate power resources are higher than usual. Thus, in electricity management, the importance of accurate prediction of electricity demand is self-evident."}, {"section_title": "Related works and problem statement", "text": "In recent years, numerous studies on energy demand forecasting have emerged. Table 1 lists the relevant works in recent two years and gives information for the utilized models.

The data-driven model is used more because the physical simulation model needs to consider too many external factors, and it is difficult to collect relevant data. Moreover, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f some data-driven regression models still need to collect data on massive related factors. On the other hand, most data-driven models use machine learning or deep learning algorithms, and in recent years many scholars have adopted hybrid models to make predictions because single models have some drawbacks. Although these models have obtained more accurate prediction results in some cases, the electricity demand prediction is still facing the following problems:\n1) according to the literature review, most scholars only considered the accuracy of the prediction model, not the stability;\n2) electricity demand prediction studies did not consider major global events such as COVID-19; weather and other factors considered may not be essential factors in this particular period. In other words, these models may lack applicability in the context of major global events.
