Despite the increasing cost of attending, high school graduates are enrolling in postsecondary education at record rates. Faced with the challenge of financing their enrollment, students have increasingly opted to work, borrow, or attend part-time. This analysis describes how undergraduates combine work, borrowing, and attendance, and examines the relationship between these strategies and students' persistence in postsecondary education. The majority of undergraduates work while enrolled. In 1992-93,72 percent of the undergraduates in this analysis worked while enrolled, and they worked intensivelyan average of 31 hours per week and 88 percent of the months they were enrolled (table  2). Compared with students at other types of institutions, students enrolled at public 2year institutions were the most likely to work; worked the most hours per week, on average; and worked over the greatest percentage of their months of enrollment. In 1992-93,18 percent of the undergraduates borrowed through student loan programs to help pay for their education (table 3). Students at private, not-for-profit 4-year and private, for-profit institutions were more likely to borrow (34 and 42 percent, respectively) than those at public 4-year or 2-year institutions (23 percent and 5 percent, respectively). Forty-one percent of the undergraduates enrolled exclusively full time during the 1992-93 academic year, 43 percent enrolled exclusively part time, and 16 percent had mixed full-and part-time enrollment (table 4). Students in 2-year public institutions were much more likely than those in other types of institutions to enroll exclusively part time (65 percent compared to 20 to 26 percent). Among students who worked while enrolled in 1992-93, there was a negative association between average hours worked per week and full-time attendance. However, within each category of hours worked per week (no work, 1-14 hours, 15-33 hours, and 34 or more hours), students who borrowed were more likely than those who did not borrow to attend exclusively full time (table 7). How students combined work, borrowing, and attendance varied by institution type. Among students who attended exclusively full time, between 25 and 29 percent at each type of institution neither worked nor borrowed (table 8). At public 2-year institutions, another approximately 65 percent relied on work without borrowing. At public 4-year institutions, 27 percent worked 15-33 hours and did not borrow (more than any other Percentage distribution of undergraduates according to attendance status by selected demographic and institutional characteristics: 1992-93 Percentage of 1989-90 first-time beginning postsecondary students who had attained a degree or were still enrolled as of spring 1994 according to type of first institution, by work, borrowing, and attendance status: 1989-94 vi\" r LIST OF TABLES Table  Page   11 Percentage distribution of first-time beginning postsecondary students according to work, borrowing, and attendance status, by measures of academic ability and potential: 1989-94 36   12Percentage of 1989-90 first-time beginning postsecondary students who attained a degree or were still enrolled as of spring 1994, and the adjusted percentage after taking into account the covariation among row variables Percentage of 1989-90 first-time beginning postsecondary students who attained a degree or were still enrolled as of spring 1994, by attendance status and type of first institution 33 6 Percentage of 1989-90 first-time beginning postsecondary students who attained a degree or were still enrolled as of spring 1994, according to hours worked while enrolled and borrowing status"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "What undergraduates must pay for tuition, room, and board has increased rapidly in recent years. Between 1980 and 1995, average undergraduate tuition, room, and board rose 48 percent (in constant 1996 dollars) at public institutions and 76 percent at private institutions.' Increases in family income did not keep pace. While the average undergraduate tuition, room, and board at a public institution was equal to 11 percent of the median family income in 1980, it was 15 percent by 1995. The corresponding increase at private institutions was from 25 to 42 percent of median family income.2 Although the costs of postsecondary education have risen, the opportunity costs associated with not receiving postsecondary training have also increased. In 1995, male bachelor's degree recipients aged 25-34 had annual earnings that were 52 percent more, and female bachelor's degree recipients had annual earnings that were 91 percent more, than their counterparts with no more than a high school diploma.3 Despite the rising cost of postsecondary education, record numbers of high school graduates are enrolling in postsecondary education. In 1995, 62 percent of high school graduates aged 16-24 were enrolled in college the October following their high school graduation, up from 54 percent in 1981.4\nThe analysis focuses on the interrelationship of three variables: work, borrowing, and attendance. A composite variable was created that combined students' status with respect to borrowing and working. The various combinations of working and borrowing were then examined in conjunction with students' attendance status.\nA related concern centered on students who started in a 2-year institution (and therefore would be categorized as attending a 2-year institution) but later transferred to a 4-year institution without earning an associate's degree. Because working full time is much more common in the 2-year than in the 4-year sector (47 percent versus 27 percent),\" such students might have worked a large number of hours while at the 2-year institution and a substantially reduced number at the 4-year institution. Students in this situation would have fewer cumulative average hours worked than the typical 2-year student. Among the BPS students, 3 out of 10 who began their education in public 2-year institutions ever transferred, and of those who transferred, 24 percent completed a degree before doing so, which means that their measure of cumulative average hours worked would be based only on their experience while enrolled at the 2-year institution.14"}, {"section_title": "CHOOSING A STRATEGY TO FINANCE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION", "text": "Students and their families have primary responsibility for paying for college, although financially needy students can receive help through grant, loan, and work study programs sponsored by the federal government, state governments, the institutions they attend, and a variety of other public and private organizations.5 When contributions from family and friends, savings, and grants are not enough, students typically work, borrow, or do both. They may also take steps to reduce costs by attending part time rather than full time or by attending a less expensive insti-INTRODUCTION tution. By attending part time, students can reduce the amount of tuition they have to pay and also free up more of their time to work. While students usually have considerable latitude in selecting a strategy, they face constraints as well. For instance, some institutions do not permit part-time attendance; class schedules may preclude the option of working a large number of hours; suitable jobs may not be available or accessible; loan programs set borrowing limits; and federal financial aid programs have eligibility requirements. Students' choices of strategies reflect these constraints and also various aspects of their personal circumstances, such as their willingness to borrow, commitment to completing a degree program, confidence in their academic abilities, work and family responsibilities, and financial obligations unrelated to the cost of attending. Since 1970, borrowing, working, and part-time attendance have all increased, in some cases dramatically. For example, while loans made up about 39 percent of federal financial aid (grants, loans, and work study) in 1970-71, they made up 65 percent of federal aid in 1990-91.6 The percentage of college students aged 16-24 working while enrolled increased from 34 percent in 1970 to 47 percent in 1995 for full-time students (although it stayed the same for part-time students: 83 percent).? And, finally, between 1970 and 1994, the part-time fall enrollment in higher education more than doubled, from 2.8 million to 6.1 million, while the number enrolled full time rose 40 percent (5.8 million to 8.1 million).8 Many students use combinations of work, borrowing, and part-time attendance to cover their postsecondary education costs. While the tradeoffs they make may be the best possible fit between their educational goals and their personal and financial circumstances, some choices may be detrimental to their chances for degree attainment. Specifically, evidence suggests that full-time/off-campus work9 and part-time attendance may negatively affect postsecondary persistence and attainment.10 In order to assist students in making the best possible choices, it is im-INTRODUCTION portant to understand which, if any, particular strategies/combinations are related to lower persistence rates and whether these relationships differ according to the type of institution a student attends. To address these issues, this analysis examines how students combine work, borrowing, and attendance to finance their postsecondary education. The report begins by describing the different working, borrowing, and attendance strategies and how they vary with students' demographic characteristics and by institutional type. It then examines how these three strategies are used in combination and identifies which strategies are most commonly used at different types of institutions. Finally, it discusses the relationship between these strategies and students' postsecondary outcomes. To measure the independent effects of work, borrowing, and attendance on persistence, a multivariate analysis was conducted to control for covariation."}, {"section_title": "DATA AND VARIABLE DEFINITIONS", "text": "The primary source of data for the analysis was the 1992-93 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93), a nationally representative sample of students enrolled in all types of postsecondary institutions, ranging from less-than-2-year vocational institutions to 4-year colleges and universities. The NPSAS:93 survey offers comprehensive data on postsecondary financing, including data reported by institutions, students, and parents. Data from the 1989-90 Beginning Postsecondary Longitudinal Study Second Follow-up (BPS:90/94) were used to examine whether different postsecondary outcomes were associated with different postsecondary financing strategies. BPS:90/94 is the longitudinal component of the NPSAS:90 survey, and includes students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time during the 1989-90 academic year. The BPS cohort was followed up in 1992 and 1994, with the latter follow-up offering a wide range of information regarding the students' persistence and degree attainment five years after they initially enrolled in postsecondary education."}, {"section_title": "Work and Borrowing", "text": "The composite variable used to classify students according to their work and borrowing status was created for both the NPSAS:93 and the BPS:90/94 populations. First, students were divided into two categories representing their borrowing status: borrowed and did not borrow.\" Then, within each of these categories, students were placed in one of four possible working categories based on the average number of hours they worked per week while enrolled: did not work, worked 1-14 hours, worked 15-33 hours, and worked 34 or more hours.12 Working during the summer, vacation periods, or other times in which the student was not enrolled was not included. Students with missing employment information (19 percent) were given missing values for this variable. For the NPSAS:93 sample, data for the 1992-93 academic year were used to determine students' borrowing status and the average number of hours worked while enrolled. For the BPS:90/94 sample, the period used to determine borrowing and working status depended on students' degree completion status. For degree completers, the period covered the time between their first enrollment in postsecondary education  and their degree attainment. For students who did not complete a degree, the period ended with their last enrollment. For students who were still enrolled in the spring of 1994, the period extended to spring 1994. Students who completed a degree (an associate's degree, for example) then transferred were classified only up to their first attainment. While borrowing status has two possible values (borrowed or did not borrow) for both NPSAS:93 and BPS:90/94 students, the period covered for BPS students was longer. The composite variable contains the following eight categories: Borrowed, did not work while enrolled  Did not borrow, worked 1-14 hours/week while enrolled   Did not borrow, worked 15-33 hours/week while enrolled   Did not borrow, worked 34 or more hours/week while enrolled One concern in developing a cumulative measure of work status for the BPS:90/94 students was that students' working status might change over time. For example, a student who worked an average of 32 hours a week while enrolled one year and not at all the next year would have the same cumulative average as someone who worked 16 hours per week for two years, but these two situations might not have the same consequences for persistence. Generally, however, students' working status remained reasonably stable. Seventy percent of students who worked less than 15 hours in their first year and 61 percent of students working 15-33 hours in 1989-90 had the same status for their cumulative variable (table 1). Among students who initially worked 34 hours per week or more, 41 percent had the same status for their cumulative variable. Another 49 percent reduced their work week to average 15-33 hours. Relatively few students showed a major difference in their work pattern cumulatively compared with their first year. For example, only 1 percent of the students who worked an average of less than 15 hours per week in 1989-90 and 4 percent of those who worked 15-33 hours had a cumulative average of 34 hours or more. It should also be kept in mind that a shift in category could actually represent a small shift in actual average hours worked (from 14 to 15, for example). NOTE: Due to the exclusion of students with missing employment information, students not seeking a degree, and students attending private, not-for-profit less-than 4-year and public less-than-2-year institutions, these estimates will vary from other estimates reported using BPS:90/94. "}, {"section_title": "Attendance Status", "text": "Attendance status measures the intensity of students' enrollment while they were enrolled.15 Students were classified as either exclusively full time, exclusively part time, or mixed. The measure was based upon the percentage of enrolled months the student attended full time (based on their institutions' definition of full time). Students with no months' full time were classified as exclusively part time, those with any months' full time up to 99 percent were classified as having mixed attendance, and those with 100 percent of months full time were classified as exclusively full time. Persistence BPS:90/94 data were used to examine whether postsecondary financing strategies were associated with persistence. Students who began postsecondary education for the first time in 1989-90 were considered to have persisted if they attained a degree or were still enrolled in postsecondary education in spring 1994, five years after their initial enrollment. Because 57 percent of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients took more than four years to attain their degree,16 still being enrolled in 1994 was considered persisting. "}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION Institution Type", "text": "Students were categorized according to the first type of institution attended. The analysis looked separately at students in the following types of institutions: public 2-year; public 4-year; private, not-for-profit 4-year; and private, for-profit. It excluded students enrolled in public lessthan-2-year institutions and private, not-for-profit less-than-4-year institutions, because these groups were too small for analysis. Also excluded were students not seeking a degree or certificate, because persistence is not relevant for this group. In total, about 26 percent of the NPSAS:93 and 14 percent of the BPS:90/94 students were excluded because they were missing employment information, were not seeking a degree, or attended one of the excluded types of institutions. Table B2 compares the characteristics of the included and excluded students. Students make decisions about work, borrowing, and attendance status that reflect their aspirations, preferences, financial situations, and personal circumstances. Those with sufficient financial resources may be able simply to choose their attendance status and not have to borrow or work (although some may choose to work for nonfinancial reasons). Students with more limited financial resources may decide to attend full time and then use work, borrowing, or a combination of both to help finance their education. If students in this group cannot survive financially with work and borrowing, they may switch to part-time attendance. Still other students may decide to work full time, attend part time, and minimize or avoid borrowing. This last group is a varied one and will include, among others, students established in a career who want additional education while holding onto their jobs; older students with family responsibilities who may not have the time, interest, or financial resources to attend full time; students not sure about their commitment to postsecondary education or their academic qualifications who want the security of a job when they first enroll; and students who want to avoid debt. This section first examines who works, who borrows, and who attends full and part time, and then looks at how work, borrowing, and attendance status are used in combination. It is important to keep in mind that while students can trade off among work, borrowing, and attendance pattern to a certain extent, there are constraints associated with each approach. These constraints are discussed as well."}, {"section_title": "WORK", "text": "The majority of undergraduates work while enrolled, not just during the summer or vacation breaks. In 1992-93, nearly three-quarters (72 percent) of undergraduates in this analysis worked while enrolled, and they worked intensivelyan average of 31 hours per week and 88 percent of the months they were enrolled (table 2). Most students (91 percent) worked off campus in their principal job (the one they worked at the longest). This practice, as indicated earlier, may be detrimental to persistence.  NOTE: Due to the exclusion of students with missing employment information, students not seeking a degree, and students attending private, not-for-profit less-than 4-year and public less-than-2-year institutions, these estimates will vary from other estimates reported using NPSAS:93. Undergraduates' work patterns varied according to type of institution (figure 1). Compared with students at other types of institutions, those enrolled in 2-year public institutions were the most likely to work, worked the most hours, and worked over the greatest percentage of their enrollment. Seventy-nine percent of students at public 2-year institutions worked while enrolled, and they worked an average of 34 hours per week for 91 percent of the months they were enrolled (table 2). Students at public 4-year institutions had a work pattern similar to that of students at 4-year private, not-for-profit institutions, with about two-thirds working while enrolled, and working an average of about 26-27 hours per week for about 85-87 percent of their months enrolled."}, {"section_title": "2G", "text": "The differences in the work patterns students exhibit reflect, at least in part, the feasibility of combining work and enrollment at the institutions they attend. Some 4-year institutions require full-time attendance or schedule most of their classes during the day, which makes working a large number of hours difficult. Public 2-year institutions, in contrast, typically offer evening classes and flexible programs, which make it much easier for students to work full time while attending. Least likely to work while enrolled were students attending private, for-profit institutions (57 percent worked), where the short-term, intensive nature of most programs leaves little time for work. NOTE: Figure excludes students with missing employment information, students not working toward a degree, and students at public less-than-2-year and private, not-for-profit less-than-4-year institutions. Work patterns vary with student characteristics as well. Generally, characteristics associated with traditional-age college students were also associated with less working. For example, dependent students, students under 24 years (who are almost all dependent), unmarried students, and students who lived on campus were less likely to work than their independent, older, married or separated, or off-campus counterparts. In addition to being less likely to work, when younger, dependent, or single undergraduates did work while enrolled, they worked fewer hours on average, worked during a smaller percentage of their months enrolled, and were more likely to work on campus. For example, students aged 24-29 worked an average of 35 hours per week, while students under age 24 worked an average of 25 hours. Working while enrolled also varied with income levels and dependency status. Among dependent students, those from families in the lower and middle income quartiles were more likely than those in the highest income quartile to work and, when they worked, to work more hours per week on average. Among independent students, the reverse was true. Those in the lowest income quartile were less likely than those in the middle and higher income quartiles to work and, when they worked, to work fewer hours per week on average. A major reason for the difference between dependent and independent students is that dependent student income refers to the student's parents' income, while independent student income refers to the student's own income. Thus, independent students who are in the lower income quartile are there at least in part because they do not work as much as students in the higher income quartiles. Work patterns vary with both institutional and student characteristics, and these two sets of characteristics are themselves interrelated. That is, students with characteristics associated with working less are more likely than other students to attend the types of institutions associated with less work. For example, younger students and students at 4-year institutions are less likely to work than older students and students at 2-year public institutions. However, younger students are also more likely than older students to attend 4-year institutions.17"}, {"section_title": "BORROWING", "text": "Borrowing has become an increasingly common way for students to help pay for their undergraduate education. However, it was not an option for all students in 1992-93. To participate in federal loan programs in 1992-93, students had to be U.S. citizens or eligible noncitizens (such as permanent residents), academically qualified, enrolled in an eligible program at least half time, and making satisfactory academic progress.18 They also had to have financial need, meaning that cost of attending the institution they selected was greater than their expected family contribution (which is based primarily on income). While students had some choice between borrowing and work, the maximum they could borrow under the Stafford loan program in 1992-93 was $2,625 per year in their first two years and $4,000 in their third year or later, and a total of $17,250 for their undergraduate study.19 Even if eligible to participate in a student loan program, students do not always borrow. Their decisions are based on factors such as the standard of living they want to maintain, how much debt they are willing to assume, alternative sources of funds available to them, and other aspects of their financial circumstances. Students' decisions also depend on how much they can and want to work given job demands, time availability, and their programs and class schedules. Eighteen percent of the undergraduates included in this study borrowed to help pay for their postsecondary education in 1992-93, borrowing an average of $3,300 (figure 2 and table 3). Both the percentage who borrowed and the average amount borrowed varied according to the type of institution attended (which is closely related to cost of attending) and family income. Private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions and private, for-profit institutions typically have higher tuition and fees than public 4-year and public 2-year institutions.20 This difference in costs may explain why students at the former types of institutions were more likely than those at the latter to borrow (34 and 42 percent versus 23 and 5 percent), and to borrow more, on average ($3,800 and $3,600 versus $3,000 and $2,500). Among students attending public institutions, those attending 4-year institutions were more likely than those in 2-year institutions to borrow (23 versus 5 percent), and to borrow more, on average ($3,000 versus $2,500). The lower rate of borrowing at 2-year institutions reflects their lower cost, but also reflects their large population of less-than-half-time students (38 percent)21 which makes them ineligible for federal loan programs. Reflecting differences in financial need, the percentage who borrowed as well as the average amount borrowed varied with family income. As family income increased from the lowest to the highest quartile, the percentage who borrowed decreased (32 percent to 8 percent). Borrowing varies with student demographic characteristics as well, but by law, gender, age, and raceethnicity are not considered in the award of federal aid. Thus, for the most part, variation in borrowing reflects differences in characteristics that are related to the regulations for awarding financial aid, which are primarily income, dependency status, attendance status, and cost of attending (which, in turn, is related to institution type). Some part of the differences may, however, reflect variation in willingness to borrow or work or parents' willingness to contribute financially to their children's education. 20As reported in J. Tuma and S. Geis, Student Financing of Undergraduate Education, 1992-93 (Washington, D.C., U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1995), the total annual costs (sum of tuition and nontuition costs) for full-time, full-year students at public 4-year institutions were $11,115; at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions, $19,549; at public 2-year institutions, $9,437; and at private, for-profit institutions, $15,021. 21U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1992-93 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93), Data Analysis System.

"}, {"section_title": "ATTENDANCE PATTERNS", "text": "Postsecondary institutions offer students a range of possibilities for full-and part-time attendance, although not all institutions offer all options. For example, some 4-year colleges and universities do not offer a part-time alternative, while most 2-year institutions do. Private, forprofit institutions frequently have short-term, intensive programs that require full-time attendance. Also, students at 4-year private, not-for-profit institutions have a strong incentive to finish a bachelor's degree in four years because of the relatively high tuition at this type of institution. Usually students can finish in four years only if they attend full-time throughout most of their time enrolled. In 1992-93, 41 percent of undergraduates enrolled exclusively full time; 43 percent enrolled exclusively part time; and 16 percent had mixed enrollmentthat is, they enrolled full time for part of the year and part time for part of the year (figure 3 and table 4). The types of institutions students attended and their attendance patterns were related.

Students in private, for-profit institutions were the most likely to attend exclusively full time (72 versus 20 to 61 percent of students in other types of institutions). Students attending public 4-year institutions were more likely than those in all other types of institutions to have mixed attendance patterns (21 percent versus 15 percent or less). Attendance patterns also varied according to students' demographic characteristics. Exclusively part-time attendance was most common among students with demographic characteristics similar to the student population at public 2-year institutions: students who were over age 24, independent (with or without dependents), married or separated, or lived off campus or with their parents were more likely than their counterparts who were younger, dependent, unmarried, or living on campus to attend exclusively part time. Compared with males, female undergraduates were more likely to attend exclusively part time (46 versus 40 percent), and less likely to attend full time (39 versus 44 percent). These gender differences may be at least partly related to age, since female students are more likely to be older.22 As age increased, the likelihood of attending exclusively part time increased from 24 percent for students less than 24 years old to 73 percent for those 30 years or older. In addition to the intensity of enrollment, the duration of enrollment may be a component of students' postsecondary strategies. That is, some students may choose to attend for only part of the academic year in order to save money or to work. Students who attended less than 8 months are considered part-year students, while those who attended 8 or more months are considered full year. Nearly three-quarters (71 percent) of students who attended exclusively full time attended for the full year (table 5). (Exclusively full-time students who attended less than 8 months would include full-time students who were in short-term programs as well as students who did not enroll each term.)

The focus of the discussion is on patterns that were associated with increased full-time attendance, since full-time attendance has been shown to be associated with increased persistence and attainment. First, among students who work, there is a negative association between hours worked per week while enrolled and full-time attendance. The more students work, the less likely they are to attend full time. However, controlling for hours worked, borrowing was associated with a larger percentage attending full time. Among both borrowers and nonborrowers who worked, as the number of hours they worked increased, the less likely they were to enroll exclusively full time (figure 4 and table 7).23 However, within each category of hours worked while enrolled (including those who did not work at all), students who borrowed were more likely than those who did not borrow to attend exclusively full time. The difference was particularly large among students who worked 34 or more hours per week: 52 percent of those who borrowed attended exclusively full time compared with 14 percent of those who did not borrow.

As the number of hours worked while enrolled increased (excluding those who did not work at all), their likelihood of attending full time decreased. Among students at 4-year institutions working similar numbers of hours, borrowers were generally more likely than nonborrowers to attend full time.24 The effect was particularly large for those working 34 or more hours: at public 4-year institutions, 51 percent of borrowers who worked 34 or more hours attended full time, compared with 21 percent of non-24At private, not-for-profit institutions, among students who worked 1-14 hours per week, the percentage of borrowers who attended full time (87 percent) was not significantly different from the percentage of nonborrowers who attended full time (81 percent).

Students with 1-99 percent of their months full time are categorized as mixed, and students with 100 percent of their months full time are categorized as exclusively full-time. 2Due to the small number of undergraduates who borrowed, the standard errors for the estimates of the percent who borrowed at public 2-year institutions are relatively large, ranging from 4.06 to 9.26. 3Borrowing includes loans from federal, state, and institutional sources in 1992-93. NOTE: Due to the exclusion of students with missing employment information, students not seeking a degree, and students attending private, not-for-profit less-than 4-year and public less-than-2-year institutions, these estimates will vary from other estimates reported using NPSAS:93. The relationship between hours worked and full-time attendance was somewhat different for students at private, for-profit institutions. Among both borrowers and nonborrowers, those who worked 34 or more hours per week while enrolled were less likely than those who worked 15-33 hours to attend exclusively full time. However, those who worked 1-14 hours or 15-33 hours per week while enrolled were about equally likely to do so. Although a substantial proportion of students at private, for-profit institutions borrowed (42 percent, table 6), only among those who did not work or worked 34 or more hours per week did borrowing appear to be associated with full-time attendance (table 7). For example, among students who did not work, 84 percent of borrowers attended full time compared with 78 percent of nonborrowers, and among students working 34 or more hours, 68 percent of borrowers did so compared with 45 percent of nonborrowers. Because so many of the students at public 2-year institutions worked 34 hours per week or more (46 percent) and attended exclusively part-time (65 percent), and because they rarely borrowed (5 percent, table 6), the estimates for students with other types of work, borrowing, and attendance patterns are based on a small number of cases. Therefore, the relationship between borrowing and full-time attendance could not be determined for these students. Table 8 summarizes how students at various types of institutions combined work and borrowing, controlling for attendance status. In all types of institutions, between 25 and 29 percent of the students who attended exclusively full time neither worked nor borrowed.

At other types of institutions, exclusively full-time students used a greater variety of strategies. For example, for students at public 4-year institutions, the most common strategies were not working and not borrowing (28 percent), or working 15-33 hours and not borrowing (27 percent). Full-time students at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions who worked were more likely than their counterparts at public 4-year institutions to borrow and work (at each level of working). Among exclusively part-time students at all types of institutions except private, for-profit, 90 percent or more did not borrow. Except at private, for-profit institutions, the strategy adopted by at least 50 percent of exclusively part-time students was not to borrow, but to work 34 or more hours per week. Almost all of the rest either worked 15-33 hours or not at all and did not borrow. As indicated earlier, a number of studies have suggested that full-time off-campus work has a negative effect on postsecondary persistence, while part-time workparticularly part-time oncampus worktends to have positive effects. Part-time, on-campus work may facilitate social integration, while working full time or working off campus may interfere with this process by curtailing the time available for schoo1.25 In addition, as also indicated earlier, part-time attendance (typically defined as fewer than 12 credit hours) has been found to be associated with lower rates of postsecondary persistence. Part-time attendance may also be associated with other circumstances that reduce a student's likelihood of persistence, such as work, family responsibilities, limited financial resources, or a low level of commitment to completing a program.26 This section examines how postsecondary persistence is related to various combinations of work, borrowing, and attendance. Specifically, it describes the relationship between 1989-90 first-time beginning students' cumulative working and borrowing status and their persistence five years later in 1994. The analysis described in this section uses data from BPS:90/94, which includes only students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1989-90. The BPS:90/94 population contains a higher proportion of young, dependent, and single students than the NPSAS:93 population discussed in the previous section. Consequently, work, borrowing, and attendance patterns of these two groups differ. Specifically, BPS:90/94 students were much more likely than NPSAS:93 students to borrow (31 versus 18 percent), and, whether they borrowed or not, they were considerably more likely to work less than 34 hours and less likely not to work at all (table 9). The BPS:90/94 students were about as likely as the NPSAS:93 students to attend exclusively full-time (40 and 41 percent, respectively), but the BPS:90/94 students were much less likely than the NPSAS:93 students to attend exclusively part time (18 percent versus 43 percent, table B3).27 27It is logical that BPS students would be more likely than NPSAS:93 students to have mixed attendance because the period covered is longer.

It also found that borrowing instead of working full time was related to increased fulltime attendance and persistence. Due to the interrelationships among these variables, however, it is difficult to determine the individual effects of each. In addition, how students combine work, borrowing, and attendance also appears to be related to their background characteristics and other environmental influences that might affect their postsecondary outcomes. To measure the independent effects of work, borrowing, and attendance on persistence,28 a weighted least squares regression model was used. By examining the effects of several variables simultaneously and controlling for interrelationships between them, linear regression enables one to determine how specific variables are associated with the outcomes of interest. The dichotomous dependent variable is defined as having attained or being still enrolled or not having either of these characteristics. The model estimated the proportion of students who had attained a degree or were still enrolled as of spring 1994. The independent variables included work, borrowing, and attendance status, as well as other factors considered to be related to students' persistence outcomes, including students' gender, age, raceethnicity, dependency status, local residence, socioeconomic status, cumulative grade point average, and the type of institution attended. The regression coefficients were used to adjust the original estimates of overall persistence and attainment by taking into account the joint effects of all independent variables.29 Table 12 shows the results of this analysis.

When other variables in the model were considered, working full time (34 or more hours) and attending part time were negatively associated with persistence. By contrast, borrowing was positively associated with persistence. Although significant differences were found in the unadjusted means for persistence according to the type of institution attended, when other variables were taken into consideration, these differences were no longer found. It is likely that the unadjusted means for institution type reflects the working, borrowing, attendance, and local residence patterns of students who attend those institutions, all of which are independent predictors of persistence in the regression model, as well as other characteristics shown in the table. When the effects of other variables were controlled, the association of academic ability with postsecondary persistence and attainment was evident.

At public 2-year institutions, most students worked full time and attended part time, whereas the majority of students at 4-year institutions worked part time and attended full time. Students in private, for-profit institutions also attended full time but most either did not work or worked full time. Similarly, whether or not a student borrowed was also related to choice of institution, with students at higher cost institutions more likely to borrow. In general, across all categories of hours worked, if students borrowed, their likelihood of attending full time increased. In addition to identifying the common combinations of work, borrowing, and attendance among students in different types of institutions, this analysis also focused on how these combinations were related to students' persistence and attainment outcomes. For each institution type, part-time attendance reduced the likelihood of persisting compared with full-time attendance. In addition, full-time work was negatively associated with persistence and attainment, while parttime work (1-14 hours) was positively associated. Students who borrowed were also more likely to persist and attain than were nonborrowers. Although the results differed according to institution type, borrowing might increase students' likelihood of persistence by reducing their need to work full time, thereby allowing them to attend full time at higher rates. When the effects of other variables were controlled, borrowing was still related to persistence and attainment. Perhaps borrowing in and of itself increases students' commitment to degree completion; that is, they may have more incentive to finish because they will need a higher paying job to meet their debt burden. Alternatively, it may be that students who borrow rather than work are more committed or motivated to completing their postsecondary studies from the outset. Conversely, students who are not as committed to their schooling may choose to finance their education through work instead, thereby avoiding future debt if they decide not to complete their program."}, {"section_title": "APPENDIX A GLOSSARY", "text": "This glossary describes the variables used in this report.

For both the NPSAS:93 and BPS:90/94 samples, exclusively part-time attendance was more likely among students age 24 and over than students under age 24, independent students compared with dependent students, married students compared with students who were not married (NPSAS) or never married (BPS),3\u00b0 and students who lived off campus or with their parents compared to students who lived on campus."}, {"section_title": "COMPARISON OF ATTENDANCE STATUS", "text": "The 1989-90 first-time beginning students were as likely to have mixed attendance patterns as they were to attend exclusively full time (43 percent versus 40 percent), and the demographic characteristics of these groups resembled the group of exclusively full-time students from the NPSAS:93 sample.

For analysis purposes, therefore, both mixed and full-time attendance were combined for the BPS:90/94 sample and identified as attending exclusively or partly full time. *Attendance status is defined in terms of the percentage of months enrolled in 1992-93 that were full time. Students with zero months full time are categorized as exclusively part-time. Students with 1-99 percent of their months full time are categorized as mixed, and students with 100 percent of their months full time are categorized as exclusively full-time. NOTE: Due to the exclusion of students with missing employment information, students not seeking a degree, and students attending private, not-for-profit less-than 4-year and public less-than-2-year institutions, all estimates will vary from prior estimates reported using NPSAS:93 and BPS:90/94. The need for a nationally representative database on postsecondary student financial aid prompted the U.S. Department of Education to initiate the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study ( NPSAS), a cross-sectional survey conducted every 3 years starting in 1987. The NPSAS sample was designed to include students enrolled in all types of postsecondary education. However, service academies were not included in the institution sample because of their unique funding and tuition base, and certain other institutions were also excluded.31 In addition to a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) of students and parents, the NPSAS surveys collect students' registrarial and financial aid information directly from the sampled institutions. To provide the full range of information on financing postsecondary education, NPSAS samples both aided and nonaided students. NPSAS:93 included a stratified sample of approximately 66,000 eligible students (about 52,000 of whom were undergraduates) from about 1,100 institutions. Students were included in the sample if they attended a NPSAS-eligible institution; were enrolled between July 1, 1992 and June 30, 1993; and were enrolled in one or more courses or programs including courses for credit, a degree or formal award program of at least 3 months' duration, or an occupationally or vocationally specific program of at least 3 months' duration. Regardless of their postsecondary status, however, students who were also enrolled in high school were excluded. The 1992-93 NPSAS survey sample, while representative and statistically accurate, was not a simple random sample. Instead, the survey sample was selected using a more complex three-step procedure with stratified samples and differential probabilities of selection at each level. First, postsecondary institutions were initially selected within geographical strata. Once institutions were organized by zip code and state, they were further stratified by control (i.e., public; private, not-for-profit; or private, for-profit) and offering (less-than-2-year, 2-to 3-year, 310ther excluded institutions were those offering only avocational, recreational, or remedial courses; those offering only inhouse business courses; those offering only programs of less than 3 months' duration; and those offering only correspondence courses."}, {"section_title": "59", "text": ""}]
