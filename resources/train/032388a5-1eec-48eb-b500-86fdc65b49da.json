[{"section_title": "TABLE OF CONTENTS", "text": "Anomalous Gulf Stream intrusions on the southern New England coastal shelf appear in the form of meanders and warm core rings. These anomalous intrusions are usually surface-intensified but can be identified in the region of the pycnocline in the summer, when there is high stratification, and near-bottom in the fall and spring due to a decrease in stratification [Churchill et al., 2003;Ullman et al., 2014]. Surface-intensified and pycnocline intrusions extend shoreward onto the shelf along the seasonal pycnocline and stay within the top 40 m of the water column [Churchill et al., 2003]. Near-bottom intrusions encompass most of the water column and have a downward increasing salinity [Churchill et al., 2003]. There is strong evidence of the onshore movement of slope water due to interaction of the intrusions with the shelf break front, which allows for cross-isobath exchange indicated by the net onshore transfer of salt and nutrients [Ullman et al., 2014]. Based on these and similar observations, we believe that the circulation of the southern New England coastal shelf is altered by the presence of anomalous Gulf Stream intrusions. Before this can be modeled, the seasonal circulation of the southern New England coastal shelf first needs to be established and analyzed. The coastal shelf of southern New England consists of Georges Bank (GB) and the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB), which includes Rhode Island Sound (RIS), Block Island Sound and the New York Bight ( Figure  1). Water in this region originates in the polar region of the Scotian Shelf and then moves through the Gulf of Maine before reaching Georges Bank and the MAB [Luo et al., 2013]. This makes the water on the coastal shelf off of southern New England colder and fresher near the coast, and warmer and more saline near the open ocean [Luo et al., 2013]. The GB consists of anticyclonic circulation that has seasonal variations governed by tidal forcings and seasonal heat flux cycles [Naimie et al., 2013]. The MAB consists of nearsurface flow that is onshore and near-bottom flow that is offshore; the change in directionality occurs around the 50-m isobath [Lentz, 2008]. However, there is an overall mean-depth averaged flow that is alongshelf, toward the equator, and increases linearly with water depth [Lentz, 2008]. Circulation in RIS, Block Island Sound and the New York Bight follows the same general alongshelf and equatorward pattern as the MAB circulation [Blumberg and Galperin, 1990;Luo et al., 2013;Sun et al., 2016]. However, different regions of the MAB have different local circulation patterns. The RIS has cyclonic circulation that is locally wind-driven and is also remotely affected by the North Atlantic Oscillation [Luo et al., 2013]. There is an anticyclonic eddy-like current off Montauk Point in Block Island Sound [Sun et al., 2016]. The New York Bight is greatly affected by wind stress to the point where strong winds can reverse the direction of flow [Blumberg and Galperin, 1990]. In this paper, we present model results for the mean and seasonal circulation of the southern New England coastal shelf. We first review the model used for this experiment in section 2. We then discuss the methods for interpreting the forcing datasets and model results in section 3. In section 4 we compare the model to known observations of the MAB and the RIS circulation. Section 5a is a review of the seasonal variability of circulation along the coastal shelf of southern New England, section 5b is a review of the annual mean circulation in this region, and section 6 is a discussion of these results."}, {"section_title": "Design of Numerical Experiment", "text": "The data used in this experiment were previously published by Zhang et al. [2016]. The numerical model is the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). This is a freesurface, hydrostatic, terrain-following, primitive equations ocean model comprised of algorithms and nonlinear kernels [Shchepetkin and McWilliams, 2005]. The model domain extends from the Scotian Shelf to Cape Hatteras to cover GB and the MAB. This region is configured to resolve the Gulf Stream [Zhang et al., 2016]. The model uses topography derived from the 1 arc-minute ETOPO1 Global Relief Model of the Earth's surface, bathymetry that ranges from 10 to 5000 m within the model range and a water column with 30 terrain-following levels that have the highest resolution at the surface and lowest resolution at depth [Zhang et al., 2016]. The open boundary forcing is provided by the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model with the Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation scheme (HYCOM/NCODA, http://hycom.org/dataserver/glb-analysis). Free surface and depth-averaged values are given using the method from Flather [1976], external subtidal values taken from HYCOM/NCODA and tidal components M 2 , N 2 , S 2 , O 1 , and K 1 [Zhang et al., 2016]. Local surface forcing is denoted from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Prediction North America Regional Reanalysis (NCEP/NARR), and the United"}, {"section_title": "States", "text": "Geological Survey (USGS, http://www.usgs.gov/water/) stream gauge climatological datasets were used as a basis for fresh water outflow [Zhang et al., 2016]. For the purposes of this experiment, only two years of climatological data are being utilized from the larger 12-year forcing dataset used by Zhang et al. [2016], and the method for this will be discussed in section 3. The climatological data consist of surface momentum flux, heat fluxes, tides and river mass flux. For the purposes of this study, only surface momentum flux, which consists of surface winds in the zonal and meridional directions, will be analyzed in terms of the resulting circulation. This is because changes in wind strength have been known to affect the direction of flow in RIS as well as other regions within MAB [Luo et al., 2013;Blumberg and Galperin, 1990]. The output data have also been provided by Zhang et al. [2016], and include the model outputs of circulation based on surface momentum flux. All data will be presented in the context of the region of study, the coastal shelf of southern New England."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "The original forcings dataset consisted of 12-year files: 2 years of climatological data and ten years of time series data from January 2004 to December 2013[Zhang et al., 2016. The climatological data were obtained from the 12-year files and used to create new 2-year files. From these files seasonal and annual means of surface wind velocity in the zonal and meridional directions were generated. Vector plots for each season, represented by February (winter), May (spring), August (summer) and November (fall), as well as the annual mean were generated to illustrate wind velocity on the southern New England coastal shelf. The equation 1is used to calculate the magnitude of each vector, where U is the average magnitude of zonal and meridional wind at point (u n , v n ), u is the zonal wind component and v is the meridional wind component. The equation 2is used to calculate the direction of each vector, where V is the average direction of zonal and meridional wind at point (u n , v n ) on a unit circle (in degrees), u is the zonal wind component and v is the meridional wind component. The circulation, in relation to the zonal and meridional winds, was remapped to the model's grid. The data were then plotted as a pseudocolor checkerboard plot with flat shading on a Universal Transverse Mercator projection with a Global Self-consistent, Hierarchal, High-resolution Geography Database coastline, which illustrates the velocity of the circulation. Equations (1) and(2) were then used to calculate the magnitude and direction of flow for the circulation, respectively. The results were superimposed over the pseudocolor checkerboard plot in the form of vectors. This process was done to illustrate seasonal mean circulation, with seasons represented by the same months as the seasonal means of wind velocity, as well as the annual mean circulation.\nThe trawl locations were characterized as \"inshore\" or \"offshore\" based on a number of physical factors including water depth (inshore generally less than 10 m and offshore greater than 10 m), temperature (inshore with warmer temperatures) and isolation from coastal circulation (inshore more protected) (Figure 1). A logistic regression was used to identify predictor variables, such as temperature, month and location, correlated to the sex of the fish captured. The function used to determine the probability of an inshore fish being male for a given size is given by equation 1, the function for an offshore fish is given by equation 2 and the function for all males in this study is given by equation 3. In these equations, p(M) is the probability of an individual being male and TL is the total length of the individual. The probability of being female is the complement of the probability of being male. (1) When determining the proportion of fish with full stomachs, the empty stomachs marked as flaccid were removed in order to correct for potential bias introduced by regurgitation. Stomachs which had contents but were noted as flaccid were considered as \"full\" stomachs in this analysis. To conduct a diet analysis, all of the fish were classified based on categorical variables, such as size class or habitat, to test the influence of these variables on diet composition. The empty stomachs were excluded from the diet composition analysis. In each of the remaining stomachs the frequency of occurrence of each prey item was totaled, with each appearance in a stomach counting as one occurrence of the prey, regardless of the number of individuals of the same species in the same stomach. Unidentifiable contents were excluded from the total number of prey items observed. Then, the frequency of occurrence of each prey species was compared to the total number of organisms observed to generate percentages of the diet. Further quantitative methods were not considered due to the potential biases from regurgitation and depredation in the net. A logistic regression was used to determine significant relationships between variables, such as sex and location, and the likelihood of a stomach being empty. All statistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.3.0), specifically RStudio (version 0.99.902). When conducting statistical tests using total length of the fish or weight of the stomach contents, both were log transformed to correct for non-normality. "}, {"section_title": "Model Evaluation", "text": "We compare the model results to known observations of the MAB circulation to evaluate the model and prove that it can accurately portray the essential features of the MAB coastal shelf circulation. The model outer shelf circulation is compared to Lentz [2008] in which mean-depth averaged currents along the MAB were studied ( Figure 2). The model results are obtained by averaging the surface circulation of the model results for one year. The circulation of the model results is consistent with the observations. Both illustrate the circulation as alongshelf in the direction of the equator. There are differences in velocity when comparing the model and the observations; however the model adequately represents outer MAB shelf circulation for our future purposes, i.e. to study the anomalous impact of Gulf Stream intrusions. The model results of the inner shelf region of RIS are compared to observations of the residual circulation in RIS from Kincaid et al. [2003] (not shown here). When averaging the summer and winter values of volume of water transported (m 3 /s), the annual mean direction of volume transport becomes east to west along the mouth of Narragansett Bay and then northeast to southwest along the Rhode Island coast out of RIS. The model annual mean RIS circulation is consistent with these observations. There are discrepancies between the model and observations with regard to the direction of circulation as well as the magnitude of flow. Still, the overall circulation patterns of the model are sufficient to represent RIS circulation."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "\nThe equation used to estimate cellular carbon from cell volume in S. costatum (s.l.) can be observed in Figure 1. Data that have been log transformed yield a stronger relationship, which allows for better estimates of cellular carbon. In general the observed log-transformed cell volumes lay within the range from ca. 1.6 to ca. 2.6 \u00b5m 3 . While there is some variation in cellular carbon at a given volume, the general trend, represented by the simple linear regression, suggests that as cell volume increases, so too, does the amount of carbon within the cell. From the linear regression equation (Figure 1) the carbon content for the average cell volume in S. costatum (s.l.) was calculated. For S. costatum (s.l.) the average cell volume was 228 \u00b5m 3 , and when log transformed and placed into the equation the carbon output was 1.44 picograms of carbon per cell. When removed from the log transformation, the carbon content in a S. costatum (s.l.) cell of average volume was calculated to be 28 picograms of carbon per cell (Table 1). When each equation is utilized to predict cellular carbon from cell volume, the amount of carbon increases with increasing volume (Figure 2). The equation for S. costatum (s.l.) generated in this study, overlaps with the equation published in Montagnes and Franklin (2001) at the narrow range of log volumes from 1.75 to 2 \u00b5m 3 . Comparatively, for S. costatum (s.l.) cells with small volumes, the equation by Montagnes and Franklin (2001) yields less carbon. For log-transformed cell volumes greater than 2, the Montagnes and Franklin (2001) equation yields more carbon, comparatively. The trends observed by Strathman (1967), and Menden-Deuer and Lessard (2000) are very similar and overlap over the wide range of log volumes from 1.5 to 2.75 \u00b5m 3 . The trends observed in this study, Strathman (1967), and Menden-Deuer and Lessard overlap in the range of logtransformed volumes from 2.5 to 3 \u00b5m 3 . For smaller cell volumes (<2.5 \u00b5m 3 ), the S. costatum (s.l.) trend in this study diverges from trend observed by Strathman (1967), andMenden-Deuer andLessard (2000). The equation for this study yields higher cellular carbon values than the other equations for smaller cells. The three winter-spring diatom bloom species in Narragansett Bay are present in very different relative cell abundances for all years (Figure 3). With time, there appears to be no apparent overall trend in S. costatum (s.l.) cell concentrations. There are years with greater cell concentrations (1960,1965,1980,1995) followed by years with respectively lower cell concentrations (1970,1985,2000). Detonula confervacea cell concentrations decreased steadily from 1960 to 1980, until it begins to fluctuate in 1985 until 2000, when it almost completely disappeared. Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii cell concentrations were relatively steady between the years 1960 and 1985. However, starting in 1990 T. nordenskioeldii began to decrease until almost completely disappearing.  The cell concentration data from Figure 3 have been converted to carbon concentrations ( Figure 4). The same overall trends described for each species in Figure 3 exist due to the fact that the conversion was made by multiplying the average cell concentration (cells/mL) by the amount of carbon (pg C/cell) found in a cell of average volume for each species. However, the magnitudes of the trends have been altered, since each species has a different average carbon content. D. confervacea had the lowest carbon concentration relative to the other two species for every time interval with the exception of 1990. While S. costatum (s.l.) is numerically more abundant (Figure 3), with respect to carbon there are multiple time intervals where T. nordenskioeldii surpasses S. costatum (s.l.) in carbon concentration (1965,1970,1975,1985,1990).  The average carbon concentrations for all three species combined gradually decrease in winter-spring bloom carbon concentration with time ( Figure 5). Sketetonema costatum (s.l.) cell concentrations in the summer-fall bloom (July-October) do not show a clear trend over time ( Figure 6). Like in the winterspring bloom, the summer-fall bloom S. costatum (s.l.) cell concentrations experience periods of greater concentrations (1970,1975,1990), followed by periods of lower concentrations (1980,1995).\nDespite having no data, the test flights conducted over land did identify a number of issues that any future endeavor will have to overcome. These issues all are related to processing the images. For the MAPIRs, one of the major issues was aligning the images (Figure 3). Since the mount holding the cameras bends slightly, any programmatic attempt would have to account for translational differences in pictures (the lenses of the four cameras do not share the same location), and rotational differences (the cameras are not all pointed at the exact same angle). This has proven difficult, and attempts to fabricate a mount with stronger materials have helped, but not enough to prevent errors in the final NDVI and GNDVI images. Note how the white car in visible light (b) has a duplicate version in (a). There is a similar effect with the bed of the blue truck in the top left of each image. This stems from imperfect alignment of images used to make the NDVI. Regardless of camera, both programs used for mosaicking have proven unreliable ( Figure  4). Agisoft was originally designed to take images and make 3D models, thus has trouble creating flat images when the ground is not flat. DroneDeploy, on the other hand, does not generate quality results, often only mosaicking a small portion of the sample area, and not always to the highest quality. Agisoft has a minor advantage as its design allows for the user to fine tune certain aspects of the mosaic, whereas DroneDeploy simply takes the images and returns an output. This study of aerial imagery for the purpose of monitoring algal blooms identified serious issues related to image processing, and compiled a few possible corrections. The most obvious issues are the misalignment of the MAPIR images, and the imprecise mosaicking of the images. There are three possible options to help improve alignment of the MAPIR images. One would be to design a new mount that does not bend at all. At high altitudes, translational displacement becomes less pronounced, while rotational displacement becomes a bigger issue. If one could remove rotational displacement all together, the remaining form of displacement may not only be negligible, but much easier to write code to account for. This simply means that the mount design should be modified. An attempt to simply use stronger plastic did not solve the issue; however, by making the mount thicker or adding in more supports, bending might be negated. Improving on mosaicking the images is far more difficult. While some of the issues with the software may be overcome by the fact that most images from tests will be over water, this ignores what will probably be the greatest challenge in mosaicking the images in the long run, water. Mosaicking programs like those mentioned above work by finding where images overlap based on GPS tags and finding overlapping features, ie: if the program sees that a car is in one image and the same car is in another image, it knows there is some overlap. If most of the pictures over a HAB are featureless water, the programs may have difficulty determining how much overlap the images have. A possible solution would be to fly high over markers on the water surface to use as reference points. This solution has the added benefit that the markers could also be used as calibration tiles. The best option moving forward would be to use an NDVI camera. These cameras do not require picture alignment and many options are available for mosaicking and calibrating.\nIn both the small-and large-volume experiments, we were able to grow colonies with excellent morphologies, that is to say, morphologies similar to what is found in nature. For the small-volume experiment, we compared pre-auxospore colonies ( Fig. 1a) to post-auxospore colonies ( Fig. 1b) to determine what differences exist in their growth rates and morphologies. When analyzing photomicrographs for morphological differences, we only used complete physiological colonies ( Fig. 1), which were discernible from broken colonies ( Fig. 2a) due to their distinct terminal setae (Fig. 2b). This also allowed us to distinguish between very long colonies and two colonies that had not drifted apart at the time they were photographed.\n\n\n\nA total of 251 tremors with durations longer than three minutes have been identified between January 2005 and May 2015. The tremor activity per month is plotted on the same figure as the north and vertical displacement recorded in a nearby GPS station (ATW2) (Figure 4). The GPS data in north direction show about 3 cm southward slip over the course of 2010 to the start of 2013, with no significant change in displacement afterward. During the time of the slow slip event, there was an average of 45 tremors per year in contrast to the years with no slow slip event, both before and after the SSE, that had an average of 10 tremors per year. The tremor activity shows a seasonal variation that peaks in the summer. The months for each year of peak tremor activity on average for the eight stations are, in order starting from 2010 and not including 2015, September, July, June, August, and May, showing a tendency for tremor activity to peak in or around the summer months (Figure 4b). In south central Alaska, seasonal hydrological loading can be significant (Fu et al., 2012) and might modulate tremor activity. In this study, the peak of tremor activity each year is at the time of the highest vertical displacement at GPS station ATW2 in year 2010 and 2013 but not in other years (Figure 4b,c), suggesting a possible but complex link between hydrological loading and tremor activity. However, the decrease of tremor activity in each year since 2010 is more likely related to the nearby SSE because no decrease of hydrological loading is observed in vertical GPS data (Figure 4c). Annual cycles of tremor activity are also observed in northern Cascadia where tremor events tend to occur in the third quarter of the year and match the annual cycle of hydrological loading (Pollitz et al., 2013). The duration of the tremors was visually estimated. Before and during the SSE, the most common tremor length is 5 minutes ( Figure 5). The distributions are very similar before, during, and after the 2009-2013 SSE, indicating that the event has no effect on the duration of the tremors. This is different from what happened in 1998-2001, where Peterson and Christensen (2009) found a decrease in the duration of tremors towards the ending of the 1998-2001 SSE. There are a number of possible reasons. Large earthquakes can trigger nonvolcanic tremors (Gomberg et al., 2008;Rubinstein et al., 2007;Han et al., 2014). However, there is no correlation between large earthquakes and increases in tremor activity in our study ( Figure 6). There are two spikes in tremor activity, one in 2008 and one in 2011, which line up with an earthquake. A close look at the timing between these events reveals that there are no tremor occurrences shortly after these events. We only focus on tremors with duration longer than three minutes. This is likely why no earthquakes triggered tremors in this study. We locate all the identified tremors that occurred between January 2005 and May 2015 ( Figure 7). We fix the depth at 40 km. In most cases, the tremors occur near the downdip end of the slow slip event, which shows a possible link between the two phenomena. Tremors are labeled based on their occurrence before, during, or after the SSE. There is no connection between the location of the tremor and the time that it occurred. The tremors that we were unable to locate either did not have enough station coverage or were located too far outside of the circle of MK stations to determine an accurate location. These tremors could be related to the tremor clusters identified by Wech (2016) to the North East of the current area of interest. The depth of the tremors are not well constrained. The misfit between modeled and observed arrival time tends to decrease with depth until at least 100 km. However, it is hard to imagine physically how a tremor can occur at 100-km depth. Therefore, we solve tremor locations for depth from 30-60 km.\n\nOxyrrhis marina showed positive specific growth rates at all ammonium treatments and concentrations of I. galbana. There was no significant difference seen in the growth rates of predator-free prey growth controls (p=0.999), so prey growth was not a confounding variable in this experiment. Variations in growth and grazing rates were observed among the three ammonium treatments over our 48-hour incubation experiments."}, {"section_title": "Seasonal Mean Wind Velocity and Circulation", "text": "Seasonal means of surface wind velocity are illustrated using vectors that represent magnitude and direction ( Figure 3). Winds in the winter have the strongest velocity of ~7 m/s in the southeast direction. Spring winds are the weakest and have velocities of ~4 m/s, whereas summer winds have a velocity of 4.5 m/s; both in the northeast direction. Winds in the fall have a velocity of about 4.3 m/s in the southeast direction. The seasonal mean circulation is illustrated using PCOLOR to represent velocity of flow and vectors to represent the direction of flow (Figure 4). Circulation is strong in the winter, reaching a maximum velocity along the shelf break of 0.35 m/s. Weak circulation occurs in the spring and summer, with maximum alongshelf velocities of 0.25 m/s and 0.28 m/s, respectively. The strongest circulation is in the fall reaching a maximum velocity of 0.4 m/s on the shelf break."}, {"section_title": "Annual Mean Wind Velocity and Circulation", "text": "Annual mean winds are in the southeast direction with a maximum speed of ~4.5 m/s ( Figure 5). The value of annual mean winds is consistent with averaging the values of the seasonal averages of wind velocity, with a 7.6% difference between the two. The annual mean circulation is in the southeast direction along the coast and shelf break ( Figure 6). Circulation on the coastal shelf and on the continental rise to the south of the shelf break is weak, having an average velocity of 0.1 m/s. The velocity on the shelf break itself is stronger, reaching a maximum velocity of 0.25 m/s.    "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The seasonal mean wind velocities and seasonal averages of circulation show some relationship, but it is not obvious when comparing Figures 3 and 4. While the strongest surface wind velocity occurs in the winter, the strongest circulation occurs in the fall; the weakest surface wind velocity is in the spring while the weakest circulation is in the spring. Based on these observations, a definitive correlation cannot be made between surface wind velocity and circulation. While the annual mean wind direction is east-southeast, the annual mean circulation is flowing south-southwest as seen in Figures 5 and 6. Based on the directionality of both the winds and circulation, this system appears to be in Ekman balance. As stated in Ekman [1905], surface currents typically deviate 45\u02da to the right of the wind direction in the northern hemisphere due to the Coriolis force and friction from surface winds being in equilibrium. However, when circulation is occurring close to a continent it causes the current to flow parallel to the coast as seen on the southern New England coastal shelf [Ekman, 1905]. The proximity of the current to the coast causes the current to flow along the coast with a velocity dependent on the wind velocity [Ekman, 1905]. As a result, while the direction of flow primarily corresponds to the annual mean wind direction, seasonal variations in circulation that coincide with the seasonal variations in wind velocity and direction will also occur as seen in Figures 3 and 4 [Ekman, 1905]. However, Ekman balance cannot be the sole balance of the alongshelf circulation in this region because when the wind strength decreases the alongshlef circulation gets stronger. We believe that there must be a geostrophic balance in play for the alongshelf flow in the MAB. This balance is defined as the Coriolis force and meridional pressure gradient being in equilibrium. The Coriolis force is present due to the Earth's rotation, causing moving objects in the northern hemisphere to move to the right as one looks in the direction of that movement [Persson, 1998]. The pressure gradient along the MAB, which has to be positive in order for alongshelf circulation to occur, is set up by zonal winds, the Gulf Stream, fresh water input from rivers and the Coastal Labrador Sea Water (CLSW) transport [Xu and Oey, 2011]. Zonal winds create a negative pressure gradient, and consequently have minimal influence on the MAB alongshelf pressure gradient [Xu and Oey, 2011]. The Gulf Stream creates a positive pressure gradient, but its distance from the coastal shelf causes it to only have an effect on the seasonal variability of the alongshelf pressure gradient due to its latitudinal shifts and anomalous intrusions on the shelf break [Xu and Oey, 2011]. Fresh water input from rivers and the CLSW transport both create strong positive pressure gradients and therefore have strong influences on the alongshelf pressure gradient of the MAB [Xu and Oey, 2011]. Even though fresh water input and CLSW transport have the strongest influence on the MAB alongshelf pressure gradient, all four components must be present to create the pressure gradient on the MAB. In the equation modified from Xu and Oey [2011] ASP x 10 8 = RIV + (7 x CSLW + 1.3) x the relationship between all four components is illustrated, where ASPG is the alongshelf pressure gradient, RIV is fresh water river input, CLSW is the nondimensional CLSW transport, H v is the Heaviside function, CLSW critical is the nondimensional critical CLSW transport, WINDS is the zonal winds and GS is the Gulf Stream. Without the four components working together in this manner, the alongshelf pressure gradient generating the alongshelf flow would not exist, and the system would not be in geostrophic balance.\nIt has been well established that estimates of cellular carbon for diatoms in general can be obtained from equations relating it to cell volume. While it is important and useful to be able to estimate carbon content in a general equation for any species of diatoms, it has limitations. It is important to understand how extremely abundant species contribute to the biomass in a system; assuming it follows the general diatom trend will not always yield accurate results. In Narragansett Bay, Skeletonema costatum (s.l.) is the most numerically important species of diatoms, and it is therefore important to understand if its carbon content diverges from the general diatom trend. From our data, we have derived an equation, which allows carbon content in S. costatum (s.l.) to be estimated from cell volume ( Figure 1). This equation was compared to previous researchers' findings for all diatoms. Whereas some overlap of the trends is present, the carbon outcome generally depends on which equation was used. For cells with smaller log volumes (<1.75 \u00b5m 3 ) entered into the Montagnes and Franklin (2001) equation, the carbon content is underestimated; using the same equation, carbon content in larger cell volumes (>2 \u00b5m 3 ) are overestimated. The equations by Strathman (1967), and Menden-Deuer and Lessard (2000) both underestimate cellular carbon in cells with log volumes less than 2.5 \u00b5m 3 . These overestimates and underestimates apparent in the general diatom equations support our hypothesis that carbon content in S. costatum (s.l.) does not follow the same trend as all diatoms when estimated using cell volume. Obtaining accurate biomass estimates for this key species in Narragansett Bay requires the species-specific relationship that we have discovered. Phytoplankton blooms are generally analyzed with respect to species composition and measured in cell concentrations. Knowing what species are present in a bloom and how abundant they are gives us valuable information about the system. However, this is only a starting point to understanding the biomass of the bloom. The winter-spring bloom in Narragansett Bay starts in December and ends in April, it contains three main species S. costatum (s.l.), D. confervacea, and T. nordenskioeldii. The five-year average cell concentrations of these species help us understand how the species structure of the bloom has changed with time. Sketetonema costatum (s.l.) was much more abundant relative to the other two species. It is unclear what ecological factors cause the periods of extreme abundance followed by periods of decreased abundance in S. costatum (s.l.); however, this pattern was observed in both the winter-spring and the summer-fall blooms. The gradual decrease in cell concentrations in D. confervacea and the eventual decrease in T. nordenskioeldii are thought to be due to increasing sea surface temperatures in the winter due to climate change. Detonula confervacea and T. nordenskioeldii require cold water to bloom; due to this cold water requirement, they are only found in Narragansett Bay during the winter-spring bloom. If the seawater during the winterspring bloom becomes too warm, D. confervacea and T. nordenskioeldii will no longer be present. This behavior is observed in more recent years (Figure 3, years 2000(Figure 3, years , 2005 where cell concentrations were fewer than 100 cells per milliliter. The decrease in cell concentrations is not only a detriment to the biodiversity of the bloom, but it affects the carbon biomass of the bloom considerably. We have shown that just because a species is numerically more abundant, that species may carry less importance when carbon biomass is concerned (Figure 4). In Narragansett Bay, S. costatum (s.l.) was the most numerically abundant species for every time interval, with the exception of 1990. However, when converted to carbon concentrations, T. nordenskioeldii often surpassed S. costatum (s.l.) in carbon concentration, although it was less abundant numerically. We argue that to fully understand biomass in Narragansett Bay, phytoplankton blooms must be converted to carbon concentrations. It is not always the case that the most numerous species contributes the most carbon the bloom biomass as we have demonstrated. The winter-spring bloom in Narragansett Bay is ecologically important for benthic species. Zooplankton are not excessively abundant during the bloom and this causes a lot of the phytoplankton to sink and be preyed upon by filter feeding benthic invertebrate species. Insight into how the carbon biomass of the winter-spring bloom in Narragansett Bay has changed over time is given in Figure  5. When the five-year averages for each species are added together to yield a total carbon concentration for the winter-spring bloom, a clear general decrease in carbon concentration is observed with time. While our study is limited to just this observation, it is likely that this decrease in total carbon is due to the decrease in cell concentration of species D. confervacea and T. nordenskioeldii. These species prefer colder water than S. costatum (s.l.), and are therefore unable to thrive as climate warms. We have shown that T. nordenskioeldii contributes more carbon than S. costatum (s.l.), although it is less numerous. The disappearance of these species is having a greater impact on the carbon biomass in the winter-spring bloom. Had only cell concentrations been considered, the large contribution of these species to the carbon biomass would not have been revealed.\nHigh light conditions consistently generated greater growth rates in the 200-mL small-volume experiments, which was expected because increased light allowed for more photosynthesis to take place. As determined by cell counts, there were no differences in growth rates between developmental stages. The lack of a significant difference between the growth rates of pre-and post-auxospore cells suggest that they have a similar physiology that regulates the rate of cell division. However, since these two life history phases differ in cell size, differences may also exist that relate to cell volume, which could be investigated further. There was always a difference in growth rates generated from cell counts and from fluorescence readings; this raises the possibility of a correction factor generated in future work to compensate for the differences. This would significantly reduce the time needed to collect data, however, since cells cultured under different light levels may contain different amounts of chlorophyll, any adjustment would need to be tailored for different light conditions. Longer colonies were formed under high light conditions, which was not expected. Since there were no length differences between pre-and post-auxospore colonies, the cells most likely had a similar physiology under our experimental conditions. More work would be required to determine what differences exist or to explain why they retain a similar physiology. However, the analysis of the replicate set of data for the colony measurements is incomplete and therefore there is no statistical analysis completed to determine if the differences or lack thereof are significant. Colony lengths from the large-volume experiment of post-auxospore cells and colonies under high-and low-light conditions; measurements taken on day two were a) the number of cells in each colony, b) the length of the colony from either terminal valve, and c) the length of the colony from the tips of both terminal setae, and measurements taken on day four, d) the number of cells in each colony, e) the length of the colony from either terminal valve, and f) the length of the colony from the tips of both terminal setae.

Gray shaded cells indicate that no measurement data were collected.\n\nThe mesozooplankton community of Narragansett Bay has undergone significant changes in body size distribution over both seasonal and decadal scales. Measures of community structure (abundance, species richness, and species evenness) have also changed significantly over the last decade, and these structural changes are related to a combination of biotic and abiotic factors in the Narragansett Bay estuary environment. Linear trend lines for surface temperature were estimated for both sets of three years (dashed red lines in middle panel). The significant seasonal differences in body size distributions within both three-year periods indicate that the zooplankton community experiences seasonal shifts in composition and abundance (Table 1). The common seasonal pattern appears to be characterized by large peaks in abundance in Spring and Summer, a smaller secondary peak in the Fall, and a sharp decline in abundance during the Winter (Figure 3) This pattern may be best interpreted as a response to the phytoplankton blooms in NB. Typical temperate marine ecosystems such as NB are generally expected to feature strong Winter-Spring phytoplankton blooms, followed by a smaller and less intense Fall bloom (Cushing, 1959). Given that zooplankton abundance peaks are expected to be temporally delayed compared to the phytoplankton blooms, we would expect peaks in zooplankton during the Spring and Summer months following a Winter-Spring phytoplankton bloom, as shown in the current study (Figure 3). Establishing this consistent pattern will be useful in tracking changes in the pattern over time in NB, and may help to identify future phenological shifts in the mesozooplankton community. The significant differences between the two sets of years (2003-2006 and 2013-2016 ,  Table 1) demonstrate that in addition to the distinct seasonal patterns, there has been a major shift in mesozooplankton community composition and abundance over the last decade. In the earlier years, 2003-2006, peak zooplankton abundance occurred strongly in the Spring and Summer, with a smaller peak in the Fall (Figure 3). However, the later set of years (2013)(2014)(2015)(2016) showed overall lower abundances of mesozooplankton and a stronger peak in Fall compared to other seasons (Figure 3). Previous studies on phytoplankton in NB have identified a phenological shift and reduction in bloom magnitude over the last few decades, including a now less-dominant Winter-Spring bloom and a shorter, less intense Summer-Fall bloom (Fulweiler and Nixon, 2009;. This, in turn, appears to have affected organisms inhabiting higher trophic levels, including zooplankton, and may help to explain the reduction in the magnitude of the mesozooplankton blooms in NB over the last decade. The cause of these changes is not certain, though there is evidence to support that warming trends and climate variability may be responsible (Fulweiler and Nixon, 2009). Phenology is often sensitive to even slight changes in local environmental conditions, and therefore phenological shifts may be effective signals of climate change (Edwards and Richardson, 2004). Tracking these changes over time in both the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in NB will be important for monitoring ecosystem productivity and health, particularly considering the possible consequences of these changes for commercially important predators in higher trophic levels. In terms of the measures of biodiversity, we found that abundance, species richness, and species evenness all differed significantly between the two sets of years, supporting that the zooplankton community has undergone changes in the last decade. Both abundance and species richness have declined in the last 10 years, whereas species evenness has increased ( Table 2) Table 2). The significant changes of the community structure (abundance, richness, and evenness) may have potential impacts on trophic functions of the zooplankton community as well as the entire ecosystem, which can only be addressed by resolving composition and abundance of true biological species rather than size bins. The lack of statistical significance of overall biodiversity change over the last decade is likely due to its relatively small magnitude masked by its drastic seasonal variations. Either a lack of change or insignificant change in diversity measures may suggest that the mesozooplankton community is sufficiently diverse to help maintain ecosystem stability (Worm et al., 2006)--an intriguing hypothesis that should be specifically tested in future studies using true taxonomic species data. The results of our linear models reveal that for each set of years, both biotic and abiotic factors influence abundance and diversity. However, which factors significantly predicted these measures depended on the year set and the specific measure. In all models, biotic factors including species richness, abundance, and diversity were significant ( Table 3). The main environmental variables, however, were not consistently significant drivers of abundance or diversity across the sets of years. Surface Chlorophyll a was perhaps the most dominant environmental factor, associated with abundance and diversity for the 2003-2006 samples, but only with abundance in [2013][2014][2015][2016] (Table 3). This relationship is unsurprising given the reliance of zooplankton on phytoplankton prey, and it is reasonable to expect a tie between the significant decrease in zooplankton abundance and the seemingly decreasing trend in Chlorophyll a values in the last decade ( Figure  5). Previous studies have also observed decreasing Chlorophyll a values in NB, with a 2009 study finding a near 70% decrease in mean annual water column Chlorophyll a concentrations since 1970 (Fulweiler and Nixon, 2009), attributed to the loss of the strong Winter-Spring bloom in phytoplankton (Nixon et al., 2008). Overall, however, it appears that biotic factors more strongly drive changes in zooplankton abundance and diversity in NB. This suggests that the zooplankton community as a whole may be more resistant to environmental change than biotic changes, though these factors are undoubtedly interrelated. With further analyses of specific species, these findings will also contribute to existing literature tracking phenological shifts in plankton communities, with environmental variation as the main driver of these changes (Mackas et al., 1998;Edwards and Richardson, 2004;Costello et al., 2006a). The use of a BVPR to process zooplankton samples has proved effective and advantageous over traditional species identification methods and abundance counts using microscopy. Other studies have used Video Plankton Recorders to track changes in individual plankton species (e.g., Olson et al., 2015), but to our knowledge no previous studies have used a BVPR to analyze temporal changes in zooplankton community structure. The patterns and conclusions obtained from size distribution data could be highly valuable for the formulation of hypotheses on ecological processes and mechanisms underlying zooplankton community changes, which will be further tested through speciesbased community ecological analysis.\n\nOur results show similarities with the behavior of non-volcanic tremors related to the 1998-2001 SSE in the same area (Peterson and Christensen, 2009). First, the tremors occur at the downdip limit of the area of SSE. Second, the intensity of the tremor activity increases during the SSE and leveled off when the SSE stops. However, there are some noticeable differences. For the 1998-2001 event, tremor intensity is at its maximum in 2000, which is close to the later stage of the SSE. For the 2009-2013 event, tremor intensity is at its maximum in 2010, in the middle of the SSE. This might reflect different temporal evolution during each SSE. Also, there was a decrease of duration of tremors towards the ending of the 1998-2001 SSE, which is not observed for the 2009-2013 event. In addition, many more tremor epicenters were resolved for the 1998-2001  The GPS station ATW2 is located very close to the seismic station PMR. Thin lines represent the contour of the slab interface at depth (Li et al., 2013). event as a temporary seismic array was in the region and provide many more seismic stations. Several factors affect the robustness of identifying tremors. One factor is the noise level. High noise levels would prevent a tremor from showing up in the waveforms. The second factor occurs during the subjective visual inspection of the figures to confirm or deny the existence of tremors. Though the visual inspection follows a set of guidelines for identifying tremors, there are still cases where it is not possible to clearly distinguish a tremor from an earthquake or string of earthquakes. We discarded 95% of the tremor hours that the computer identified because they did not meet the guidelines necessary for the types of tremors important for this study. Another issue is due to the process of identifying tremors in hour sections, some potential tremors could have been excluded because they did not last long enough during each hour in order to be recorded as a possible tremor. These issues are diluted by the large number of possible tremors that arise and the consistency with identification; they are not significant to the point of incorrectly skewing results. However, more precise results could be obtained if better managed. Despite these reservations, the temporal data clearly show the connection through the observation of the tremor activity before and after 2013. With the tremor activity before 2013 three times larger than that after 2013 and the slow slip event ending at the start of 2013, the temporal relationship between the two appears very evident. We were unable to locate all identified tremors because the process requires a tremor with a clearly defined arrival time and a similar shape at the different stations. The reference envelope of the tremor has a large impact when locating tremors. The reference envelope can affect the correlation among the tremors and if the correlation from one station is not strong enough, that station is not used when locating the tremor. Many times, in years with low station coverage, the parameters of the reference envelope can determine whether or not the tremor is locatable. Wech (2016) found no temporal correlation between tremor activity and the 2009-2013 slow slip event. There are a few differences between the studies: Wech 2016used several additional stations far east of our study region, and therefore found a lot more tremors on the west of our study area. We don't miss events that occurred within the circle. For events initiated outside, the time delay is only 1-2 minutes. So if the tremors were large enough, we see them in our method. Wech's method is more complex and sophisticated and ours is straightforward and simple. We focus on tremors that last more than 3 minutes and Wech might see more short tremors.\n\n"}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This study documented the seasonal and annual mean winds and circulation of the southern New England coastal shelf. Research of this region will continue through the study of how anomalous intrusions of the Gulf Stream impact the circulation of the southern New England coastal shelf in the region of the intrusion and regions removed from the intrusion.\nWhen making estimates of cellular carbon from cell volume in the diatom S. costatum (s.l.), it is best to use a species-specific relationship. While it is important and insightful to understand cell concentrations of the winter-spring bloom in Narragansett Bay, carbon conversions are necessary to fully understand the biomass characteristics of the bloom.\nThe measurement of body length distributions is an effective way to assess changes in zooplankton community composition over multiple time scales. Driven by both biological and abiotic (environmental) factors, the mesozooplankton community of Narragansett Bay has undergone significant changes over seasonal, yearly, and decadal scales, with abundance and species richness dramatically decreasing, and species evenness slightly increasing in the last decade.\nThere is a higher proportion of female summer flounder inshore than offshore; therefore, the offshore sex ratios, including those gathered through federal trawl surveys, are not reflective of inshore sex ratios. Males do not migrate inshore later than females, as shown by the consistent sex ratios between months of this study. The summer flounder are eating a varied diet that likely reflects local prey species abundances, but they do not appear to be consuming any commercially important species with populations in poor health in Rhode Island waters.\nOur study confirms the occurrence of nonvolcanic tremors associated with the 2009-2013 slow slip event in south central Alaska. The SSE has no effect on the duration or location of the tremors. Seasonal variations in tremor activity with a peak in summer have been observed and are likely related to the hydrological loading in this region.\nSinking microfibers were quantified in the water column for the first time. Sinking rates determined through theory, laboratory experiments, and field observations average 12 \u00b1 15, 16 \u00b1 4, and 2.4 \u00b1 2.3 m day -1 , respectively. Further studies regarding regional composition, distribution, and refining of sinking rate models are suggested in addition to those regarding biological and ecological effects. heterotrophic protists. It is important to quantify protistan-copepod relationships in order to include them in computer-based oceanic models to more accurately predict how changes in the ocean affect carbon cycling and population dynamics. In the present study, we tested the consequences of copepod excretions on the growth and ingestion of Oxyrrhis marina as a function of concentration of their prey, Isochrysis galbana. Oxyrrhis marina, a singlecelled heterotrophic dinoflagellate, is known to react to various environmental chemical cues and has been observed exhibiting chemotaxis, a physical response to changes in chemical abundance (Martel, 2006;Boakes 2011). Chemotaxis is often seen as a positive response to the presence of prey, guiding O. marina in its grazing (Martel, 2010;Roberts et al., 2011). However, O. marina exposed to saturating amounts of nitrogen-stressed I. galbana exhibit cannibalism as opposed to feeding on the microalga (Martel, 2006;Roberts et al., 2010). Based on the negative chemotaxis seen from O. marina in response to N-saturated I. galbana, we hypothesize that O. marina exhibits negative chemotaxis when exposed to high levels of ammonium, the excretory product of their predators."}, {"section_title": "Cellular carbon estimates.", "text": "Carbon is an essential element for the functionality of every living organism, and therefore of utmost importance to understand how it moves through a biological system from its original assimilation to its release. Being able to quantify how much carbon biomass is available in primary producers to be consumed by grazers has serious implications for the overall understanding of the carrying capacity of the system. Phytoplankton obtain carbon from the water in the form of carbon dioxide and turn it into organic carbon through photosynthesis. Largescale measuring of the organic cellular carbon for each species of phytoplankton is an impossible task, which is why researchers must estimate cellular carbon from a given parameter, cell volume. Previous work suggests that the best way to estimate cellular carbon in phytoplankton is by correlating it with a more easily measured parameter: cell volume. However, morphological differences between types of phytoplankton can contribute to error when estimating carbon content. A diatom has a fundamentally different shape from that of a dinoflagellate, and the amount of carbon needed for a diatom to function may be more or less than a dinoflagellate. This discrepancy is precisely what researchers found when developing equations to estimate carbon content for all types of phytoplankton in general (Strathman 1967), and the carbon content specifically in diatoms (Strathman 1967, Montagnes and Franklin 2001, Menden-Deuer and Lessard 2000. A key finding of Strathman (1967) was that for a given cell volume, diatoms would always have a lesser cellular carbon content than other phytoplankton. Although the trend between cell volume and cellular carbon for all diatoms is strong in many cases, there are reasons to question whether or not certain species of diatom do not follow the trend as well as others. Just as estimates of carbon for all diatoms diverged from the estimates for all phytoplankton, could it be that key species of diatoms do not fit the prescribed relationship for all diatoms? Diatoms are a diverse group of phytoplankton with a large size distribution amongst species, their size distribution has a range of nine orders of magnitude (Litchman et al. 2008); this could affect the relative amount of carbon needed for a cell of a particular species to function. Skeletonema costatum (s.l.) is one of the most abundant species in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, accounting for 60 percent of all diatom species in the bay (Smayda, pers. comm). Due to its great abundance, it is important to fully and accurately understand how S. costatum (s.l.) contributes to the overall biomass of the bay with respect to carbon. For this reason, the first aim of this study was to determine if the cell carbon-cell volume trend in S. costatum (s.l.) diverged from the trend in all diatoms, and if so, what mathematical relationship can define that trend."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of bloom seasonality.", "text": "In mid-temperate latitudes, phytoplankton blooms, depending on the time of the year experience limited growth due to lack of light or nutrients, or physical conditions such as changing temperatures. This creates a seasonality of the blooms in a given area, which can be comprised of specific species of phytoplankton. The seasonality of the blooms creates somewhat consistently expected conditions from one year to the next. Bloom seasonality, and the phytoplankton community structure of that bloom can affect the available biomass in a given system, especially if that system is changing. The winter-spring (December of previous year -April) bloom in Narragansett Bay has historically contained three key species of diatoms, Skeletonema costatum (s.l.), Detonula confervacea, and Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii (Smayda 1973). Whereas S. costatum (s.l.) is a eurythermal species, tolerating both warm and cold waters allowing it to bloom throughout the year, D. confervacea and T. nordenskioeldii are strictly cold water species (Durbin 1978) and are the main constituents of the winter-spring bloom in Narragansett Bay but begin to disappear as the water becomes warmer. As global climate begins to warm, thermal boundaries are being pushed increasingly northwards. Species have begun to migrate farther north in pursuit of conditions favorable to their physiological function (Beaugrand et al. 2009). It is hypothesized that phytoplankton are not the exception to the rule, and the historic latitudinal boundaries of their distribution are being altered due to increases in sea surface temperatures. Due to the cold-water requirements of two of the main winter-spring bloom species, D. confervacea and T. nordenskioeldii, the consistent seasonality of the winter-spring bloom in Narragansett Bay is hypothesized to have altered. Traditionally, blooms are analyzed with respect to the abundance or concentration of cells of each species in the bloom. This gives a general idea of which species are in bloom and their relative cell abundances. However, if an accurate measure of biomass is to be obtained, we argue that it is more accurate to convert cellular concentrations to carbon concentrations. Different species of phytoplankton, due to disparities in size or function, may require more or less carbon than the other species in the bloom. While knowing how many cells of each species are present has its value, when looking at biomass, it is better to know how each species contributes to the bloom with respect to carbon. Accordingly, the second aim of this project was to determine if the species that comprise the winter-spring bloom in Narragansett Bay have changed cellular concentrations over a 50-year time period, and to convert cellular concentrations to carbon concentrations to see how it affects carbon biomass representation."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "\nThe sUAS's Initial tests were conducted using two different sUAS's.

Samples were collected at the surface in 5-L Niskin bottles. Various physical conditions, including temperature, salinity, light penetration, and nutrients, were also recorded at the time of sampling.

Edwards. 2009 Algal blooms are caused when an excess of a limiting nutrient enters a body of water. This is most commonly associated with excess fertilizers from farms running off into a water system (Anderson et al., 2002). Some of these blooms are made up of cyanobacteria, which produce cyanotoxins. These cyanotoxins have been shown to be dangerous to animals through both contact and ingestion (Briand et al., 2003). These blooms are often call harmful algal blooms or HABs. It is important to be able to monitor a HAB in order to determine how dangerous it is and where the toxic levels are highest. Generally, this consists of collecting water samples which are later taken to a lab to be analyzed. This often takes a few days, which leads to problems. Given that HABs are complex and dynamic systems, their distribution and intensity are likely to change over time. Limited sampling which may not include the entire body of water makes predication difficult. In other words, one only understands how part of the HAB was a few days ago, thus predicting any changes is unlikely to be accurate (Merwe and Price, 2015). Alternative monitoring methods have been tried, but have run into their own complications. One such alternative is the use of helicopters or planes to take images of HABs to monitor algae concentrations, but the cost of fuel is a deterrent. Another method is using satellite imagery to take images of HABs. This can also be expensive and if the orbit does not line up perfectly, getting repeated images of a site may be difficult (Pozo et al., 2014). The goal of this project is to investigate the possible use of autonomous vehicles to monitor HABs. This comes in two parts, the first of which involves an autonomous kayak to collect water samples from throughout the entire body of water, along with several sensors to assess water conditions. The kayak is paired with a second vehicle, the primary focus of this study, a small unmanned aircraft system, or sUAS, which takes images in the infrared and specific visible spectra of light to create a normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI. A NDVI is an index known to highly correlate with biomass in plants and cyanobacteria (Merwe and Price, 2015). This can provide three advantages for monitoring. One, combining the sampling data from the kayak and the images from the sUAS of the entire body of water, gives a much more complete view of the HAB than traditional methods. Two, NDVI images can be processed faster than samples can be analyzed. While sampling data are still important, these images can help provide management with quick first response data. Three, an sUAS does not disturb the bloom, as it makes no contact with the water surface and flies high enough that any force from the props is minimal by the time it gets to the surface.\n"}, {"section_title": "The cameras", "text": "For the initial tests, two different camera rigs were used.

These indices were made into one mosaic image using either Agisoft or DroneDeploy. For the MAPIRs, the images were run through a MATLAB program that creates either NDVI or GNDVI images. These images were then mosaicked using either Agisoft or DroneDeploy."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Due to the nature of this project a HAB was required for sampling.

Intraspecific morphological variation is common and is caused by a variety of factors including response to environmental conditions. Recent advances in holography performed in situ demonstrate that orientation of diatom colonies in the water column may vary under different hydrographic conditions. The physical conditions that lead to horizontal particle orientation are most commonly observed near the pycnocline, where light levels are lower than near the surface. Chain-forming diatoms may regulate the length of their colonies, which alters their entrainment in flow and thus their physical orientation, thereby increasing the area for light absorption. We hypothesize that diatoms form longer colonies under low light conditions. Chaetoceros physiologically regulate their colony length, and complete, unbroken colonies are easy to distinguish by their specialized hair-like terminal setae, which are very distinct in C. constrictus. We cultured C. constrictus at high (~115-160 \u00b5mol photons m 2 sec -1 ) and low (~30-55 \u00b5mol photons m 2 sec -1 ) light intensities at cell/colony concentrations representative of those found in nature. Cell fluorescence was measured daily, and photomicrographs were analyzed for colony length. Differences in growth rates between different developmental stages were not significant, but growth rates obtained from cell counts were different from those generated from fluorescence readings. Growth rates were greater under high light conditions than low light conditions. Preliminary analyses of length frequency data suggest that longer colonies form in high light, however analyses are still in progress. Phytoplankton are photosynthetic protists present in nearly all aqueous environments. They are responsible for about half of the earth's total net primary production (Field et al. 1998). Diatoms are a widespread and abundant group of phytoplankton that form their cell walls from silica. Although diatoms are single celled organisms, many employ diverse strategies including mucus pads (e.g. Asterionellopsis), mechanically interlocking spines/hooks (e.g. Rhizosolenia and Cerataulina), chitan threads (e.g. Thalassiosira), and fusion of silica (e.g. Chaetoceros and Bacteriastrum) in order to form colonies of cells, which may increase particle size by several orders of magnitude. The ecological role(s) of complex morphology has fascinated scientists for more than a century (Gran 1912;Sournia 1982), but insight has remained elusive. Kociolek and Stoermer (2010) note that there is a host of factors that can affect diatom morphology, from developmental and genetic to environmental factors. However, although many environmental factors including temperature, salinity, silica concentration, seasonality, pH were reviewed, there was no discussion of light. It is well known that light impacts the growth rate of diatoms, but little investigation has been carried out to determine what impact, if any, light has on diatom morphology. Light intensity decreases with depth in the water column, therefore low light situations occur naturally in areas like the pycnocline, decreasing the potential for photosynthesis. In this region, it is not uncommon for horizontal flow or shear to entrain colonial diatoms, gently pulling them into a horizontal orientation. Indeed, recent in situ observations using holographic instruments have shown that diatom colonies are often oriented horizontally as opposed to randomly in the water column (Malkiel et al. 1999;McFarland et al. 2016;Nayak et al. 2016;Nayak et al. in prep). Horizontal orientation would expose more cell/colony area to incident light, increasing its photosynthetic potential. Under these circumstances, longer colonies would be more easily captured in a horizontal flow and would extend the area (or \"footprint\") of a single colony and reduce the area available for competitors. Longer colonies would be favored under these specific environmental conditions. If longer colony length enhances entrainment in anisotropic shear flow, resulting in horizontal orientation and increased photosynthetic potential, diatoms might regulate their colony length to take ecological advantage of this phenomenon. In this study, we ask whether longer colonies are formed when growth is light limited. One challenge in conducting this type of experiment is determining whether the measured colony lengths are a function of growth in the experimental conditions, or of bias (i.e. breakage) resulting from the subsampling and handling necessary to make the measurements. Therefore, we selected an experimental diatom in which physiologically regulated colonies are visually recognizable, thus intact vs. broken colonies can be easily distinguished. Chaetoceros are chain-forming diatoms with differentiated cells. They have specialized, elongated and hollow projections made of silica called setae that are formed as the cell divides (Rines and Hargraves 1988). Setae form first as protrusions in the corners of the cell after the girdle bands have recently separated. In intercalary cells, or cells that are not at either end of the colony, adjacent setae are fused near their bases, holding cells together into chains (Pickett-Heaps 1998a; Pickett-Heaps 1998b). This is not the case in terminal setae, which occur in terminal cells. They are not fused, and thus act as colony separation valves, allowing a colony to divide in two. The frequency of formation of terminal valves/setae thus regulates the number of cells per colony in this genus. The setae that form from the terminal valves are more distinct than those formed within the colony, especially in C. constrictus. This makes Chaetoceros ideal taxa to work with for our purposes since it allows us to differentiate between colonies broken due to handling or excessive turbulence and physiologically regulated colonies, in other words, complete, unbroken colonies whose morphology reflects growth in the experimental conditions. Lab grown cultures are typically much denser than what is found in nature, even in a typical season (Rines 1985; Rines and Hargraves 1987; Rines unpublished). Observations from preliminary experiments have shown that diatoms form better morphologies in these lower densities. Likewise, in order to truly understand what affects diatom morphology, we want to replicate natural conditions as much as possible in our cultures. We first conducted a small-scale (200-mL flasks) preliminary experiment, and used these results to guide a second, large-volume (10-L tanks) experiment. Here, we compare the effects of light on two different developmental stages in the diatom life cycle, before and after auxospore formation. In addition, we determined whether differences exist in data collection methods for generating growth rates. Lastly, we determined if there are any morphological or growth rate differences in light treatments or high light and low light conditions. For our large-volume experiment, we compare morphologies and growth rates between two light treatments, high and low. We hypothesize that longer colonies form in low light conditions.\nThe nitrogen cycle plays a key role in the biological productivity of the ocean. Phytoplankton growth is limited by the amount of bioavailable nitrogen. The bioavailable nitrogen budget depends on a balance between input through nitrogen fixation and output through denitrification and the budget appears to be balanced on a global scale. The Indian Ocean has a nitrogen deficit that may be created by excess denitrification, whereas the majority of the Atlantic Ocean has a nitrogen surplus due to excess nitrogen fixation. The South Atlantic Ocean has a small nitrogen deficit with an unclear source. The Agulhas Current delivers water from the Indian Ocean to the South Atlantic Ocean through eddies and these eddies may carry nitrogen deficient water into the South Atlantic Ocean from the Indian Ocean, linking the nitrogen cycles of the two oceans. Denitrification imparts an isotopic signature on a water mass, which is ultimately transferred to sediment on the sea floor. Anticipating that the water mass would be the most important source of the isotopic signature in the sediment, we measured 15 N to 14 N ratios in the bulk sediment through cores from three sites along the Agulhas flow path. The trends in these signals were inconsistent between sites, indicating that N isotope ratio in sediment likely results from a combination of factors for each site. The results do not directly reflect the movement of denitrified water masses from the Indian to South Atlantic Oceans and exemplify the complexity of nitrogen cycle connectivity along the Agulhas Current. \nCharacterized by their immense biodiversity, zooplankton are essential members of the Narragansett Bay (NB) estuarine system, facilitating bottom-up energy transfer from primary producers and thus supporting fishery production. Over the past decades, NB has been subject to strong impacts of climate change and anthropogenic exploitation. Whether and/or how the zooplankton community has undergone ecological changes in response to the environment remains unknown, but may have serious impacts on productivity and fishery health. Here we examined temporal changes in the composition and abundance of the NB zooplankton community at monthly, seasonal, yearly and decadal time scales, using 72 monthly samples for two sets of three consecutive years (2003-2006 and 2013-2016) from the Narragansett Bay Long-Term Plankton Monitoring program. With a Benchtop Video Plankton Recorder, we recorded and characterized zooplankton community composition and abundance from body size and its frequency distribution. Analyses focused on mesozooplankton (200-2000 \u03bcm), which were found to be a dominant size group of the common zooplankton in NB. We identified significant changes in the mesozooplankton community on seasonal and decadal scales, with a strong seasonality in abundance and body size distribution. In addition, abundance and richness of compositional size groups have dramatically decreased, whereas species evenness has slightly increased in the last decade. These changes are significantly associated with a combination of biotic (abundance, species richness, diversity, Chlorophyll a) and abiotic factors (surface temperature, salinity). As the environment of NB continues to change over time, it will become increasingly important to the ecosystem as a whole to monitor changes in zooplankton community structure and biodiversity, which play key roles in marine ecosystem resilience, stability, and overall health. Environmental change has the capacity to dramatically affect not only the physical environment, but also the dynamics of an ecosystem as a whole. While there exists a considerable body of work examining the effects of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems, the effects on marine ecosystems are not well understood (Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno, 2010). For many ecosystems, both marine and terrestrial, one of the most significant consequences of climate change is the loss of biodiversity (Hooper et al., 2005;Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno, 2010), the maintenance of which has been known to be critical to the functional dynamics of an ecosystem (Hooper et al., 2005;Balvanera et al., 2006;Stachowicz et al., 2007;Cardinale et al., 2012). For example, biodiversity enhances ecosystem stability, defined as \"the ability to withstand recurrent perturbations\" (Worm et al., 2006). Marine systems with higher species richness are more stable, and commercially important fish and invertebrates show lower rates of extinction and collapse over time in these species-rich environments (Worm et al., 2006). High species diversity also promotes faster recovery from perturbations, perhaps due to the ability of predators to switch prey species if necessary, allowing the perturbed prey populations to recover (Worm et al., 2006;Stachowicz et al., 2007). Losses in biodiversity can therefore have significant negative effects on the structural and functional dynamics of ecosystem as a whole (Cardinale et al., 2012). Narragansett Bay (NB) is among the most productive estuaries in the United States, playing important ecological and socioeconomic roles in surrounding states. For example, commercial fisheries based out of Rhode Island landed more than 34,000 metric tons in 2007, valued at approximately $77 million (RIDEM, 2008). However, the NB estuarine system has been experiencing evident climate change and anthropogenic stressors over the last few decades, including a rise in water temperature of 1.2\u00b0C since 1950 (Smith et al., 2010), intermittent hypoxic events (Codiga et al., 2009), and a historical rise and recent fall of nutrient loading (Nixon et al., 2008). These environmental changes, particularly increases in seawater temperature, have reportedly led to system-wide structural changes in NB, including shifts from vertebrate to invertebrate and benthic to pelagic species (Collie et al., 2008), as well as a sharp decline in the abundance of boreal species such as the winter flounder over the past decades (Oviatt et al., 2003). Such evidence of change in large, nektonic species has raised concerns regarding the stability and health of the NB system, prompting us to examine it thoroughly in order to gain a full understanding of environmental impacts on NB and the community response, specifically through the lens of the marine zooplankton community. Zooplankton are essential members of marine communities, often consisting of a diverse range of marine organisms, from unicellular protozoans, to multi-cellular invertebrates and vertebrate larval fish (Lalli and Parsons, 1997). Within a typical temperate estuary such as NB, zooplankton play a pivotal role in regulating primary production and transferring energy from primary producers to higher-level predators (Vald\u00e9s et al., 2004;Richardson, 2008). For example, the growth and development of zooplankton predators such as menhaden in NB is highly related to the zooplankton community composition and size distribution within the bay (Durbin and Durbin, 1998). Compared to vertebrate animals, invertebratedominated zooplankton are more susceptible to environmentally-induced physiological and community changes due to their short generation times, enormous population sizes, and lack of commercial exploitation by humans (Richardson, 2008). As a result, zooplankton are expected to be useful \"beacons of climate change\" and the effects of environmental change on an ecosystem may be examined via changes in their community composition, abundance, and diversity (Richardson, 2008). Specific zooplankton species in Narragansett Bay have already begun to show responses to local environmental change. Phenological shifts of abundance are one of the most conspicuous among the changes occurring in plankton communities, with environmental variation being the main driver (Machas et al., 1998;Sullivan et al., 2001;Edwards and Richardson, 2004;Costello et al., 2006a, b;Sullivan et al., 2007). For example, warmer temperatures are believed to have facilitated a shift in peak occurrence of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi (a planktivore) by approximately 2 months earlier than the previous annual mean (Sullivan et al., 2001) and an earlier spring population increase in the copepod Acartia hudsonica, though there were no changes in the appearance or abundance of the copepod A. tonsa (Sullivan et al., 2007). Although these species-specific shifts have been identified and documented, few studies have examined how the zooplankton community composition as a whole has responded to climate change in NB. Within the community, not all ctenophore or copepod species have appeared to follow the same changing pattern, suggesting species-specific responses may not be assessed additively for a picture of the whole community. Rather, it is evident that community-wide responses may be complicated by complex interactions among species. In NB, the phenological shift of peak ctenophore abundance has led A. hudsonica to outnumber A. tonsa within copepod communities, and may have unprecedented long-term impacts on the trophic structure of the entire zooplankton community (Sullivan et al., 2007). Thus, it is important to investigate patterns of zooplankton responses at the community level, and gain insights into their underlying processes and mechanisms. In this study, we sought to identify whether the zooplankton community of NB has changed over time, and if it has, what environmental factors may be driving this change. To attain this goal, we examined historical, preserved zooplankton samples from the Narragansett Bay Long Term Plankton Monitoring Program (NB-LTPMP, http://www.gso.uri.edu/phytoplankton/, August 2016). Instead of using the traditional and time-consuming taxonomy-based approach, we employed a rapid body sizebased approach to characterize the zooplankton community. Using a Benchtop Video Plankton Recorder (BVPR), we recorded images of zooplankton individuals in a community sample and retrieved their body sizes through image analysis. Frequency distributions of zooplankton body sizes, equivalent to species composition and abundance, were compared among community samples to search for patterns of zooplankton community change in relation to environmental changes within NB. The ability to process many samples very quickly allows for the exploration of wider temporal trends, as well as the analysis of community-wide changes. By using body size distributions as a proxy for community composition, we are able to view and analyze changes in the zooplankton community over multiple time scales. More importantly, this method is highly promising for potential future use in real-time monitoring of zooplankton community change in response to changing environmental conditions.\nSummer flounder, Paralichthys dentatus, is an aggressive predator and the most commercially-important finfish in Rhode Island. Accordingly, a long-term increase in abundance documented in Narragansett Bay may prove both economically beneficial and detrimental to resident fish populations. In addition to ecological concerns, management of summer flounder is complicated by sexual dimorphism; females grow larger and faster than males. This dimorphism, when coupled with previous evidence of spatial sex-segregation, increases the risk of disproportionate removal of females via fishing. Specimens were collected on the University of Rhode Island weekly fish trawl and Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management monthly fish survey to determine the role of summer flounder in the local ecosystem and elucidate the nearshore sex-driven population dynamics. Individuals were dissected and sexed based on visual inspection of the gonads. The stomach was then removed and classified as full or empty, and its contents identified to the lowest taxonomic level and weighed. Crangon shrimp (Crangon septemspinosa), squid (Doryteuthis pealeii), and scup (Stenotomus chrysops) were important components in the summer flounder diet. As total length increased, the probability that an individual was female also increased; of the 65 fish collected that were legal for recreational harvest, 63 were female. Additionally, a higher percentage of females was found in shallow inshore waters than deeper offshore areas. These results suggest that implementing a slottrophy limit on the recreational fishery and restricting inshore commercial harvest would account for the sex-based population dynamics and better protect the spawning stock biomass from future overexploitation. Significant increases in sea surface temperature and sea level due to climate change are occurring throughout the world's oceans. These impacts are particularly significant in the North Atlantic, where surface water temperatures are increasing at more than twice the rate of the global average (Levitus et al., 2005;Smith et al., 2010). From 1959-2016 the average winter-spring surface temperature in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island has increased by approximately 2\u00b0C (Collie et al., 2008;Collie, 2016). Shifts in species distribution and composition in response to climate change have been well documented (Bell et al., 2014b;Collie et al., 2008;Murawski 1993). The mean temperature preference -defined as the midpoint of the range of acceptable temperatures of each species weighted by the mean abundance -of Narragansett Bay organisms increased by 2\u00b0C from 1959-2005, resulting in seasonal migrants superseding resident species (Collie et al., 2008). One such dominant seasonal species is summer flounder, Paralichthys dentatus, which exhibits annual inshore-offshore seasonal migrations, migrating inshore as the water temperatures increase in the spring/summer and returning offshore in the fall (Murawski 1993;Wuenschel et al., 2013). Summer flounder are the most profitable finfish in the state of Rhode Island, with over 2 million pounds of landings worth over 7 million dollars in 2014 (National Marine Fisheries Service, 2016). Although fishing pressure in the 1980s caused the summer flounder population to decline, implementation of stricter regulations in the 1990's has since allowed the population to recover and increase (Bell et al., 2014a;Bell et al., 2014b). While summer flounder have always been common in Narragansett Bay (Collie et al., 2008), the attenuation of harvest pressure and lengthening residence times linked to rising temperatures have resulted in an all-time high abundance that necessitates further understanding of their role in the local ecosystem by fishery managers. In order to elucidate these potential impacts, the diet of summer flounder in nearshore Rhode Island waters needs to be characterized to identify resident species that they frequently predate. Further, as the abundance of summer flounder increases, so will the incentive to increase fishing pressure. However, this species exhibits several sex-based population characteristics that may complicate management of the fishery. Summer flounder are sexually dimorphic; the females grow larger and faster, with sexual differentiation beginning at 6-12 cm (King et al., 2001). In addition, males have a higher natural mortality rate than females (Maunder and Wong, 2011). Moreover, a study conducted by Morson et al. (2012) found that there was a significant relationship between the sex ratio and the port at which summer flounder were collected, suggesting the potential for spatial sexual segregation. Together, these findings suggest there is a significant risk of disproportionate removal of female spawning stock biomass through fishing. Such concerns were validated in New Jersey in 2009 and 2010, as the recreational catch was predominantly female (Morson et al., 2012). These characteristics therefore suggest that to properly manage the summer flounder population in Narragansett Bay, the sex-based population dynamics of the local stock also need to be studied. For a species that is so commercially important all along the east coast (National Marine Fisheries Service, 2016), there is a paucity of information on its sex-specific population dynamics. For example, it is not known whether the male summer flounder migrate inshore later than the females, thereby shifting the sex ratios of the inshore population throughout the season. Additionally, studies have not been conducted to evaluate the theory that females eat more often than males, and thus are more vulnerable to the recreational hook-and-line fishery, skewing the data used in the stock assessment (Morson et al., 2012;Northeast Fisheries Science Center, 2013). Finally because federal trawl surveys are conducted far offshore, the sex composition of the nearshore population remains an enigma (Northeast Fisheries Science Center, 2013). The present study aims to use continuous trawl surveys in Rhode Island waters to better inform management in these specific areas of uncertainty.\nWhile the abundance of microfibers (< 5 mm) in coastal and deep-sea sediments is well documented, the flux and sinking speed of these particles within the water column remain unknown. In June 2016, the water column abundance and vertical flux profile of microfibers were examined using Niskin bottle collection and a vertical array of surface-tethered sediment traps (STSTs, spanning 60 to 200 m) on the R/V Endeavor at the continental shelf break south of Rhode Island (40\u00b0N, 71\u00b0W). Fibers were extracted and analyzed on a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer to determine the type of materials present, namely polyester and cotton. A total of 178 fibers averaging 1100 \u00b1 1000 \u03bcm long and 11 \u00b1 7 \u03bcm wide were imaged and quantified. Sinking rates (Ws) of the fibers were estimated through three independent approaches. The observed sediment tube flux divided by the water column concentration yielded W s, field = 2.4 \u00b1 2.3 m day -1 , whereas settling chamber observations gave W s, lab = 16 \u00b1 4 m day -1 . These results were compared to the theoretical Stokes sinking speed for cylindrical particles W s, theory = 12 \u00b1 15 m day -1 . In general, the field-based approach indicated roughly 8x slower sinking speeds than those observed in the lab or predicted by theory. To our knowledge, this is the first study that attempts to quantify and compare in situ sinking rates with laboratory and theoretical approaches to understand the fate of microfibers in the ocean. Plastics have permeated today's society through electronics, packaging, and synthetic clothing. Moreover, they have infiltrated today's water systems. Plastics have been observed in rivers (Casta\u00f1eda et al., 2014;Wagner et al., 2014), lakes (Imhof et al., 2013;Free et al., 2014), arctic sea ice (Obbard et al., 2014), surface oceans (Law et al., 2010;Collignon et al., 2012;Reisser et al., 2013;Eriksen et al., 2014), and in ocean floor sediments (Van Cauwenberghe et al., 2013;Woodall et al., 2014;Fischer et al., 2015). While larger plastic debris such as discarded water bottles and stray fishing nets dominate the focus of the general populace and is addressed through beach cleanups, the study of microplastics (< 5 mm) ( Barnes et al., 2009) has been increasing in the scientific community since the turn of the millennium (Thompson et al., 2004;Wagner et al., 2014). Microfibers, including a subset of microplastics as well as other synthetic and organic materials, have only begun to be quantified in the marine environment within the last five years (Goldberg, 1997;Browne et al., 2011). Implications of microfibers in the marine environment are not fully known since the field is still developing, but studies are presently underway to determine the nature of these effects. Adsorption of hydrophobic pollutants is known to occur in marine plastics (Lee et al., 2014), and studies have shown marine plastics have the ability to transport foreign contaminants to benthic communities, due to pollutant transfer from particle to pore water, becoming available for ingestion by benthic infauna (Graham and Thompson, 2009). This transport mechanism has the potential to increase the number of ecosystems impacted by point source contamination, such as oil spills and harmful algal blooms, to include those otherwise thought to be unaffected. In addition to chemical transport, invasive species can spread by using plastic as a substrate (Barnes, 2002). Laboratory studies have observed a wide range of biological effects from plastic interaction including lowered cellular chlorophyll concentrations and growth rates in the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus (Besseling et al., 2014), no observed feeding or developmental effects in the larvae of oyster Crassostrea gigas (Cole and Galloway, 2015), severe developmental defects in the embryos of sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus (Della Torre et al., 2014), and reduction in both body size and reproduction rate in the crustacean Daphnia magna (Besseling et al., 2014). The trophic level transfer of microplastics has been observed through the ingestion of the mussel Mytilus edulis by the crab Carcinus maenas (Farrell and Nelson, 2013). Further long-term studies on trophic level transfer of these particles are needed to comprehend any risk of bio-magnification of hydrophobic contaminants (Teuten et al., 2007). Ingested plastics have been observed to alter the ballast of fecal pellets (Cole et al., 2016) and phytoplankton aggregates (Long et al., 2015). Sinking rates are either enhanced with plastic densities greater than that of the surrounding material or reduced with those less dense. Whether this phenomenon benefits or hinders the carbon cycle and sequestration is currently unknown. While a potential for harm is established, fibers taken from the marine environment have the potential to act as passive samplers for pollutants present in locations where larger passive sampling techniques are not viable. Ultimately, the plastics reach the benthos where it has been suggested by Goldberg (1997) that the gas exchange between sea water and pore water has the potential to be disrupted due to smothering, resulting in anoxia and hypoxia, theoretically disrupting other water-sediment interactions such as oceanic nutrient cycling (Klump and Martens, 1981). Whereas general microplastics have a variety of sources including industrial spills of pre-production plastic pellets (Moore et al., 2001), use of cosmetic products (Fendall and Sewell, 2009), and fragmentation of existent marine macroplastics (> 5 mm) (Andrady et al., 1998), it is currently understood that microfibers originate from laundry effluent (Browne et al., 2011). This residential contribution to marine debris is made possible by microfibers shedding from clothing and passing through filters in the waste water treatment process (Browne et al., 2011). It is generally assumed that plastics float, and therefore remain in the surface oceans and filtered out on beaches, but global studies have proven otherwise (Table 1). While the presence of microplastics in coastal and deepsea sediments have been studied extensively, the water column has not been surveyed for the flux of sinking particles (Woodall et al., 2014). Some laboratory methods suggest that fibers settle after incorporation into phytoplankton aggregates due to biofouling and turbulence (Long et al., 2015), and marine snow due to ingestion (Cole et al., 2013(Cole et al., , 2016. Previous studies performed by Alldredge and Silver (1988) have found marine snow sinking rates to range between 1 -168 m day -1 . Known densities of fibers found in deepsea sediments (Table 2) are greater than that in seawater, offering that the fibers sink individually. Factors such as biofouling and the compressibility of the fibers introduce potentials of variance of sinking rate with depth, as biofouling may fluctuate due to grazing, and compressible fibers effectively increase in density as the water pressure rises. Sedimentation of the fibers would vary depending on the sinking rate, with higher sinking rates depositing fibers closer to the shoreline on the continental shelf or slope than fibers with slower sinking rates, which would reach farther on the abyssal plain (Figure 1). Models suggest that further transport is possible within submarine canyons due to shear force movement and resuspension (Ballent et al., 2013). Here, three approaches to calculating the sinking rate (W s ) of microfibers collected during June 2016 in the water column of the continental shelf break south of Rhode Island (40\u00b0N, 71\u00b0W) are presented: theoretical, laboratory-based, and field-based. This first look at how dense microfibers are reaching deep-sea sediments was achieved through the use of polyacrylamide-gel-tube sediment traps deployed for a drift period of three and a half days. Further analysis of collected fibers included the use of microscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry, and the image-recognition software ImageJ. Table 2.

An inoculum culture of clone B6b was grown for four days, and its concentration determined by two replicate cell counts. We used the B6b post-auxospore clone because in the small-volume experiment we determined that the smaller pre-auxospore colonies were too challenging to quantify.

In fact, the growth rates for the low light treatment were so low that cells would be expected to divide only once every 8 days -two times the duration of our experiment (Table 2). This very low growth rate could also indicate that very few (if any) cells divided at all, but rather, the amount chlorophyll per cell increased to compensate for the very low light conditions (Geider 1987). This means that the morphologies in the low-light treatments are likely representative of the morphologies of the inoculum culture, which was grown under high light for three to four days, and do not represent growth under the low light experimental condition. As in the 200-mL flask experiment, longer colonies were also seen in the high light treatment in the large volume-(10L) experiment. Over time, colonies grew shorter in both light regimes. Even though these results seem to directly contradict our hypothesis, after analyzing the growth rate data for the low light experiment and realizing that the colonies were unable to grow sufficiently, we are unable to completely reject our initial hypothesis. In addition, data analysis and the accompanying statistical analysis are incomplete, which has prevented us from doing a statistical test to determine if any differences are significant. However, the decreasing cell length over time raises intriguing points. The density of the colonies in the high light regimes undoubtedly increased significantly, and corresponds with the reduction in colony length, which leads us to ask whether the two factors are related and what might regulate this interaction. Even though we were able to create a gentle turbulence, we were unable to create a horizontal orientation, which was a significant part of our hypothesis and may affect the colonies differently. It is also possible that light intensity is not the factor which regulates the frequency of terminal valve formation (and thus colony length) in Chaetoceros, or that it is affected by a multitude of factors."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The tantalizing but preliminary evidence from both experiments suggest that light may very well impact diatom morphology.

Wind also has a significant effect on dissolved oxygen concentration. Existing data were used from long-term NOAA tide gauge and co-located wind, medium-and short-term National Park Service (NPS) water level gauges, Remote Automated Weather System (RAWS) wind, and dissolved oxygen from NPS Inventory & Monitoring and ASIS sources. Statistical models were developed using RStudio to best estimate water level based on weather at Buntings Bridge and Ocean City, MD. Wind speed and direction were investigated but speed was found not to be significant. The model was then used to estimate the component of water level due to wind direction. Based on the model, wind direction can cause a change in water level of 0.14 m, which is 22.9% of the tidal range. West winds are correlated to the highest water levels whereas eastsoutheast winds are correlated to the lowest levels, likely due to the shape of the basin. The dominant spring and summer wind is from the south-south west, which also increases water level. A model was developed to estimate the component of dissolved oxygen concentration based on wind. Westerly winds cause a decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration. Wind direction affects dissolved oxygen concentration, limiting organism access to oxygen. Wind direction also affects water level, altering inundation and affecting vegetation zonation, based on species inundation tolerance. Tides are the primary driver behind salt marsh inundation and nutrient loading is a large determinant of dissolved oxygen concentration. In micro tidal systems (systems with tidal range less than 2 m), winds have the potential to have a significant impact on water level and the subsequent inundation of salt marsh vegetation. Additionally, previous research has shown that wind direction has the potential to affect dissolved oxygen concentration (Scully 2010). In the Chesapeake Bay, southwest winds are correlated to lower dissolved oxygen concentrations (Scully 2010). Climate change is causing sea level rise; these higher sea levels will exacerbate storm impacts and increase the potential for ecosystem changes and property damage. Warmer waters will also decrease dissolved oxygen concentrations and increase hypoxic events (Meire 2013). Atmospheric circulation is being altered in the form of poleward shifts of wind and pressure systems due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and the depletion of stratospheric ozone (Letcher 2009). Large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation is connected to local climate and, on the Atlantic coast of the United States, this is largely determined by the location of the Bermuda High (Katz 2003). There is evidence that westerly winds are increasing in frequency in recent decades in the mid-latitude North Atlantic due to a weakening of the Bermuda High (Scully 2010). There are multiple factors that affect water level, including tides, winds, air pressure, precipitation, and the shape of the shoreline. The National Park Service (NPS) has previously researched the impact of tides on water level and subsequent salt marsh inundation at Assateague Island National Seashore (ASIS). We aim to expand this research by focusing on the impacts of wind on water level at ASIS. Due to the micro tidal system of Chincoteague Bay, the tidal range at Buntings Bridge (Figure 1) is 0.61 m. Ocean City (Figure 1) is outside of the bay and has a tidal range of 2.1 m due to the exposure to the ocean. Wind therefore may have a significant impact on water level within Chincoteague Bay relative to tides. Increased nutrient loading has been linked to an increase in primary productivity and an increase in microbial activity and subsequent depletion of bottom depth dissolved oxygen (Diaz and Rosenberg 2008). Currently at Chincoteague Bay, nutrient monitoring is lacking; eutrophication is estimated based on modeling of bay wide nutrient loading. This modeling is limited by the many non-point sources, which has led to uncertainty in loading amounts (Cole 2005). The modeling is also generalized for the entirety of the Bay and not to specific locations. NPS dissolved oxygen research at ASIS has been done through partners and has not included measurements of nutrients, but it has been assumed that nutrients are a major factor (Kopps and Neckles 2009). We explore winds as an additional factor that may affect bottom dissolved oxygen concentrations.\nWind does have a significant effect on water level with westerly winds correlating to the highest water levels: a change in wind direction can change water level by 0.14 m, which is 22.3% of the tidal range. Wind direction affects dissolved oxygen concentration in Chincoteague Bay, westerly winds are correlated to lower levels of dissolved oxygen than non-west winds. Climate change related to changes in prevailing winds could harm salt marsh ecosystems at ASIS through both increased marsh inundation and decreased dissolved oxygen levels. \nOur results show that the ammonium excreted by copepods has an instantaneous negative effect on Oxyrrhis marina ingestion of and growth on Isochrysis galbana at dense monospecific copepod swarm abundances."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1.

This research provides a better understanding of how shifts in wind direction would impact salt marsh ecosystems and can help inform the management of these vital ecosystems.

While the positive difference values that the model predicts suggest that every wind direction leads to water levels higher than predicted, it is likely that other factors have an impact on the height of the water level. The reason for the variation between water level and predicted water level may be the effect of where wind drives water based on the shape of the bay. Westerly winds would push water from the bay into inlets leading towards Buntings Bridge, likely increasing the water level at the location. Easterly winds may be pushing water out of these inlets and lowering the water level.

To understand the extent of this inundation and impacts it may have on vegetation, the mapping done in this research should be used as well as information on the elevation inhabited by different vegetation species. The mapping can be used to determine the extent of salt marsh that experiences increased inundation with west winds and the extent should west winds increase. The available vegetation data can be used to determine if the vegetation at the areas at risk are of a species that would be negatively impacted by changes in inundation and if the surrounding marsh is of a height that will allow for vegetation species shifts and migration.

Westerly winds are correlated to increased bottom turbidity, which may be causing shading that is decreasing submerged aquatic vegetation production of dissolved oxygen. In order to better understand the influences on dissolved oxygen and the relation of wind to dissolved oxygen, improved nutrient monitoring should be implemented. Nutrients were not statistically significant in this analysis, but this is likely due to the limited data and lack of data co-located with dissolved oxygen data. The data used were estimates of total nutrient loading to Chincoteague Bay by year. When used in analysis, each estimate was assigned to every dissolved oxygen value for that year; it therefore is understandable that nitrogen would not appear to have a significant effect when it likely does. In order for the best understanding, it would be necessary to sample nutrients at the same times and locations the other measurements are made. If westerly winds increase in the area with climate change or with shifts in Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, it is likely that decreased dissolved oxygen concentrations will be observed.

The majority of samples were preserved in a buffered formalin-seawater solution with a final concentration of 4%, though two samples (September and October 2003) were preserved in 95% ethanol."}, {"section_title": "BVPR Data Collection and Image Analysis", "text": "The Benchtop Video Plankton Recorder (BVPR, SeaScan Inc., Falmouth, MA) takes zooplankton specimens into its circulating flow system and photographs them as they flow past a camera and strobe system. Before beginning data collection, we adjusted and calibrated the BVPR following the manufacturer's manual (SeaScan, Inc., 2012) to ensure the flow rate corresponded to a percent overlap of about 10% between successive image frames. Given slight variation in the percent overlap value as the BVPR was left running, the calibration was performed twice for each BVPR run (before and after). The percent overlap was calculated following the manual and the average of the two values was later used to convert the zooplankton number recorded in the specific run to true abundance by excluding the overlapped portion. To allow the flow to reach equilibrium and maintain a constant rate, the BVPR was turned on and warmed up for 20 min before first calibration and sample processing. To run a sample through the BVPR, preserved specimens were first washed to remove fixatives (ethanol or formalin). Specifically, specimens were concentrated on a 64-\u00b5m mesh filter, washed multiple times using distilled water, and then diluted in 50 mL of freshwater. Each pre-processed sample was carefully added to the sample cone of the BVPR and recording was started immediately after the specimens were introduced and continued until no specimen remained in the sample cone. All the specimens were later recollected in the sample collection funnel using a 64-\u00b5m mesh sieve and returned back to the sample's fixative. Samples containing a particularly high load of phytoplankton were either pre-filtered through a 200-\u00b5m sieve or were recollected using a 200-\u00b5m sieve to prevent filter clogging and overflow into the BVPR system (Table S1). The recorded data files were individually processed using the BVPR's data processing program and the default configuration settings developed for zooplankton by the NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (Jonathan Hare). Suspected individual zooplankton bodies were automatically recognized from each image frame and extracted as \"Regions of Interest\" (ROI) TIFF image files. The raw BVPR ROI files were further analyzed to obtain biological data (abundance, body size distribution) for community ecology analysis. The number of ROIs collected from each sample was interpreted as the total recorded number of zooplankton, assuming all the ROIs represent zooplankton individuals. This number was first adjusted for the true number of individuals using the recorded overlap rate for the examined sample (SeaScan, Inc., 2012), and then converted to the field abundance in individuals/m 3 using the filtered volume. The body size of a zooplankton individual was calculated directly from its ROI image by converting the pixels to distance using the calculated Image Scale Factor (\u00b5m/pixel, SeaScan, Inc., 2012). In order to automatically measure the body size of each individual from the ROI file, we developed a MATLAB (MATLAB R2016a, 2016) code to loop through each ROI from a particular sample, convert it to a binary image, identify the \"blob\" (organism in the image) with the largest area (to ignore the small particles in the background), and measure the longest major axis and the minor axis. We tested this protocol on a variety of known zooplankton groups and species to ensure that this measurement was accurately applied to true zooplankton objects of different sizes and shapes for the majority of images. For the purposes of this study, we use body length as the general measure of body size and defined it as the length of the longest major axis. To characterize a sampled community, individual body sizes from a sample were grouped into bins and a frequency distribution was obtained. To determine the appropriate bin size to use, we manually created a library composed of 22 identifiable zooplankton groups (including subgroups when relevant) present from 2003-2006 and calculated average body size and standard deviation for each group based on randomly selected ROI images (up to 200) within each group. An appropriate bin size was used in order to maximally distinguish all known zooplankton groups."}, {"section_title": "Community Ecology Analysis", "text": "Community ecology analysis was conducted using zooplankton body size data obtained from the BVPR, with size bins and frequencies equivalent to species and abundance, respectively. Species composition for each sample was defined as the number of bins (width = 0.1 mm, maximum bin limit = 19.2 mm) from the body size distributions with individuals present. To assess the temporal change of the zooplankton community, we compared species diversity, total abundance, and size distribution pattern (histograms) among samples at seasonal, annual, and decadal time scales. Four diversity statistics (Species richness [Margalef], Pielou's evenness [J'], Shannon's H [H', log base e], and Simpson's Diversity [1\u03bb']) were calculated from the zooplankton body size distributions using DIVERSE in PRIMER v6.1.6. (Clarke and Gorley, 2006). The difference in diversity indices and total abundance among samples was statistically tested using the Student's ttest. The difference between two size distributions (histograms) was tested using the non-parametric Whitney-Mann U test, against a null hypothesis that the two histograms were sampled from a single community. For all assessments with regards to seasonal patterns, seasons were defined for a northern hemisphere temperate estuary: Fall (September, October, November), Winter (December, January, February), Spring (March, April, May), and Summer (June, July, August). We analyzed the variation in the key environmental factors (surface temperature, surface salinity, and surface Chlorophyll a) over the sampling periods using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in PRIMER v6.1.6 (Clarke and Gorley, 2006). Ecological correlation between the zooplankton community and the key environmental factors was explored using multiple linear regression methods (Kutner et al., 2004). Full multiple linear regression models were constructed for 2003-2006 and 2013-2016 data sets respectively, with one of two responsive variable (abundance [N] or Shannon's H') against \"species\" richness (S), Shannon's H' (or abundance), surface seawater temperature (SST in \u00b0C), surface seawater salinity (Sal in PSU), and Chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a in \u00b5g/L). The best-fit models were further searched through model selection in both forward and backward directions and selected based on Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) values. The variables selected by the best-fit models would be considered important candidate ecological factors driving the zooplankton community changes. All the statistical analyses were performed using statistical package R (R Core Team, 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Zooplankton Body Size and Frequency Distribution", "text": "All 72 samples were run through the BVPR, producing over 42,644 ROIs (Tables S1, S2). The MATLAB code developed for automatic measurement successfully recognized zooplankton of different shapes and calculated three size measures: area, major and minor axis lengths (Figure 1). There was apparent variation in these values for body shape and size for all 22 known zooplankton groups (Figure 2, Table S3). To best reflect the inter-group size differences, we used 0.1 mm (100 \u00b5m) as the bin width to group the size data and construct the body size distribution histograms.   [2003][2004][2005][2006]. Some of the groups are labeled in gray (See Table S3 for a full list of taxonomic groups). There appeared to be defined seasonal patterns in zooplankton size distributions for all sets of years. The pattern was more visible in the earlier set of years (2003)(2004)(2005)(2006) and especially for mesozooplankton, the dominant zooplankton size group with a range of 0.2-2.0 mm (Figure 3). Thus, comparison analyses were focused on mesozooplankton, with an upper maximum of 2.0 mm imposed for all plots, though the distributions for all seasons and years spanned a wider range of body sizes (minimum = 0.1 mm, maximum = 19.2 mm). All seasonal distributions were fairly normal, though slightly skewed (Figure 3). Fall appeared to be characterized by evenest distribution of mesozooplankton within the varied size categories, whereas Winter distributions displayed the most limited range in size categories and the lowest average frequencies within each (Figure 3). Spring and Summer distributions were similar in their spread and mean frequencies, though highly variable within the 2003-2006 period ( Figure  3). Statistical analysis of these distributions revealed statistically significant differences between the size distributions of both seasons and year sets (decadal scale) ( Table 1). The majority of comparisons (8/12) showed significant differences between the seasonal size distributions (Whitney-Mann U test, p < 0.05) ( Table 1).  "}, {"section_title": "Temporal Patterns of Abundance and Diversity", "text": "We recorded a wide range of average seasonal zooplankton abundance (96-1,534 individual counts in samples, corresponding to 391,357.5-6,253,566.9 individuals/m 3 in the field), and a high level of species diversity (Simpson's index: > 0.88) and evenness (J': >0.71) in seasonal measurements. Overall, average abundance and diversity indices did not vary significantly among seasons of a year, with only a few exceptions, especially in the second year set (2013)(2014)(2015)(2016) (Table 2). However, abundance, species richness, and species evenness differed significantly between the two sets of three years (Table 2, p < 0.01). Average seasonal zooplankton abundance decreased up to five-fold between 2003-2006 and 2013-2016 (Table 2). Species richness also appeared to decrease over the last decade, whereas species evenness significantly increased (Table 2). Neither measures of diversity were significantly different between the two sets of years (p = 0.0612 and 0.8402 for Shannon's H and Simpson's Index, respectively) ( Table 2). Table 2. Seasonal and decadal changes of zooplankton abundance and diversity in Narragansett Bay. All statistics for a season were averaged over its three monthly samples. Pairwise comparisons among seasons within each year set were conducted using monthly sample-based pairwise t-tests, with statistical significance adjusted with the Bonferroni method and labeled in superscript letters. Decadal difference between the two year sets was tested for each statistic using Student's t-tests.  (Figure 4a), but best by year set (Figure 4b). Winter and Spring were characterized by lower SST and lower Chlorophyll a, whereas Summer and Fall were associated with high Chlorophyll a values (Figure 4a). The year sets were most highly separated along the surface salinity axis, where the 2013-2016 samples were associated with higher surface salinity values than the 2003-2006 samples (Figure 4b). The mean surface salinity of the 2013-2016 samples was about 2 PSU higher than that of the 2003-2006 samples ( Figure 5). Surface Chlorophyll a values were highly variable within both sets of years, but overall appeared higher in the 2003-2006 samples than the 2013-2016 samples ( Figure 5), much like zooplankton abundance values ( Figure 5, bottom panels). Sea surface temperature varied seasonally throughout both sets of years, and in both, a linear trend line revealed increasing SST over both sets of three years ( Figure 5, middle panels). Zooplankton diversity (Shannon's H') was also highly variable throughout both sets of years, but did not appear to follow any overall trend ( Figure  5, bottom panels). A multiple regression analysis revealed that for the 2003-2006 samples, variation in zooplankton abundance was best explained by Shannon's H', species richness, salinity, and Chlorophyll a, while zooplankton diversity best correlated with abundance, species richness, temperature and Chlorophyll a (Fstatistic tests: p < 0.0001) ( Table 3). For the 2013-2016 samples, variation in zooplankton abundance was best explained by Shannon's H', species richness, and Chlorophyll a, while abundance, species richness, temperature, salinity, and Chlorophyll a best correlated with zooplankton diversity in terms of Shannon's H' (F-statistic tests: p < 0.0001) ( Table 3). In either case, both abiotic environmental factors (temperature, salinity) and biotic factors (Chlorophyll a, species diversity and abundance) appeared to have played a role in driving changes in the zooplankton community in terms of abundance and diversity."}, {"section_title": "Key Points", "text": "\u2022 The mesozooplankton community has exhibited significant seasonal shifts. "}, {"section_title": "Data Collection", "text": "Summer flounder were collected from the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography (URI GSO) fish trawl survey conducted in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island as soon as they began their inshore migration and appeared in the catch in April 2016. The URI GSO fish trawl is conducted on the R/V Cap'n Bert and samples at two locations in Narragansett Bay: Fox Island, a mid-bay habitat with a depth of about 7 m, and Whale Rock, an outer-bay location with a depth of about 22.9 m. Each trawl covers one nautical mile by towing for 30 minutes at a speed of two knots. The otter trawl net has 5.1 cm mesh and an effective opening of 6.5 m (Collie et al. 2008). All of the summer flounder were retained for further sampling. To gain better spatial resolution, specimens were also collected from the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) monthly fish trawl on the R/V John H. Chafee. DEM samples at 13 set locations throughout the bay each month. The net has a 6.71 m wingspan and is in the water for 20 minutes traveling at 2.5 knots. Although DEM sampled several flounder from each survey for their own data collection, all data were shared with the investigators of this project and the excess summer flounder were donated to this study (Olszewski, 2016). Summer flounder (N=218) were most often dissected immediately after the trawl, but in several instances the fish were first frozen. Other studies (Morson et al, 2012) found that freezing the fish had a negligible impact on the total length of the specimen. The fresh samples and the thawed samples, therefore, were aggregated for data analysis. It was assumed that the freeze-thaw cycle also had minimal impact on the stomach contents. The total length of each individual was measured, prior to dissection to determine the sex by visual inspection of the gonads. The stomach was then excised, opened, and classified as \"full\" or \"empty\" depending on the presence or absence of contents. Because some summer flounder were observed regurgitating stomach contents on the boat, individuals that appeared to have flaccid stomachs were also noted. The contents were then visually identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and weighed."}, {"section_title": "Diet Analysis", "text": "It was found that 46.63% of the stomachs considered (excluding empty stomachs marked as flaccid) had contents. Within these \"full\" stomachs there were 71 identifiable prey items. The most common components of the summer flounder diet were squid (Doryteuthis pealeii) (17/71, 23.94%), scup (Stenotomus chrysops) (17/71, 23.94%), and crangon shrimp (Crangon septemspinosa) (14/71, 19.72%). Other frequent prey items included mantis shrimp (Squilla empusa) (5/71, 7.04%), and silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis) (4/71, 5.63%). Less common prey included Say mud crabs (Dyspanopeus sayi), Atlantic herring (Clupea h. harengus), bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli), Atlantic butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus), tautog (Tautoga onitis) and Northern searobin (Prionotus carolinus). Stomachs of smaller summer flounder (<40 cm) contained a higher proportion of crustaceans (44%) and fish (53%) than the stomachs of larger individuals (>40 cm) (21% and 38%, respectively) ( Figure 2). In comparison, the stomachs of larger individuals contained a much higher proportion of squid (41%) than the smaller individuals (3%) (Figure 2). The diet of the inshore individuals was primarily composed of fish (47%), followed by crustaceans (36%), with squid comprising the smallest proportion of the diet (17%) (Figure 3). In comparison, squid and fish were the most prevalent components of the offshore summer flounder diet (39%, 39%), and crustaceans were the least common component (22%) (Figure 3). In contrast to the female diet, the male diet included more crustaceans (M: 45%, F: 26%) and less squid (M: 10%, F: 29%), with the same amount of fish (M: 45%, F: 45%) ( Figure 4). The summer flounder diet varied greatly between months. April was not included because only 17 individuals and 4 prey items were sampled that month. Crustaceans accounted for 57% of the diet in May, 5% in June, and 18% in July ( Figure 5). Fish was the most important component of the diet in June (84%) and July (55%) and the least important in May (8%) ( Figure 5). Squid followed the same pattern as the crustaceans: highest in May (35%), decreased in June (11%) and increased again in July (27%) ( Figure 5) Although there was no significant relationship found between prey presence in the stomach and the sex (p=0.203), there was a significant relationship found between whether the stomach had contents and the station (p=0.024). Of the individuals obtained from an inshore habitat, 55/97 (56.7%) had \"full\" stomachs, whereas only 35/96 (36.46%) of the offshore fish had \"full\" stomachs. A significant relationship was also found between the weight of the stomach contents and the total length of the individual (p<0.0001). Figure 2. The diet components of (a) small summer flounder (<40 cm) (N=113) and (b) large summer flounder (>40 cm) (N=105): crustaceans (blue), fish (red), and squid (green).\nThere have been many studies conducted on the diet of the summer flounder (e.g. Buchheister and Latour, 2011;Latour et al., 2008;Manderson et al., 2000;Sagarese et al., 2011;Staudinger, 2006;Wuenschel et al., 2013), but none specifically in Narragansett Bay. Investigations conducted by Buchheister and Latour (2011), Latour et al. (2008), Manderson et al. (2000, and Sagarese et al. (2011) noted the importance of crustaceans, such as crangon shrimp and mantis shrimp, as components of the summer flounder diet, which is in accordance with the results found here. Additionally, Latour et al. (2008) found that there were ontogenetic changes in the summer flounder diet. Wuenschel et al. 2013noted these shifts as well; specifically they found that as summer flounder grow, and therefore age, they transition from a diet dominated by crustaceans to one supplemented with more squid and fish. This trend was supported by the flounder in Narragansett Bay, as crustaceans were found to be superseded by fish and squid in frequency of occurrence in the diet of the larger size class. Several summer flounder diet studies (e.g. Buchheister and Latour, 2011;Latour et al., 2008;Sagarese et al., 2011;Wuenschel et al. 2013) describe the summer flounder diet as diverse, which also supports the results of the present study. Here, four species of crustaceans and eight species of fish were present in the summer flounder diet. Sagarese et al. (2011) found that the components of the summer flounder diet fluctuated based on location, specifically between the contrasting environments of the North and South shores of Long Island, New York. Similarly, a difference in diet was found between the differing inshore and offshore habitats of Narragansett Bay. Likely linked to this pattern, the studies conducted by Latour et al. (2008), Manderson et al. (2000, Sagarese et al. 2011, Staudinger (2006) and Wuenschel et al. (2013) also all found that the diet of summer flounder varied based on month or season. Again, this is similar to the results of this diet study where prey composition greatly shifted depending on the month. Both of these diet trends appeared to simply reflect the availability of prey species inferred from the URI GSO fish trawl catch among the habitat classifications and months sampled. Based on the opportunistic and varied diet of this species (Buchheister and Latour, 2011;Latour et al., 2008;Sagarese et al. 2011;Wuenschel et al. 2013) it therefore seems very likely that the diet of summer flounder is highly dependent on the abundance and spatial distribution of available prey. Despite the number of diet studies conducted on summer flounder, few have compared the diets of males and females. This has caused uncertainty about the potential for differences in feeding frequency between the sexes. Such differences would lead to a bias in studies on sex composition using recreational landing data (Morson et al., 2012;Northeast Fisheries Science Center, 2013). The current work has allowed for clarification of this uncertainty, finding no significant relationship between sex and whether the stomach was \"full\" or \"empty,\" implying that females do not eat at a higher frequency than males. However, Morson et al. 2015found that growth rates of summer flounder are different between fishery-dependent and fisheryindependent data, suggesting that gear, or the spatial distribution of sampling, may influence the patterns observed in the catch in a manner undetectable by the methods used here."}, {"section_title": "Population Dynamics", "text": "The data from the 218 summer flounder retained from both fish trawls were supplemented with independently collected DEM data, resulting in sex and total length information for 281 total individuals. Sixtyfive summer flounder were the minimum size for recreational harvest (45.72 cm) or larger; 63 of these 65 fish (96.92%) were female. Of the fish that were the minimum size for commercial harvest (35.56 cm) or larger (N=216), 70.37% (152) were female. Male summer flounder were found to occupy a smaller range of sizes and had a smaller size overall compared with the females; the largest male summer flounder caught was 46.6 cm, whereas the largest female was 64.5 cm ( Figure 6). The a. b. probability of a fish being female increased as the total length of the fish also increased (Figure 7). Based on this sampling, the most probable size of a male summer flounder in Rhode Island waters was found to be between 35 cm and 40 cm, whereas the most probable size of a female summer flounder was approximately 45 cm ( Figure 7).     The sex composition of the inshore and offshore habitats differs, with a higher percentage of females found inshore. Specifically, 67.5%-76.0% of the inshore summer flounder were female in May, June, and July, whereas females only comprised 47.62%-48.98% of the offshore population for these same months (Figure 8). There were approximately twice as many females inshore than offshore. Therefore, the probability of a fish being female inshore was found to be up to 20% greater than offshore (Figure 9). The month of April was again excluded in this analysis because only 17 of the 218 summer flounder were caught during this time period, and the small sample size may not accurately reflect the population given the sporadic and variable catch observed during this month. Small sample size notwithstanding, in April, 50% of the summer flounder inshore were female and 77.78% were female offshore.  \nIt has been found that female summer flounder grow larger and faster than their male counterparts (King et al., 2001). Similarly, the probability of a fish being female was found here to increase with total length. The most probable size of males was found to be approximately the minimum size for commercial harvest and the most probable size of females approximately the minimum size of recreational harvest (Figure 7). Since fishing mortality has the greatest influence on the distribution of summer flounder (Bell et al. 2014a;Bell et al., 2014b), the results of this study could be reflecting the impact of fishing pressure on the summer flounder population. Just as Morson et al. (2012) found in the New Jersey fishery in 2009 and 2010, this study found that flounder that were the minimum size for recreational harvest were almost entirely female. Morson et al. (2012) also found that the sex ratios were impacted by the port at which they were collected. The Narragansett Bay data reflected a relationship between sex ratio and location of the fish, inshore or offshore. However, unlike Morson et al. (2012), a significant relationship between the sex ratios and month of capture could not be identified. Although Morson et al. (2012) found that fish caught in June were significantly more likely to be female than the fish caught in August, this study found consistent sex ratios in May, June, and July. The difference in these results could be due to a migration of summer flounder. Summer flounder migrate inshore as the waters warm in the spring and migrate offshore in the fall (Murawski, 1993;Wuenschel et al. 2013). Although this study characterized locations in Narragansett Bay as inshore or offshore, federal trawl surveys and commercial fishing still often take place farther offshore than these sampling locations. If the present study locations were far enough inshore that they served as an endpoint to seasonal migrations, then it could explain why the sex ratios observed were consistent each month. Meanwhile, if the locations used in the Morson et al. (2012) study were on active migration routes, significant differences in the sex ratio based on month could be expected. Another uncertainty posed by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (2013) and Morson et al. (2012) is the potential of the males migrating inshore later, and thereby influencing the recreational fishery data. As previously stated, this study found consistent sex ratios each month, despite increases in overall abundance, which contradicts the theory that males migrate inshore later, and suggests both sexes migrate at similar times. Another uncertainty posed by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (2013) to consider when updating the summer flounder stock assessment is whether the federal trawl surveys are truly reflective of the inshore population. The data presented here supports the conclusion that the federal trawl survey is not an accurate representation of the inshore population ( Figure 10). Morson et al. (2015) found that the federal trawl survey was not representative of commercial and recreational fisheries. They found that the females landed through recreational and commercial fisheries grew faster than those collected in the federal trawl survey, whereas the males collected in the federal trawl survey grew faster than the males landed in the commercial and recreational fishery.

For example, restrictions could be placed on inshore commercial fishing to prevent the disproportionate removal of females, or recreational slot-trophy limits with a size range consisting of a more equal sex ratio could be implemented. In summary, these results provide important consideration for managing the nearshore summer flounder population to ensure the continuation of a sustainable fishery."}, {"section_title": "Non-volcanic tremors associated with slow slip event in South Central Alaska between 2009-2013", "text": "Whitney Schultz 1,2 , Blake Cross 1,2 , Meng Wei 1 1 Graduate School of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island, Narragansett, RI 02882, U.S.A. 2 Geopphysical Engineering Program, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO 80401, U.S. A. Corresponding author: matt-wei@uri.edu Abstract A slow slip event between 2009 and 2013 has been recorded in south central Alaska near the epicenter of the 1964 M9.2 earthquake. It is unclear if there is any change of non-volcanic tremors associated with the slip event. We search for tremor signals from January 2005 to May 2015 using seismic data from local seismic networks in this region. The data are filtered using a band-pass filter between 1-6 Hz. Potential tremors are detected using a waveform envelope method and are then visually inspected under several general criteria for validation. The observed tremors were recorded in a time series portraying frequency of occurrence per month. The tremor activity increased in 2010 and decreased from 2010 to 2013 then leveled off in 2014. This shows that tremor activity did intensify during the slip event and returned to normal after the conclusion of the slow slip event. There was no systematic change in the duration of the tremors before, during, and after the slow slip event. Seasonal variations in tremor activity with a peak in summer are also observed and are likely related to the seasonal hydrological loading. We locate the tremors using a 1D seismic velocity model, and their horizontal locations are near the downdip limit of the slow slip area. The depth of tremors is not well resolved due to the limited number of seismic stations in this region. Our study confirms the occurrence of nonvolcanic tremors associated with the 2009-2013 slow slip event in south central Alaska. Episodic tremor and slip (ETS) was first reported in Cascadia (Rogers and Dragert, 2003). Since then, ETS has been observed in many subduction zones including those in southwest Japan, Costa Rica, Mexico, and New Zealand (Peng and Gomberg, 2010;Dixon et al., 2014). Through detailed analysis of these events, our understanding of the variety of slip events has been improved significantly. In most cases, ETS occur near the downdip end of the mega-earthquake rupture area (Ghosh et al., 2012) and are likely caused by high pore pressure in the fault zone (Rubinstein et al., 2007(Rubinstein et al., , 2010Audet et al., 2009). ETS studies in Alaska are quite limited. Only one slow slip event (SSE) between 1998-2001 (Ohta et al., 2006) and the associated change in non-volcanic tremor (Peterson and Christensen, 2009) have been reported before 2010, which is partly due to the long interval between and duration of ETS events in Alaska. A low velocity zone identified in the south central Alaska where ETS occur suggests high pore-pressure on the fault interface (Kim et al., 2014). Tremors have also been identified along the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone (Brown et al., 2013) and at two spots favoring dynamically triggered tremors in south central Alaska . Between 2009-2013, two slow slip events have been observed on the newly established Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) GPS network at two separate but nearby locations (Figure 1). One SSE between 2009-2013 is near the slip area of the 1998-2001 SSE (Fu and Freymueller, 2013;Fu et al, 2015) and another 2010-2012 SSE is farther southwest (Wei et al., 2012). In the same time, enhanced seismic activity has also been observed with the slow slip event (Wei et al., 2012;Fu et al., 2015). However, Wech (2016) searched tectonic tremor in this region between 2007-2015 and found no-temporal change in tremor intensity related to the 2009-2013 SSE. Figure 1. Map of south central Alaska, including the seismic stations (triangles) that are used in this study. Stations MCK, SAW, PMR are used for locating but not identifying tremors. The darker regions are the slip area of three known SSEs (Wei et al., 2012;Ohta et al., 2006;Fu et al., 2015). The dashed line highlights the rupture area of the 1964 M9.2 earthquake. GPS station ATW2 is very close to seismic station PMR. In this paper we search and locate tremors between January 2005 and May 2015 using seismic data from the Alaska Regional Network, the National Tsunami Warning System Seismic Network, and the Multidisciplinary Observations of Subduction Array. Unlike Wech (2016), we focus on tremors with duration longer than 3 minutes and in the area near the 2009-2013 SSE. All the tremors discussed in this paper are nonvolcanic, which means that they are not related to any volcanic processes. The methodology is adopted from many previous studies (Obara, 2002;Rogers and Dragert, 2003;Wech and Creager, 2008;Peterson and Christensen, 2009). Due to the large amount of data, we picked six stations with the longest record and near the previous non-volcanic tremor locations identified by Peterson and Christensen (2009) to monitor temporal changes of tremor activities. Then we used three additional stations to locate several wellrecorded tremors. We also documented the durations of these tremors and explored "}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Identifying non-volcanic tremors", "text": "Non-volcanic tremors are seismic signals with low frequency (1-6 Hz) and long duration (at least several minutes). We adopt an envelope detection method used by many previous studies (Obara, 2002;Rogers and Dragert, 2003;Wech and Creager, 2008;Peterson and Christensen, 2009). Seismic data from eight AK stations are downloaded from the IRIS database using the Matlab script irisFetch.m. The waveform data are filtered through a band-pass filter for a frequency range of 1-6 Hz (Peterson and Christensen, 2009). Signals from local earthquakes are masked out based on a ratio of peak amplitude and background noise. Once earthquakes are removed an envelope is created to overlay the waveform. The data are then run in hour sections and automatically screened to produce a list of possible tremor events. Only events that last longer than three minutes are listed. In the meantime, figures with hourly waveforms are produced and are used to visually inspect the tremors under the following criteria: (1) the tremors last for more than three minutes, (2) they lack evident P and S waves, (3) there is no sharp increase in signal, and (4) the times of increased seismic signals from at least three stations are closely aligned and the shapes look alike. From this visual inspection, a list of determined tremors is created and used to show tremor activity per month since January 2005. The visual inspection primarily removes earthquake signals, characterized as a sudden onset of large energy. Over 90% of events were identified as earthquakes therefore not included in the tremor list. An example of the tremor signals is shown in Figure 3a. This tremor event occurred in September 19, 2010. The signal lasted about 10 minutes and showed up in all the eight stations. The similarity of the signal and the timing suggest that the signals are from the same event. Figure 3b illustrates an hour of waveform that the Matlab code identified as possible tremors, but were excluded by visual inspection. A clear onset of large energy indicates this to be an earthquake instead of a tremor. This particular event is possibly a glacial event because of the sharp onset and it is occurring in an area known for producing large glacial calving signals (Wolf and Davis, 1986). The waveform in stations PPLA and TRF, in figure 3c, is cut based on the large signal-tonoise ratio of this earthquake. signal not identified as a tremor. This example was identified as a possible tremor by the script automatically but was excluded from the list of tremor because of the sharp increase in signal that is indicative of earthquakes. (c) Another earthquake that was automatically identified as a possible tremor. The earthquake is masked out on most of the stations, but it is still seen at two stations. We locate tremors to understand the spatial relationship between the slow slip event and tremors. First, the lag time between stations is determined by cross correlating the smoothed envelopes of different stations (Figure 3a). Then, for simplicity, we forward model the arrival time using a 1D-velocity model based on CRUST 1.0 (Laske et al., 2013) even though more complex models are available (Wang and Tape, 2014). Next we perform a grid search including location (x,y), depth (z) and origin time (dT). For each grid, a misfit is calculated between the modeled and observed arrival times. The grid that generated the smallest misfit is considered as the most likely location and origin time of tremors. We have good constraints on the horizontal location of the tremors. Resolving the depth is less successful, with the smallest misfit point being usually the largest depth in the search grid ( Figure S1 in Supplementary Materials). The difficulty of resolving depth is expected (Wech and Creager, 2008).  "}, {"section_title": "Sinking Microfibers on the New England Continental Shelf Break", "text": "Jennie L.

At the high prey concentration, O. marina exposed to the combination of high ammonium and high prey treatments displayed a noticeably lower ingestion rate than the other three ammonium treatments. This pattern points to a distinct stress accompanying the high prey/high ammonium treatment. It has been shown that the ingestion rates of some heterotrophic protists are negatively affected when exposed to high prey concentrations due to mechanical interference with feeding (Montagnes & Lessard, 1999;Calbet et al., 2013). Thus, it is possible that the overloading of inhibitory chemicals and prey may have had a similar effect on O. marina in our incubation experiments. At 48 hours, the decline in ingestion rate observed in the high prey/high ammonium treatment disappeared and the values became positive. This could be due to the removal of excess ammonium from the system by bacteria or I. galbana, which in turn removed stress from O. marina and allowed them to begin grazing more normally.

A possible explanation to the observation is that at 48 hours, O. marina in the high ammonium treatment was grazing efficiently but the cells were not reproducing. This result points to a stress response by O. marina. When exposed to the stress of high ammonium and high prey concentration, O. marina cells initially ceased to graze and therefore reproduced less. After that stress was removed from the system, O. marina cells began to feed again at high grazing rates, but did not reach maximum growth. We speculate that after the stress factor was removed, O. marina acquired carbon and energy to expand    in volume as opposed to using it to reproduce. In order to confirm this idea, carbon biomass should be measured throughout the course of future experiments.
