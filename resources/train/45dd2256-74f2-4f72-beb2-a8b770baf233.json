[{"section_title": "", "text": "The U.S. biomedical research ecosystem is one of the great engines of inno vation in modern history. It is a wellspring of discovery and cures that has expanded the domain of human knowledge, improved and saved countless lives, and catalyzed job growth and economic prosperity in communities across the nation. The United States' model for training and funding the biomedical workforce is widely credited with making it a global leader in scientific research, one that is emulated around the world. But there is nothing inevitable about the success of this enterprise. It requires constant vigilance and stewardship, to ensure that we are setting the optimal conditions and incentives for our scientists and the science they imagine, now and into the future. There have been warning signs for years that the enterprise may be calcifying-in ways that create barriers, in particular for the incoming generation of researchers. Multiple national reports have been penned about these warning signs, and they have proposed countless recommendations for reform. But many of the recommendations have gone unaddressed. And the problems have endured. Of late, the vulnerabilities in the biomedical enterprise have grown more evident, leading to renewed concern on the part of science policy leaders, professional organizations, funding agencies, and, above all, the U.S. Congress, which called on the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study of the policies affecting the next generation of researchers in the United States. This report is the outcome of that study. In developing it, we saw our task as two-fold: First, to identify reforms that are tailored to the evolving barriers facing the next generation of researchers. But, second, to do so in a manner that responds to the failure of many of the earlier recommendations to gain traction. Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Second, there has been an absence of shared responsibility for the biomedical research system (Daniels, 2015). Many stakeholders tend to hold the federal government responsible for this system, placing blame for failures at the feet of NIH, the principal funder of biomedical research. Doing so, however, obscures the important role that other organizations, particularly universities, must play in developing and implementing solutions. The committee's review of the implementation of past recommendations revealed that NIH has been more responsive than other stakeholders-namely universities and research institutions-in adopting reforms. It has been too easy for stakeholders other than NIH to ignore or pay superficial attention to the recommendations repeatedly made in periodic reports. In addition, without a mechanism for shared oversight of the system, institutions acting unilaterally will fail to make progress to solve what are often shared systemic problems. Third, a lack of comprehensive and easily available data about the bio medical research system itself has impaired progress on addressing these problems. The opacity of the system has prevented students and trainees from making informed decisions about their training and career options as well as hindered institutions' and policymakers' ability to decide with confidence how to proceed with policy and funding reforms to ensure the system's vibrancy and responsiveness. Finally, the sands of the biomedical research enterprise are rapidly shifting. Since the release of earlier reports and their calls for reform, the funding landscape, demographic trends, and scientific priorities in science and industry have changed. The nature of research itself has evolved: team science, with its attendant premium on collaboration in multi-investigator and multidisciplinary projects, is ascendant; the growing use of pre-prints enables quick disclosure of research results; experimentation with hybrid business models blend traditional research institutes and for-profit companies; and the emergence of data sciences and online connectivity accelerates the pace at which experiments can be conducted. The committee took its mandate seriously. Congress, NIH, scientific societies, and U.S. research institutions are acutely aware of the frailties of the current biomedical research environment and have put forth many recommendations, so there is a heightened sense of urgency to address the problems. To meet its mandate, the committee developed recommendations that attend to the research ecosystem not only as it exists now, but also as it is likely to evolve during the next 10 years. This report discusses the current biomedical research ecosystem and its challenges, informed by new insights into the workforce from NIH and independent scholars, and proposes several substantive and structural reforms for stakeholders across the research enterprise. These reforms chart a path to a biomedical research enterprise that is competitive, rigorous, fair, and dynamic, and can attract the best minds from across the country.

While 56 percent of doctorate recipients in 2015 were women, only 46 percent of postdoctoral researchers in the same fields were women. In addition, 9 percent of the biomedical Ph.D.'s were awarded to individuals from underrepresented minority groups in 2015, but only 5 percent of postdoctoral researchers in those fields were from those same groups. A substantial proportion of biomedical postdoctoral researchers are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Of the biomedical postdoctoral researchers included in the 2015 NSF GSS, 53 percent held temporary visas and 31 percent reported earning their degrees in a foreign country. Moreover, the origin of the degree was unknown for 33 percent of biomedical postdoctoral researchers surveyed the same year. 11 These percentages reflect both the openness of U.S. biomedical training and labor markets and the attractiveness of U.S. research careers to international scholars. It is also the case that some countries encourage recent Ph.D.'s to seek postdoctoral training in the United States. 12 In the extramurally funded biomedical sciences, postdoctoral researchers at U.S. degree-granting institutions are supported largely by NIH funding mechanisms. In 2016, approximately 10 percent of postdoctoral researchers in the biomedical, behavioral, social, and clinical sciences were supported on federal fellowships and traineeships, such as the Ruth L. Kirschstein Individual National Research Service Award (NRSA) postdoctoral fellowship (F32), which provides support to individual postdoctoral fellows, and the Ruth L. Kirschstein Institutional NRSA training grant (T32), which provides support to institutions to develop training opportunities for selected individuals. 13 That same year, 46 percent of postdoctoral researchers were supported on a federal research grant, which is awarded to a principal investigator (PI) and supports individuals selected by the PI, and 44 percent received non-federal support. Of postdoctoral researchers specifically supported by NIH in 2016, approximately 79 percent of them were supported on research project grants (RPGs) and 19 percent were supported on a fellowship or traineeship. 14 NIH training grants, such as individual F32 and institutional T32 awards, are restricted to U.S. citizens and permanent residents, undergo peer review of the research and training plan, and include stipulations for professional development and mentoring by eligible mentors. For postdoctoral researchers, obtaining a fellow ship is often considered a step toward professional independence, but significantly fewer postdoctoral researchers are supported on fellowships and training grants than on RPGs. In fact, the number of postdoctoral researchers supported on F32 grants was lower in 2016 (516 awards) than any year since 1998. 15 For postdoctoral researchers supported on an RPG, NIH states, \"Staff in postdoctoral positions engaged in research, while not generally pursuing an addi tional degree, are expected to be actively engaged in their training and career develop ment under their research appointments as Post-Docs.\" 16 However, there is neither a requirement to include a plan for training and professional development in the grant application, an assessment of the PI as a mentor, nor any other formal mechanism to ensure quality training and mentorship opportunities. In 2014 NIH implemented a policy that RPG Research Performance Progress Reports (RPPRs) must include a brief description of how and whether Individual Development Plans (IDPs) are used to manage the career development of students and postdoctoral researchers associated with that award. 17 These deficiencies contribute to a longstanding concern about a disparity in the treatment of postdoctoral researchers between RPGs and training grants (National Research Council, 2005). Moreover, because only U.S. citizens or nationals or lawful permanent residents are eligible for NIH-funded fellowships or training grants, postdoctoral researchers from other countries are significantly less likely to receive mandated training and professional development. The fastest growing and second most prevalent source of postdoctoral support at degree-granting institutions is non-federal organizations, such as philanthropies, research centers, universities, the private sector, and professional societies. 18 The Health Research Alliance, a national consortium of more than 70 non governmental, nonprofit funders of biomedical research and training, provided $866 million in research awards in 2012. 19 Of that amount, 44 percent was for early-career development and training, including programs such as the American Cancer Society's Postdoctoral Fellowship Award and the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation's Postdoctoral Research Fellowship.

The size of the postdoctoral workforce in those sectors is not clear, but the roles and experiences of these postdoctoral researchers and their peers in academia are notably different. According to the National Academies report The Postdoctoral Experience Revisited (National Academy of Sciences et al., 2014a, p.3), their \"roles are better defined, salaries are higher, terms are shorter, and the connection to career development is clearer.\" It is difficult to determine with accuracy the length of time researchers spend in their postdoctoral positions and whether that duration has changed over time. One recent analysis, however, found that the duration has held relatively constant over the past several decades at 4.5 years . There appeared to be a slight decrease in the duration after the late 1990s, perhaps attributable to a gradual move by some universities to cap postdoctoral periods at their institutions. Even so, approximately 20 percent of postdoctoral fellows in 2005 had spent 7 or more years in postdoctoral research positions . It is unclear whether these postdoctoral researchers had prolonged postdoctoral experiences because (1) they came from institutions with shorter doctoral training periods, (2) they required additional training because of their specific research areas, (3) they were in a \"holding pattern\" because of the scarce availability of independent academic research positions, or (4) other unknown reasons. Importantly, the data from this analysis are only included up to 2006, so it is unclear whether these trends persisted over the following decade. Despite calls in prior reports for improved data collection on postdoctoral researchers, it remains challenging to find comprehensive quantitative and qualitative data about the postdoctoral research experience. Several surveys in recent years have revealed qualitative aspects of the postdoctoral experience. Respondents in a national survey of 1,002 American biological and life science postdoctoral researchers reported lower clarity on career goals during the postdoctoral experience than upon entry into or departure from Ph.D. programs (Gibbs et al., 2015). In a separate study, only 4 percent of biological and life sciences postdoctoral researchers reported feeling a \"severe lack of information\" regarding research careers in academia, but that number increased to 21 percent in government, 34 percent in established companies, and 42 percent in start-ups (Sauermann and Roach, 2016). Finally, those doctorates who had not thought about their careers at all were more likely to pursue a postdoctoral experience than those who had (Sauermann and Roach, 2016). These results are broadly consistent with prior reports that highlight a persistent lack of communication about the broad range of career prospects and educational and training opportunities for doctoral and postdoctoral researchers (National Academy of Sciences et al., 2014a). NIH has developed initiatives to address the need for postdoctoral career development. For postdoctoral researchers supported on NRSA awards, NIH requires institutions to offer preparation for research-related and researchintensive careers in various sectors, such as academic institutions, government agencies, for-profit businesses, and private foundations. 21 In 2013, NIH launched the Strengthening the Biomedical Research Workforce program through the NIH Common Fund as one component of a trans-NIH strategy to enhance training opportunities for early-career scientists to prepare them for a variety of research-related career options. 22 A core component of this program is the NIH Director's Biomedical Research Workforce Innovation Awards to enhance biomedical research training, more commonly called the Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training (BEST) awards. 23 These 5-year awards are intended to support innovation in both graduate student and postdoctoral researcher training. Although a broad evaluation of BEST is not yet available, the awarded institutions convene annually to share data, develop best practices, and discuss program sustainability. It is promising that multiple initiatives are aimed at providing postdoctoral researchers with career development opportunities, but an economic analysis of career paths for biomedical doctorates reveals that the postdoctoral experience can come at a substantial opportunity cost. Recent data indicate that postdoctoral training may not provide a positive financial return for more than a decade if the postdoctoral researcher later pursues jobs outside of academia. Biomedical Ph.D.'s in postdoctoral research positions earn an average of $45,000 per year for several years. In comparison, biomedical Ph.D.'s who enter the workforce immediately after degree attainment earn a median starting salary of $73,662. It can take 12 to 15 years after degree attainment for the postdoctoral research cohort to make up the lost earnings. The salary advantage in private industry for foregoing a postdoctoral position is especially pronounced for Ph.D.'s conducting biomedical research . Despite repeated recommendations to increase postdoctoral stipends and salaries (American Academy of Arts and Sciences, FASEB, 2015;McDowell et al., 2014;National Academy of Sciences et al., 2014a;National Institutes of Health, 2012a;National Research Council, 2011), the 2017 starting postdoctoral stipend of $47,484 for NRSA 21 See https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA- 18-403.html (accessed December 14, 2017). 22 See https://commonfund.nih.gov/workforce (accessed December 14, 2017). 23 See https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-12-022.html (accessed December 14, 2017).

First, they face fierce competition for a limited number of academic faculty positions. Second, they are a vulnerable part of the biomedical workforce because these positions are short-term and thus susceptible to fluctuations in federal research budgets. Third, although they seek these positions to enhance their skills, they are principally supported on RPGs in individual laboratories across the institution, which does not ensure quality mentoring and training experiences. At the core of concerns about the postdoctoral research experience is whether it provides value to postdoctoral researchers and prepares them for a variety of research careers outside of academia, and whether it proportionately and adequately supports diverse populations. Without comprehensive and longitudinal data on the postdoctoral population, however, it is difficult to develop evidence-based recommendations for improving the quality of the postdoctoral experience and recruiting an appropriate number of promising scientists from diverse populations into the biomedical research enterprise."}, {"section_title": "TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENT RESEARCH POSITIONS", "text": "In general, postdoctoral experience is considered necessary preparation for research positions in academia, but it does not guarantee advancement to such a position. According to one survey, 60 percent of postdoctoral researchers in biological and life sciences who graduated before 2013 reported that they accepted their position primarily to secure a faculty tenure-track position (Sauermann and Roach, 2016). However, another recent analysis showed that only 27.4 percent of employed individuals, regardless of their cohort, previously employed in biomedical postdoctoral research had tenure-track or tenured positions . The same mismatch between career aspiration and reality plays out more notably for recently trained cohorts, as studies show that greater than 50 percent of Ph.D.'s in the biological and life sciences rank a faculty research position as their desired career . As of 2013, however, only 18 percent of all U.S.-trained Ph.D.'s were employed in tenure-track or tenured positions 6 to 10 years after completing their Ph.D. training (Figure 2-1). The percentage of Ph.D.'s in tenure-track positions has declined significantly in recent years. Partially contributing to this decline is increased hiring of new faculty in nontenure-eligible appointments. 25 According to Figure 2-1, in 1993, slightly greater than 10 percent of individuals were in tenure-track or tenured faculty positions within 5 years of degree attainment, but that percentage dropped to 6 percent by 2013. Only 18 percent of biomedical Ph.D.'s 6 to 10 years post degree attainment held academic tenure-track or tenured positions in 2013, compared to 29 percent in 1993. 26 An analysis from the AAMC supports a similar trend at medical colleges, where 73 percent of full-time basic science Ph.D. faculty were on tenure-eligible tracks in 2014, compared to 82 percent in 1984. 27 As the percentage of biomedical Ph.D.'s in tenure-track or tenured faculty positions has declined, their representation has notably increased in two other sectors: academic non-tenure track positions and non-academic non-research positions. The former includes postdoctoral researchers, as well as instructors, adjunct professors, non-tenured research professors, and staff scientists. Data about the latter are limited, but sources such as the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) suggest that the category likely encompasses a wide variety of positions across many employment sectors. The declining probability of transitioning into an academic research position reflects the relatively flat job market in academia coupled with a growing supply of individuals trained in the biomedical sciences. Several factors contribute to the flat job market for early-career investigators. First, although the \"number of bio-medical academic tenured/TT jobs did grow (by 150 percent, ~8,700 jobs) from 1981-2013,\" this increase could not keep pace with the \"278 percent (102,000 people) increase in new U.S. Ph.D.s\" (Kahn and Ginther, 2017, p. 92).

A related factor contributing to the flat nature of the academic labor market is the considerable costs associated with recruiting a new faculty member, including startup packages that can exceed $1 million (Dorsey et al., 2009;Joiner, 2005). At the same time, the profit margins from clinical activity in academic health centers, which have traditionally been used to partially subsidize the research enterprise, are under increasing pressure. Further, public institutions have faced declining financial support from their state and local governments."}, {"section_title": "Physician-Scientists", "text": "One group of crucial contributors to biomedical research are physicianscientists-scientists with professional degrees 28 and training in clinical medicine who engage in biomedical research. As defined in the 2014 NIH Physician-Scientist Workforce Working Group Report (National Institutes of Health, 2014), physician-scientists typically engage in both clinical care and basic or clinical research, although not always at the same point in their career. The combination of training and experience allows the physician-scientist to contribute a unique perspective and affords them the opportunity to translate clinical observations to the laboratory to help identify the mechanisms of disease, as well as to apply the findings of basic science to patient care. Physician-scientists also face challenges early in their research careers, including a lack of protected research time, loan repayment obligations, prolonged training, and a need for additional mentoring (National Institutes of Health, 2014). The 2014 NIH Physician-Scientist Workforce advisory committee estimated that about 1,000 physicians need to enter the research workforce each year to maintain the current physician-scientist workforce, but a significant number of physician-scientists move out of research when they are unable to renew their first NIH award (Dickler et al., 2007). NIH offers a variety of support mechanisms that are available to physician-scientists, such as the Loan Repayment Award (LRP), the Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08), the Career Transition Award (K22), the Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00), and the Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23).

In some institutions, staff scientists can apply for their own federal research funding. A robust staff scientist path can offer investigators the promise of a sustainable academic research career outside of the traditional research faculty route, potentially easing the logjam of trainees waiting for such opportunities in postdoctoral positions.

To foster innovation, biopharma ceutical companies often collaborate with the government and the next generation of entre preneurially minded basic and clinical science researchers through enterprises such as Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer grants and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences. The private sector also supports biomedical researchers through innovation health care accelerators and incubators such as StartUp Health and OneStart. Currently, several hundred state, national, and global networks of investors, partners, and customers who typically form peer networks provide financial support (i.e., direct funding and investment resources), education, mentoring, and coaching to promote the cutting edge of biomedical science. One analysis of focus group responses suggests that personal values, combined with frustrations about long training periods, low postdoctoral researcher salaries, tight grant funding, and a highly competitive job market, have diminished biomedical scientists' interest in faculty research careers and has guided them toward non-academic careers (Gibbs and Griffin, 2013). However, as Figure 2-1 shows, the percentage of biomedical doctorates who are 1 to 5 years post degree attainment and are conducting research in non-academic positions has remained relatively steady between 1993 and 2013 ( Figure 2-1). In contrast, the percentage of such doctorates in non-academic non-research positions has increased. More data are needed in this area to better understand the availability of and interest in non-academic research and non-research pathways. 30 \"Biomedical\" here includes biological and health sciences, but because of the nature of the SDR this figure likely includes subfields previously excluded in other calculations in this chapter.

That funding, however, is increasingly competitive. According to data provided by NIH, until the late 1990s, a newly hired assistant professor's first grant was most likely an NIH Type 1 (new) research project grant (R01) or equivalent award. The R01 is the flagship NIH RPG and remains an important benchmark for success on the path to independent research. Between 1998 and 2003, the NIH budget nearly doubled from roughly $13 billion to $27 billion ($21 billion in 1995 constant dollars) (Figure 2-3), and the success rate for type 1 competing R01-equivalent awards peaked at approximately 26 percent in 2000. However, the percentage of research awards to new investigators dropped steadily during those years, and, according to the 2005 National Academies Bridges to Independence report, it appears that \"those with existing funding and established research programs received increased funding, in part to hire additional postdoctoral and graduate student researchers and further exacerbate the imbalance between trained researchers and available positions\" (National Research Council, 2005, p. 40). Since the doubling ended in 2004, NIH appropriations have declined in constant dollars, and the success rate for R01-equivalent awards has decreased rapidly for both established and new investigators 32 (Figure 2-3). The NIH budget received a supplemental bump in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) 33 in 2009 and 2010, while sequestration in 2013 required a 5 percent ($1.55 billion) cut in the budget. 34 The consequences of these significant funding changes can be compounded by the fact that NIH commits its funding to PIs in multi-year tranches-the average R01 grant is 3 to 5 years in duration, although funds are disbursed annually. At any given moment, close to 80 percent of NIH appropriations are committed to ongoing projects (Berg, 2016), with only the remainder available for new projects. Therefore, the size of the pool for new and competing projects in any given year is sensitive to year-to-year changes in the appropriation level. Between 1998 and 2006, the success rate for R01-equivalent awards for new investigators declined from 23 to 15 percent 35 (Figure 2-4). One reason for the decline in success rates since 2004 is the change over time in the NIH budget. Another is the increase in the number of investigators seeking NIH funding each year. The number of applications for all NIH awards rose 32 NIH defined \"new investigators\" as a program director/principal investigator (PD/PI) who has not previously competed successfully as a PD/PI for a substantial independent research award. https:// grants.nih.gov/policy/early-investigators/index.htm (accessed January 19, 2018   steadily from 19,663 in 1998 to 41,420 in 2016 (Figure 2-5), while the number of applications for the Type 1 R01 awards increased by 97 percent for established investigators and 42 percent for new investigators. 36,37 In 2016, of more than 40,000 PIs that submitted competing RPG applications, only 11,434 (or 28%) received funding. Also that year, nearly 30,000 eligible biomedical investigators were unable to secure NIH funding to support their research Figure 2-5, leading many to characterize the current biomedical ecosystem as \"hypercompetitive,\" a situation with a stark imbalance between the dollars available for research and the expanding U.S. scientific community Fochler et al., 2016;Kamerlin, 2015;Kimble et al., 2015). Faced with an increasing number of applicants for research awards-and concern about the ability of new investigators to compete for funding in that environment-NIH sought to boost support for new investigators by instituting a policy in fiscal year (FY)2007 to maintain comparable success rates for type 1 R01-equivalent applications from both experienced and new investigators. 38 NIH also established a policy that the majority of awarded new investigators should be early-stage investigators (ESIs), 39 defined as a \"Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) who has completed their terminal research degree or end of post-graduate clinical training, whichever date is later, within the past 10 years and who has not previously competed successfully as PD/PI for a substantial NIH independent research award.\" 40 This new policy benefits both new investigators and ESIs by requiring peer reviewers to focus more on the proposed approach in grant applications than on an investigator's track record, and to expect less preliminary data than would be provided by established investigators. 41 NIH Insti tutes routinely fund ESI applications that score outside of the normal funding range by maintaining a separate payline for competing, investigator-initiated ESI R01 applications. 42 For example, in FY2017, the payline for ESI applications to 36 NIH Data Book.

A recent Next Generation Researcher Initiative (NGRI) at NIH emphasized ESIs. However, grants from both new investigators and ESIs are still identified in eRAcommons (the online interface for NIH grants) and reviewed separately from grants from established investigators. An NIH NGRI advisory committee to the director and NIH ICs are currently discussing final recommendations on policies to enhance independence and research funding for early-stage and new researchers.

However, in 2013, the number of new investigator awardees dipped to 2005 levels, which coincided with budget sequestration. NIH estimated that sequestration resulted in approximately 640 fewer RPG awardees compared to FY2012, but it is unclear how new investigators and ESIs were affected. 45 Since sequestration,  (Figure 2-7). In addition, the number of NIHsupported researchers under age 46 has declined over a 32-year period, 47 even after implementation of new investigator and ESI policies. 48 The precise reason for why the age of receipt of the first NIH R01-equivalent award has increased, even as the success rate of new investigators relative to 46 Data provided courtesy of NIH. 47 See https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11249/bridges-to-independence-fostering-the-independence-ofnew-investigators-in (accessed January 19, 2018). 48 See https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-08-121.html.

All rights reserved. established investigators has stabilized, is unclear and a matter of debate. 49 NIH data show that the number of years to first R01 since the investigator's last degree has increased over time as well, suggesting that the increase in the age at first R01 cannot be explained by any delays in the start or culmination of doctoral education (Figure 2 -8). The data also show that the number of years on average between an investigator's first R01 and second R01 has mostly held steady over time, suggesting that whatever is causing the delays over time in the capacity of investigators to obtain their first R01 is largely confined to the pursuit of that first grant (Figure 2-9). Finally, the rise in the age exists across NIH Institutes, which suggests an effect of larger workforce trends that apply across all areas of biomedical research (Figure 2-10). The rise persists across race 50 and gender 51 as well.  Today, even when ESIs and new investigators do receive an R01-equivalent award, they often confront the challenge of the declining purchasing power of these awards, because the size of these awards has not tracked with either overall inflation or the rising cost of conducting research as measured by the Biomedical Research and Development Price Index, 52 despite some increase in the average costs for R01s when adjusted for inflation. As a result, investigators often need to secure more than one source of financial support to establish and sustain their laboratories. Additional avenues of federal research support for emerging biomedical researchers include NIH's Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant Award (R21), NIH Director's New Innovator Award (DP2), Early Independence Award (DP5), and Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00). According to NIH, the nonrenewable R21 grant mechanism, as opposed to the renewable R01 award, is intended to encourage exploratory or developmental research by providing support for the early and conceptual stages of project development, usually defined as lasting no longer than 2 years. Although R21 awards are not specifically designed to support ESIs, data provided by NIH highlights the fact that the R01 is increasingly giving way to the R21 and other awards as the research grant that starts investiga-tors' NIH-funded career (Figure 2 -11). Each year, roughly the same number of investigators now apply for an R21 and an R01 as their first grant. 53 These trends are observed across all age cohorts. 54 R21 awards may be regarded as an opportunity to secure initial funding for an emerging investigator's independent research career, but analysis of R21 awardees shows that receipt of the award does not increase the success rate for receiving an R01-equivalent award. 55 Not all individual NIH Institutes offer R21 awards, and data provided by NIH show that applications for R21 awards have increased to the point where success rates for receiving the award are now lower than for R01-equivalent awards, at 15 percent and 20 percent, respectively, in 2016. 56 In addition, R21 awards provide less funding over a shorter time period compared to R01-equivalent awards, and thus are less ideal for establishing an independent research career. The combined budget for direct costs for the 2-year R21 project period may not exceed $275,000, and no more than $150,000 may be requested in any single year. 57 In 2016, the average cost of competing R21 awards was $221,434, whereas the average cost for an R01 award, which can span 5 years, was $476,631 per year. 58 The higher level of funding and longer funding period for R01 grants are designed to provide researchers with the time and resources necessary to collect and publish data that represent a substantial addition to biomedical knowledge. The NIH Director's New Innovator Award (DP2) program offers a small number of awards through the NIH Common Fund to support highly innovative research from promising ESIs. DP2 applicants can request up to $1.5 million in direct costs spread over the 5-year grant period. Data on the DP2 awards indicate that awardees have a higher rate of application for R01 awards compared to a matched cohort of ESIs who receive R01 awards, although DP2 awardees are not more successful at receiving an R01 award (National Institutes of Health, 2017). Although the DP2 award seems to be an important mechanism for supporting ESIs as they transition into research independence, NIH expects to make only 33 awards in 2018, depending on availability of funds in the NIH Common Fund. This represents a decrease from the 55 awards in 2017. 59 Developed in response to the National Academies Bridges to Independence report (National Research Council, 2005), NIH launched the K99/R00 Pathway to Independence awards in 2006 to 53 Data provided courtesy of NIH. 54 Data provided courtesy of NIH. 55 Open Mike Blog.

The K99/R00 award is intended to foster the development of a creative, independent research program that will be competitive for subsequent independent funding and that will help advance the mission of the NIH. 60 The K99/R00 award is unique among NIH awards in that it combines an initial mentored phase-a K99-supported postdoctoral position-with the investigator's first independent research support, the R00 phase. This award is available to individuals who have less than 4 years of postdoctoral training, and to non-U.S. citizens and physician-scientists. The K99 phase lasts a maximum of 2 years, and the R00 phase provides up to 3 years of independent research support for individuals who have secured an independent, tenure-track, or equivalent faculty position by the end of the K99 period. In 2016, 231 K99s were awarded with a success rate of 23 percent. 61 One recent analysis of the K99/R00 award reveals that recipients have a higher success rate for subsequent R01 and other grants compared to those supported on other K-series career development awards (Carlson et al., 2016). Additional support for ESIs from NIH includes several innovative Institutespecific programs that seek to support these researchers' transition to independence: the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Biobehavioral Research Awards for Innovative New Scientists (BRAINS) award, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA), and the NIH Director's Early Independence Award (DP5). Together, these programs fund only 100 or so awards per year. 62 The number of federal research awards to help investigators transition into independent faculty research positions is limited, and postdoctoral researchers are typically not prepared or, often even eligible, 63 to submit an R01 application prior to obtaining a faculty appointment. Funding for emerging investigators is generally provided by their host institutions, and universities have reported surges in the size of start-up packages offered to junior faculty. In testimony to the committee, committee member Nancy Andrews, former dean and vice chancellor for academic affairs at Duke University School of Medicine, confirmed this phenomenon: she observed that the current \"range for the amount of cash that basic science department assistant professors are offered is probably between about $800,000 and the highest I have heard is $3.5 million nationally . . . but more typically it would be something like $1.2 to $1.8 million, sometimes including three years of salary.\" These trends align with data revealing that higher education institutions are the second largest funder of basic science research in this country behind the government (Figure 2-12). This upward pressure may make K99/R00 award recipients more attractive for recruitment to faculty positions at academic institutions because they have been successful at obtaining NIH funding."}, {"section_title": "OTHER CHALLENGES IN PURSUING RESEARCH CAREERS", "text": "Funding remains the paramount concern for early-career scientists, but a 2016 survey of Nature readers highlighted additional areas of concern (Powell, 2016).

Of special concern for the biomedical research enterprise are the enduring barriers to independent faculty research careers faced by women and individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. As of 2016, women had equivalent NIH RPG success rates and representation in NIH research career development awards as their male counterparts, 66 yet the average total research grant size for men was nearly $75,000 more than for women. 67 Additionally, faculty positions are often required for eligibility to apply for an NIH grant, but between 2011 and 2012, women represented only 30 percent of biomedical faculty at the assistant, associate, and full professor levels (Valantine et 66 Research Career Development Award Recipients and Kirschstein-NRSA Trainees and Fellows: Representation of Women, by Activity and Career Stage. https://report.nih.gov/NIHDatabook/Charts/ Default.aspx?sid=0andindex=1andcatId=15andchartId=170 (accessed February 9, 2018). 67 Research Grants: Average Size, by Gender. https://report.nih.gov/NIHDatabook/Charts/Default. aspx?showm=YandchartId=173andcatId=15 (accessed February 9, 2018).

In fact, women represented only 32 percent of all NIH-supported investigators on RPGs. 68 It is unclear whether the high rate of attrition for women between Ph.D. attainment and faculty research positions is due to personal choice or hiring discrimination, but the 2007 National Academies report Beyond Bias and Barriers reported that women leave academia because of a lack of mentorship or guidance and difficulty managing family and career responsibilities, among many other socially and culturally influenced factors (National Academy of Sciences et al., 2007). These findings are consistent with those from a 2009 study that revealed that female Ph.D.'s with children, or planning to have children, opted out of the NIH R01 pool in favor of a career they believed would be more compatible with their family work-life plans (Ginther and Kahn, 2006). Despite longstanding efforts to increase racial and ethnic diversity in the biomedical research workforce, the proportion of individuals from underrepresented minority groups hired into faculty research positions and securing NIH RPGs has not matched their steady gains in Ph.D. attainment (Gibbs et al., 2016). A recent analysis by Meyers et al. 2018examining underrepresented minority research faculty participation at medical schools reveals significant retention issues between their postdoctoral experiences and faculty research positions. Once in faculty research positions, African Americans applicants experience significant disparities in R01-funding (Ginther et al., 2011). Additionally, African Americans proportionately resubmit fewer R01 applications than do White, Asian, or Hispanic applicants (National Institutes of Health, 2012b). In an analysis spanning 1999 to 2009, 73 percent of applications from African Americans were not discussed in NIH peer review, which may have impacted their resubmission rates (National Institutes of Health, 2012b). The decreased representation of underrepresented minority biomedical postdoctoral and faculty researchers coincides with a decline in NIH-supported training and career development programs with a focus on diversity and remains an area of continued concern (Valantine et al.,201 6). The challenges facing early-career biomedical researchers command urgent and sustained attention. In a Nature article, Jon Lorsch, head of NIGMS, said that the 2016 Nature survey results echo what he hears from early-career scientists as he travels nationwide: \"We risk losing a generation of researchers at the prime of their creativity and energy\" (Powell, 2016). The genesis of this report stems from concerns expressed by members of Congress that the nation's emerging biomedical 1 researchers face unprecedented, systemic challenges that limit their ability to begin and sustain their careers as independent investigators. As Chapter 1 argues and the data presented in Chapter 2 show, those concerns are well-founded. This and the following chapters present recommendations reflecting the committee's strong view that addressing these challenges and creating a better path forward for the nation's emerging biomedical researchers is not the sole responsibility of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), but is rather a shared responsibility of stakeholders throughout the entire biomedical research enterprise."}, {"section_title": "SHARED RESPONSIBILITY", "text": "The American biomedical research enterprise is a complex ecosystem that includes a range of public and private stakeholders with overlapping and sometimes conflicting interests, objectives, and incentives. The decisions of many of these stakeholders cannot help but affect the way in which the next generation of investigators are recruited into the system. For an enterprise dependent upon identifying, training, and recruiting a cadre of investigators, few well-established forums exist to consistently evaluate and discuss the consequences of widely distributed and seemingly unconnected decisions by these different stakeholders. Mainly, stakeholder engagement on the issues facing the biomedical research enterprise-including those affecting young investigators-has been episodic and uncoordinated. When and where it has occurred, engagement has taken the form of working groups, advisory councils, and ad hoc committees such as this one. These bodies have produced no shortage of recommendations addressed to different stake holders in the biomedical research system, such as federal funding agencies, research institutions, professional societies, private-sector organizations, principal investigators, and the young researchers themselves. These endeavors, however, tend to be sporadic and discrete, and thus do not maintain sustained stewardship of the enterprise. These advisory bodies usually disband after issuing their recommendations, so there is no sustained oversight or collaboration on what occurs afterwards. Those advisory bodies that do meet regularly-such as advisory councils at NIH-are designed principally to advise the federal government on its own functioning and decisions, rather than to serve as a venue for the multilateral exchange of ideas and information that bear on the responsibilities of everyone in the ecosystem. There is little in the way of regular, ongoing, and shared conversations among these stakeholders about how best to implement recommendations and advance common interests that benefit the entire biomedical research system (Daniels, 2015). Assessment of responses to prior recommendations (Appendix B) illustrates that NIH has been responsive to calls for action, but NIH is not, nor should be, the sole driver of efforts to support the next generation of researchers. The committee, therefore, has concluded that the need exists for an umbrella coordinating body to serve as an ongoing, independent forum for analyzing and addressing challenges confronting the biomedical workforce in a sustained manner, and to monitor implementation of the recommendations set forth in this and other reports. This body would include representatives from research universities, nonprofit advocacy associations, disciplinary societies, industry, NIH, and other federal agencies. A number of other areas of national policy priority that exhibit a close integration of public and private actors and a need for engaged action across a sector have benefited from standing multi-stakeholder bodies that promote the ongoing exchange of information and ensure sustained oversight of strategic initiatives. Examples include the protection of critical infrastructure, 2 standards-setting, 3 and 2 For example, Infragard is a network of 501(c)(3)-developed in the wake of Presidential Decision Direction 63 on critical infrastructure protection, and originally managed out of the National Infrastructure Protection Center and includes members from the Federal Bureau of Investigations, state law enforcement agencies, academia, other government agencies, business and other organizations, and was created to provide formal and informal channels to promote the exchange of information about how to protect our nation's critical infrastructures and key resources. 3 The American National Standards Institute is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization composed of government agencies, companies, academic and international bodies, and others that seeks to facilitate voluntary consensus standards and conformity assessment systems and to safeguard their integrity.

TRANSPARENCY, SHARED RESPONSIBILITY, AND SUSTAINABILITY 51 the interoperability of emergent technologies. 4 Each of these bodies is structured in a somewhat different way, and serves a somewhat different purpose, but common among them is a diverse membership across public and private stakeholders in service of a common goal, and a recognition that earlier siloed approaches to decision-making were inadequate to the challenges at hand. The time has arrived to create a similar coordinating council for the biomedical research enterprise-to serve as a consultative forum for analyzing and addressing issues confronting the biomedical workforce, assembling information and resources across the sector, monitoring implementation and assessing the impact of the recommendations set forth in this report, and developing and overseeing new initiatives in an ongoing manner. The committee recommends the establishment of the Biomedical Research Enterprise Council (BREC) to serve as this forum. Although the committee does not want to be too prescriptive in the structure of the BREC, because it expects the council will both want and need space to grow and adapt as needed over time, its success will depend in no small measure on decisions regarding its funding and membership. The committee comments briefly on both below."}, {"section_title": "Launching the BREC", "text": "The committee recommends that the BREC be an independent not-for-profit organization, to ensure that it can play a stewardship role on behalf of the full range of stakeholders. However, the committee recognizes that the first few years after the BREC launches will be critical in establishing its stability, trajectory, and sustainability. Therefore, the committee recommends that NIH play a temporarily outsized role in financing the BREC in its earliest stages. The committee expects that responsibility for support of the BREC soon thereafter will transition to the broader biomedical community (with some continuing support from NIH). The committee notes that a number of current examples of independent public-private bodies started their existence under the close sponsorship of a federal agency before transitioning to self-support. 5 In addition, there are now bodies supported initially by a federal agency, with the expectation that they would transition to self-support. For example, the Department of Energy formed the Gridwise Architecture Council (GWAC)-an entity with public and private member ship that seeks to advance interoperability among the entities that inter act with the nation's electric power system, and continues to provide the GWAC with administrative and logistical support, but \"operational assistance is expected to eventually transition to related industry organizations.\" 6 The committee notes that this and similar bodies do not set an exact precedent for the BREC, but have succeeded under a sequenced model of public funding followed by broader support that balances the need for early support and stability and long-term independence. The committee does not expect that the BREC will need an especially significant budget, anticipating that-at least initially-it will principally serve a convening function with a modest staff, and that the remainder of its budget will otherwise go to circumscribed tasks such as data collection and analysis. The participants in the BREC would be drawn from a diverse set of organizations and entities, including associations of academic institutions, federal agencies, industry groups, and not-for-profit organizations, including those that represent postdoctoral fellows and graduate students and those that advocate for the research enterprise. Membership can be set initially by an ad hoc sponsoring group consisting of the above stakeholder organizations, after which the BREC could choose its own members. The committee envisions that initially the BREC would be relatively modest in size, in the vicinity of 10 to 20 members. This number is small enough to allow for collaboration and effective deliberation, but large enough to represent the full scope of the biomedical research enterprise."}, {"section_title": "Long-Term BREC Structure", "text": "After the BREC is established and functional, it should transition to a selfsupporting model of funding. One option is a tiered fee schedule that varies based on the type (profit, nonprofit, university, government agency) and size of institution (annual revenue or operating budget), to ensure that all relevant stakeholders can participate. Here too, precedents can be found in existing multi-stakeholder bodies. 7 The committee cannot predict with absolute certainty that stakeholders will provide the entirety of the financial support necessary to fund the BREC once it transitions away from exclusive NIH funding. But we are encouraged by the precedents whereby a membership fee, either alone or combined with other funding sources, has been successful in supporting multi-stakeholder public-private bodies in other arenas. The committee considered alternatives to the creation of the BREC, such as remitting responsibility for the work to one of several existing scientific advisory bodies, such as the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, but found that those bodies tend to be structured principally to provide counsel to the government on the development of its own science 6 See https://www.gridwiseac.org/about/mission.aspx (accessed February 9, 2018). 7 An example is the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel.

The committee also canvassed alternative options for the structure of the BREC that involve less formality or less robust representation and funding, but ultimately concluded that the need for sustained, legitimate oversight and coordination for a sector that is so critical to the nation's social and economic welfare required the establishment of this organization. To do less would render the effort susceptible to criticism by excluded stakeholders. The numerous related committee and task force reports over the years on the biomedical workforce (see Appendix B) underscore the desirability of a more streamlined and formal institution. An assessment of the utility and effectiveness of the BREC should be conducted 5 years after its establishment. The committee envisions that the BREC would serve as a policy forum for conceptualizing and developing ideas focused on supporting early-career researchers, sharing information, convening workshops to assess progress, and evaluating and creating accountability for implementation of policy reforms. The BREC would anticipate future trends and needs in relation to challenges and opportunities confronting early-stage and early established investigators (ESIs and EEIs 8 ) and would examine the extent to which research institutions and the private sector are creating adequate opportunities for early-career researchers to thrive. The BREC could play an early role in data collection (see Recommendations 3.3 and 3.4), an area with meaningful and encouraging momentum but relatively little interaction between public and private groups on what should be collected and how. The BREC should also examine the extent to which federal programs and policies-including recommended new policies and programs from this report that are implemented by NIH-are having their intended effects to support the next generation of biomedical researchers. Therefore, the committee makes the following recommendation: "}, {"section_title": "INCREASING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION", "text": "One charge to the BREC would be to address the twin issues of disparity and inclusion. As described in Chapter 2, underrepresented minorities and women face enduring barriers to success, and the entire biomedical research enterprise must share responsibility for breaking down the barriers that prevent these populations from thriving and advancing in their chosen career paths. The capacity of the system to support the best science will be subverted if systemic barriers continue to thwart the recruitment of the brightest scientists irrespective of their race, gender, socioeconomic, or ethnic background. There is little consensus on the effectiveness of potential strategies for improving diversity in the biomedical sciences. Few studies have evaluated or tested the impact of these strategies on the diversity or climate of institutions, and no studies that the committee could find assessed interventions in a systematic way across different institutional contexts. Notably, NIH has undertaken an extensive and ongoing review of its practices to improve diversity of the biomedical workforce. As a result of that review, NIH created the Scientific Workforce Diversity Office and the Diversity Program Consortium, the latter of which consists of three integrated initiatives-Building Infrastructure Leading to Diversity (BUILD), the National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN), and the Coordination and Evaluation Center (CEC). The CEC pilots and conducts rigorous evaluation and assessment of possible intervention strategies. These programs, however, are supported by the NIH Common Fund, and are therefore not slated for funding after 10 years of operation. If the evaluations of these programs are positive, the nation's universities, research institutions, and government laboratories should draw on the findings to enhance their own diversity and inclusion initiatives in the biomedical arena. There is, in fact, growing evidence that institutional interventions aimed at enhancing workforce diversity can be effective. For instance, progress has been made in the development of strategies to increase gender representation among institutions participating in the NSF-ADVANCE program and of underrepresented populations in the National Insti tute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) Institutional Research and Academic Career Development Award (IRACDA) (K12) program. The IRACDA program, for example, funds postdoctoral training programs that combine a mentored research experience with an opportunity to develop additional academic and teaching skills. Currently, only 25 institutions have IRACDA programs, each supporting five to six postdoctoral researchers per year. A recent evaluation of the IRACDA program shows promising recruitment of underrepresented populations into the program, as well as a high rate of transition into academic careers compared to those postdoctoral researchers supported by Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Individual Postdoctoral Fellow ships (F32 award) over the same period (Faupel-Badger and Miklos, 2016). Although NIH's continuing commitment to enhancing the diversity of the biomedical research enterprise is laudable, it is not, nor should it be, the only stakeholder championing adoption of these effective programs. Universities are well-positioned to identify evidence-based practices for their institutions and to implement and scale those practices on their own, in parallel with NIH's efforts to develop evidence-based reform. Through their training, educational, mentoring, and coaching programs, the biopharmaceutical industry and health care accelerators and incubators are also committed to increasing the participation of underrepresented populations and women in their research workforce. Accord ingly, the committee makes the following recommendation to strengthen the excellence and diversity of the biomedical research enterprise: Recommendation 3.2 All stakeholders in the biomedical research enterprise-universities, research institutions, government laboratories, and biomedical industries-should promote, document, assess, and disseminate their existing and planned efforts to reduce the barriers to recruiting and retaining diverse researchers at all stages of career development."}, {"section_title": "INCREASING TRANSPARENCY", "text": "The community's responses to the Dear Colleague Letter (see Appendix C) revealed widespread concern about the paucity of accurate, timely data to guide decision-making by and about the biomedical workforce, a concern that previous reports have also raised. As Chapter 2 details, the time and investment committed to building a career in biomedical research is substantial, yet, too often, trainees lack the information needed to make informed choices about career and training opportunities that align with their interests and talents. This absence of information also likely contributes to disequilibrium in the workforce characterized by a mismatch between the career aspirations of trainees and the jobs available in specific sectors of the biomedical research enterprise, particularly tenure-track faculty positions , and it reduces the potential positive impact of the federal government's-and hence taxpayers'-investment in training biomedical researchers. There has been some promising recent activity with respect to collecting infor mation to guide graduate student career choices. For example, the NIH Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training (BEST) consortium requires its members to collect and disseminate information on graduate student career outcomes. Universities such as Stanford University and Vanderbilt have been early leaders, and, on September 20, 2017, the Association of American Universities (AAU) issued a policy statement calling on \"all Ph.D. granting universities and their respective Ph.D. granting colleges, schools and departments, to make a commitment to providing prospective and current students with easily accessible information.\" 9 The AAU statement stated explicitly that such data should include student demographics, average time to finish a degree, financial support, and career paths and outcomes both inside and outside academia. Other groups, such as Rescuing Biomedical Research 10 (RBR), the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS), and the newly formed Coalition for Next Generation Life Sciences (CNGLS) (Blank et al., 2017), are also mobilizing universities to improve transparency about Ph.D. career outcomes. RBR has worked with AAU, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), NIH, the BEST consortium, and numerous universities and other research organizations to develop a common set of methods for data collection on Ph.D. alumni and a common career outcomes taxonomy (Pickett and Tilghman, 2017). In October 2016, CGS announced a pilot program that will fund 15 universities to gather and use data about the careers of Ph.D. students and alumni in the humanities to support career development and mentoring, 11 and the Graduate Career Consortium has developed its own taxonomy for tracking Ph.D. career outcomes (Brinkman et al., 2017). In December 2017, CNGLS announced an agreement between its nine member universities and one research institution on a set of milestones for the next 2 years for collecting data on training outcomes for doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows, among other commitments. The presidents and chancellors of these universities acknowledged that \"the arguments in favor of transparency are sound, and the time has come for institutions to develop credible mechanisms that are responsive to these concerns\" (Blank et al., 2017(Blank et al., , p. 1389. The efforts mentioned above create an opportunity to guide the development of a multi-stakeholder plan for data transparency across research institutions and to ensure that data collection is consistent across universities and useful to trainees and policymakers alike. Given that universities are required to collect much of this information on trainees funded through NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA Institutional Research Training Grants (T32 award), and occasionally when hosting privately funded fellowships, the rationale for declining to share these data with prospective students is weak. Some institutions are not collecting and publishing such data because they fear that the necessary cost and time to do so would be prohibitive or that publication of career outcomes data would negatively affect their recruitment efforts, but the RBR effort found those fears to be unfounded. In fact, as the authors of a report on the RBR effort noted, \"Interviews of institutions that had collected and published data on their biomedical Ph.D. alumni suggested that many of these roadblocks could be overcome with efficient data collection and presentation programs, and that their commitment to transparency actually enhanced graduate student recruiting rather than diminishing it\" (Pickett and Tilghman, 2017, p.3). Previous reports have called on research institutions to collect information on training outcomes and to make that information easily accessible for their students and postdoctoral trainees, yet most institutions have been slow to respond to these recommendations.

TRANSPARENCY, SHARED RESPONSIBILITY, AND SUSTAINABILITY 57 going today to develop taxonomies for collecting data on educational and career outcomes for Ph.D. students will prompt the biomedical research community to join the burgeoning movement to increase transparency. Although it would be ideal for the community to reach consensus on one taxonomy, it is beyond the remit of this committee to recommend one taxonomy over another. At a minimum, though, the data collected should include Ph.D. completion rates, time to degree, length of time between attaining a Ph.D. and accepting an independent position, number and length of postdoctoral positions, and sector and location of employment for a minimum of 10 years after receiving the Ph.D., disaggregated to the extent possible by demographics, including gender, race and ethnicity, and visa status. Institutions should update these data on a regular schedule. Some research institutions have begun to clarify and narrow the number of titles and career tracks for postdoctoral researchers, which enable better collection on their status and outcomes, and other institutions should emulate this trend. In addition to being invaluable to our young scientists, these data are critical for sound policymaking. For example, there is a debate in the literature about whether the asymmetries that exist in the biomedical workforce justify more draconian interventions, such as limits on graduate enrollments Stephan, 2012). The case in favor of such caps is based in no small measure on the increasing number of postdoctoral trainees relative to the number of available academic positions and the large and growing number of individuals with biomedical doctorates working in non-research positions. However, before taking a step as dramatic as reducing the number of students admitted to biomedical Ph.D. programs, it is crucial to understand the actual population of trainees, the duration of postdoctoral training, career trajectories and aspirations of trainees, changes in these data over time, and the type of research versus non-research positions that Ph.D.'s ultimately secure, including data on whether these placements are in the United States or abroad. Furthermore, if trainees were given the agency to make informed career choices using robust and timely information, their actions might contribute to balancing the supply and demand. The committee makes the following two recommendations to address the need for increased transparency and data generation to support better private decisions and better policy development. NSF stands as the national clearinghouse of information collected through various surveys on science and engineering trainees and the workforce (see Box 3-1). Therefore, the committee recommends that NSF, which has developed an extensive infrastructure to collect these data, lead a renewed effort to improve the collection of sector-wide biomedical data, with an emphasis on standardizing, collecting, and synthesizing data from across the workforce. Currently, NIH contributes funds to support NSF's Survey of Doctoral Recipients and Survey of Earned Doctorates. Additional efforts to synthesize data would benefit from the empirical infrastructure built since 2015 by the Institute for Research on Innovation and Science (IRIS), which provides a platform for linking university administrative records with U.S. Census data, as well as administrative data with other databases, including patents and publications. 12 Among the early insights into the careers of researchers produced using IRIS data is a better understanding of the factors contributing to an aging science and engineering workforce  and the geographic locations and sectors employing recent science and engineering Ph.D.'s (Zolas et al., 2015). Given the promising nature of the IRIS system, the committee strongly urges that research institutions join the IRIS initiative. This system is consistent and aligned with recommendations made by the Commission on Evidence-Based Policy Making (Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking, 2017). There have been multiple efforts recently to collect data about portions of the workforce, and the NIH Office of Extramural Programs (OER) has played a leadership role in such efforts. The committee appreciates the analytical support that it received from OER during its deliberations. In 2015, NIH established the Division of Biomedical Research Workforce Programs (DBRW) 13 within OER in part to analyze biomedical research workforce data. However, these data are not comprehensive; NIH is largely limited to information about its own grant programs, and broader data about the workforce are neither comprehensive, precise, nor readily available.

As noted in Chapter 2, the decline in real dollars of federal research support has contributed directly to the many stresses facing the incoming generation of biomedical researchers. For example, ESIs securing their first NIH award must deal with the declining purchasing power of those awards. Over the past decade, the size of grant awards has not tracked with research inflation as measured by the Biomedical Research and Development Price Index calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Today, investigators must fund their research with an award that is worth approximately 80 percent of its value 10 years ago. 15 The decline in funding in constant dollars, and the resulting sharp increase in competition for the available funding, has also meant that NIH has had fewer opportunities to address enduring barriers to groundbreaking research for the next generation of biomedical researchers. Over the years, a series of thoughtful and evidence-based reports from a cadre of leaders in biomedical research have called for solutions. Many of these solutions have been reiterated in report after report, including doubling the number of Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) awards and the NIH Director's Early Independence Awards (DP5), with the goal of easing the transition of trainees to independent research positions, increasing the proportion of postdoctoral researchers supported by training grants and fellowships, and developing new programs for early faculty that seek to respond to particular barriers they face in developing new research programs (FASEB, 2015; Institute of Medicine et al., 2000; National Academy of Sciences et al., National Research Council, 2005). However, as highlighted in Appendix B, NIH has not fully implemented these recommendations. In addition, unpredictable funding or periodic surges and subsequent cuts in the NIH budget create issues for a research enterprise that depends on longterm planning and multi-year grants. These issues can place a unique burden on early-career investigators, who are especially vulnerable to unpredictable funding for NIH.

In August 2017, NIH launched the Next Generation Researchers Initiative (NGRI) specifically to provide additional funding for ESIs and EEIs to \"promote the growth, stability and diversity of the biomedical research workforce.\" 16 NIH Director Francis Collins explained in a June 8, 2017, letter that the funding required to carry out this policy would be drawn from commitments already made in the 2017 NIH base budget, and then, pending the availability of funds, investment in the initiative would increase to $1.1 billion per year after 5 years. Although the NGRI could address many of the funding challenges unique to ESIs and EEIs, its current structure requires NIH to support it with funds currently allocated to other initiatives and research needs. This would divert funds from more established investigators and would increase the hyper-competition for funding, threatening the sustainability of the enterprise and decreasing the amount of funds available for these researchers when they no longer qualify for an award under the NGRI. Therefore, to fully realize the promise of initiatives aimed at helping the next generation of biomedical researchers, including the NGRI and the recommendations in this report, Congress should provide new funds for their implementation in the same manner it has for initiatives such as the Human Genome Project, the Cancer Genome Atlas Project, the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative, and the NIH All of Us Research Study. To ensure consistent funding for the incoming generations of independent investigators and the vibrancy of the biomedical research enterprise and its workforce, Congress should increase its annual funding for NIH at a rate that is at least equal to the Biomedical Research and Development Price Index developed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. As noted throughout this report, evidence shows that securing federal research funding, particularly R01 support, has become increasingly competitive over the past decade. At the same time, because increases in federal support for NIH have been modest, the purchasing power of NIH grants have diminished over that period. This heightened competition affects all researchers, but especially early-career scientists without a strong record of grant success. The Statement of Task for this study explicitly requires the committee to analyze the full range of barriers and constraints to research opportunities for career researchers. It reads, in part, \"The study will include . . . an evaluation of the impact of federal policies and budgets. . . .\" Any serious effort to address the barriers faced by early-career scientists cannot ignore the challenges of reduced funding and more intense competition for scarce research dollars-to say nothing of the challenges presented by the lack of predictable, sustained funding that arises as a result of annual uncertainties in the Congressional appropriations process. As such, the committee includes a recommendation not only for support of new and enhanced programmatic initiatives at NIH, and more aggressive policies and programs at research institutions, but also for an increase in overall Congressional appropriations for NIH to support the NGRI and enable expansion of programs, such as the NIH BEST program, that address some of the early biomedical career issues discussed in this report. The committee is not proposing sweeping programs that require substantial money. Indeed, the financial scale of its recommendations, estimated to cost approximately $1 billion over 5 years, is small relative to that of research project grant funding, yet such funds would substantially increase resources available for training, mentoring, and sustaining the careers of ESIs. If Congress provides no additional funding for NIH, and funds cannot be reallocated within the agency, then many of the trends discussed throughout this report (e.g., increasing age to securing an R01-equivalent grant, decreasing representation of NIH-supported investigators under age 50, enduring barriers to diversifying the research workforce, and prevailing lack of accountability for the training and mentorship of postdoctoral researchers) may very well continue, or even worsen. If Congress provides no additional funding and NIH reallocates funds from research grants, then these problems could continue and even pose addi tional challenges when investigators try to secure subsequent NIH funding. As discussed throughout this report, additional considerations influence the trajectory of the biomedical workforce independent of funding. However, in the years since the 2005 Bridges to Independence report, congressional funding for NIH research has declined in real dollars, and although NIH has sought to commit funding and attention to address the challenges facing young investigators, a number of the recommendations were not fully implemented, and the problems have endured. A commitment of funding is necessary to bend the curve on these issues and to achieve the vision of a truly dynamic and innovative workforce system. Otherwise, we seem destined to repeat the lessons of the past. Therefore, the committee recommends the following: The federal government makes a substantial investment in future scientists through a variety of training and research grant mechanisms. These individuals make their own investment, by devoting upwards of 12 years of time, intellect, and skills to prepare for a career in biomedical research after obtaining a bachelor's degree. 1 Considering the magnitude of this public and private investment, it is imperative that they receive comprehensive and meaningful research training, mentorship, and, as discussed in Chapter 3, the information needed to find and then thrive in a career that aligns with their interests and talents. This is essential for the United States to retain its leadership role in biomedical research and advancements. As of 2013, 80 percent of U.S. biomedical Ph.D.'s enter postdoctoral research training after receiving their doctoral degrees . Most individuals enter into a postdoctoral research position with the intention of becoming an academic research faculty member , but only 18 percent ultimately secure tenure-track or tenured positions within 10 years of obtaining their doctorates (Figure 2-1). Others enter postdoctoral training to prepare for industry or other non-academic positions, while others do not state any clear career goal (Gibbs et al., 2015). As explained in Chapter 2, the postdoctoral experience should be a mentored transition to research independence with the purpose of providing additional scientific, technical, and professional skills to advance an individual's career. However, as also explained in Chapter 2, postdoctoral researchers have long been recognized as valuable to the research enterprise, \"performing a substantial portion of the nation's research in every setting\" (Institute of Medicine et al., 2000, p. 10). The tension between the roles of trainee and institutional employee can taint the postdoctoral experience and compromise opportunities for postdoctoral researchers to develop the skills needed for their eventual careers. Trainee status, for example, typically entails low wages relative to the postdoctoral researcher's educational background, and studies indicate that it can take up to 15 years after degree attainment for the postdoctoral cohort to catch up in salary compared to the non-postdoctoral cohort. To the extent that trainees are forgoing higher wages 2 and benefits for a limited time period in exchange for meaningful opportunities to advance their long-term career goals, this trade-off is not controversial. However, if trainees are languishing in low-paying jobs, not securing appropriate mentorship and training, not progressing steadily toward research independence, and not receiving counseling about other potential career tracks (i.e., as a staff scientist), the situation becomes deeply problematic and violates core academic norms and values. Although biomedical researchers throughout the enterprise face a variety of challenges during their research careers, 3 the challenges experienced during the postdoctoral research stage command explicit attention in this report (Gibbs et al., 2015;Institute of Medicine et al., 2000;National Academy of Sciences et al., 2014). To address these issues, the committee makes the following set of recommendations.  Table 3-18: Median salaries for recent U.S. SEH doctorate recipients in postdoc and non-postdoc positions up to 5 years after receiving degree: 2015. https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsb20181/assets/901/tables/tt03-18.pdf (accessed February 28, 2018). 3 The National Academies' Committee on Revitalizing Graduate STEM Education is addressing these same issues from the perspective of graduate training in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics."}, {"section_title": "TRAINING AND SUPPORT FOR ALL POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS", "text": "Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. For the purposes of this report, \"postdoctoral researchers\" are advanced trainees who, by definition, are entitled to receive training and mentoring regardless of the funding mechanism that supports them. This approach aligns with recommendations made by NIH, the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC), the National Postdoctoral Association (NPA), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 4 Currently, approximately 46 percent of biomedical postdoctoral researchers at universities are supported on research project grants (RPGs). 5 Unlike training grants and individual fellowships, RPGs do not explicitly require postdoctoral training or career development activities or reports on training outcomes. Further, the peer review process for RPGs focuses on the merit of the proposed project and does not assess the PI's training record or the quality of the experiences of postdoctoral researchers supported on the grant. Postdoctoral researchers supported on RPGs during their entire tenure lack external benchmarks (such as the need to develop their own research project for a fellowship application) that could encourage and recognize the development of research independence. In addition, RPGs are awarded to PIs and therefore are not portable by postdoctoral researchers, making them dependent upon the PI for salary and research support. Finally, the use of RPG funding for postdoctoral researchers makes it more difficult to monitor the number of postdoctoral researchers and to assess their career progress. Even if the number of fellowships and training grants were to be increased substantially as recommended below, postdoctoral researchers will remain supported largely through RPGs for the near future, given that only 10 percent of postdoctoral researchers are currently supported on federal fellowships and traineeships. 6 Nonetheless, select changes in the RPG application and peer review could hold both the PI and the institution accountable for postdoctoral research training and thereby reduce disparities between training experiences. To start, NIH should require that the \"Resources and Environment\" section in all grant applications includes an institutional training and mentoring plan, as well as an individualized plan that outlines the PI's commitment to the scientific and professional development of all postdoctoral research trainees. These additional requirements would build upon the existing requirement that NIH annual progress reports describe how individual development plans (IDPs) help to identify and promote the career goals of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers associated with NIH awards. 7 This recommendation encourages research institutions to take responsibility for developing robust training and mentoring programs for their postdoctoral researchers. This recommendation also contemplates a new mechanism to facilitate consideration by the researcher and their mentors of the researcher's credible career opportunities, based on their demonstrated commitment to, and capacity for, rigorous, creative, and meaningful independent research activity. This career guidance mechanism should be documented and should occur between the first Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The committee envisions that every postdoctoral researcher would receive a written career guidance report that is signed by the PI and researcher and co-signed by the departmental head/chair. A final report would be included in any RPG or fellowship proposal that requests continued funding for that postdoctoral researcher. Following that report, each postdoctoral researcher would propose a concrete career plan, such as an IDP. Those aspiring to an academic research career would be expected to apply for an F or K award to continue preparation for an independent research career. Those ending their postdoctoral training would receive a reasonable time period to secure other employment. The discussions about career opportunities should cover a diversity of career paths, because the majority of biomedical Ph.D.'s do not transition into academic research positions (National Institutes of Health, 2012). The collection of a modest fee for each postdoctoral researcher would create a partial funding source for institutional programs, including those that enhance training activities that occur outside the research laboratory, and would provide postdoctoral trainees with the resources, skills, and knowledge needed to succeed within and outside of academe. The imposition of an explicit, transparent fee in the RPG also reinforces the mentorship and training responsibilities of PIs and their home institutions. The amount of $1,000 is not so large that it will disrupt the RPG budgets, but is large enough to not only contribute funds to institutional programs, but also make PIs more cognizant of non-salary costs to employ and train postdoctoral researchers and to consider these costs when deciding whether or not to hire a postdoctoral researcher. 8 For institutions employing fewer than 100 postdoctoral researchers, the sum raised will be relatively modest but sufficient to encourage them to augment programs to enhance the training and employability of their postdoctoral researchers. Federal funding agencies should make this fee an allowable and itemized direct cost budget item, and institutions should be accountable for and report the use of the fee. Regarding the specific training that postdoctoral researchers should expect to receive, the committee endorses the six core competencies cited by the National Postdoctoral Association: (1) discipline-specific conceptual knowledge, (2) research skill development, (3) communication skills, (4) professionalism, (5) leadership and management skills, and (6) responsible conduct of research. 9 Peer review for grant proposals should evaluate both laboratory-based and institutional plans for trainees, adopting these competencies as criteria and rating as \"ACCEPTABLE/UNACCEPTABLE,\" analogous to evaluations of the use of human subjects, the inclusion of children in research, and the use of vertebrate animals. Any concerns should be resolved before applications are recommended for funding. Currently, stipends paid to postdoctoral researchers supported on RPGs are at the discretion of the PI. Although institutions establish guidelines, they may be optional or not enforced. Postdoctoral Experience Revisited (National Academy of Sciences et al., 2014) includes a recommendation that postdoctoral research salaries start at $50,000 in 2014 dollars. The committee considers this recommendation sound and endorses its adoption for all starting postdoctoral researchers. NIH has already revised NRSA stipend levels since the publication of this 2014 report, and many institutions base their postdoctoral research salary guidelines on these levels (National Academy of Sciences et al., 2014). Encouragingly, recent survey data show that institutions employing 60 percent of the U.S. postdoctoral population have instituted policies to raise postdoctoral salaries (Bankston and McDowell, 2017). The committee believes that this salary level should be adjusted periodically for inflation (meaning that the baseline salary would be $52,700 in 2018 dollars 10 ) and for local cost-of-living increases (using existing federal guidelines). Institutions should also provide postdoctoral researchers with fringe benefits appropriate for advanced trainees as cited by the National Postdoctoral Association 11 and should make these benefits equitable across the institution, regardless of the source of postdoctoral research support. The dependent status of most postdoctoral researchers-including a lack of job security, an inability to transfer salary support to a different laboratory, and the fact that their advisor will serve as a professional reference-renders them particularly vulnerable to instances of unfair or exploitative treatment. Therefore, each institution should appoint an ombudsperson to fairly and expeditiously resolve conflicts and concerns between PIs and postdoctoral researchers related to training experience, authorship disputes, and other matters. To be effective and credible, the office must be an impartial and independent actor and not saddled with responsibilities outside its narrow mandate (i.e., the broad employment and training issues relevant to postdoctoral researchers)."}, {"section_title": "OPTIMIZING THE DURATION AND SUPPORT MECHANISMS FOR POSTDOCTORAL TRAINING", "text": "All postdoctoral researchers should be offered a mentored transition to independence and opportunities to develop skills and acquire substantive knowledge in their area of intended research.

Many argue that 5 years is an appropriate timeframe (see Appendix B) for postdoctoral researchers to complete training in preparation for an independent research career, while protecting them from languishing in a professional rank with little opportunity for career advancement. In the current climate, however, 5 years may not provide enough time for postdoctoral fellows to compete successfully for an academic research position. At the same time, 5 years is too long for timely consideration of other research and non-research career options. Although adopted by many universities, there has been little evidence that the 5-year rule on its own has substantially shortened the length of time spent in postdoctoral research positions, or has led to marked improvements in the training or mentoring experiences of postdoctoral researchers . As discussed above and in Chapter 2, there are several respects in which RPGs present suboptimal training and mentoring support for postdoctoral researchers as compared to individual fellowships or mentored awards. Postdoctoral researchers on fellowships performed better on all outcomes compared to postdoctoral researchers on RPGs and training grants (National Institutes of Health, 2012). Indeed, it has been identified as potentially disadvantageous for underrepresented populations to be supported on RPGs rather than fellowship mechanisms (Working Group on Diversity in the Biomedical Research Workforce, 2012). Because PIs spend a large percentage of their time applying for funding, grantsmanship is a key skill for research independence in academia. Therefore, applying for an individual fellowship should become a standard practice during the postdoctoral training experience. Thus, postdoctoral researchers would be better served if they secured their own support through individual awards that \"diminish the employment relationship between postdoc and principal investigator\" (National Research Council, 2005, p. 5). Although many PIs meaningfully train and mentor the postdoctoral researchers supported on their RPGs, it is challenging to guarantee these experiences for all postdoctoral researchers under an RPG where the primary accountable party is the PI. In the public input received by this committee, a broad array of individuals and organizations shared the view that postdoctoral researchers should receive mentored training. As examples from the latter, the AAMC stated that \"the research community should begin to dis entangle 'workforce' from 'training',\" and the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology recommended action to \"help mitigate the current dualism that graduate students and postdoctoral researchers face as trainees AND employees.\" To address this persistent challenge, the committee recommends an approach to ease postdoctoral researchers off a funding mechanism that does not explicitly promote a mentored transition to an independent career, while also presenting a natural check-point, well before the 5-year mark, that motivates postdoctoral researchers and their advisers to actively consider the researcher's training and career trajectory. Therefore, the committee recommends the following: Postdoctoral training should be limited to 5 years, after which time any postdoctoral researcher continuing in the same laboratory should be shifted to employment as a staff scientist with an increase in salary and benefits as appropriate for a permanent staff member. Recommendations 4.2,4.3,and 4.4 are premised on the belief that limiting the time postdoctoral researchers are supported on an RPG rather than fellowship will diminish the risk that the researcher will linger in a research position without clear and meaningful opportunities for advancement, training, and mentorship. Recommendation 4.2 seeks to address the concern that the current number of available fellowships is much smaller than the number of postdoctoral researchers, and it has declined in real terms over time even though previous reports have recommended its increase, as noted in Appendix B. Of postdoctoral researchers specifically supported by NIH in 2016, approximately 79 percent were supported on RPGs and 19 percent on a fellowship or traineeship. 12 To begin to shift the training system away from RPGs and toward a more beneficial platform for the next generation of researchers, the committee strongly advocates for a substantial increase in the proportion of postdoctoral researchers supported by F-type and K-type awards. These awards enable postdoctoral researchers to pursue research of their own design, and their portability ensures a suitable mentoring experience by tying the postdoctoral researchers to a project rather than a particular PI. Furthermore, peer review of F-and K-type applications ensures that postdoctoral fellows are selected for their potential to make significant scientific contributions rather than to serve as a productive subordinate. The committee specifically recommends increases in independent F-and K-type awards rather than training grants. The committee considered various increases in F-and K-type awards, including a 10-fold increase. However, the committee concluded that a 5-fold increase in the number of F-and K-type awards over 5 years is preferable. Slightly more than 1,200 F-type awards 13 and nearly 1,000 K-type awards 14 were distributed in 2016, and a 5-fold increase would represent a substantial increase in the number of fellowships and career development awards and would help to transform the training landscape. These awards are not intended to increase the size of the postdoctoral researcher popula- 12 NSF.

To the committee's knowledge, this recommendation is the first of this kind to set a concrete goal for such an increase. The committee recognizes the possibility that a large, non-staged increase could have unintended consequences for other aspects of the biomedical research enterprise, including the number and size of research grants, increased pressure on award reviewers, and the functioning and operation of laboratories. In particular, an expansion of F-and K-type awards might unintentionally penalize applications from postdoctoral researchers in the labs of early-stage investigators (ESIs) if they were deemed less competitive than those in the labs of established investigators. The increase from 8 percent to 16 percent for indirect costs on F-and K-type awards is necessary to cover the incremental costs of multiple demands on training institutions to improve monitoring and reporting of the professional development and mentoring that trainees receive. Without a significant increase in the indirect costs associated with training grants, the new requirements outlined throughout this report would amount to an unfunded mandate and, as a result, would likely not be acted on in the manner needed. Recommendation 4.3 creates an expectation that postdoctoral researchers who continue in positions supported by RPGs for more than a certain time period must transition to F-and K-awards (or similar awards from non-federal sources). This recommendation seeks to reinforce the decision point when the postdoctoral researcher and mentor should assess the researcher's potential to develop an independent research project. This decision point is not meant to determine a researcher's subsequent career choice; rather, it is meant to require the researcher to design and propose a fellowship project as a milestone on the path toward independence. The committee suggests 3 years as an appropriate timeframe to support a postdoctoral fellow on an RPG, but recognizes that this timeframe should be examined in the pilot study (or studies). It is instructive that the authoring committee of Bridges to Independence expressed its hope that \"the normal length of postdoctoral training will be closer to 3 years, whether in one or multiple environments. This is consistent with an overall training period-including graduate and postdoctoral training-of no more than 10 years\" (National Research Council, 2005, p. 5). The committee recognizes, however, that in the current labor market, few postdoctoral researchers can compete for an independent position after only 3 years. Therefore, postdoctoral researchers with strong potential to establish their own research programs (from all populations, including non-domestic, underrepresented ethnic and racial minorities, women, and individuals with disabili-Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved."}, {"section_title": "TRANSITIONING TO INDEPENDENCE 75", "text": "ties) should continue their work on a funding mechanism that nurtures and promotes the development of their independence. For postdoctoral researchers who are phasing out after 3 years on an RPG, there must be an adequate number of oppor tunities for additional (but time-limited) support in the form of grants, fellowships, or awards that will allow them to complete their postdoctoral work and advance toward an independent academic research appointment-either in the United States or abroad. The committee does not envision that the 3 years of support on research grants must run consecutively. One scenario for application of the cap could be 3 years of support on the PI's grant, and then a fellowship or career development award, but other scenarios are possible. The suggested 3-year cap should include a grace period of at least 1 year for parental leave to ensure that researchers with increasing family responsibilities are not selectively harmed by this policy change. The committee is mindful as well that the success of this recommendation depends on the application of a universal definition of a postdoctoral researcher, as noted in Chapter 2. Postdoctoral researchers who remain on a RPG for more than 3 years should be identified as a staff or career scientist and compensated accordingly. The committee recognizes these recommended changes to current funding policies could have unpredictable effects on the incentives and conduct of researchers. Committee members had diverse and intensely held opinions about the likely impacts of implementing a 3-year cap on support from RPGs. In the end, committee members agreed that before any cap is instituted, NIH should develop one or more pilot studies to assess the feasibility of the recommendation and its consequences for research personnel across the biomedical research enterprise. These studies should begin expeditiously, be designed with sufficient size and duration for adequate assessment and evaluation, and be monitored by both NIH and the proposed Biomedical Research Enterprise Council (BREC). The studies should explore different mechanisms for implementing a 3-year cap on support from RPGs, as well as expansion of funding mechanisms to provide researchers who have demonstrated the capacity and inclination for an academic research career, with additional but limited time to complete their research projects and secure an academic appointment. The committee is aware that the current number of postdoctoral awards is grossly insufficient to support postdoctoral researchers who would, under the suggested 3-year cap, be required to transition from RPGs. An additional and serious complication relates to the current restrictions on the capacity of foreign postdoctoral researchers to be supported on F-type training fellowships, T-type institutional training grants, or K-type mentored career awards, with the exception of the K99/R00 Pathway to Independence award. Currently, 53 percent of the postdoctoral researchers at U.S. academic institutions 16 are not eli-gible for support on federal fellowships and training grants. If the eligibility criteria are not changed, then the imposition of a 3-year cap on support from RPGs would deprive the enterprise of access to a large and outstanding cadre of talent and would have a devastating impact on the quality of the current workforce. Therefore, prior to implementation of a 3-year cap, along with the pilot studies, there should be action on Recommendation 4.2, that is, to increase the numbers of individual F-and K-type awards that are not restricted to U.S. citizens and permanent residents. In addition, there should be a transitional period between the last fellowship decision received by a postdoctoral researcher and termination of their support on an RPG. The committee remands to NIH the responsibility of developing any additional steps that are necessary to effectively shift postdoctoral researchers from funding on RPGs to fellowships at the end of 3 years. These steps could include expansion in the number or eligibility of certain other existing awards and creation of a new award tailored to the needs of this population. The model of a temporally phased approach to postdoctoral training presents an opportunity to experiment with entirely new modes of funding, and the committee encourages NIH to make ample use of this opportunity. 17 More generally, in designing the proposed pilot study, NIH should consider the many complexities that may arise with implementation of a new cap of this type. These may include, but are not limited to \u2022 the implications for PIs, including, in particular, the potential for a negative impact on newly established and resource-limited laboratories and ESIs; \u2022 the consequences of imposing rigid timing constraints for independent research career progression, especially for underrepresented groups, including women, ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities; \u2022 the potential to favor incremental or conservative research over more inno vative proposals if postdoctoral researchers must compete successfully for fellowships in their second year; \u2022 the potential for an adverse effect on internationally trained Ph.D.'s; and \u2022 the consequences of differential overhead rates on research grants versus fellowship (F-type) and career development (K-type) awards. If due care is not taken in addressing these issues, widespread and consistent imposition of the cap could very well harm the populations that this recommendation is intended to benefit-especially ESIs and individuals already underrepresented in the biomedical research fields.

Finally, Recommendation 4.4 endorses recommendations from earlier reports that postdoctoral training on any funding mechanism be limited to 5 years (Appendix B). After 5 years, any postdoctoral researcher continuing in the same laboratory should be shifted to employment as a staff scientist with an increase in salary and benefits appropriate for a permanent staff member. However, postdoctoral researchers should be allowed to request a short extension beyond the 5 years to account for unplanned circumstances or parental responsibilities. Taken together, these recommendations seek to engage an enduring concern, one expressed in numerous earlier reports, that most postdoctoral researchers are supported for extended periods of time on RPGs that do not adequately promote their mentorship, training, or transition to independence. RPGs enable the PI to use postdoctoral researchers as technicians who are expected to execute predefined aims. Under these conditions, many postdoctoral researchers face barriers to cultivating independence. It was not always this way; the percentage of postdoctoral researchers supported on these mechanisms has skyrocketed in recent years. These recommendations seek to ease the postdoctoral research population away from this funding mechanism. While acknowledging all of these complexities and their diverse opinions about the potential implications of these recommendations, the committee members were unanimous in the belief that the postdoctoral experience should be considered a period of mentored transition to independence and that an enforceable, innovative, and tested mechanism is necessary to promote the career progression to independent careers. Previous recommendations have fallen short of stimulating the action needed to transform this crucial career stage. The system is now primed for innovative, rather than incremental, systemic change-if done deliberately and with care. outside of academia would be an individual grant mechanism geared toward promoting entrepreneurship in the small business environment. Small business has long been recognized as \"critical to the nation's economic strength, to building America's future, and to helping the United States compete in today's global marketplace.\" 18 In 1982, Congress created the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program to encourage small businesses to develop new processes and products and to provide quality research in support of the U.S. government's missions. In 1992 it created the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program to expand partnership opportunities for small business and nonprofit research institutions by requiring small business recipients to collaborate with academic research institutions. 19 The SBIR/STTR program is overseen by an interagency committee co-chaired by the White House Office of Science and Technology and Policy and the Small Business Administration, and it is implemented through 11 federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In 2015, HHS awarded $813.8 million in SBIR/STTR funds, with the majority provided by NIH. 20 In light of the 2016 21st Century Cures Act 21 and 2017 American Innovation and Competitiveness Act, 22 which includes a focus on the next generation of researchers and the promotion of scientific entrepreneurship, the committee examined whether the central structure of the SBIR/STTR program as implemented by HHS should be modified to align with the goals of those laws. The development of programs and support mechanisms that encourage early-career researchers to engage with the small business enterprise can provide critical preparation for biomedical research trainees, including postdoctoral researchers, to become biomedical innovators and advance economic growth. To achieve this endpoint, the NIH SBIR/STTR program should be modified to enable grants/contracts to small businesses that aim to reduce the cost of research.

Congress and NIH should build on that precedent by adapting other mechanisms not currently linked to the SBIR/STIR program to promote entrepreneurship in the next generation of researchers. For example, a mechanism similar to the NIH Pathways to Independence Award (K99/R00) could be developed within the SBIR program to provide mentoring for early-career scientists and aids their transition to independence within the small business ecosystem, rather than academia. In the same way, a model similar to the Research Supplements to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research program, which provides earmarked funding for established scientists to mentor diverse trainees interested in pursuing careers in health-related research, could be developed within the SBIR/STTR program to promote diversity in the small business-driven ecosystem.

Second, tax credits in the form of wage subsidies for Ph.D.'s have been found to have a positive effect on the number of Ph.D. researchers hired by Belgian firms (Dumont, 2015). They have also been shown to be effective in stimulating R&D hiring by firms that have previously not engaged in research (Neicu et al., 2016). Moreover, the tax credit provides opportunities to target certain types of firms. By way of example, and consistent with the recommendation designed to stimulate entrepreneurial activity on the part of recently trained biomedical researchers, the credit could be higher for small-to medium-sized R&D firms or for young innovative companies. Such a policy would be similar to one in Belgium that provides a tax exemption on wage subsidies associated with recruiting and hiring scientists for young innovative companies and research organizations (Dumont, 2015). Chapter 2 chronicled the challenges that early-career investigators face as they transition to and sustain research independence. In this chapter, the committee identifies a series of reforms to the existing biomedical 1 ecosystem designed to create stronger and more easily navigable pathways to independent research opportunities for investigators regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, visa status, or degree. If adopted, these reforms would provide stable and supportive platforms for success at each stage in a researcher's career, while ensuring that the most promising candidates proceed to the next stage of training and mentorship and that robust exit opportunities exist for those who choose not to progress to an academic appointment. An ideal ecosystem would strike a balance between low-risk and high-risk lines of research, between basic and applied research, and between opportunities to work independently or as part of a team of independent investigators. It would also provide appropriate mentoring and financial support in a manner that does not place an arbitrary and undue burden on young scientists from any background, but instead creates equitable opportunities for all qualified investigators to succeed. As highlighted in commissioned papers by international contributors, 2 the U.S. biomedical research ecosystem is not unique in the challenges facing younger investigators or in its desire to attract and retain the best and the brightest in rewarding research careers. Canada, for example, has been working to rejuvenate its biomedical research workforce in the face of declining federal research funds and increasing pressures on entry-level academic positions resulting from 5 Building a Better Ecosystem for Independence an end to mandatory retirement in universities and colleges. The European Union is grappling with its own misalignment between the supply of and demand for trainees, availability of faculty positions, and the need to train young scientists for diverse careers. The countries that provided input to the committee are addressing many issues similar to those experienced in the United States: \u2022 whether to allocate additional funds set aside for early-career investigators; \u2022 whether to increase the size and duration of funding for these investigators; \u2022 how to avoid unintended consequences for mid-career investigators seeking follow-on funding; and \u2022 how to monitor success of these populations in systems under stress. The committee strongly endorsed the urgent need to solve the persistent and severe structural issues described in Chapter 2 that impact early-career investi gators. These issues command deliberate attention from and action by all stakeholders, including the federal government, academic and research institutions, and industries in the biomedical space. The committee's recommendations are predicated on the strong belief that collaboration from all stakeholders will be required to strengthen the system in the manner envisaged by this committee. The committee strongly supports NIH's recent announcement of the Next Generation Researchers Initiative (NGRI) and encourages Congress to allocate new funds to support this initiative. NIH should evaluate on a regular basis its new programs with the goal of expanding those that prove effective at addressing the challenges that ESIs and early established investigators (EEIs) face as they attempt to become independent investigators. The committee also commends NIH's support of ESIs who pursue R01 awards through previous ESI-specific policies, including preferential paylines and segregated review. These efforts have had a positive impact on the success rates for the intended applicant pools (see Figure 2-4). In the past, most R01-equivalent grants were funded for 5 years, but the duration and number of R01 awards have decreased as the number of applicants has increased out of proportion to the NIH budget. Initial NIH funding for ESIs should be long enough in duration and large enough in amount to support establishment of new, independent research programs. We recommend 5 years and at least $250,000 per year of direct cost. Furthermore, NIH should consider exempting the first R01 for ESIs from administrative cuts after the grant is awarded so that those investigators are not penalized as they establish their programs. In 2007, NIH unveiled the DP2 to support highly innovative research from exceptionally creative ESIs. DP2 applicants can request up to $1.5 million in direct costs over the 5-year grant period. Although the DP2 award appears to be an excellent mechanism to support ESIs who plan innovative projects, NIH expects to make only 33 awards in 2018, depending on the availability of funds in the NIH Common Fund. 3 Given that the DP2 award has successfully motivated early-career investigators to propose and conduct inno vative, high-risk, and impactful biomedical and bio-behavioral research, NIH should encourage Institutes and Centers to implement similar mechanisms, such as the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)'s Biobehavioral Research Awards for Innovative New Investigators (R01) award. Many organizations that responded to the Dear Colleague Letter (Appendix C) strongly urged expansion of the DP2 program. The committee requests that NIH expand the number of DP2 awards and mount a pilot project to determine whether there are tangible advantages to increasing the duration of the DP2 and similar awards, such as the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke's Research Program (R35) award with an 8-year duration, the National Cancer Institute (NCI)'s Outstanding Investigator Award (R35) with a 7-year duration, and the National Institutes of General Medical Science's MERIT (R37) award with a potential 8-to 10-year duration. The benefits could include, but are not limited to, higher success rates for securing subsequent NIH awards, increased publication and citation rates, or increased willingness to undertake higher risk research. In 2006, NIH established the NIH K99/R00 award to \"help outstanding postdoctoral researchers with a research and/or clinical doctorate degree complete needed, mentored career development and transition in a timely manner to independent, tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions.\" 4 Recipients of the K99/R00 award have been found to have a higher success rate for subsequent R01-equivalent awards compared to new ESIs and are more persistent in obtaining subsequent grant support (Carlson et al., 2016). In addition, a 2014 analysis by Grantome found that close to 60 percent of 2007 K99 awardees became the PI on a research project grant (RPG), compared to less than 20 percent for postdocs supported on F32 awards (Grantome, 2014). The committee commends NIH for developing a program that artfully connects training and independence, and recommends that NIH consider expanding this program with some modifications, such as extending the length of the R00 portion of the grant beyond 3 years, ceasing funding of applicable indirect costs from the R00 portion of the grant, 5 and decreasing the emphasis on the new/additional training component of the K99 proposal."}, {"section_title": "BUILDING A BETTER ECOSYSTEM FOR INDEPENDENCE 85", "text": "To improve the review process for ESIs, NIH identifies ESI applications when they are assigned to a study section so that appropriate consideration of career stage can be applied during review. To facilitate this effort, ESI applications are clustered, or reviewed together, to enable evaluation as a group, and NIH instructs peer reviewers to focus more on the proposed approach than on the track record and to expect less preliminary data than might be provided by an established investigator. NIH requires a standardized biosketch to accompany every grant application. The biosketch highlights an individual's qualifications for the proposed research project. In the current application format, applicants describe their major contributions and list four to five publications that reflect each contribution. Since the current biosketch format focuses on the totality of the researcher's career, and places less emphasis on recent productivity, it could advantage more established over younger investigators in the review process. Revising the biosketch requirement to emphasize recent productivity could help to level the playing field for ESIs. Canada adopted a similar approach, whereby applicants for Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) grants are assessed on the quality and impact of their contributions to research over the past 6 years instead of the duration of their careers. 6 All investigators, but particularly ESIs, would benefit from increased diversity on the review panels. The committee also recommends that NIH expand the number of junior investigators who serve as ad hoc members on review committees and afford them an opportunity to learn more about the peer review process. In addition, NIH should continue to develop training strategies to address implicit biases in peer review. Data reveal that grants submitted by members of underrepresented minority groups (Ginther et al., 2011) receive lower priority scores than those submitted by their white counterparts. The committee applauds NIH for its current efforts and notes that current studies are under way to identify effective remediation strategies. 7 The committee requests quick dissemination of these studies' findings and full funding of any additional research needed to promote equity during the peer review process. Relatively few established paths exist for researchers who pursue research at academic institutions as non-faculty researchers, often referred to as staff scientists. These positions often do not include clear opportunities for career advancement, and they rarely allow access to the professional resources available to faculty and trainees. In many cases, staff scientists work in the laboratories of individual PIs and are not encouraged to secure independent research support. In addition, few funding mechanisms are dedicated to supporting professional, non-faculty researchers in academia, and staff scientists who receive an NIH grant find it difficult to sustain their careers because of federal prohibitions against spending time writing grants when they are supported by a federal grant (Carpenter, 2012). The lack of clarity around established career paths at many universities other than academic faculty positions is a flaw in today's academic biomedical enterprise. This flaw contributes to many of the issues discussed in this report, including the backlog of postdoctoral researchers and confusion and frustration on the part of trainees and PIs. Promotion of a staff scientist track as an attractive and viable research career choice in academia-one with stability and professional recognition and status as well as opportunities for progressive advancement-would provide a career path for individuals who are interested in academic research but are not interested in an academic faculty position. This action would help to bring the biomedical system into greater equilibrium, though it is possible that the increased use of staff scientists could impact the downstream availability of faculty positions, a possibility that will require careful monitoring to avoid. At many institutions, it is staff scientists who manage the sophisticated research technologies located in core and other shared facilities. These services and technologies are essential to the success of biomedical investigators' endeavors and therefore the overall biomedical research enterprise. Therefore, programs to support a unique class of independent or semi-independent staff scientists are needed. Many will be leaders of scientific core facilities or shared resources, and while they will enjoy a degree of independence, they will nearly always focus on providing collaborative support and making critical research technologies accessible. This recommendation is intended to further the development of a cadre of staff scientists, provide research-based opportunities for academic scientists beyond a faculty research appointment, and support advancement of the nation's biomedical research. Recognition of the role for staff scientists in the research enterprise is growing. Academic institutions such as the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Janelia Research Campus, the Salk Institute of Biological Sciences, NIH Clinical Center, NIH intramural laboratories, and Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The Broad Institute is notable for its Institute Scientist initiative and for employing more than 400 staff scientists (Hyman, 2017). In recognition of the key role that staff scientists can play in advancing complex scientific projects, the NCI launched in 2015 a new Research Specialist Award (R50) pilot program for exceptional scientists who want to pursue research within the context of an existing cancer research program, but not serve as independent investigators. The R50 is intended to provide desirable salaries and sufficient autonomy so that individuals are not solely dependent on grants held by PIs for career continuity. However, meaningful evaluation of the potential impact of staff scientist or equivalent positions will depend on the design of new programs that extend beyond NCI and can fund more than a few dozen positions. This area is well suited for funding experimental pilot projects, and NIH and universities alike should explore development of programs that provide support for original research projects conducted by staff scientists. These programs should be open to qualified scientists regardless of visa status. In addition, institutional leadership will need to nurture an environment that supports staff scientists and attracts high-caliber investigators who want to work in non-faculty academic positions. The nature of pilot projects differs from that of RPGs; therefore, the metrics for their evaluation should be considered carefully. Evaluation criteria should aim to capture the holistic contributions of the scientist and could include contributions to published work noted in authorship, contributorship (Rennie et al., 1997;Sauermann and Haeussler, 2017) or acknowledgement, contributions to data that result in successful grant funding, and the breadth and numbers of different independent researchers that are assisted. In addition, NIH or the National Science Foundation (NSF) should track the career paths of staff scientists in the same ways that this report recommends they track the career paths of postdoctoral researchers (see Recommendation 3.3). Many of the responses to the Dear Colleague Letter (Appendix C) highlighted the need to better support staff and professional scientists given their contributions to the biomedical research enterprise. Based on the findings of its working group to study the issues confronting staff scientists, the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) is planning a study to collect data on the cost, efficiency, and productivity of staff scientists as a means to develop guidance for the research community on how best to incorporate staff scientists into its operations. The ASBMB working group proposed that institutions create individual development plans for staff scientists to ensure they receive some degree of professional development and career advice. In a 2015 report, Sustaining Discovery (FASEB, 2015, p. 5), the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) called for the research community to employ more staff scientists and to consider more extensive use of career technicians, as have others (Pickett et al., 2015). The ability of science to promote worldwide health and prosperity requires a culture that supports and sustains a diverse and innovative biomedical workforce, but recent studies suggest that women-particularly women of colorand individuals from underrepresented populations (Hispanic or Latino, African American, American Indian and Alaska Native) experience higher rates of attrition in the transition from Ph.D. to academic faculty positions (Gibbs et al., 2014(Gibbs et al., , 2016. Research into why improvements in gender, race, and ethnicity representation at the doctoral level are not reflected at the postdoctoral researcher and faculty career stages is ongoing, as is research on how best to restructure training, mentoring, and faculty hiring practices to reverse this trend. One obvious priority is to address concerns about the effect of current hiring, tenure, and promotion policies on diversity and inclusion. These concerns arise from evidence-based observations about the enduring challenge of increasing faculty diversity. The first observation from recent studies is that the improved diversity in the ranks of trainees has not carried forward to the ranks of tenured professors (Finkelstein et al., 2016;Gibbs et al., 2016;Li and Koedel, 2017). At most academic medical centers, for example, promotion rates for African American and Hispanic faculty were lower than those for their non-Hispanic white peers (Nunez-Smith et al., 2012). In one set of studies in European countries, where faculty tenure and promotion decisions are made by randomly assigned committees, the promotion chances of female candidates for faculty promotion were diminished if they were assigned to an all-male review committee rather than a mixed-gender review committee (De Paola and Scoppa, 2015;Zinovyeva and Bagues, 2010). Establishing institution-wide and laboratory-specific diversity and inclusion plans would go a long way in encouraging research institutions and their PIs to participate actively in addressing underrepresentation in the scientific research workforce. The committee applauds the National Institute of General Medical Sciences' recently announced plans to require institutions to report evidence-rigorous review criteria and now requires the student or fellow supported by a diversity supplement to write an individual proposal within 2 years of receipt of support from this program. This approach should be extended to Next Generation Researchers Initiative-Diversity Supplements (NGRI-DS). The eligibility criteria for administrative supplements has been the subject of debate. The committee recommends limiting the eligibility for underrepresented racial and ethnic groups to those groups underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields as defined by NSF. The committee also recommends that eligibility for the NGRI-DS should not extend to individuals from economically or educationally disadvantaged backgrounds unless evidence demonstrates that this group is at a competitive disadvantage during the ESI and EEI stages. Physician-scientists function as a critical segment of the biomedical research workforce because they bridge the clinical and research enterprises and thus help to accelerate the translation of basic discoveries into medical advances. In addition to the challenges that all ESIs face, physician-scientists face some unique challenges early in their research careers. For example, the training required to obtain competency in clinical and scientific research is extensive, and, not surprisingly, achieving proficiency in both can require a long overall training period. In addition, physician-scientists face increasing clinical demands, thereby decreasing their time for investigative work. In the face of these challenges, additional incentives are needed to support clinicians interested in either pursuing or sustaining their research programs (NIH Physician Scientist Workforce Working Group, 2014). Initiatives such NIH's Loan Repayment Programs (LRP) for physicianscientists are helpful in encouraging research activity by physician-scientists, but the program has not kept pace with the increasing cost of medical school and is only available in some biomedical fields. As of 2017, NIH's LRP will pay 25 percent of the eligible education debt up to a maximum of $35,000 of loan repayment per year, with an option for a 1-or 2-year renewal. However, the median medical school debt in 2016 was $190,000, a nearly $20,000 increase Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. BUILDING A BETTER ECOSYSTEM FOR INDEPENDENCE 91 since 2011, 9 and the loan repayment amount is considered taxable income. Divi sion of Loan Repayment at NIH pays federal taxes for the LRP recipient on a quarterly basis at 39 percent of the loan repayment. However the LRP recipient may be subject to other taxes such as state taxes. In fiscal year 2017, this program made 1,283 awards totaling $68,185,910. With 74 percent of medical school graduates from 2016 with education debt, 10 physicians are less likely to pursue biomedical research and become physician-scientists than they were in the past (Garrison and Deschamps, 2014). In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act authorized increases in the amount of loan forgiveness to a maximum of $50,000 per year and granted the NIH Director authority to expand the number of repayments to reflect workforce and research needs. However, NIH has not yet expanded LRP access for physician-scientists beyond the current programs for which they are eligible: clinical research, pediatric research, health disparities research, contraception and infertility research, and clinical research for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. Therefore, the committee recommends that NIH make the LRP available to all individuals pursuing biomedical physician-scientist researcher careers, regardless of their research area or clinical specialty, and that NIH increase the dollar amount of loans forgiven to reflect the debt burden of current medical trainees to incentivize talented physicians to pursue independent biomedical research careers. Ensuring that physician-scientists have dedicated time for research, as well as adequate mentoring, is perhaps the most effective intervention to retaining young academic medical faculty in the NIH workforce. Time devoted to clinical care and financial pressures are strong predictors of attrition (Dzirasa et al., 2015;Lingard et al., 2017;Milewicz et al., 2015;Turner, 2012). Career mentoring and peer support have been identified as effective measures for supporting young physician-scientists, particularly among women and underrepresented minorities (Byington et al., 2016;Chen et al., 2016;Dzirasa et al., 2015;Gotian et al., 2017). Prompted by the 2014 NIH PhysicianScientist Workforce Report, NIH has begun to explore several approaches to support physician-scientists, such as decreasing the length of training, reducing educational debt, and encouraging earlier mentored-research experiences. One example of such a program is the new National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Stimulating Access to Research in Residency R38 research program. 11 This program funds qualifying institutions to provide outstanding mentored research opportunities to resident-investigators and to foster their ability to transition to individual career development research awards. The program enables institutions to provide support for up to 2 years of 9 See https://news.aamc.org/medical-education/article/taking-sting-out-medical-school-debt/ (accessed December 15, 2017 research conducted by resident-investigators in structured programs for clinicianinvestigators with defined program milestones. In 2017, NINDS established the Neurosurgeon Research Career Development (K12) Award, 12 with the goal of expanding the cadre of neurosurgeon investigators trained to conduct research into neurological disorders. The K12 award provides 5 years of funding to research organizations to support a national research career development program. Although this K12 award is housed at the program director (PD)'s or PI's institution, it is not intended to support scholars solely at that institution. The PD/PI can solicit applications from eligible candidates at institutions from across the country, and selected scholars will proceed with their career development and research plan at their home institution, with a local mentor. The committee encourages NIH to continue piloting programs and institutions to not only participate actively in these programs but also develop and test their own innovative programs. When successful, NIH should encourage every Institute and Center to adopt such programs. Some academic institutions have established innovative programs to help researchers dedicate more time to research and increase their productivity. Harvard Medical School's Office for Diversity Inclusion and Community Partnership Faculty Fellowship, 13 for example, provides junior faculty with 2 years of fellowship support in the amount of $50,000 per year to release time from clinical work to conduct an individual, mentored research project. NIH could incentivize these types of efforts by providing matching flexible funds to institutions that are exploring ways to retain physician-scientists. The funds could be used to protect research time or to provide mentoring services. A system as vast and complex as the biomedical research enterprise requires careful and evidence-based policy solutions. Without a culture of innovation, experimentation, and rigorous assessment, institutions will feel less comfortable adopting policy recommendations, the recommendations that are adopted may be less effective or produce unforeseen consequences, and even the successful ones may not be broadly adopted by institutions over time. And yet, the committee was surprised by the small number of publicly reported, evidence-based studies of the many ideas to address the issues confronting the nation's young investigators, as well as the lack of a site analogous to clinicaltrials.gov to register experiments and pilots of the type mentioned throughout this report. If the nation hopes to design and sustain effective policies to support the next generation of investigators, we need to hardwire into the biomedical research enterprise 1 a greater capacity for experimentation in policy and funding changes, followed by assessment, publication, and adaptation or replication if successful. This is, in essence, how science itself proceeds. Indeed, many of the responses to the committee's Dear Colleague Letter (see Appendix C) expressed a desire for more experimentation and assessment with public disclosure on approaches to address the challenges identified in this report. For example, the Public Affairs Advisory Committee of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology noted that concrete data on the effect of supporting more staff scientists are not readily available and that \"understanding the true financial and productivity effects of employing staff scientists would guide the community on how best to incorporate staff scientists\" into their research enterprise. The Association of American Medical Colleges urged that any changes to the scope of grant award or review \"be based on ample data, and as possible, pilot testing, given the potential for unintended consequences for any system wide changes.\" In recent years, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has established initiatives that encourage impact assessments and examine programs or policies to support the biomedical workforce. For example, the NIH Common Fund funded a Coordination and Evaluation Center (CEC) to undertake longitudinal, cross-institution assessments of diversity programs such as the National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN) and the Building Infrastructure Leading to Diversity (BUILD) initiative (Estrada et al., 2016;National Academy of Sciences et al., 2011). NIH has also undertaken comprehensive evaluations of the Director's New Innovator Award (DP2) (Tinkle et al., 2016), the Director's Pioneer Award (DP1), mentored career awards, and the Institutional Research and Academic Career Devel op ment Award (IRACDA) program (K12), among others. In some cases, NIH has undertaken experimental designs to test the effect of policy changes, as is currently being done to examine anonymized peer review and implicit bias modules. For example, the NIH Scientific Workforce Diversity Office has launched an anonymized review to examine biases in peer review. That office is also assessing the efficacy of implicit bias modules and investments in research on workforce diversity. Assessments are also planned for other pilot projects for career development and mentoring, notably the Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training (BEST) program. In addition, the NIH Next Generation Researchers Initiative will be accompanied by a new effort to \"encourage independent analyses of metrics that can be used to assess the impact of the NIH portfolio.\" Too often, however, there is an absence of published, evidence-based studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of potential reforms on the issues that will affect the next generation of investigators. Even within NIH some successful experiments have not been considered for broader implementation, because no formal mechanism for \"registering\" experiments and sharing analyses exists. This is not to say that all attempts to improve the system are equally amenable to experimentation, and if every policy change were held to the scientific method, improvements would be slow in coming. Even so, the shortage of experimentation, analyses, and sharing slows the development of much needed changes in policy that will break down the barriers confronting today's young scientists and those of future generations. These evidence-based studies cannot be expected to emerge on their own; their conduct will require institutions, norms, and conditions that are conducive to innovation and experimentation. Fortunately, much of the institutional bedrock for such an approach already exists in the form of the embedded research capacity of our nation's graduate research programs and in the individual NIH ICs. In the recommendations that follow, the committee proposes to harness these institu-Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved."}, {"section_title": "EXPERIMENTATION AND INNOVATION", "text": "\n"}, {"section_title": "97", "text": "tions to serve as \"policy laboratories\" whose experiences can be used to benefit the next generation of researchers. Universities and other research institutions have been slow to adopt systemic change in how they train and support the next generation of researchers for several reasons, including a paucity of evidence that the recommended reforms of the past are effective and workable and the absence of ready resources to experiment with innovative approaches to the operation of the research enterprise. NIH has recognized the need to step in and support experimentation at the institutional level in certain areas. The BEST program, for example, supports 17 universities across the country to implement career development programs to improve access to a range of biomedical career options. The NRMN seeks to fund, implement, and evaluate innovative university approaches to research training and mentoring practices for individuals from diverse backgrounds. These programs are laudable, but integration of sustained change into the biomedical research enterprise requires a more consistent effort to support regular experimentation and innovation that consider the full range of barriers affecting the next generation of researchers. Therefore, the committee recommends a new pilot program, perhaps run through the NIH Common Fund, to support novel experiments to improve the training and research landscape for the next generation of investigators as they seek to transition into independent research careers. The Biomedical Research Enterprise Council (BREC) described in Recommendation 3.1 could serve as a repository for all experiments proposed in Recommendations 6.1 and 6.2 (below). This pilot program could support approaches to, for example, increase the diversity of new faculty, improve support for staff scientists, and accelerate transitions to research positions in various sectors, such as academia, industry, or government. Proposals for pilot projects would be subject to NIH peer review and would address issues within or overlapping with the province of this report. The proposed experiments should be designed to include rigorous assessment, and those receiving funding under this program should be required to make results widely available at timely intervals, given that the final outcomes will take years to assess. In addition, institutions should be invited to make joint proposals or assemble consortia to submit a single proposal so that the pilots can proceed at multiple institutions where appropriate. One model for such a pilot program could be the Burroughs Wellcome Fund's Physician-Scientist Institutional Program, 2 which provides awards of $500,000 per year over 5 years to create innovative programs to increase opportunities for physician-scientists to pursue careers in research, with careful evaluations of the funded programs. Consistent with the need for broader stakeholder ownership of the biomedical research system, the experiments proposed in Recommendations 6.1 and 6.2 could be financed through a cost-sharing arrangement that includes NIH, universities, and industry. This approach creates incentives for stakeholders to mount programs that assist in reorienting the system, rather than the present tradition of focusing much of the responsibility for new policy reform on the shoulders of NIH. Ideally, applicants would be required to identify at least partially matching funds to ensure their commitment to the enterprise and to strengthen the impact of any initiatives designed to improve the biomedical research system. At NIH, policy reform involving the next generation of researchers tends to follow two broad approaches. In the first approach, a single Institute or Center develops an initiative that meet the needs of its research mission, which may later be adopted by other Institutes. For example, the National Cancer Institute (NCI)'s Research Specialist Award is designed to encourage the development of stable career opportunities for exceptional scientists who want to pursue research within the context of an existing cancer research program, but not serve as independent investigators. Another example is the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)'s recent decision to support early-career investigators through the Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA). Created to support established investigators, MIRA was recently expanded to include early-stage investigators and awards money to the investigator instead of a specific project, thus providing more flexibility to pursue new ideas and opportunities as they arise. 3 The second approach to developing new policies emerges out of the NIH Office of the Director and takes several forms: \u2022 General policies for the ICs for the administration of their grant programs, such as the early-stage and early established investigator policies through Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved."}, {"section_title": "99", "text": "which the Office of the Director issued a general set of expectations for supporting certain early-career investigators; \u2022 Parent announcements for specific grant programs that provide individual Institutes with discretion to decide the extent of their participation, such as the Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) award introduced more than a decade ago to support a timely transition from a mentored postdoctoral research position to a stable independent research position; or \u2022 New funding programs, generally out of the Common Fund, such as the Director's New Innovator (DP2) and Early Independence Awards (DP5). Less common is an approach that integrates these two approaches for policy change. Although programs emerge from individual institutes and centers (ICs), as well as from the NIH Office of the Director, no central and independent mechanism is charged with evaluating the performance of these experiments, and, where successful, promoting their adoption across other NIH ICs and the broader biomedical research community. An integrated approach would use the dynamic and decentralized structure of NIH ICs as natural sites for policy experimentation regarding the multi-dimensional challenges confronting young investigators. NIH should champion the rapid adoption (and tailoring, as appropriate) by all ICs of experiments proven successful through rigorous evaluation. Conversely, when evaluation provides evidence that a policy is ineffective or counterproductive, the practice or policy should be abandoned. The U.S. biomedical 1 research enterprise has been one of the most productive segments of the U.S. economy since the second half of the 20th century. It has been responsible for generating a wealth of knowledge about the very workings of life, producing groundbreaking medical advances, and creating thousands of new companies and tens of thousands of well-paying jobs. It has also served as a model of how multiple stakeholders, working both independently and collaboratively, can make and turn fundamental discoveries into products and economic activity that benefit many areas of modern society. Yet, as with any successful complex enterprise, sustained success-and the benefits accrued to society-requires a constant infusion of talented individuals who receive support from the enterprise as they generate the next wave of discoveries and innovations. However, as this report and others preceding it have stated, there is substantial room for improvement when it comes to nurturing, supporting, and, in some cases, valuing that next generation of young scientists. Indeed, the U.S. biomedical enterprise is in danger of at best underutilizing and at worst losing a significant number of its brightest young scientific minds because of significant structural and cultural problems. However, stakeholders in the U.S. biomedical research enterprise, working independently and collaboratively, could implement solutions to these problems in relatively short order. Through its recommendations in this report, the committee has enumerated what it believes to be the most important of those solutions."}, {"section_title": "Final Thoughts and Summary of Recommendations by Actor", "text": "Although most of the committee's recommendations are directed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), given its outsized role in funding biomedical research and training, they are not intended for NIH to implement by itself.

Now, it is time for the remaining stakeholders-universities and other research institutions, principal investigators, professional societies, philanthropic organizations, Congress and the nation's biomedical research funding agencies, and industry-to be equally involved in creating an environment that enables the nation's young investigators to thrive and push the frontiers of knowledge, generate enumerable benefits to our society, and provide the intellect and energy needed to keep the biomedical research enterprise strong and vibrant.

The Committee on the Next Generation Researchers Initiative is not the first to examine the challenges young investigators face in starting independent research careers. Indeed, over the past few decades, a number of groups have issued high-profile reports examining concerns about the biomedical and behavioral research enterprise and the investigators trained to carry out that research. These reports each contained recommendations that targeted various institutions, career stages, and scientific research organizations, and all were aimed at securing and supporting our nation's biomedical and behavioral research scientists. The committee recognized early in its work that while a number of previous recommendations have been offered to tackle these concerns, only some of those recommendations actually had seen progress in the ensuing years. This led the committee, early in its deliberations, to pose a series of questions: Which of the previous recommendations had been addressed, and which had not? Of those that had been addressed, had interventions addressed the challenges confronting the biomedical workforce, or had they produced unintended consequences? Answering these questions was instrumental in informing the work of the committee. Some NIH programs and policies have aimed to increase training experiences for postdoctoral researchers and graduate students. In 2013, NIH encouraged institutions to develop and use IDPs for postdoctoral researchers and graduate students. In 2014, NIH issued a notice to indicate that NIH annual progress reports received on or after October 1, 2014, must include a section describing how IDPs are used to identify and promote the career goals of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers associated with NIH awards. This is required for research project grants supporting graduate students and postdoctoral researchers and for all T, F, K, R25, D43, and other awards or award components designed to provide training and professional development opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. 14,15 NIH also launched the K99/R00 Pathway to Independence awards in 2006 in response to the Bridges to Independence report and specified a mentoring component and training plan relating to the candidate's career goals. 16 "}, {"section_title": "NIH should increase the proportion of postdoctoral researchers supported by training grants and fellowships. Bridges to Independence (2005) Biomedical Research Workforce Working Group Report (2012)", "text": "The number of T32 and F32 postdoctoral training grants and fellowships has remained relatively constant since these recommendations were made (see section 1.6 below for more detail). In 2013, following the Biomedical Research Workforce Report review, NIH declared its intention to increase support for the K99/R00 Pathway to Independence awards, aiming for a 30 percent success rate compared to the 23 percent success rate in 2012 ( Figure B-1). Outside of NIH, some private foundations have developed new post doctoral fellowships. For example, the Simons Foundation responded to the NIH report by developing its Bridge to Independence Award to invest in and support early investigators in autism research. 17 Similarly, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute initiated the Hanna Gray Fellowship Program in 2016 to support researchers for a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4 years of postdoctoral training and up to 4 years of a tenure-track faculty position at a U.S. institution with a doctorallevel graduate program in the fellow's field of interest. 18 Other privately funded postdoctoral research award programs include the Damon Runyon Fellow ship  The recommendation to increase the proportion of postdoctoral researchers supported by training grants and fellowships has received some resistance from the research community. For example, the Association of Medical and Graduate Departments of Biochemistry (AMGDB) published a response on behalf of its leaders through the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) detailing its opposition to the Biomedical Research Workforce report recommendation. 22 In its response, the AMGDB leaders opposed increasing the number of postdoctoral fellows supported through training grants, asserting that postdoctoral salary support though R01 grants is a historically effective mechanism to easily and efficiently accommodate productivity and achievement.

PhysicianScientist Workforce Working Group Report (2014) Thus far, there is no known action addressing this recommendation. Physician-scientists with professional health degrees are eligible to apply for individual postdoctoral fellowships known as F32 awards and receive special consideration under NRSA legislation if they agree to undertake a minimum of 2 years of biomedical research. 23,24,25 Available data indicate that a majority of applicants and awardees for postdoctoral fellowships hold a Ph.D., but the success rate for those physician-scientists who apply is similar to that of Ph.D.only applicants (Figure B-2). In 2016, the success rate for F32 applicants with the following degrees was 28.1 percent for Ph.D.'s, 28.6 percent for M.D.'s, and 23 See https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA- 16-307.html (accessed December 11, 2017). 24 See https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/288 (accessed December 11, 2017). 25 See https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2012/nihgps_ch11.htm (accessed December 11, 2017)."}, {"section_title": "FIGURE B-2", "text": "Trends in F32 awards: The success rate for F32 applications by degree between 2011 and 2016.

The purpose of the K01 is to provide support and \"protected time\" (over 3, 4, or 5 years) for an intensive, supervised career development experience in the biomedical, behavioral, or clinical sciences leading to research independence. 45 There has been a growth in K01 awards from 82 in 1997 to 202 in 2016. 46 The K awards that support physician-scientists are discussed later in this document. The T90 and R90 are institutional programs that together support comprehensive interdisciplinary research training programs, but the R90 gives support to those who do not meet qualifications for NRSA support.

Such information should include completion rates, time to degree, career outcomes for Ph.D. trainees, and time in training and career outcomes from postdoctoral researchers over a 15-year period. Institutions should display these outcome data prominently on their websites. This will require institutions to track the career paths of their students and postdoctoral researchers over the long-term. One way to do this would be for an institution to assign graduate students and incoming postdoctoral researchers an identifier, or to use an identifier such as ORCID, 79 that it can then use to track its graduate students and postdocs throughout their careers. This could be part of a unique researcher identification (ID) system that would allow tracking of all researchers throughout their career. The ID would need to relate to any NIH ID assigned to the individual. \u2022 Bridges to Independence: Data about all career stages of the biomedical workforce must include the growing population of staff scientists and other non-tenure-track researchers. Moreover, data collection strategies should also be constructed to allow for disaggregated information to detect different trends between sub-populations of the biomedical research workforce.

For comparison, 79 percent of new award recipients had educational debt greater than $50,000. However, 2015 is the last year NIH released LRP data, and it is possible that funding levels have changed since then. 109 In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) authorized increases in the amount of LRP to a maximum of $50,000 per year and granted the NIH director authority to expand the number of LRPs to reflect workforce and research needs. 110 NIH does not appear to have expanded access by physician-scientists to LRPs beyond the current programs for which they are eligible: clinical research, pediatric research, health disparities research, contraception and infertility research, and clinical research for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. 111"}, {"section_title": "The citizenship requirement for NRSAs should be modified to", "text": "provide equal opportunities for non-U.S. citizens."}, {"section_title": "Bridges to Independence (2005)", "text": "To be eligible for an NRSA award, individuals must be U.S. citizens, noncitizen nationals of the United States, or lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence at the time of the award.

There is currently no citizenship requirement for K99 applicants, but significantly more individual postdoctoral NRSA fellowships (approximately 550-650 annually) are awarded than K99s (approximately 200 annually). In addition, NRSA awards support postdoctoral researchers, while the K99/R00 supports postdoctoral researchers transitioning to independent faculty positions.

Graduate and medical schools track information at varying levels of detail and frequency and make it publicly available to varying degrees. Multiple university administrators who presented to the committees spoke to these different approaches to data collection and release. Some institutions collected and published graduate student and/or postdoctoral data before the release of these reports, and there is no clear evidence that tracking expanded in response to these recommendations. Examples of institutions collecting graduate and postdoctoral data and sharing it with the public include the University of California, Berkeley, Stanford University, University of California, San Francisco, and University of Michigan. 75 Following the Bridges to Independence report, the NIH Health Reform Act of 2006 (P.L.109-482) was signed into law. Section 403C of the law stipulates that institutions receiving NIH-funded training grants are required to report doctoral completion rates and time to degree annually to both the NIH director and applicants to graduate programs at those institutions. In 2009, this requirement was added to the program statistics section of NIH Training Data Tables, which universities must complete to renew training grants, and became a new assurance requirement, which universities must fulfill in order to be eligible for training grants. 76,77,78 However, the recommendations outlined in the latter three reports pointed to the inadequacy of these data in helping students make educational and 75 See https://graduate.ucsf.edu/aggregate-data; http://web.stanford.edu/dept/pres-provost/irds/ Ph.D.jobs; http://grad.berkeley.edu/doctoral-alumni-outcomes/placement-survey/; https://secure. rackham.umich.edu/academic_information/program_statistics/ (accessed December 11, 2017). 76 See https://www.congress.gov/109/plaws/publ482/PLAW-109publ482.pdf (accessed December 11, 2017). 77 See https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-09-141.html (accessed December 11, 2017). 78 In 2015, NIH released a series of new data tables for institutions receiving NIH training grants to complete in conjunction with their applications and progress reports.

In addition, these surveys include only doctorate-granting institutions, not research centers and national labs, and only U.S.-trained doctorates.

For example, the average age to first R01 has increased from 38 years in 1986 to 42 years in 2016. 9 Early career investigators are the principal investigators (PIs) or co-PIs on fewer and smaller grants than other investigators, and so may be more vulnerable to the loss of a grant award on renewal. 10 Further evidence suggests that the aging workforce appears to be drawing grants away from younger investigators, and models demonstrate that the aging of the NIH funded biomedical workforce is likely to continue. 11 The NIH has intervened over the years to address these trends and the longterm stability of the workforce, including through the introduction of the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00), the Director's New Innovator Award Program (DP2), the Directors Early Independence Awards (DP5), and new and ESI programs. 12 Recently, NIH introduced a new Next Generation Researchers Initiative program to reinforce its efforts to bring balance to the workforce. Separately, the peer review process has come under scrutiny for its possible role in these larger trends. Some studies have suggested that the peer review process may disadvantage underrepresented populations or unconventional ideas. 13 NIH is currently funding studies to further investigate the presence of bias in the peer review process and identify strategies to respond. Examples of recommendations in these areas that we have heard from stakeholders, or that have been proposed in the literature, and on which the Committee would be interested in the views of the community, are:"}]
