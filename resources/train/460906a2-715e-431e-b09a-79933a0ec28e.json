The Policy Analysis and Science Assistance (PASA) branch at the USGS Fort Collins Science Center was asked to conduct an evaluation of GAP. The aim of the evaluation included three objectives- \u2022 to characterize users of GAP data and products; \u2022 to identify how those products have been used; and \u2022 to estimate GAP's contribution, whether direct or indirect, to conservation of biodiversity. The most direct method to evaluate the use of GAP data is to survey individuals who use GAP data now or have used the data in the past."}, {"section_title": "Conducting the Survey", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Identifying the Sample", "text": "Identifying the sample for this survey was time consuming and required multiple approaches. The data produced by GAP are available to the public at no cost. GAP does not require the individuals who download data to provide any identifying information nor does GAP maintain customer lists. For these reasons, the identification of GAP data users for the purposes of conducting a survey presented a challenge. Some GAP users are known to GAP, but there are unknown users of GAP data whose perspective should be included in a thorough evaluation of GAP. Two approaches were used to identify GAP data users. A \"snowball sampling\" approach was used to identify GAP data users. This approach is typically used to identify research subjects from hidden populations. Because there are no existing comprehensive lists of GAP users, this population was considered a hidden population. As another part of the evaluation of GAP, a review of published literature that cited GAP data was conducted (Ratz and Conk, 2014). The authors identified as having used GAP data were added to the list of GAP users. The snowball sampling approach was started by creating a GAP user database that included authors who published articles in volumes 1 to 14 of the \"GAP Bulletin.\" Names of potential users were solicited from the offices that develop state and regional GAP data. The names they provided were added to the GAP user database. The lists included subscribers to the \"GAP Bulletin,\" names from individuals participating in a study of State Wildlife Action Plans, and names of individuals who had downloaded GAP data from a site maintained by a state or a university offering state level GAP data. The database included the name and email address for each individual. Each individual in the database was emailed a message alerting them to the upcoming survey and asking if they could provide the names and email addresses of three other individuals who they knew to be users of GAP data. When a name was received that was not already in the database, the name was added, and an email was sent to that person asking if he or she could provide the names and email addresses of three other individuals who were users of GAP data. This process was followed until the number of new names received declined sharply."}, {"section_title": "Administering the Survey", "text": "The variety of GAP products available (state, regional, or national; land cover, predicted species distributions, stewardship, or analysis), the importance of the information addressed in the survey, and the varied nature of identified GAP users were compelling reasons to send the survey to the complete list of 1,264 identified GAP users rather than sampling from the list. A message written by Dr. Kevin Gergely, National GAP Program Manager, introducing the survey was emailed to the individuals included in the survey. Although the message was from Dr. Gergely, it was sent by PASA personnel to maintain the privacy and protect the identity of those participating in the survey. After this introductory letter was sent, Joan Ratz, USGS Volunteer Social Scientist, sent an email message that included the link to the survey. This message was sent using KeySurvey software. KeySurvey automatically sent reminders to individuals who had not completed the survey 7 and 10 days after the survey opened. The data collection process started on September 18, 2012, and ended on November 9, 2012. The survey was conducted entirely online. The survey was adaptive so that the number of total questions asked of respondents would be limited. Specifically, the parts of the survey that addressed certain types of GAP data solicited responses only from individuals who have knowledge of those types of data. For example, the questions regarding land-cover data were directed only to respondents who indicated that they were most familiar with the land-cover data provided by GAP."}, {"section_title": "Response Rate", "text": "Of the 1,264 surveys initially sent, 215 were undeliverable due to invalid email addresses. Fifteen individuals requested to be removed from the survey sample. Six individuals were out of the office for the duration of the data collection process. This left a potential sample size of 1,028. Three hundred fifty-nine respondents answered the survey questions. The adjusted response rate was 35 percent. Because the survey sample included individuals who were not Federal employees, the survey had to be submitted to the information collection request process overseen by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). OMB requires that any survey with a response rate less than 80 percent must have a nonresponse bias survey. A nonresponse survey was conducted as part of this survey process. The results of the nonresponse survey are described in this report in a separate section \"Nonresponse Survey\" that follows the question summaries of the survey."}, {"section_title": "Preliminary Findings", "text": "This report includes only summaries of the responses to the questions asked on the survey. Until additional analyses are complete, only preliminary conclusions reached on the basis of these summary statistics can be presented. Answers to the introductory questions indicate that most survey respondents use GAP data currently or have used GAP data within the last 5 years . For those who are not now nor within the last 5 years users of GAP data, the primary reason they do not use GAP data is that it is not applicable to their current work. Respondents who used GAP data within the last 5 years most frequently used the data to address the issues of biodiversity conservation and fish and wildlife management. They have used GAP data to provide information regarding conservation related policy issues and to provide decisionmakers with knowledge. Survey respondents were from a variety of organizations; most users were from State and Federal agencies. Respondents indicated that conservation of biodiversity was important to their organizations. When asked to describe their current position, geographic information systems (GIS), ecology, fish and wildlife management, and conservation were the most frequently selected options. Respondents were asked to name a source they read most frequently to keep current in their field. The most frequently named publications were the \"Journal of Wildlife Management\" and \"Conservation Biology.\" The survey respondents were primarily skilled users of GIS, and most of them have been using GIS for more than 10 years. They learned GIS by themselves, through a graduate course, or through informal on the job training. They mostly use data to create information products but acquire, create, maintain, and distribute datasets. The opinion of many respondents was that only basic GIS skills are needed to use GAP data, although some respondents thought that high skill levels were needed. Approximately one-third of respondents were partners in a state GAP project; otherwise, respondents often learned about GAP from someone else. They received GAP data either from a download from the GAP web site or through direct distribution from GAP. Respondents were asked with which set of geographic data they were most familiar. Seventy percent of respondents were most familiar with state data, 20 percent of respondents were most familiar with regional data, and only 10 percent were mainly familiar with national data. Those who use state data do so because the state data meet their needs more closely than regional data, but state data are not necessarily perceived as being more accurate. Those who use regional data do so because regional data meet their needs more closely than state data, but regional data are not necessarily perceived as being more accurate or current than state data. Those who use national data do so because they need data consistent at a national scale. Most survey respondents agreed that the data they needed for their area were available. Forty percent used data that are approximately state sized in extent. In terms of the types of data used, 57 percent of the respondents were most familiar with GAP land-cover data. These respondents were asked questions regarding land-cover data. Respondents indicated GAP land-cover data were useful at state, regional, ecosystem, and county levels. They indicated that GAP land-cover data were necessary at state, regional, ecosystem, county, and national levels. Having consistent seamless national coverage of vegetation was very important to respondents. When asked how frequently GAP land-cover data should be produced, the most frequently selected time period was 5 to 7 years. Opinions about land-cover data were generally positive. Respondents to the land-cover questions indicated the GAP land-cover data were of medium quality and that the data met most of the users' expectations. There are alternative sources to GAP land-cover data, and survey respondents named a variety of alternatives, such as state data, National Land Cover Data (NLCD), and LANDFIRE. Respondents gave GAP a grade of \"B\" for performance on mapping the land cover of the United States. About 22 percent of survey respondents indicated they were most familiar with predicted species distribution (PSD) data. These respondents were asked more specific questions about PSD data. These respondents indicated that GAP data were useful at state, regional, and ecosystem levels and that GAP data are necessary at those levels as well as at national and county levels. It is important to respondents to have consistent seamless national coverage of PSD data. When asked how frequently they thought GAP PSD data should be produced, respondents were split between the response options of \"5 to 7 years\" and \"8 to 10 years.\" Respondents agreed that it is more useful for species to be modeled on biological range rather than along state boundaries. Respondents agreed that the species modeled by GAP are appropriate for their uses. In general, respondents' opinions about GAP PSD data were favorable. Respondents to the PSD questions indicated the GAP PSD data were of medium quality and the data met most of the users' expectations. When asked if there were alternative sources to GAP PSD data, 58 percent of respondents to that question indicated there were no alternative sources. Respondents gave GAP a grade of \"B\" for performance on mapping PSD of vertebrate species for the United States. However, a nearly equal percentage indicated they lacked sufficient information to provide a grade. Ten percent of respondents indicated they were most familiar with the stewardship data and were asked specific questions about that type of data. Respondents indicated GAP stewardship data were useful at the state, national, regional, and ecosystem levels, and GAP stewardship data are needed at the state, national, regional, ecosystem, and county levels. It is important to respondents to have consistent seamless national coverage of stewardship data. In the opinion of these respondents, GAP stewardship data should be updated every 2 to 4 years if not more frequently. Respondents who answered the stewardship questions were generally positive in their opinions of GAP stewardship data. However, when asked if GAP stewardship data were the best available data of that type, 41 percent were neutral, and there was no majority either in agreement or disagreement. GAP stewardship data are viewed as being high quality and meet most of the users' expectations. However, 41 percent of respondents indicated they did not have enough information to grade GAP's performance on documenting land ownership and protection in the United States. When asked if there were alternative sources for the information provided in GAP stewardship data, 75 percent of respondents indicated there were alternatives. When asked to identify with which type of GAP data they were most familiar, 11 percent of respondents indicated familiarity with analysis data. These respondents were asked a few questions specific to GAP analysis data. Respondents' opinions of analysis data were generally positive. When asked if there were alternative sources to GAP analysis data, 63 percent of these respondents indicated there were alternative sources. After answering questions specific to the types of GAP data they use, respondents were asked about benefits of the use of GAP data. Respondents generally agreed that they intend to continue to use GAP data and that GAP data are compatible with other data they use. Respondents indicated that GAP data improve their capacity to affect conservation of biodiversity and help their organization achieve conservation-related goals. Their organizations experienced time savings, efficiency in the work process, improved effectiveness, and improved decisions. If GAP data were no longer available, respondents generally agreed that the work of their organization would suffer and that they would have to search for an acceptable replacement dataset. Respondents could not indicate how much a replacement would cost because there is no readily available substitute. Respondents indicated their work products would be less effective if they had to use alternate data instead of GAP. A section of the survey included questions about respondents' GIS software and data preferences. The most frequently used GIS software package was ArcGIS. Respondents reported that they also have access to multiple other GIS software packages such as Imagine, ArcView, and ENVI. Respondents indicated a preference for downloading data rather than accessing web-based tools. They prefer direct download options. When downloading GIS raster data, whether GAP data or other data, respondents most frequently use ESRI GRID (Interchange format). Respondents indicated that using GAP data for the first time was neither difficult nor easy. If they had a question about using GAP data, they would most likely go to the GAP web site to find information. When asked questions regarding training on the use of GAP data, more than one-half of the respondents indicated it would be somewhat valuable with an average of 2 on a 4-point scale. Respondents would not be willing to pay more than a negligible amount for training. If respondents were to attend training they would want it to be for only one day. Respondents believed that the most effective form of training would be in an instructor-led classroom but that the most practical form of training would be web based. When asked about contact with GAP staff, respondents most frequently indicated that they have not had contact with staff. Respondents were asked how they learned to use GAP data. The most frequent response was that they had figured it out by themselves and that it was somewhat easy to do. A series of questions addressed the linkages between GAP and GAP users. Most frequently, respondents indicated that they knew someone involved in developing regional or state GAP projects but that they did not know anyone currently employed by GAP. A section of survey questions addressed how GAP data are distributed. Respondents indicated that they generally do not distribute GAP data in the original form. When asked if they ever direct anyone to the GAP web site to download data, respondents were roughly split between those who never do and those who do so several times a year. When asked how frequently they distribute a product based on GAP data, respondents most frequently indicated they do so up to several times a year. However, the distribution is usually limited to a few people. The intended audience for these products is usually at the state level. The respondents to this survey indicated their role is primarily to provide information products to those who make policies and decisions affecting conservation and that they were most frequently not in a position to make decisions directly affecting conservation of biodiversity. Respondents were asked several questions regarding possible future actions by GAP. Respondents indicated that land cover is the most important database to keep current and that it is more important to update existing data than to create new data. Respondents generally agreed they would use new releases of GAP data. Having access to an individual to help with use of GAP data was viewed by respondents as being somewhat useful. A section of the survey addressed outreach methods and included questions regarding a GAP conference, the \"GAP Bulletin,\" and the GAP web site. Respondents indicated that cost, location, and topics covered would affect their attendance at a GAP conference. Respondents indicated it was generally unlikely that they would submit a presentation to, or attend, a GAP conference. Most frequently respondents indicated they had never used information from the \"GAP Bulletin\" and that they were not familiar with the publication. The respondents who had used the \"GAP Bulletin\" indicated that the information had been somewhat useful and that the bulletin was a good quality information source. Most survey respondents had visited the GAP web site at some time. They visited the web site primarily to obtain information or download data. They believed that visiting the web site met some or all of their needs. A section of the survey included questions about GAP's reputation. Respondents generally disagreed that GAP is unknown to conservation professionals and the GIS user communities. GAP is perceived as having a generally positive reputation. However, when asked if GAP is losing ground to competing organizations, more than 50 percent of the respondents would neither agree nor disagree. When asked about the breadth of GAP's reputation, respondents believed that GAP has a state-level reputation but were less confident in judging GAP's reputation at the national or county/municipal levels. Respondents were asked what percentage of people who could use GAP data know about GAP. The most frequently selected response option was \"Between 26 and 50 percent.\" Respondents indicated they would recommend use of GAP data to others, and many of them already have. Those who have not recommended GAP to others indicated that the main reason was that no opportunity to do so had occurred. The last section of the survey included questions regarding the goals and objectives of GAP. The respondents indicated that the most appropriate use for GAP data is to provide decisionmakers with knowledge about conservation issues and indicated that GAP data were most frequently used in that way. Respondents were asked how helpful GAP data are or could be in addressing 21 different issues. The results varied on the basis of the issue. For seven of the issues, respondents most frequently indicated that they could not judge how helpful GAP data would be in addressing that issue. Respondents generally agreed that GAP data are relevant to pending decisions relating to conservation of biodiversity and are compatible with existing policy-making processes. Respondents generally agreed that individuals who make decisions about conservation of biodiversity would be open to considering the types of information products that can be made using GAP data. When asked to rate GAP's progress in meeting its objectives or grade GAP's performance on meeting cooperation and information dissemination goals, most frequently respondents indicated that they lacked the knowledge to make such judgments. The nonresponse survey included a small set of questions from the primary survey and was sent to those who did not respond when the primary survey data were collected. The purpose of a nonresponse survey is to determine whether there are differences between those who responded to a survey and those who did not. Nearly one-half of those who answered the nonresponse survey are currently using GAP data or have used GAP data within the last 5 years. For those who are not currently using GAP data, the primary reason is because the data are not applicable to their current work. The respondents were most frequently employed by Federal agencies or universities. Respondents most frequently selected the term \"ecology\" to describe their current position. Most of these respondents were most familiar with data from state GAP projects. The type of data with which they were most familiar was land cover."}, {"section_title": "Question Summaries", "text": "The descriptive results for the survey questions are provided in the order in which the questions were asked.

More detailed landcover down to forest community types, inundation data, We have added in protected areas that are missing in the PAD. We have changed the status rank on some areas based on local expert knowledge Lump or split some cover types Grouping LULC categories to cross-walk with Canadian datasets Theme: Update (n = 11) Updating species models, PAD, and land cover Updating Updated and better done. Update with more training data Update species distributions Update land management status. Intersect it with other more current data. Augment with more recent data layers. Add more recent data. Replace it with updated data that I've collected. More specific, localized information/ updated data Theme: Correct accuracy (n = 10) Oak is overrepresented in the Willamette Valley ecological systems coverage. I have used ancillary datasets to remove pixels of oak for which support is weak that oak do indeed exist there. Land cover is not always accurate. Particularly for sub-state level (e.g., multi-county) analyses, I have had to correct the more egregious departures from reality. The categories of \"recently burned\" or \"recently chained\" are also of minimal use and need to be reclassified to an actual land cover (not a land management activity). Identifying and fixing issues of misclassification in the landscover map, and extending wildlife models into areas that have not been updated. I correct GAP land cover classification errors by referencing other datasets, both vector and raster. For example, MnDOT data is used to improve the GAP built-up areas, and NWI data is used to distinquish upland and wetland natural land cover types. GAP land cover data for Florida are full of errors and are now out of date relative to other land cover data layers available for the state. Thus, GAP data are not very useful for Florida. Corrected misclassifications, added land cover types Change land cover types and areas as needed from groundtruthing. Correcting omissions in land status layer Spatial clean up of specific type distributions based on field knowledge and samples data Southwest ReGAP is generally based on NM. In AZ we have found errors in Veg data and have had to correct it.

There is a need to update/create new higher spatial resolution land cover maps for the Northern Great Plains. There has been a lot of land cover change in recent years in response agricultural and energy policies. RapidEye imagery would be cost effective for this work. The current regional products from the LandFire program are of lower quality than the older state products. The GAP land cover data in Minnesota is currently worthless because of its age -it's derived from LandSat images from the early 1990's. In fact, the data took so long to create it almost worthless as soon as it was released, and was immediately displaced by the NLCD. It was revolutionary in scope and detail when it first came out. Unless data is updated fairly regularly, gap data is in danger of becoming irrelevant and un or under used. It needs to be updated with whatever new habitat-relevant digital layers are available. I use SWreGAP data from the Utah GIS portal and would use it more if it were up to date. Up until earlier this year, I relied on that data for remote landcover analysis. A university-based GIS professional told me that he hardly ever uses it now because it is out of date and less reliable than Landfire, so I've been switching to Landfire. I am not familiar with a general GAP website or the national GAP program. In Utah, my access to species predictions has been limited and the data pretty hard to find. My biggest complaints with the GAP data I have used are that it is not up date and too coarse-scale to adequately represent riparian areas and other thin/small features in this western landscape. My biggest complaint with Landfire data is that it is only available in raster format. It is easier for me to work with polygons than with raster pixels. I think the GAP data is great, just too old in our state, which is rapidly changing. GAP data are very valuable to Minnesota's Coastal management program. It would be great to see a stronger relationship with NOAA C-CAP program and an update to land cover and land stewardship data. GAP data are useful, but in MN they are 20 years out of date. They are still useful in the boreal part of the state; not so much elsewhere. Classification reliability at Level 4 is generally poor, which is why I almost always aggregate and reclass at Level 3. Almost all my responses reflect one basic issue: the Midwest needs an updated regional GAP. An update cycle would allow correcting spatial and attribute errors as well as improving currency. Stewardship changes faster than landcover and is easier to update. Theme: No comments (n = 10) None No (9) Theme: What would be helpful (n = 8) The most common critique I hear about Gap is that the data are not accurate enough at high resolution. Personally, I understand the limitations of the input data and the appropriate scale for most datasets, but many end-users fail to appreciate this. The scale mismatch issues are greatest in the land cover layer -especially with aquatic features. Gap could do a better job of explaining this problem to end users. We use GAP for two things: land use change and species distribution models. I really want to see GAP gain more detail in each. The species models are created on a regional scale and they are are very useful at that scale, but at the local scale, they are less useful. It would be fantastic if additional information could be brought forward to merge GAP models with more current information (about habitat) and observations. We need maps that show stand age or seral stage. We need higher resolution species distribution maps based on models that use stand age or seral stage as predictor variables. Models for mapping species distributions should also use minimum area requirements of a species as predictors variables. Most program efforts are on data development and provision, but not enough focuses on analysis. Much more valuable attention would come to the program if there was greater emphasis placed on analysis and drawing helpful conclusions; aim at national scale assessment (not planning, assessment) and bring in your cooperator community to prioritize and carry off the analyses under the Gap Program flag. The main results of national \"gap analysis\" (in its many forms) should be common knowledge in Washington DC; and to regional leadership of federal land managers, and within leaders of state agencies. More species please Another protected area dataset is the one put out by CBI (http://www.protectedlands.net/). I know they are similar, but there are some differences. It is very confusing about what dataset I should use and what exactly is the difference between them. I would like to see the USGS put out some information on the differences, and the appropriates uses of each. My employer put money into developing the state GAP program many years ago and I have forgotten all about it because I did not have direct access to the program. Our GIS folks need to inform biological staff that it is available and help us get access to it. GAP needs to serve people on a state by state basis. Workshops in each state would be good. Feds usually ignore Arkansas. The program needs to focus more on aquatic gap. It it too terrestrial oriented. Theme: Comment about the survey (n = 8) This survey would have been better if there had been fewer questions about the \"best\" or most use of data, since we use species data almost as much as Land Cover data. This survey was way too long to provide meaningful information. This survey was too long. Suggest streamlining. This survey may be meaningless. It appears to be directed solely at terrestrial issues, and most of my use has been stream characteristics models and fish mussel and crayfish distribution models for Missouri streams. My use of GAP was old, so most answers for current GAP issues were guesses. I am not a user, hence, was unable to comment effectively on many questions. Perhaps some changes to the beginning of the survey can help identify that point. I am merely here to learn about GAP and hopefully become a user at somepoint. I am a biologist, not a GIS specialist, so many questions were not appropriate. For GIS specialist in the Kansas Biological Survey, contact [personal information deleted] This questionaire is too long. Gap has several products, and this survey does not adequately separate out those products in the questions. The species distribution maps tend to be less credible than the pad us maps, in my view. There was no way to make this statement in the survey. Theme: Outreach/cooperation (n = 5) There has always been a weak connection between those who compile GAP data and those who could use it for conservation decisions. The program has failed to invest in sufficient outreach and development of synthesized information products that serve a broad audience. The program had a much higher profile in the early 90s than it does now, as it was a very early GIS product. It is a wonderful, ambitious program that has probably taken on too much with too little resources. GAP needs to become more cooperative, less defensive and turfy, and reach out more to academics, practitioners, and NGOs. I would like to know more of how to use the GAP tools in Puerto Rico. Little is known about these tools. Present GAP to the university professionals and other personnel at the island. I think you need to get the program out there and sell it. You need to market to OFWIM, NSGIC and others. You should build collaborations with state and local agencies to build and use GAP data. I think there just needs to be more marketing, education and training on GAP. I think it is useful, but it previously had a reputuation of not being so good. Theme: Aquatic data (n = 4) I considered both the terrestrial and aquatic gap projects when responding to all of these questions but based on the definition of multiregion projects it was obvious that these questions where specifically directed at the terrestrial gap effort and ignored the aquatic component. I am really only familiar with the Great Lakes Aquatic GAP project, so many of the questions were not really relevant. Begin more fish and fisheries habitat data online. It is a great resource but more investment needs to be made and people need to use it more than it is being used. We need to do more for the aquatic and terrestrial GAP interfaces."}, {"section_title": "Theme: Comments about errors in or accuracy of data (n = 4)", "text": "Please provide a way for the land cover datasets to be updated, so we can correct errors. This is, I realize, easier said than done, but it can be done, particularly with the advent of GPS cameras. One photo says a lot. My experience has been that, in general, GAP land cover and species distribution maps contain too many errors for them to be relied upon, except as ancillary data when more accurate site-specific data are lacking. Part of the discussions our office has is in the accuracy of the data and the resolution of the data used in land management. Many have the perception that GAP data is too coarse for our needs. I haven't been very involved in Gap since the original Gap analyses back in the 90s (I was a developer of Gap data). My sense now is that Gap has addressed the issue of resolution, but still suffers from a real or perceived lack of accuracy, especially with land cover mapping. It's not that the methods used aren't appropriate, but that accurately mapping huge regions or even states is very very difficult at the level of accuracy needed by local-scale land managers. As you know, it's an old problem."}, {"section_title": "Theme: Timeliness (n = 4)", "text": "Probably my biggest problem, answering these questions relates to my extensive use and moderately high satisfaction with the 1997 products for Washington State and the more problematic experiences with the more recent effort which has produced some products that appear to be no better, in some ways worse than what was produced in 1997, a significant disappointment. The more recent products seem to have taken an inordinately long time to be completed and were not available when I had a critical need for them. In many places, this survey asked questions that were difficult to fully answer with the allowed choices. Ultimately, I believe the primary downfall of GAP is the inability to provide more timely and accurate data -primarily land cover. This isn't just a fault of GAP (NLCD, Landfire also have the same issue). Until steps are made to correct this, the same complaints and issues will continue to arise. I understand that it's a long and complicated process to create the vegetation maps, but if there's anyway to decrease the time lag between image acquisition and mapping that would be helpful. Also, a suite of products related to habitat quality and/or invasion by exotic species would be super helpful. I like the land use land cover GAP data set, however it should not take 10 years to develop new data sets. The imagery is completely out of date by the time the product is released. Theme: Respondent's background or perspective (n = 4) I was part of my state's GAP team and know how the data was collected and integrated into the data layers. I was envolved with Gap Analysis over 20 years. I currently teach in Portugal and GAP data is not available for this area I apologize for not answering all your questions. I hired consultants who used Gap data to create a regional GIS land cover map for me. I have never used the data myself, so felt unprepared to answer many questions. Having that data enabled us to promote and successfully implement local zoning policies leading to the conservation of 90,000 riparian acres in metropolitan Kansas city. I am supportive of strong national efforts to develop and use data for the variety of purposes outlined in this survey. I am not experienced enough with the data to evaluate how well it has served those purposes in the past. FYI. I do not use GAP data on a frequent basis. I've used GAP data for species/habitat conservation planning. And I am not that familiar with the uses of GAP data. Most of these questions were beyond my use experience."}, {"section_title": "Theme: Thanks (n = 3)", "text": "Thanks for all your good work on the GAP program! Thank you for your efforts. Thank you for all you do! Theme: More useful data available (n = 2) GAP is good for regional or cross-border analysis but anything limited to states or smaller generally has better data sources available GAP has largely become irrelevant to me in recent years as new alternative products have become available. I am in a portion of the country that has not gotten a sorely needed regional Re-GAP, so we've had to make do pursuing alternatives. No theme: I am using GAP data for my dissertation research project about how local land use / land cover changes impacts the local climate and meteorological events. Land Covers classes from GAP do not match simulation program LC classes because GAP data has higher resolution, is more specific and detailed about local species but is useful enough for analysis. The multiscale nature of biodiversity conservation requires interoperable multiscale products, GAP does not provide this. Many errors that managers find in GAP data are attributable to the scale at which the data are derived for (national -regional). People want to use GAP data for policy decisions that need higher resolution data so they become frustrated with GAP and it gets an undeservedly bad reputation. Sure, please call me for a follow up[personal information deleted] Overall, I would like to see GAP program more based on real science. The Landfire product was a plain disaster, as far as I can tell. How come? I find that people I work with often think the GAP program is no longer active. I do not hear GAP data mentioned in discussions at the LCC or JV/habitat partnership level. SWAP revisions are upon us, and many states have not incorporated GAP into their plans to the level that could be achieved (variety of reasons). So much opportunity but definitely a challange for GAP to re-establish itself especially in the East. I cannot recall hearing a single popular or scientific article citing GAP as a data source in the past 5+ years. Given the concerns over climate change, the GAP data set should be very relevant, yet it seems to have faded into the background. The reason for this eludes me. Again, as far as I know GAP never produced a credible land cover map of Texas. I am not familiar with the other Texas products. Management of wildlife is local not national. Many agencies that manage wildlife do not control the habitats on which wildlife occurs (eg private lands, or lands managed by other agencies). GIS-based analyses using GAP datasets may help provide acceptable maps, but the mindset or local governments and state agencies needs to change. At the close of the survey, respondents were asked to provide their email address if they wanted to receive notifications of new release of GAP data, products, and other information. Seventy-one respondents provided an email address."}, {"section_title": "Nonresponse Survey", "text": "Because the survey sample included individuals who were not Federal employees, the survey had to be submitted to the information collection request process overseen by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). OMB requires that any survey with a response rate less than 80 percent must have a nonresponse bias survey. The survey of GAP data users had an adjusted response rate of 35 percent; therefore, a nonresponse survey was required. A nonresponse survey is a brief survey sent to individuals who had an opportunity to respond to a survey but chose not to do so. The purpose of a nonresponse survey is to provide information to determine if those who did not respond to a survey are different from those who did. The nonresponse survey was sent to all individuals with valid email addresses who had received the GAP survey but did not respond, and who had not previously actively declined to participate by requesting removal from the survey list. The nonresponse survey opened on January 11, 2013, and closed on January 24, 2013. The nonresponse survey was sent to 672 individuals. Two individuals had invalid email addresses. Five individuals requested to be removed from the survey sample, and two individuals were out of the office for the duration of the data-collection process. This left a potential sample size of 663. One hundred ninety-six respondents answered the nonresponse survey questions. The adjusted response rate was 30 percent. The questions included in the nonresponse survey were taken from the original survey. The questions included in the nonresponse survey and the frequency of responses provided are presented below."}, {"section_title": "NRQ1 (Survey Q1)", "text": "Which statement best describes your use of GAP data? (n = 196) Response Percent a. I am using GAP data (either state, regional, or national data) at the present time, or have used it within the last five (5) years. (Respondents selecting this response were directed to NRQ3 next.) 47 b. I last used GAP data (either state, or regional) more than five (5) years ago. (Respondents selecting this response were directed to NRQ2 next.) 27 c. I am familiar with GAP data but have not used it. (Respondents selecting this response were directed to NRQ2 next.) It's a great resource! I think the newer GAP data is a great improvement over the first version. I retired in 2003 after 25 years as a Biology Professor. The GAP data at the State and Regional levels before then was very helpful in understanding distribution of the fungi I was researching. I have been very impressed with the Gap Analysis Program and the land cover data that I've used in the past. Because my work tends to be focused on wildland fire rather than conservation, I generally use LANDFIRE data... but that doesn't mean I think it's necessarily better than GAP. I do use the GAP protected areas database (PAD v1.1) for land ownership information nationally, and for the most part I think it's great. I found the GAP data to be very useful in my previous job, as a consultant calculating the Ecological Footprint of Utah. We needed land cover data for the renewable biocapacity calculations. See our final report, if you like, at http://www.utahpop.org/vitalsigns/research/report_2007.htm. Thank you! Great stuff! Very useful for academic and conservation purposes! Theme: Respondent's background or perspective (n = 9) Perhaps improvements and updates have been made in GAP data of which I am not aware, and I might use it or develop projects that would involve use of the GAP data if I were more familiar with current products. Not applicable to my program. Others in FWS use it I retired 5 years ago and have little use for Gap data now. I really know very little about this I asked one of my staff who were more involved in the use of the GAP data to respond to your survey I am not familiar with GAP data. I am not familiar with gap analysis I am \"using them\" only in that I am collaborating with another researcher that is using MNGAP data. As the programs evolved, I became more involved with NBII than GAP per se, but continue to use both GAPderived data and the central concepts of the GAP program in research, teaching, and graduate education. Theme: Update needed (n = 8) Would like to see updated species distribution maps every five years or so with new data Very desperately needs a higher resolution redo for Hawai'i. The program is invaluable. I hope funding continues so that the data can be periodically updated and/or improved. Really like the Southeast GAP product, just wish it could be updated more frequently. This is a seminal data set for our analyses! Need updates with more current land cover and more sophisticated species modeling given new technologies available. My organization provided all the occurrence records used by GAP. More up to date land cover datasets would be very useful Land cover data need to be updated thru time, as significant landscape change has been occurring in the Southwest over the last 12+ years. Best land cover data I've worked with still, at least for the forested portion of the state. Need detailed cover down to tree species for much of my work. Would like to see updates to the Landcover. May want to partner with NLCD to capture what it seems to identify best, ag and development. Theme: No comment (n = 8) No (6) None n/a Theme: Reason for not responding to earlier survey (n = 7) Very helpful to have. Thank you! Sorry, I didn't fill out one earlier--crazy busy lately. Sorry for not responding before. Been a very hectic year..... Since I mainly use the data to help teachers answer questions about local wildife and may need additional assistance from our GAP and GIS staff I didn't take the time to answer the previous survey. I do not work with our data base on a daily basis My program was responsible for image and geospatial data processing and analysis for the NYS Gap Analysis Project. I am very familiar with GAP and the geospatial database. I thought I responded to your earlier survey. I apologize for not doing so. Great program but users seem to prefer NLDC land cover products rather than GAP land cover products. I don't have much experience with species distribution modeling products and how they are used in the academic, public, or private sector. I am more of a GAP data developer than a GAP data user, which is why I did not respond to the original survey. I am a manager of staff who use Gap products; that is why I did not respond previously. GAP data is essential to conservation efforts. I have used land cover data for years as well as the protected areas database. I recently completed an update to PAD-US for Kentucky and was glad to have the opportunity to contribute. My previous non-response was because I have left the state agency where these emails were sent and believed another member of the data management team filled out the survey. I am not with a land trust and will subscribe under that email. Theme: Reason for using alternate data (n = 5) The GAP data served our needs at the time we used it to map land cover over a 3.3 million acre land base. However, we only used it once and adopted other datasets which I believe were trained or based in part on GAP data for LANDFIRE. The Gap analysis was used for a document/program that assisted in developing County's comprehensive policies and goals. However, it was not integrated into the regulatory framework, therefore the data is not used widely by staff in permitting and review assessments. In recent years my work and the work of my students has had a focus of larger geographic scale (smaller area at more detail) so we have used NAIP imagery for current land cover information for our models. GAP is excellent data for more broad studies, and especially useful if it includes both current and historical layers. I think it's great data, it just doesn't fit my current research. I believe GAP land cover is a great dataset, however, the thematic classes generated by GAP do not meet my research requirements. Theme: What would be helpful (n = 4) We use the national GAP stewardship classification as a guide to categorize local land stewardship. We occasionally refer to SWReGAP data, as well as other national, state and regional land cover data. There should be a national process for gathering information from local land management agencies about changes in stewardship; or if there is one, I'd like to know about it. Regional, not statewide, GAP products would be most useful. Please develop a program to provide national land cover data every 5 years. GAP land cover is the most important data because it is used by the most people. States and other groups are now creating land cover data because GAP stopped, and those other data are often not consistent in classification schemes and methods. Relying on states and other groups to figure out how to provide regional maps is far less effective and less efficient than if GAP was providing this service nationally. Desktop tools to display GAP data are needed. Use of GAP data must not require advanced GIS skills, must be user friendly. Periodic updates (e.g., quarterly) on what GAP data are available. Provide examples of how GAP data are being used in natural resource management. Theme: Comments about errors in or accuracy of data (n = 4) The data provided by Iowa's GAP was the first comprehensive look at species distribution for almost all of Iowa's terrestrial vertebrate species. For many species, the data points used to determine distribution were often not current, but the information still allowed an informed interpretation of where each particular species might still be found. Based on my 35 years experience in the field, it seems the predicted range for most species was very accurate. I think GAP is invaluable data! I appreciate that we continue to update it and improve its accuracy. I'm hoping that we continue to work on the land cover data (i.e., improve Columbia Basin shrub-steppe). I have used gap for Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) assessments in Nevada, California, New Mexico, and Utah. I have found that it is many times inaccurate and I have had to tweek data in our BAER reports to reflect what is actually on the ground. CA gap sucks Gap data is in the foundation of the LANDFIRE program. I look forward to the day when these various data and the derivations are dependable. I really appreciate having national wall-to-wall data for regional analysis projects. Thank you for your foresight. Theme: Outreach/cooperation (n = 3) For federal folks, collaboration on Land Cover between GAP and LANDFIRE would be most beneficial. LANDFIRE is our default source for fire related analysis but GAP input could likely improve the land cover, especially in the Southeast United States. The greatest utility of the GAP data is now being made through a joint USGS/EPA effort to create a national level product entitled the Enviro Atlas. The GAP deductive models have been grouped into functional groups that represent ecosystem services. The first national deployment of the Atlas is scheduled in September 2013. This effort will significantly elevate the prominence of the GAP models, and subsequently the GAP Program. I suggest you contact Kevin Gergely or Alexa McKerrow to learn more. Collectively, the joint agency effort will be a game changer. The data is extremely useful. However, I don't see it marketed as much as I would like, and having easy online query tools could greatly enhance it's use. E.g. there is enough data there to provide any user at any location a habitat typing and a list of vertebrate species likely to be found. Why not partner with Google or the mobile application market to really get this data out there and in the hands of not just land managers, but the general public? Theme: More useful data available (n = 3) I did not know the GAP program was still active. With greater local data and GIS software availability I have been relying upon GAP like analyses on our land system using local data and ESRI's ArcGIS. Florida has relatively high-precision, high quality land cover data in the Cooperative Land Cover (CLC) dataset maintained by Florida Natural Areas Inventory with collaboration by Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission. Florida has other higher quality land cover and species distribution information that are the standards for conservation use in the state Theme: Negative comment regarding land-cover data (n = 3) The Gap program data is too coarse in its categories of land cover and because of that and inherent low resolution lacks the precision to be truly useful in operational forest or wildlife management...and related research. The consensus is that the GAP land cover produced for Ohio was a complete and total failure, with millions of dollars wasted. I have struggled with various land cover maps none of which seem to have data at the resolution that I need. Theme: Aquatic data (n = 3) My impression from exposure to the Iowa aquatic GAP analysis products is that the predictor variables were quite generalized and did not inspire a lot of confidence in the model's ability to predict fish species occurrence. The data used to develop the models is now outdated, in the sense that it does not include fish survey data from the past 10 years or so. Initially the NY Aquatic Gap program of USGS Cortland had been promoted as a capability that biologists could use in their office. In NY that hasn't happened, but the program supervisor has extracted data and made it available in a project last year. That is my limit of direct, personal involvement. I am most interested in aquatic species information. I'd like to see more modeling and datasets for aquatic systems. Theme: Comment about the survey (n = 3) I stated earlier that I do not use GAP data but could not complete the survey unless I gave some response as to use and familiarity of the data. These should have been blank for me -I was involved in GAP in a variety of ways -but never a user. The data seem to over [sic] wonderful potential -I would like to see the three components continue as they provide a comprehensive view of conservation in the US. As a high level administrator I don't deal directly with GAP data anymore, my staff does. Your survey doesn't allow me to answer in context with my position versus the usefulness of the information to the agency. I did not complete this survey because I am the office director/administrator and forwarded the survey to my data manager who as I recall responded to the survey. I only know we have used GAP data in the past and assume we still use it. I did not forward this email to my data manager because directions said not to. Seems you should have had a question about whether recipient is the right target/person. Theme: How GAP data were used (n = 2) I have used the landcover data for developing logistic regression models for species distribution in R and ArcGis. I have used gap analysis and its data in a conceptual way in reports to two federal agencies -suggesting that they need to use gap data in their analyses to prioritize future conservation areas. No theme: In Maine, the most significant problem was that the actual data was not available; there were summary reports. The actual data was to be published prior and the timeframe was unworkable for on the ground conservation planning and implementation needs of our agency. We were able to access GAP gis data for use in other States. Up-to-date land cover data is still an important need for our state, however given the age of the GAP project data in our state (MN) the usefulness of GAP for this purpose is limited. The species distribution data has been of limited use as far as I can tell, for MN. The Stewardship component is poor, and was out of date before it was even published. In MN the GAP project was essentially seen as a means to get a Land Cover dataset by the DNR Forestry division. Our DNR Natural Heritage Program and our County Biological Survey Programs and Wildlife Programs were already mature and not interested in the data produced from the GAP process. They were already taking a much more detailed approach. Now the MN GAP data is over 15 years old and of little use except for timechange analysis. NLCD has become the Land Cover dataset of record, and the DNR is in the process of completing and consolidating its native plant community inventory GIS. The stewardship layer has been the most useful layer long term. Landcover was used extensively until other current datasets replaced it. PSD was the most marginal dataset for usefulness The Predicted Species Distributions was too general to be very useful for anything but very general planning. Stewardship/protected areas was so out-of-date it was not useful. BLM had much better data. Just waiting for ReGAP It's too coarse to be useful for most of our applications, so we rarely use it, although as a last resort it's better than nothing. At the close of the nonresponse survey, respondents were asked to provide an email address if they wanted to receive notifications of new release of GAP data, products, and other information. Sixtyone respondents provided an email address."}, {"section_title": "Limitations to Report", "text": "This report to respondents provides a preliminary summary of the results of the survey regarding the use of GAP data. Although the frequencies of responses and the average response for the questions are useful information, these summary statistics do not constitute complete analyses of the survey data."}]
