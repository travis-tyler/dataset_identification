[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Different modalities such as structural MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF have complementary information, which is likely to be very useful for diagnosis of AD and MCI. Therefore, it is possible to develop a more effective and accurate AD/MCI automatic diagnosis method by integrating complementary information of different modalities. In this paper, we propose multi-modal sparse hierarchical extreme leaning machine (MSH-ELM). We used volume and mean intensity extracted from 93 regions of interest (ROIs) as features of MRI and FDG-PET, respectively, and used p-tau, t-tau, and Ab 42 as CSF features. In detail, high-level representation was individually extracted from each of MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF using a stacked sparse extreme learning machine auto-encoder (sELM-AE). Then, another stacked sELM-AE was devised to acquire a joint hierarchical feature representation by fusing the high-level representations obtained from each modality. Finally, we classified joint hierarchical feature representation using a kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM).\nThe results of MSH-ELM were compared with those of conventional ELM, single kernel support vector machine (SK-SVM), multiple kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) and stacked autoencoder (SAE). Performance was evaluated through 10-fold cross-validation. In the classification of AD vs. HC and MCI vs. HC problem, the proposed MSH-ELM method showed mean balanced accuracies of 96.10% and 86.46%, respectively, which is much better than those of competing methods. In summary, the proposed algorithm exhibits consistently better performance than SK-SVM, ELM, MK-SVM and SAE in the two binary classification problems (AD vs. HC and MCI vs.\nHC).\nAlzheimer's disease, CS, mild cognitive impairment, MRI, multimodal classification, PET, sparse hierarchical extreme learning machine\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia type in the elderly. The number of people suffering from AD is increasing rapidly every year. Because AD is a degenerative disease and progressively attacks memory cells, the development of early diagnostic tools for AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is essential. AD is known to be closely related to structural atrophy, pathological amyloid depositions, and metabolic alterations in the brain (Jack et al., 2010; Nestor, Scheltens, & Hodges, 2004) . For this reason, brain atrophy measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hypometabolism measured by functional imaging, and quantification of specific proteins measured by CSF have been used for AD/MCI diagnosis. In general, features extracted from the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and cingulate using structural MRIs have been reported to be the most effective in classifying AD/MCI, and these results are consistent with those of previous studies based on group comparison methods (Ch etelat et al., 2002; Convit et al., 2000; Fox, & Schott, 2004; Jack et al., 1999; Misra, Fan, & Davatzikos, 2009 ). In addition to structural MRI, another important modality for AD and MCI diagnosis is fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) (Ch etelat et al., 2003; Foster et al., 2007; Higdon et al., 2004 et al. (2004) and Drzezga et al. (2003) showed that there is a decrease in glucose metabolism in the parietal, posterior cingulate, and temporal brain regions of AD patients (Diehl et al., 2004; Drzezga et al., 2003) .\nAnother modality that is important for diagnosis of AD and MCI is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is generally known that increased CSF total tau (t-tau), tau hyperphosphorylated (p-tau), and reduced amyloid b (Ab 42 ) at threonine 181 appear in AD patients (Bouwman et al., 2007; Ji et al., 2001; De Leon et al., 2007). Different modalities such as structural MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF have complementary information, which is likely to be very useful for diagnosis of AD and MCI (Apostolova et al., 2010; Fjell et al., 2010; Foster et al., 2007; Landau et al., 2010; De Leon et al., 2007; Walhovd et al., 2010) . For this reason, a number of studies have reportedly integrated multiple modalities such as MRI, PET, and CSF rather than using a single modality to improve the performance of AD/MCI automatic diagnosis (Cui et al., 2011; Fan et al., 2007; Kohannim et al., 2010; Suk & Shen, 2013; Walhovd et al., 2010; Westman, Muehlboeck, & Simmons, 2012; Yuan et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2011; Zhang, & Shen, 2012) . Learning by most deep learning architectures is based on a backpropagation algorithm that iteratively adjusts the parameters of all layers.\nFor this reason, conventional neural networks require numerous iterations to obtain good generalization performance (Huang et al., 2004) . To overcome this situation, Huang, Zhu, and Siew (2004) proposed an extreme learning machine (ELM) with good generalization performance and computational efficiency by randomly assigning input layer weights and analytically calculating hidden layer weights. However, ELM is fundamentally a shallow network, which makes it difficult to obtain a hierarchical representation of the data (Cao et al., 2012; Cao, & Lin, 2015) .\nTo overcome these limitations, the deep ELM (DELM) algorithm was proposed by Kasun, Zhou, Huang, and Vong (2013), with the ELM autoencoder (ELM-AE) as its base building block. Tang et al. (2016) proposed a sparse ELM-AE, which is an improved version of the existing ELM-AE, by learning the hidden layer weights sparsely (Tang et al., 2016) . Wei, Liu, Yan, and Sun (2016) proposed a multi-modal deep ELM-AE (MM-DELM) framework, an extended version of DELM, for multi-modal data analysis and classification. MM-DELM reportedly had successful performance in robotic grasping problems (Wei et al., 2016) .\nIn this article, we propose a multi-modal sparse hierarchical extreme learning machine (MSH-ELM) that employs a sparse ELM-AE as a base building block. Through the MSH-ELM algorithm, we will extract joint hierarchical representations from three modalities (MRI, Our contributions of this study are as follows:\n1. We propose an automated AD/MCI discrimination method based on a deep extreme learning machine framework. Compared to conventional ELM which is shallow network, deep extreme learning machine which is deep neural network and stacked by ELM auto-encoder (ELM-AE) can more effectively extract optimal features from the data. This is the first study to introduce a deep extreme learning machine framework for AD and MCI classification.\n2. Our proposed framework employs a novel architecture which extracts optimal features from structural MR image, PET, and CSF modalities, simultaneously. Deep extreme learning machine models for multi-modal data have been rarely studied, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-modal deep extreme learning model for medical image classification.\n3. The base building block of our proposed framework is sparse ELM auto-encoder (sELM-AE). sELM-AE can generate sparser and more compact features from the data compared to ELM-AE. This is the first algorithm to apply sELM-AE as base building block into multimodal deep extreme learning machine framework. 5. The classification performance of our framework is expected to be superior to other conventional classification algorithms such as ELM, SVM, and MK-SVM and so on because of deep neural network structure, sparse, and jointly optimized multi-modal feature extraction characteristics. This will be addressed in detail through this study.\nThe remainder of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the information contained in the ADNI database that we used for this study and the preprocessing procedure. Section 2.1 discusses related work, including the fundamental concepts and theories of ELM and the proposed MSH-ELM framework. Sections 4 and 5 present the results and discussion of the proposed method, respectively. Section 3 presents the concluding remarks.\n| M A TE RI A L S A ND I M A GE P ROC ESSI N G\nThe data used in this study were obtained from the ADNI dataset, which is publicly available on the web (www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI).\nDetailed information on the subjects is presented in Table 1 . General criteria for categorizing HC, AD, and MCI are explained on the web (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu). The subjects ranged in age from 55 to 90 years, and independent functioning assessments were evaluated by the study partner. The general inclusion/exclusion criteria were as follows:\nhealthy control (HC) subjects had Mini-Mental State Examination In this study, we only used the baseline MRI, 18-FluoroDeoxyGlucose PET (FDG-PET), and CSF data acquired from 51 AD subjects, 99 MCI subjects, and 52 healthy control (HC) subjects, who included all three modalities at baseline. All subject IDs used in this study are provided in Supporting Information.\nAll structural MR scans were collected from 1.5 T scanners. We downloaded MR images in the Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) format. All MR images were preprocessed for spatial distortion correction owing to gradient nonlinearity and B1 field inhomogeneity.\nThe FDG-PET images were collected 30-60 min after injection.\nThe obtained images were averaged, spatially aligned, interpolated to a standard voxel size, normalized in intensity, and smoothed to a common resolution of 8 mm full-width at half-maximum.\nCSF data were acquired in the morning using a 20-or 24-G spinal needle after overnight fasting. CSF was frozen within 1 h after acquisition, and transported to the ADNI biomarker core laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center.\nFor simplicity of algorithm comparison, we followed the image preprocessing procedure of other studies that classified AD using multi-modal data. For the same reason, we used the Kabani template as the MRI atlas in this study (Kabani et al., 1998) . The Kabani template consists of 93 regions including parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampal formation, and so on. The detailed information about the region is provided in the Supporting Information, S4.\nBoth MR and PET images were preprocessed using the following procedures. First, in the case of MR images, we applied anterior commissure (AC)-posterior commissure (PC) correction, and the N3 algorithm to correct the intensity inhomogeneity of MR images using MIPAV software. Next, skull stripping and cerebellum removal were performed using both brain surface extractor (BSE) (Shattuck et al., 2001 ) and brain extraction tool (BET) (Smith, 2002 CDR (mean 6 SD) 0 6 0 (0-0) 0.5 6 0 (0-0.5) 0.7 6 0.3 (0.5-1)\nNote.

As GM is highly related to both AD and MCI, we only considered the volume of GM tissue in each ROI and used it as a feature of structural MRI.\nIn the case of the PET images, we rigidly aligned them to the corresponding MR images using MIPAV software, and used the mean intensity of each ROI as a feature of FDG-PET.\nIn the case of CSF, CSF Ab 42 , CSF t-tau, and CSF p-tau were used as the features of CSF for discriminating the AD/MCI from HC. Therefore, totals of 93 features from the structural MR image, 93 features from the FDG-PET image, and 3 features from the CSF data were obtained for each subject. Figure 1 illustrates all the techniques and procedures of this study. As shown in Figure 1 , GM volume and the mean intensity for each ROI were extracted from preprocessed MR and PET images, respectively, and CSF Ab 42 , CSF t-tau, and CSF p-tau were utilized as CSF features.\nFirst, high-level representations of features extracted from each modality were individually computed using the stacked sparse ELM auto-encoder (sELM-AE). Then, another stacked sELM-AE was used to obtain the joint hierarchical feature representation of three modalities (MRI, PET, and CSF), taking the high-level representations of each modality as the input. Finally, we classified the obtained joint hierarchical feature representation using the kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM). We performed this series of processes in an integrated framework called the multi-modal sparse hierarchical extreme learning machine (MSH-ELM).\nWe evaluated the effectiveness of MSH-ELM by considering two binary classification problems (AD vs. HC and MCI vs. HC) based on the MRI, PET, and CSF biomarkers of 202 baseline subjects in ADNI1\nand compared the performance of MSH-ELM with those of SK-SVM, conventional ELM, MK-SVM, and SAE. To estimate the performances of the proposed method and comparative classifiers, 10-fold cross-validation was used in this study. Specifically, we split the dataset into 10 subsets at random, with each subset containing 10% of the total data.\nWe used nine sets of 10 subsets for training, and the remaining one "}, {"section_title": "", "text": "and Drzezga et al.

Different modalities such as structural MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF have complementary information, which is likely to be very useful for diagnosis of AD and MCI (Apostolova et al., 2010; Fjell et al., 2010; Foster et al., 2007; Landau et al., 2010; De Leon et al., 2007; Walhovd et al., 2010) .

For example, Kohannim et al. (2010) concatenated the features extracted from various modalities into a vector and classified it using support vector machine (SVM) (Kohannim et al., 2010) . Walhovd et al. (2010) used multi-method stepwise logistic regression analysis to integrate multiple modalities. Hinrichs, Singh, Xu, and Johnson (2011) , Suk and Shen (2013) , and Zhang et al. (2011) used a kernel-based machine learning method such as multiple kernel SVM (MK-SVM) to integrate complementary information from multi-modal data (Hinrichs et al., 2011; Suk & Shen, 2013; Zhang et al., 2011) .\nRecently, deep learning has become a promising technology in the machine learning field. Deep learning refers to the learning of multiple levels of representation and abstraction. Deep learning has resulted in significant performance improvements in data analysis and classification of images, sounds, and text. In recent years, increasingly more attempts have been made to use deep learning techniques for multimodal data analysis and classification. For example, Wang et al. (2014) used stacked auto-encoders to obtain seamless information from various types of media. Srivastava and Salakhutdinov (2012) proposed a multi-modal deep belief network to obtain joint representations of image and text data (Srivastava & Salakhutdinov, 2012) . Ouyang, Chu, and Wang (2014) developed a multi-source deep model to obtain information for human pose estimation. Suk and Shen (2013) proposed a method of integrating MRI, PET, and CSF modalities for automatic diagnosis of AD using stacked auto-encoders.\nLearning by most deep learning architectures is based on a backpropagation algorithm that iteratively adjusts the parameters of all layers.\nFor this reason, conventional neural networks require numerous iterations to obtain good generalization performance (Huang et al., 2004) .

Through the MSH-ELM algorithm, we will extract joint hierarchical representations from three modalities (MRI, PET, and CSF), and finally classify AD and MCI from healthy controls (HC). Volume from MRI, mean intensity from PET, and Ab 42 , t-tau, and p-tau from CSF were used as the features of classifier. Particularly, the reason for using volume as a feature of MRI is that there are many studies that the volume reflects the brain atrophy induced by AD (Guo et al., 2010; Hirata et al., 2005; Ishii et al., 2005; Karas et al., 2003; Matsuda et al., 2012; Vemuri et al., 2009; Whitwell et al., 2007) .\nOur experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset prove the utility of the proposed method. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we compared the classification performance with the single kernel support vector machine (SK-SVM), conventional ELM, multiple kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM), and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) (Liu et al., 2014a; Suk & Shen, 2013; Zhang et al., 2011) .\nOur contributions of this study are as follows:\n1.

Boldface denotes the best performance in individual metric for each classification task.\nOn the basis of the results presented above, the proposed method is clearly superior to MK-SVM and SK-SVM in the problem of classifying AD and MCI from HC."}, {"section_title": "| Comparison with other studies", "text": "In Table 4 , the classification accuracy of the proposed method is compared with the results of a recently published studies that used multi-modality data in the classification of AD and MCI from HC.\nIt should be noted that direct comparison of performance between methods is not fair because of the different datasets, preprocessing procedures, and type of features. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that the proposed method has the highest accuracy among the methods reported in the classification problem of AD and MCI from HC."}, {"section_title": "| Effect of feature selection", "text": "In the previous section, we applied the proposed multi-modal classification method without feature selection for AD and MCI classification. In this section, the proposed method with feature selection is tested and compared with the performance of the proposed method without feature selection. The main objective of this section is to verify whether feature selection is effective for the proposed method. For this reason, we simply applied a feature selection method based on the t test and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) which are widely used in this field. We performed a paired t-test and LASSO on training samples to choose the optimal subset of features. Table 5 shows the list of top 10 brain regions selected by the t-test-based feature selection algorithm in AD classification and Figures 4 and 5 present the brain areas detected from MRI and PET in the template MRI Note.

Boldface denotes the best performance in each classification task.\nspace, respectively. The selected regions include the amygdala, hippocampal formation, and uncus, which is known to be highly related to the AD by numerous studies based on the group comparison methods.\nIn particular, the hippocampus, which is found in both Figures 4 and 5, is a brain area that plays an important role in information integration from short-term memory to long-term memory and is known as the first brain area to be damaged by Alzheimer's disease (Ch etelat et al., 2002; Convit et al., 2000; Fox et al., 2004; Jack et al., 1999; Misra et al., 2009) . We computed the classification accuracies according to the number of selected features and filled out the result of the feature subset showing the best classification performance in Table 6 . Interestingly, there was no significant difference in the results between with feature selection and without feature selection. We assume that these results suggest that MSH-ELM itself extracts compact and optimal feature subsets that are equal to or greater than the t-test-based feature selection method and LASSO based feature selection method.\nHowever, if the advanced method is used instead of the simple feature selection method, the above results may be different. Therefore, further study about the effect of feature selection on the proposed method is needed."}, {"section_title": "| D ISC USSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "| Comparative algorithms", "text": "We compared the performance of MSH-ELM to those of SK-SVM, ELM, MK-SVM, and SAE. The reasons for choosing SK-SVM, ELM, MK-SVM, and SAE as comparative algorithms are as follows: (a) SK-SVM has been widely used as a reference classifier for performance comparison in AD/MCI classification problem (Cui et al., 2011; Dyrba et al., 2012; Li et al., 2015; Liu, Wee, Chen, and Shen, 2014a; Liu et al., 2014b; Suk and Shen, 2013; Zhang et al., 2011) . (b) ELM was selected (Zhang et al., 2011) . Therefore, MK-SVM has been used as a comparative algorithm in many studies related to AD/MCI classification (Dyrba et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2014b; Suk, Lee, and Shen, 2015; Suk and Shen, 2013 (Suk and Shen, 2013) . Another reason to select SAE as comparative algorithm is that SAE is very similar to MSH-ELM in that SAE is a deep neural network built with many autoencoders and trained by greedy layerwise. The major difference between SAE and MSH-ELM is that ELM-AE is used as a base building block and multi-modal feature extraction is performed in MSH-ELM.\nWe expected to verify the effectiveness of ELM-AE and multi-modal feature extraction through comparison of the performances of the two algorithms."}, {"section_title": "| Performance analysis", "text": "The proposed MSH-ELM shows better AD classification performance than conventional ELM using individual single modality data or simple concatenation feature of multi-modality data (MRI, PET, and CSF). This means that MSH-ELM, a deep network, discovered the optimal feature representation for AD classification that was not found in a conventional ELM, shallow network. In addition, MSH-ELM effectively extracted AD-related complementary features from multiple modalities which are helpful for discrimination of AD, MCI, and HC. As shown in Tables 2 and 3 , the ability of MSH-ELM to integrate multi-modal data is superior to that of MK-SVM, which is widely used in AD classification using multi-modal data.\nAdditionally, we compared the classification performance of MSH-ELM with SAE which is the back propagation-based multi-layer perceptron (MLP) learning algorithm. MSH-ELM showed higher performance than that of SAE in two binary classification problems (AD vs. HC and MCI vs. HC).\nFurthermore, the computation load of MSH-ELM is much lower than SAE as the base building block of MSH-ELM is ELM-AE, which randomly assigns the weights for hidden layer. According to Tang et al. (2016) , MLP using ELM-AE as a base building block is more efficient than the latest back propagation-based MLP (SAE, deep belief network, and deep Boltzmann machine) for MNIST and NORB dataset classification in terms of classification accuracy and computation speed.\nAnother interesting aspect of the MSH-ELM is that the MSH-ELM exhibits excellent classification performance even though the dimension of the hidden neurons was higher than that of input neuron.\nWe think that this is because the base building block of MSH-ELM is a sparse ELM auto-encoder. Imposing the sparsity constraint on the hidden units allows the hidden layers to have larger number of units than the input dimension (Larochelle et al., 2009; Suk and Shen, 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "| Limitations and future work", "text": "In this study, although the proposed multi-modal classification framework exhibits utility in binary classification cases (AD vs. HC and MCI vs. HC), it has several limitations.\nThe first limitation is the lack of the number of data samples (52 AD, 99 MCI, and 51 NC) to learn the proposed algorithm. For this reason, we cannot be certain that the joint hierarchical feature representations extracted from the proposed method are globally optimal.\nTherefore, additional research is needed such as learning the optimal parameters of the deep network structure from large data samples for practical use in a clinical environment.\nAnother limitation is that it is difficult to interpret the joint hierarchical feature representation extracted by the MSH-ELM method and to provide effective clinical information. Thus, further research is required to provide clinicians with useful information such as brain regions that are highly related to AD and MCI.\nNext, the training procedure of hierarchical feature extractor and classifier for MSH-ELM is not performed simultaneously. We expect that the performance of MSH-ELM would be improved by developing a way to train hierarchical feature extractors and classifiers together.\nMultiple kernel learning (MKL) which has been recently studied for joint optimal feature fusion might be a suitable way to improve the performance of MSH-ELM. For example, multiple kernel ELM (MK-ELM)\nproposed by Liu et al. shows the improvement of classifier by applying MKL into ELM for Protein, Oxford Flower17, Caltech101 and Alzheimer's disease data sets (Liu et al., 2015) . To estimate the possibility of joint optimal feature fusion based on MKL and identify the effectiveness of multi-modal feature extraction capability of MSH-ELM, we additionally conducted both simpleMKL and MK-ELM for automatic diagnosis of AD from NC. We used the SimpleMKL toolbox to implement the simpleMKL method and Multi-Kernel-Extreme-LearningMachine toolbox to implement the MK-ELM method (code is available at http://asi.insa-rouen.fr/enseignants/~arakoto/code/mklindex.html and https://github.com/xinwangliu/Multi-Kernel-Extreme-LearningMachine) (Rakotomamonjy et al., 2008) . We conducted simpleMKL and MK-ELM using (a) raw feature or (b) joint learned feature from multimodal feature extractor of MSH-ELM as the input of the classifier. We used SVM as a classifier for simpleMKL and fixed the tradeoff parameter, C 5 100 as it shows the best classification performance in validation set. Linear kernel and Gaussian kernels with 10 different kernel bandwidths ({2 23 , 2 22 ,. . ., 2 6 } multiplied by ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi number of features p ) for each feature representation was applied to simpleMKL and MK-ELM (Liu et al., 2013) . When using the raw features as the input of the classifier, the simpleMKL and MK-ELM's balanced accuracy were around 0.90 very similarly. When using the joint learned features obtained from the sELM-AE of the MSH-ELM, the simpleMKL's balance accuracy was 0.94 and the MK-ELM's balance accuracy was 0.93. This results show that feature extractor of MSH-ELM is very robust for multi-modal feature extraction, and joint learned features of MSH-ELM are better classified using the single kernel ELM than using multiple kernel methods in our case. It is necessary to develop a better method than existing MKL to improve the performance of AD classification and extract joint multi-modal optimal feature.\nFinally, our multi-modal classification framework only considers structural MRI, PET, and CSF. However, it is expected that combining as many modalities as possible would be efficient for discrimination of AD and MCI from HC. Accordingly, in further studies, we will build a multi-modal classification framework that combines the multi-modal data including medical imaging, genetics, proteomics, and cognition."}, {"section_title": "| CON CL USI ON", "text": "In this article, we proposed a method for obtaining joint hierarchical "}]
