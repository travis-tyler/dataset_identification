Here, we aimed to assess whether resting-state FC in core brain regions activated during memory-task functional magnetic resonance imaging is altered and predictive of memory performance in AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Twenty-three elderly cognitively healthy controls (HC), 76 aMCI subjects, and 19 AD dementia patients were included. We computed resting-state FC between 18 meta-analytically determined peak coordinates of brain activation during successful memory retrieval. Higher FC between the parahippocampus, parietal cortex, and the middle frontal gyrus was observed in both AD and mild cognitive impairment compared to HC (false-discovery ratedcorrected p < 0.05). The increase in FC between the parahippocampus and middle frontal gyrus was associated with reduced episodic memory in aMCI, independent of amyloid-beta positron emission tomography binding and apolipoprotein E \u03b54-carrier status. In conclusion, increased parahippocampal-prefrontal FC is predictive of impaired episodic memory in aMCI and may reflect a dysfunctional change within the episodic memoryerelated neural network."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Enhanced resting-state functional connectivity between core memory-task activation peaks is associated with memory impairment in MCI Studies including resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have revealed large-scale functional networks in the human brain. Such resting-state networks show high functional connectivity (FC) , that is, a synchronization of spontaneous lowfrequency fluctuations in brain activity between different brain regions. Because resting-state fMRI is acquired without engaging the subjects in a particular cognitive task (i.e., during rest), resting-state FC can be considered a measure of basic activity of intrinsic functional networks in the brain (Smith et al., 2009) . In Alzheimer's disease (AD), altered FC in resting-state networks has been reported across the spectrum of clinical severity including elderly cognitively normal subjects with increased levels of amyloid burden, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and dementia (Greicius et al., 2004; Hedden et al., 2009; Sorg et al., 2007) . Such abnormalities of FC were detected in AD even when controlling for gray matter atrophy (Agosta et al., 2012; Sorg et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2013) . Together, these results suggest that alterations of FC in resting-state networks are an independent, early brain change in the course of AD.\nThe functional implications of such resting-state FC changes are debated (for review see Pievani et al., 2014) . Resting-state fMRI makes no task demands to the patient, which has advantages for clinical practice. In the present study, we aimed to identify restingstate network changes that are associated with episodic memory impairment in aMCI. The rationale for using resting-state FC as a predictor of memory performance comes from the known spatial overlap between resting-state networks and task-related networks for cognitive functions (Li et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2009; Yeo et al., 2011) . The activity of resting-state networks is modulated during tasks, suggesting that resting-state networks are the building blocks of task-related brain activation underlying cognitive performance (Li et al., 2015) .\nIn AD, the resting-state network that is most prominently affected is the default mode network (DMN). This network includes several brain regions known to be involved in episodic memory retrieval such as the posterior cingulate and hippocampus (Huijbers et al., 2012) . A reduction of FC within the DMN has been observed in preclinical AD, aMCI, and dementia (Greicius et al., 2004; Hedden et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2013) and was found to be associated with lower episodic memory performance (Wang et al., 2013) . Deficits in episodic memory have further been associated with increased FC in the hippocampus of aMCI and AD patients Wang et al., 2013) . However, several studies failed to reveal an association between FC in the DMN and memory impairment in AD or aMCI (Agosta et al., 2012; Binnewijzend et al., 2012) .\nTo understand which resting-state FC changes are related to episodic memory performance, brain regions other than the DMN need to be taken into account. Areas commonly activated during memory encoding or retrieval are distributed across several of the \"classic\" resting-state networks (Li et al., 2015) , suggesting that brain activity underlying episodic memory is not confined to any single network (Damoiseaux et al., 2006) . For example, a recent resting-state fMRI study showed that resting-state FC between different resting-state networks such as the DMN, cingularopercular network, and the frontoparietal attention network was associated with memory performance in cognitively healthy subjects (Geerligs et al., 2015) .\nIn the present study, we mapped the number of connections and the strength of resting-state FC between meta-analytically determined hotspots of brain activation observed during successful memory retrieval (Spaniol et al., 2009) . The aims of the present study were to test whether FC between these core brain regions (1) can be observed during rest, (2) is altered in aMCI and AD, and (3) is predictive of episodic memory impairment as assessed by standard neuropsychological tests."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "All subjects were recruited within the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, phase GO and II, www.loni.ucla. edu/ADNI; Weiner et al., 2013) .

Differences in the number of significant connections between groups were computed via 2-sample t tests.\nTo select potential predictors of episodic memory performance among the high number of ROI-to-ROI values, we applied the following 2-step procedure. In the first step, we tested for which ROI-to-ROI connections the strength of FC was abnormally changed in AD dementia subjects compared to HC subjects. To this end, we applied analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) including diagnosis (HC vs. AD), age, gender, and education as independent variables (training sample). The p-value for each ANCOVA was FDR-corrected at p < 0.05 (for n \u00bc 153 multiple comparisons).

We computed linear regression models including episodic memory score as the dependent variable and strength of FC, age, gender, education, and MMSE as independent variables. For exploratory reasons, we compared the strength of FC values among all groups including HC, aMCI, and AD.

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The first major finding of the present study was the increased strength and number of connections between peak locations of memory taskerelated brain activation in aMCI and AD dementia subjects compared to HC. The second major finding was that the abnormal increase in the strength of FC between the MFG and the PHC was associated with reduced episodic memory performance in aMCI and AD dementia.\nThe current finding of increased strength of FC in aMCI and AD is in line with previous reports of increased strength of FC between the hippocampus and the lateral prefrontal cortex (Wang et al., 2006) . Those studies which explored FC changes within the whole brain in patients with AD dementia reported increased strength of FC within the frontoparietal and prefrontal resting-state network (Agosta et al., 2012) and increased strength of FC between widely distributed cortical ROIs (Gardini et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2007) . In contrast, reduced resting-state FC in patients with MCI and AD was primarily confined to the DMN in previous studies (Agosta et al., 2012; Binnewijzend et al., 2012; Greicius et al., 2004) . For the present study, the increase in the strength of FC was found exclusively for connections that were not confined to the DMN but spanned different functional clusters, that is, the connections were between the frontoparietal network (MFG ROI) and the posterior DMN (AG ROI), medial temporal lobe subsystem (parahippocampus), or a subcortical cluster (thalamus). In summary, these results suggest an increase in the strength of FC between brain regions that are typically activated during episodic memory retrieval across different resting-state networks in MCI and AD patients.\nThe second major finding showed that an abnormal increase in the strength of FC was associated with reduced episodic memory performance in aMCI. These findings are in agreement with previous reports of an association between increased local strength of FC within the hippocampus and lower episodic memory performance in AD dementia patients . In cognitively normal subjects, higher levels of interhemispheric FC between the hippocampi were associated with increased higher age and associated with faster memory decline (Salami et al., 2014) . Here, we extended these findings by showing that the increased strength of FC between the hippocampus and lateral frontal cortex is associated with memory decline in aMCI. Task-related studies have shown elevated levels of hippocampus and parahippocampus activation in patients with aMCI (Dickerson et al., 2004 (Dickerson et al., , 2005 . Higher abnormal increase in hippocampus activation was associated with faster subsequent cognitive decline in aMCI (Miller et al., 2008) .\nTreatment of aMCI patients with an antiepileptic drug that reduced hippocampus hyperactivation lead to improved memory performance (Bakker et al., 2012) . Together, these results suggest that hippocampus hyperactivity and the hyperconnectivity to brain areas involved in memory-related brain activation is detrimental to episodic memory performance in aMCI.\nResults of a recent meta-analysis of resting-state fMRI studies suggested increased FC in brain areas such as the subcortical structures and the medial temporal and parietal lobe that occurred early in the course of AD (Jacobs et al., 2013) . Increased activation of medial temporal lobe and parietal brain regions has also been observed in relation to memory task-fMRI, when tested in the preclinical and prodromal stage of AD (Celone et al., 2006; Sperling, et al., 2009 Sperling, et al., , 2010 . The question arises whether increased restingstate fMRI connectivity within the medial temporal lobe and other brain regions may constitute a candidate biomarker for the early detection of AD-related brain abnormalities (Jacobs et al., 2013) . Compared to task-fMRI, resting-state fMRI is due to its task-free and relatively short assessment attractive for clinical application. Few studies, however, have tested resting-state fMRI for the detection of MCI or AD dementia (Bai et al., 2011; Dyrba et al., 2015; Wee et al., 2012) , where resting-state fMRI connectivity measures alone stayed below a clinically relevant classification accuracy below 85%. For resting-state fMRI, feature selection, interindividual stability, and multicenter variability of FC are currently an intense area of research (Biswal et al., 2010; Feis et al., 2015) and may provide an important basis to increase the predictive accuracy of resting-state fMRI.\nThe underlying nature of the increase in FC in aMCI and AD is not known. One possible explanation is that increased brain activation results from increased deposition of Ab. Previous studies showed that increased brain activity during memory task was associated with Ab deposition in elderly cognitively healthy subjects (Elman et al., 2014) and aMCI patients (Huijbers et al., 2015) . Results obtained in mice suggest that levels of Ab are associated with epileptic spikes in neural activity, which may potentially explain increased neural activity in patients with AD. However, whether increased Ab levels in the brain can also account for the increase in FC is questionable. If Ab leads to aberrant neural activity, FC may not be increased, since FC requires the coordinated activity between different brain areas rather than a local increase in brain activity. In the present study, we did not find the observed increase in FC to be dependent on Ab when tested in the aMCI subjects. These results suggest that increased levels of Ab may not be necessary for the increase in FC in aMCI. An alternative explanation is that the increase in FC reflects less efficient neural network activity. According to the dedifferentiation hypothesis, age-related changes in brain function lead to more diffuse brain activity due to less efficient neural processing (Dennis and Cabeza, 2011) . Consistent with the dedifferentiation hypothesis, a study in elderly cognitively healthy subjects found an age-related decrease in modularity of resting-state FC within networks and increased inter-network connectivity (Geerligs et al., 2015) . In the present study, we found not only increased strength of FC but also a higher number of connections in MCI and AD compared to HC. The number of connections peaked in MCI, being significantly higher compared to AD. It is possible that this increased density of the connections within the network may represent a more diffuse and less efficient processing. Less efficient neural processing may require increased FC, that is, a compensatory recruitment of additional neural resources to maintain task performance (Dickerson et al., 2004; Grady et al., 2003) . Thus, the current finding of an inverse association between increased FC and memory performance may reflect a failed compensatory attempt (Bakker et al., 2012; Pasquini et al., 2014) . However, a caveat of this interpretation is that the present study did not aim to assess efficiency of the network, and thus, no metric of efficiency or experimental manipulation of efficient processing was included. Therefore, this hypothesis requires confirmation in future studies.\nIt is important to acknowledge the potential limitations of our study. Increased levels of FC during resting-state FC provide only a snapshot of brain activity. During resting state, \"spontaneous\" brain activation is sampled without reference to external events and, thus, is inherently ambiguous to interpret. To alleviate this drawback, we attempted to tailor the study in a hypothesis-driven way, focusing on meta-analysisederived brain regions that have previously been found to be activated during memory retrieval processes. However, a combined resting-state and memory taskerelated fMRI study design (Koch et al., 2014) is encouraged for future studies to investigate the association between rsfMRI and memory performance.\nWe also caution that the multisite acquisition of resting-state fMRI may have introduced between-site variability. In ADNI, fMRI scans, however, are acquired exclusively on Philips 3T MRI scanners, where standard resting-state fMRI sequences are applied across sites. Thus, such a study design may reduce the influence of major sources of interscanner variability. A statistical control or assessment of any intersite variability in the present study is almost impossible due to relatively high number of sites that contribute data.\nDespite such drawbacks of resting-state fMRI, the current results on FC changes between core brain regions underlying episodic memory retrieval support the notion that resting-state fMRI provides a \"window\" to assess neural network function underlying cognitive performance. The present study provides an approach to design resting-state FC analysis to assess FC changes for predicting episodic memory impairment in MCI. FC is currently not established as a neuroimaging biomarker. Longitudinal studies to examine the value of FC for predicting future cognitive decline are needed."}, {"section_title": "Disclosure statement", "text": "The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose."}]
