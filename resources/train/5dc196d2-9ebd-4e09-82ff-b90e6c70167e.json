Because postsecondary students invest a considerable amount of time and money to obtain these credentials, it is important to learn about their labor market experiences after they graduate or when they leave without graduating. What kinds of jobs do they get? How much money do they earn? What are their experiences with unemployment? If they have borrowed to finance their education, what are the financial and other implications of this borrowing after they leave postsecondary education? Can they afford to pay back their loans without undue hardship? How does borrowing affect their further education and lifestyle choices? These questions are addressed in this report.\nHow much debt is too much? This question has been debated by legislators, policymakers, and members of the postsecondary community for more than a decade.4 Without disputing the fact that loans provide students who otherwise would not have the resources to go to college a way to invest in their future, much concern has been expressed about student debt levels and whether the growing dependence on loans is creating serious problems for the borrowers and for society. One set of concerns. centers on whether students are in danger of defaulting, a situation that has financial consequences for the students themselves, the institutions they attend, and the loan programs through which they have borrowed. A second set of concerns relates to the possibility that the prospect of borrowing and heavy debt may discourage students (especially minorities and others who are traditionally underserved) from enrolling in postsecondary education or cause them to drop out before they reach their educational goals. A third set of concerns focuses on how debt affects students' postgraduation plans. That is, does it prevent them from continuing their education to the next level, entering a field that is socially beneficial but not necessarily well paying (such as teaching), or buying a home or car or forming a family at approximately the same time as their peers without education loans to repay? This report uses data collected by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to examine the experiences of postsecondary education participants who have recently graduated or dropped out. The rest of this section describes the data and the characteristics of the groups included in the analysis. The next section .describes their early labor force experiences, including how many were working, their occupations, their earnings, and their experience with unemployment. This is followed by a description of their borrowing and its impact on their career choices and plans for graduate school. The next section addresses loan repayment and the debt burden implied by borrowers' current income and repayment obligations and reported information about other aspects of their financial circumstances.

Over the past two decades, borrowing has become an increasingly common way for undergraduates to finance their education. In 1990-91, for example, 65 percent of federal grant, loan, and work-study aid was awarded in the form of loans, compared with 39 percent 20 years earlier.1 In the 1992-93 academic year, borrowing through the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program totaled $14.9 billion.2 With the introduction of unsubsidized Stafford loans for students not meeting the need criteria for subsidized loans, higher maximum loan limits, and changes in need analysis authorized by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, borrowing grew suddenly and dramatically. In the 1993-94 academic year, the FFEL loan volume was $19.0 billion. In 1994-95 and 1995-96, federal loan volumes (which then included Ford Direct loans as well as FFEL loans) continued to increase, to $22.3 billion and then $24.4 billion.3 1Laura Greene Knapp, Borrowing for College in 1989-90 (Washington, DC: The College Board, 1992), 1. 2The College Board, Trends in Student Aid: 1986to 1996(Washington, DC: The College Board, 1996. 3U.S. Department of Education, Budget Services, table prepared for the FY 1998 President's Budget. Loan volumes refer to net commitments (loans actually dispersed) and exclude consolidated loans."}, {"section_title": "DATA", "text": "The analysis uses the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B) and the Beginning Postsecondary Student Longitudinal Study (BPS). Both of these studies were derived from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), a comprehensive, nationwide study of students enrolled in all types of postsecondary institutions. To this date, four administrations of NPSAS have been completed (1986-87, 1989-90, 1992-93, and 1995-96). B&B provides information on the education and work experiences of approximately 11,000 NPSAS:93 participants who received a bachelor's degree during the 1992-93 academic year (July 1992 through June 1993). The analysis for this report is based on information collected through NPSAS:93 and the B&B First Followup (B&B:93/94), which was conducted in 1994. BPS provides information on the experiences of 8,000 students in NPSAS:89 who entered postsecondary education for the first time in 1989-90; this group was followed up in the spring of 1992 (BPS:90/92) and again in the spring of 1994 (BPS:90/94). Appendix B contains additional information on NPSAS, B&B, and BPS. For the analysis of the BPS data, the sample was limited to individuals whose last spell of enrollment ended no later than December 1992 (approximately three and a half years after they started). The sample was limited in this way because studying debt burden requires information on both monthly loan payments and monthly income. BPS survey respondents were asked to report the amount of their monthly loan payments in the spring of 1994, but only their annual (rather than monthly) incomes. The last year for which individuals were asked to provide income data was 1993. Although dividing respondents' 1993 annual income by 12 provides a credible estimate of their monthly income in spring 1994, an accurate picture of debt burden can be obtained only if the income data apply to a period after students have graduated or dropped out. For this reason, only students whose last spell of enrollment ended before January 1993 were included in the analysis described in this report. Bachelor's degree recipients were excluded from the analysis of the BPS data, because all except those who finished in less than four years (5 percent of the bachelor's degree recipients5) would have still been enrolled in 1993. Since the number of 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who finished a bachelor's degree in less than four years was relatively small, and to avoid confusion between the different B&B and BPS bachelor's degree populations, bachelor's INTRODUCTION degree recipients were excluded from the parts of the analysis that used the BPS data. However, bachelor's degree seekers who dropped out before January 1993 and did not return were included. Where possible, this analysis uses B&B:93/94 and BPS:90/94 to answer similar questions about the early labor force experiences of recent graduates with different types of awards, their borrowing as undergraduates, and the financial implications of that borrowing. However, these two studies have different orientations: B&B:93/94 focuses on the experiences of bachelor's degree recipients during the first year after they graduate, while BPS:90/94 focuses on their persistence, progress, and attainment from when they initially entered postsecondary education. Consequently, the questions asked of survey participants differed, and direct comparisons of their experiences were not always possible."}, {"section_title": "1992-93 BACHELOR'S DEGREE RECIPIENTS", "text": "In the 1992-93 academic year, 1.2 million individuals earned a bachelor's degree in the United States.6 About two-thirds of them (65 percent) received their degree from a public institution (table 1). Slightly more than half were female in both public and private, not-for-profit institutions (table 2). Eighty-three percent were white, non-Hispanic. Black, non-Hispanics; Hispanics; and Asian/Pacific Islanders accounted for another 5 to 6 percent each, and the remaining 1 percent were American Indian/Alaskan Natives.? Table B.1 (appendix B) shows the percentage distribution of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients according to various characteristics.  \nIn 1994, approximately one year after they graduated, the vast majority (87 percent) of the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients were employed, even if they were continuing their education. About three-quarters (76 percent) were working only, and 11 percent were combining work and further education. The most common method of finding out about their job was a referral from family, friends, or professors. Those working full time had an average annualized salary of about $24,200 from their primary April 1994 job. Some undergraduate majors seem to lead to better paying jobs than others. Specifically, graduates who majored in business and management, engineering, mathematics, or science had considerably higher salaries than those who majored in humanities or social sciences. The April 1994 unemployment rate for 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients was 4.5 percent. Some experience with unemployment in the first year after graduating was not uncommon: 29 percent had been unemployed and looking for work for at least one month. Although older undergraduates (30 years or older) as a group were less likely than younger ones (24 years or younger) to ever be unemployed, they were more likely to have been unemployed for 9 months or more. About one-half (49 percent) of the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients had borrowed from some source .(including relatives or friends as well as through student loan programs) to help finance their education. The average total amount borrowed from all sources was $10,200. Graduates of private, not-for-profit institutions were more likely to have borrowed and to have borrowed more, on average, than graduates of public institutions. The B&B data provide no evidence that graduates' career choices were related to borrowing if they were working. However, SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION borrowers were less likely to enroll immediately in graduate school or other postsecondary education, even when other student and institutional characteristics were taken into account. In 1994, 29 percent of all 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients were required to make payments on their education loans. For those making payments, the average monthly payment was $136, or about 9 percent of their April 1994 monthly salary. The graduates with the greatest average debt burden (15 percent) were those with salaries less than $15,000. As monthly debt burden increased, graduates reported spending less on other items, such as housing, auto loans, and other noneducational debt, but larger outstanding loans did not appear to limit spending on these items. Marrying did not appear to be related to debt burden, but graduates whose debt burden exceeded 15 percent were more likely than those with lower debt burdens to be living with parents or relatives. Whether or not a graduate was saving did not seem to be related to debt burden, but whether or not it affected the amount saved is unknown."}, {"section_title": "1989-90 BEGINNING POSTSECONDARY STUDENTS", "text": "Among all those who began their postsecondary education in 1989-90, 26 percent had earned a bachelor's degree by spring 1994that is, within five academic years of the time they were first enrolled (figure 1 and table 3).

To get some idea of how cumulative borrowing for bachelor's degree recipients has changed with the recent aggregate increases in loan volume, the cumulative borrowing of the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients was compared to the cumulative borrowing of the 1995-96 fourth-and fifth-year seniors (assuming they would be the 1995-96 graduates). Because the student-reported data for NPSAS:96 are not yet available, it is not possible to determine how the percentage of students who borrowed changed between 1992-93 and 1995-96. However, it is possible to examine changes in the average amounts borrowed by students who participated in federal student loan programs (which most borrowers do). The 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who graduated from public 4-year institutions and who participated in a federal student loan program borrowed an average of $10,100 from all sources (federal, state, institutional, family, and other) for their undergraduate education (table  6). Three years later, in 1995-96, fourth-and fifth-year seniors at public 4-year institutions who participated in a federal student loan program borrowed an average of $12,800 in federal loans for their undergraduate education, about $2,700 (or 27 percent) more than the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who graduated from public 4-year institutions borrowed from all sources. At private, not-for-profit institutions, the increase in the average amount borrowed between 1992-93 and 1995-96 was approximately $1,200 (from $13,800 to $15,000, about 6 percent). Because students at private, not-for-profit institutions were more likely than those at public institutions to take out institutional loans in 1992-93 (2 percent versus less than 1 percent),9 the average amount borrowed through federal loan programs in 1995-96 may understate the total amount borrowed at private, not-for-profit institutions more than it does at public institutions. , 1992-93 [National Postsecondary Student Aid Study], NCES 95-202, by John Tuma and Sonya Geis, Andrew G.

Thus, it is impossible to make an exact comparison of cumulative borrowing. However, because some federal loan program participants borrow from other sources as well, the increases reported here understate the true increases over the three-year period. Despite the difficulty of making exact comparisons, it appears safe to conclude that the amounts bor-INTRODUCTION rowed have increased substantially, at least at public 4-year institutions. Among 1992-93 graduates of public institutions, for example, 7 percent of federal loan program participants borrowed $20,000 or more for their undergraduate education from all sources, while 14 percent of their 1995-96 counterparts borrowed this amount in federal loans alone. Because of this major increase in borrowing, one can expect that the 1995-96 bachelor's degree recipients will face larger loan payments than their 1992-93 counterparts did. Their debt burden might also increase, depending on their salaries."}, {"section_title": "9U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Student Financing of Undergraduate Education", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "EARLY LABOR FORCE EXPERIENCES", "text": "Approximately one year after they graduated (in spring 1994), most of the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients were in the labor force, even those who were continuing their formal education. The 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students whose last enrollment ended by December 1992 were also recent entrants into the labor force. All of this group had been out of school for at least a year by spring 1994, and some had been out for as many as four years, depending on the length of their program or, if they did not complete their program, when they left.1\u00b0T his section describes the early labor force experiences of these individuals from a number of perspectives. Specifically, it examines their employment rates, occupations, and earnings in the spring of 1994, and their experience with unemployment since completing or leaving their academic programs. For the bachelor's degree recipients, it also describes whether and how they combined further education with employment. (None of the beginning postsecondary students in the analysis group were still enrolled at this point, although overall 13 percent of those who began their postsecondary education in 1989-90 were still enrolled.11) Particular attention is paid here to how the early labor force experiences of these individuals varied with the type of institution attended, undergraduate major, and personal characteristics such as gender, age, and race ethnicity.\nLike the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, noncompleters and associate's degree and certificate recipients were recent entrants into the labor force in spring 1994. Comparisons of the EARLY LABOR FORCE EXPERIENCES  employment rates of the two groups must be made with care, however, because the nonbaccalaureate group being analyzed here excludes anyone enrolled after December 1992, while many of the bachelor's degree recipients were combining school and work. Comparing the nonbaccalaureate group only to bachelor's degree recipients who were not enrolled shows a considerably higher employment rate for bachelor's degree recipients than for the nonbaccalaureate group (92 percent compared with 81 percent) (tables 8 and 9). Employment rates for the noncompleters and associate's degree or certificate recipients differed by gender, with higher employment rates for males than females (86 percent compared with 77 percent). Some of the 23 percent of females who were not employed were unemployed but available and looking for work, and some were not in the labor force. Other characteristics associated with higher employment rates were first enrolling in postsecondary education at age 19 or younger (rather than older); being in the highest (rather than lowest) socioeconomic status (SES) quartile in 1989-90; having last attended a public or private, not-for-profit institution (rather than a private, for-profit institution); and having attended a 2year (rather than less-than-2-year) institution last (table 9).\n\npercentage in any other occupation (8 to 11 percent). One possible explanation is that some graduates who lined up teaching jobs for the fall did seek, but were unsuccessful at finding, short:term employment until school started; or, if they graduated before June, they may have had trouble finding anything except for the summer. :Although the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who graduated in the summer or fall of 1992 .had been in the labor market longer than spring 1993 graduates, they were not any more likely to have been unemployed. However, among those who had been unemployed, summer 1992 graduates were more likely than later graduates to have been unemployed for more than nine months, reflecting their longer time in the labor market. Information on the unemployment experiences of the nonbaccalaureate group is more limited. Data are available on whether they were ever unemployed between 1989-90 and spring 1994;_but not on whether they had been unemployed since they graduated or left postsecondary education. About one-third of the group experienced at least one spell of unemployment between 1989-90 and spring 1994 (table 16). For those who had been unemployed, the average total number of months of unemployment was 10. There is some apparent variation in the unemployment experiences of the nonbaccalaureate group by student and institutional characteristics. For example, noncompleters who last attended private, for-profit institutions appear to be more likely to have been unemployed than noncompleters who last attended other types of institutions, and engineering, mathematics, or science majors appear to be less likely than those with other majors to have been unemployed. However, small sample sizes make it impossible to determine whether the differences are real or simply statistical artifacts.\nThose with either an associate's degree or no award were more likely than those with a certificate to find their jobs within a month (84 percent and 78 percent compared with 67 percent). However, this should not be interpreted to mean that it is more difficult to find a job with a certificate than with no award. Some of those who left without completing a degree or certificate may have left because they had obtained a job and therefore would have experienced no delay between enrollment and employment In addition, some from all of these groups may have been already working at the job while enrolled and therefore also would have experienced no delay. It should also be kept in mind that the \"no award\" group includes individuals with a mixture of postsecondary educational experiences that could range from a month at a less-than -4year institution to three and a half years at a 4-year institution. Consequently, some individuals with no award could have much more postsecondary education than those with a certificate, which might make it easier for them to find a job. Certain student characteristics were associated with relatively greater ease in finding a job. For example, males were more likely than females to find a job within a month. Also, white, non-Hispanics were more likely than black, non-Hispanics to find a job within a month, and black, non-Hispanics were much more likely to have taken more than 12 months to do so. Finally, those in the highest SES quartile were more likely than those in the lowest quartile to find 1 their job within a month, and those in the lowest quartile were the most likely to take more than 12 months."}, {"section_title": "EMPLOYMENT", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Employment and Enrollment Among Bachelor's Degree Recipients", "text": "In April 1994, about one year after they graduated, the vast majority of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients were employed (figure 3 and table 7).

What 1992-93 bachelor' s degree recipients were doing in April 1994 varied with their gender, age, and undergraduate major. Gender differences were relatively minor. Males were slightly more likely than females to be enrolled only, but a relatively small proportion of bachelor' s degree recipients were in this category (7 percent). Age differences were more notable. Graduates who were 24 years or younger when they received their degree (that is, those who started college relatively soon after graduating from high school and attended mostly full time without any long breaks in attendance) were considerably more likely than those who were 25 to 29 years old when they graduated to be enrolled for further education in April 1994. Work/enrollment patterns varied by undergraduate major, but not by the type of institution attended. Business and management majors were the most likely to be working only, and those who majored in engineering, mathematics, or science were the most likely to be enrolled only. Graduates of public and private, not-for-profit institutions had similar work/enrollment patterns. Borrowing for undergraduate education may discourage graduates from immediately enrolling for further education unless they are working as well.

Among those who were working only, the vast majority (89 percent) were working full time. Whether the remaining 11 percent who were working part time were doing so by choice or because they could not find full-time employment is unknown. The graduates combining enrollment and work were about equally divided between working full and part time. Their employment status was related to their enrollment status. Among those who were enrolled full time, more than half (59 percent) were in the labor force as well: 17 percent working full time, 33 percent working part time, and 9 percent unemployed but looking for work. Among those who were enrolled part time, all but 9 percent were also in the labor force, and about two-thirds were working full time. As indicated in the previous section, borrowing as an undergraduate may encourage employment rather than enrollment only. However, it does not necessarily encourage full-time employment. In fact, the proportions of borrowers and nonborrowers who worked full time were about the same. As was the case with the bachelor's degree recipients, the vast majority (81 percent) of the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students whose last enrollment had ended by December 1992 were employed in April 1994 (table 9 and figure 4). The remaining 19 percent were either unemployed or not in the labor force.

The most common way the graduates found out about their jobs was through a referral from family, friends, or professors, with 35 percent finding their jobs this way (table 11). Another 19 percent found their jobs through a want ad, and 10 percent found them through a campus placement office. Job search methods and types of jobs (in terms of salary and occupation) were related. For example, graduates whose jobs paid $25,000 to $34,999 per year were more likely than those whose jobs paid less than $20,000 to have found them through the campus placement office or an employment agency. In contrast, graduates with jobs in the $15,000 to $19,999 per year range were more likely than those with higher paying jobs to have found them through want ads. Similarly, graduates with sales/service jobs were more likely than those with professional jobs to have found them through want ads. 141n fall 1970, women made up 41 percent of enrollment in higher education, and in fall 1992, 55 percent.

The rest had sales or \"other\" positions. Associate's degrees and certificates appear to lead to different types of occupations.

Among females, 38 percent held clerical positions and 21 percent worked in service occupations.

The primary job was defined as the job for which the most hours were worked. If the hours were the same for more than one job, the one with the highest salary was considered the primary job. This discussion focuses on those employed full time based on the belief that the salaries of this group most accurately portray the immediate economic prospects of bachelor's degree recipients after graduation. This full-time employed group constitutes the majority of the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients (73 percent) (table 8). One could argue that some bachelor's degree recipients may be able to find only part-time work and that this should be reflected in any discussion of the economic outcomes of college graduates. However, among those working part time are many who are enrolled as well as working and therefore not necessarily working in a     career-oriented job. In addition, some (whose number cannot be determined) may be working part time by choice rather than because they could find only part-time work. Finally, graduates were asked to report on only one job. Consequently, the amount of time and earnings of anyone holding multiple part-time jobs simultaneously in April 1994 would have been understated. Although the salaries of the graduates who are employed full time are not representative of all bachelor's degree recipients, they do provide a useful indicator of what a graduate who enters the labor market full time can expect to earn."}, {"section_title": "43-EARLY LABOR FORCE EXPERIENCES", "text": "The average annualized salary for 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients working full time in April 1994 was about $24,000 (table 13 and figure 5), with approximately two-thirds earning between $15,000 and $35,000.

Average annual salary increased with age, from $22,200 for those 24 years or less when they graduated to $25,400 for those 25 to 29 years old and $32,000 for those 30 years or older. This pattern may reflect older graduates' greater lifetime experience in the work force and in higher paid occupations (table 8). Some undergraduate majors, at least initially, seem to lead to better paying jobs than others. However, it is important to keep in mind that beginning salary differences may not persist over the long term as experience and performance become more important than undergraduate education in determining labor market success. Full-time employed bachelor's degree recipients with undergraduate majors in business and management, and in engineering, mathematics, or science earned considerably higher average annual salaries ($27,000 and $27,200, respectively) than did those who majored in humanities or social sciences ($21,300). Bachelor's degree recipients in business and management and in professional occupations in April 1994 had higher average salaries than their peers in teaching; administrative, clerical, or support; or sales or service occupations. The average annual salary was about $2,000 more for a bachelor's degree recipient who graduated from a private, not-for-profit institution than for one who graduated from a public institution. This pattern has no straightforward explanation, but may reflect a number of interacting factors. Regional economic differences might contribute (private, not-for-profit institutions are more common in some parts of the country than others), as might occupational differences (for example, bachelor's degree recipients from private, not-for-profit institutions were slightly more likely than those from public institutions to have business and management occupations, which pay more than many other occupations). Differences in family backgrounds might also contribute to salary differences, especially since, as indicated above, 35 percent of all bachelor's degree recipients found their jobs through referrals from family, friends, and professors (table   11)."}, {"section_title": "Earned Income of Noncompleters and Associate's Degree or Certificate Recipients", "text": "The average 1993 earned income for noncompleters and associate's degree or certificate recipients was $16,600 (table 14 and figure 6). This includes both full-and part-time employees, and employees who worked only part of the year because they were out of the labor force or unemployed for part of the year. Because no one in this group was enrolled at any time during  1993, none would have worked only part of the year because of enrollment. The average earnings of the individuals in the nonbaccalaureate group were similar regardless of degree or certificate attainment. However, this does not necessarily mean that an associate's degree or certificate has no immediate effect on earnings. Indeed, earnings vary with other factors as well, such as gender, raceethnicity, age, occupation, and time out of school, and many of these factors are interrelated. Associate's degree earners are likely to have been out of school less time than certificate earners or noncompleters, and those employed most recently may have lower salaries. It is also important to remember that the associate's degree earners in the analysis group may not be representative of associate's degree earners in general, because they represent only 34 percent of all beginning postsecondary students who earned associate's degrees by 1994. Average 1993 earnings were higher for males than females and for white, non-Hispanics than black, non-Hispanics. In addition, those who began postsecondary education when they were 20 years or older earned more in 1993 than those who began when they were younger than EARLY LABOR FORCE EXPERIENCES 20 years, perhaps reflecting greater lifetime work experience or different occupations. Average earnings varied with the amount of time spent out of school as well, which again may reflect additional work experience or different occupations. For instance, those who had not been enrolled since the 1989-90 academic year had average 1993 earnings of $18,100, while those whose last enrollment ended by December 1992 had average 1993 earnings of $13,400. Those who had attended a public 2-year institution rather than a private, for-profit institution last also earned more. Average earnings were also related to individuals' primary occupation. Those in the craftsman/repair, labor, or machinist; manager/administrator; and professional categories earned an average of around $20,000 in 1993, while those with clerical occupations earned an average of $14,000 and those in service occupations, $12,200. Individuals in sales occupations had earnings that were in between, averaging $16,900. Those who majored in engineering, math, or science appeared to have earned more than those in other fields, but only the difference with respect to business and management was statistically significant. Comparing the Earnings of Bachelor's Degree Recipients with the Earnings of Noncompleters and Associate's egree or Certificate Recipients With an average annualized salary of $22,100 based on their primary April 1994 job, the bachelor's degree recipients appear to have been doing better financially than the noncompleters and associate's degree or certificate earners, whose average earnings for 1993 were $16,600 (tables 13 and 14). Because full-and part-time employment cannot be distinguished for the nonbaccalaureate group, no direct comparison of full-time employment is possible. In comparing the earnings of the two groups, it is important to keep in mind the difference in how earnings were reported. Noncompleters and associate's degree or certificate recipients reported their earnings for calendar year 1993. How many different jobs they held, whether or not they were ever unemployed, and whether or not they worked full or part time all or part of the year are all unknown. The bachelor's degree recipients, in contrast, reported their April 1994 salary for their principal job, which was then annualized to estimate annual earnings. The number of hours they worked per week was taken into account, so part-time employment is reflected. However, no periods during which they were unemployed or out of the labor force were factored into this estimate of annual earnings. Moreover, some of the bachelor's degree recipients may have worked for part of the year at different salaries or they may have held multiple jobs simultaneously."}, {"section_title": "54", "text": "In summary, the bachelor's degree recipients' annualized salaries provide a good indication of their current earning power for their principal job, but may not accurately represent what they earned during the past year.

No other apparent differences among subgroups were statistically significant. The April 1994 unemployment rate for the nonbaccalaureate group (4.7 percent) was similar to that of the bachelor's degree recipients (table 16). Among the nonbaccalaureate group, females had a higher unemployment rate than males (6.0 percent versus 3.1 percent). In addition, those who last attended a private, for-profit institution had a much higher unemployment rate than those who last attended a 4-year private, not-for-profit institution (8.2 percent versus 1.4 percent). No other apparent differences among subgroups were statistically significant.   To place these rates in context, the unemployment rate for the civilian noninstitutional population 25 to 44 years of age was 5.3 percent in January 1994. Taking into consideration education, the January unemployment rate was 2.9 percent for college graduates 25 to 64 years old (including those with graduate degrees) and 5.0 percent for those with some college, but less than a bachelor's degree.16"}, {"section_title": "Periods of Unemployment", "text": "Some experience with unemployment in the first year after graduating appears to be not unusual for bachelor's degree recipients.

No meaningful gender or racialethnic differences were found in terms of spells of unemployment for bachelor's degree recipients, but there were some interesting age differences. Bachelor's degree recipients who were more than 30 years old when they graduated were less likely than younger graduates to have been unemployed since graduating. This may reflect a longer time in the work force prior to graduation. In addition, older students are more likely than younger students to work full time while enrolled.17 Therefore a greater proportion of older students may have continued with the same job or employer when they graduated. At the same time, however, graduates 30 years or older were more likely than graduates 24 years or younger to have been unemployed for 9 months or more, suggesting that the older group may include more individuals with more severe employability problems. Broad occupational categories and relatively small sample sizes in some categories make meaningful differences in graduates' periods of unemployment difficult to detect. Graduates with administrative, clerical, or support or teaching occupations were more likely those with business and management or professional occupations to have been unemployed. Most notable among the occupational differences was the relatively high percentage of teachers reporting three to four months of unemployment (18 percent), which was considerably higher than the 16U .S.

The average total amount borrowed from all sources was about $10,200. Tuition is higher, on average, at private, not-for-profit institutions than at public ones. Reflecting this higher tuition, graduates of private, not-for-profit institutions were more likely than graduates of public institutions to have borrowed (54 percent compared with 46 percent) and borrowed more, on average ($12,800 compared with $8,700). About one out of five graduates of a private, not-for-profit institution borrowed at least $20,000. The longer bachelor's degree recipients took to get their degrees, the more likely they were to have borrowed (59 percent of those who took six years or more to complete their undergraduate education borrowed, 50 percent of those who took from four to six years, and 41 per- cent of those who finished in four years or less). However, those who finished in four years or less borrowed more, on average ($11,000), than those who took more than six years to finish ($9,300). This may reflect, at least in part, the fact that graduates of private, not-for-profit institutions (who borrowed more, on average, than their peers at public institutions) were more likely to finish in four years or less (65 percent compared with 34 percent).19 In addition, some of those who took six years or longer to finish may have taken longer because they were working and using their earnings to reduce the amount they needed to borrow. Although some bachelor's degree seekers who start at 2-year public institutions rather than 4-year institutions may do so in order to reduce the total cost of obtaining their degree, 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who started at public 2-year institutions were actually more likely than those who started at public 4-year institutions to borrow at some point during their undergraduate education, and they borrowed about the same amount, on average. Those starting at 2year institutions may have been more likely to borrow at least in part because they took longer to complete their postsecondary studies (27 percent took more than six years, compared with 13 percent of those who started at public 4-year institutions).\"Lo They may also have had greater overall financial need (which is related primarily to family income and the cost of the institution attended). In other words, they may indeed have started at a 2-year institution to keep their costs down, but then had greater need than the average public 4-year student when they later transferred to a 4-year institution.

For example, 61 percent of those who last attended a private, for-profit institution borrowed through a student loan program, compared with 10 percent who last attended a public 2-year institution. The average amount borrowed through student loan programs ranged from $2,900 at public 2-year institutions to $6,200 at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions.

Those who left postsecondary education with no degree were the least likely to take out a student loan (19 percent, compared with 43 percent of certificate earners and 34 percent of associate's degree recipients). This pattern might reflect a shorter time or intensity of enrollment for at least some noncompleters: for example, students who enrolled only in 1989-90 were less likely to borrow than those who enrolled longer. It also might indicate less commitment to postsecondary education and less willingness on the part of noncompleters to borrow.

Bachelor's degree recipients were asked some questions in the B&B survey that can help shed some light on this issue. First, they were asked whether various factors (including financial ones) were important to them in determining the type of work they planned to do in the future. Second, they were asked if their April 1994 job was related to their degree, and if not, why they took the job. If they were feeling pressured by their loan obligations, one might expect borrowers to be more concerned than nonborrowers about financial factors in choosing a career and to be more likely to take jobs unrelated to their degree for financial reasons. The responses of bachelor's degree recipients to these questions provide no evidence that borrowers are making career choices differently than nonborrowers. The 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients were asked whether various factors were important to them in determining the type of work they planned to do in the future. Two factors very relevant to their ability to repay their loans were \"good income potential\" and \"job security.\" Borrowers and nonborrowers were about equally likely to indicate that these were important to them (table 22). However, both borrowers and nonborrowers were more likely to indicate that \"interesting work\" and \"intellectual work\" were important to them than they were to indicate that job security was important. Overall, 55 percent of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients reported that their job in April 1994 was closely related to their degree, and 20 percent reported that it was somewhat related (table 23). The remaining 25 percent reported that their job was not at all related. Nonborrowers were slightly more likely than borrowers to have an unrelated job (26 percent to 24 percent), although there is no obvious reason why this would be so. Among graduates who took jobs that were unrelated to their degree, borrowers were not any more likely than nonborrowers to take a job for financial reasons. Among bachelor's degree recipients whose April 1994 job was not at all related to their degree, 22 percent said their main reason for taking the job was that it was the only one they could find, and 25 percent said the pay was better than that in other jobs (table  24). The percentages of graduates who took jobs for these reasons were similar for borrowers and nonborrowers.   Beginning postsecondary students were also asked about the importance of various factors in determining the kind of work they planned to be doing, but, in contrast to the bachelor's degree recipients, borrowers and nonborrowers were different. To virtually all the noncompleters and associate's degree or certificate recipients included in this analysis, job security and permanence were important in determining the kind of work they planned to do for most of their lives (88 percent said these factors were \"very important\" and another 11 percent said they were \"somewhat important\") (table 25). However, those who had taken out student loans were more likely than those who had not to rate them as \"very important\" in determining their future work (92 percent compared with 86 percent). Direct comparisons between the baccalaureate and nonbaccalaureate groups must be made with caution because different questions were asked in the two studies. Nevertheless, there was no evidence that career choice was related to borrowing for bachelor's degree recipients, but some limited evidence that it might be for the nonbaccalaureate group."}, {"section_title": "BORROWING AND PLANS FOR GRADUATE SCHOOL", "text": "Bachelor's degree recipients immediate career choices do not appear to be related to borrowing. However, borrowing does appear to have some effect on whether they enroll in graduate school right away, with borrowers slightly less likely than nonborrowers to apply to graduate school (27 percent versus 31 percent) (table 26). Bachelor's degree recipients who said that they had considered applying to graduate school but then had not applied were asked the primary reason they had not applied. Ten percent of those who had borrowed as undergraduates said that having too much undergraduate debt was their main reason for not immediately enrolling in graduate school (table 27). Five percent of those who borrowed less than $5,000 gave this reason, but 20 percent of those who borrowed $20,000 or more did so. Another roughly 20 percent of those who borrowed gave other financially related reasons for deciding against graduate school: 12 percent said graduate school cost too much, was not worth it, or they could not afford it; 6 percent said they had too much other debt; and 3 percent said they could not get enough financial aid. Those who had not borrowed were slightly less likely to give \"cost too much\" and \"too much other debt\" as their main reasons deciding against graduate school. Additional possible evidence of a negative relationship between undergraduate borrowing and subsequent graduate or other postsecondary enrollment was the earlier finding that nonborrowers were more likely than borrowers to be enrolled only, while the two groups were about equally likely to be combining work and enrollment (table 7). These findings, however, do not take into account the relationships between either further enrollment or undergraduate borrowing 77 and various student and institutional characteristics. Examining how enrollment and undergraduate borrowing are associated without considering these relationships may provide misleading results. Several statistical methods are available to examine the relationship between two variables while holding other variables constant. Here, a linear a regression model was used to describe the relationship between immediate enrollment for further education and undergraduate borrowing while adjusting for the covariance of independent variables.21 The dependent variable was defined as the percentage of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who were enrolled for graduate or other postsecondary education in April 1994. They might have been enrolled only or both working and enrolled. The independent variables included gender, raceethnicity, age when they received their degree, whether or not they borrowed from any source for their undergraduate education, type of institution from which th6y graduated, undergraduate major, and grades (GPA). The results of the multivariate analysis are displayed in table 28. The negative impact of undergraduate borrowing on immediate graduate or other postsecondary enrollment was confirmed. Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, borrowers were less likely than nonborrowers to be enrolled in graduate or other postsecondary education in April 1994. This relationship held regardless of whether they borrowed less than $5,000 or $5,000 or more. The B&B data, because they were collected only one year after graduation, do not permit any examination of longer term effects. However, because the 1995-96 NPSAS includes graduate students of all ages, it will be possible to use these data to examine the relationship between undergraduate borrowing and timing of graduate enrollment. 21See appendix B for a detailed discussion of the technique used in this section. "}, {"section_title": "LOAN REPAYMENT AND DEBT BURDEN", "text": "Most student loan programs require borrowers to begin repayment six months after they leave school, although repayment can be deferred for a variety of reasons. For example; payments can be deferred if the borrower is enrolled in postsecondary education at least half time, is unemployed, is participating in a qualifying service program such as the Peace Corps, or. has an approved hardship (e.g. medical or financial). The terms for loans from families or friends are negotiated by the parties involved. Repayment schedules for these loans may be formal or informal, and some borrowers may even have their loans forgiven. The first part of this section describes the repayment status of the bachelor's degree recipients and noncompleters and associate's degree or certificate recipients and the amounts of their monthly paymentsfor all education loans for the former group and for student loans for the latter. Understanding the extent to which education loan payments impose a financial burden on borrowers requires knowing something about the financial circumstances of the borrowers as well as the size of their payments. Therefore, this' section also examines the amount of the payments in relation to other aspects of borrowers' financial circumstances, such as earnings, other expenses, and, if married, their spouse's educational debt. To complete the picture, this section also looks for links between borrowing and lifestyle choices that might indicate that education loan payments are burdensome. Specifically, it examines whether students who borrow marry later or live at home more often than those who do not borrow, and whether or not they are less able to save for major items such as a house or further education.\nBecause 84 percent of the nonbaccalaureate group as a whole was not making payments on student loans, this group appears to be to be more debt free in 1994 than bachelor's degree recipients (63 percent of whom were debt free at this time, table 29), but the comparison must be made with caution. Data on bachelor's degree recipients' repayments apply to loans from all sources, while data on the nonbaccalaureate group's repayments applies only to loans made through student loan programs. If only loans through student loan programs were included in calculating the percentage of bachelor's degree recipients who had no debt, the percentage probably would be greater than 63 percent. However, because very few bachelor's degree recipients borrowed from relatives or friends (only 4 percent of those who owed in spring 1994 had these loans22), excluding these loans would make little difference. Thus, it seems safe to conclude that the nonbaccalaureate group was more debt free. Among the noncompleters and associate's degree or certificate recipients owing money on student loans in spring 1994, 82 percent were making payments on their student loans; of those who were not repaying their loans, 45 percent were not employed in April 1994.23 The rest could have had hardship or service deferments or been in default. Because none from this group had been enrolled since December 1992, none would have still been in the enrollment grace period for federal loans.\nFamily and friends sometimes help borrowers repay their loans. In spring 1994, 13 percent of the nonbaccalaureate group who were making payments were receiving help from relatives or friends, but the vast majority (87 percent) were making payments on their own. Whether or not an individual was receiving help was related to the family's socioeconomic status (SES): 7 per-23U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1990 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study-Second Follow-up, (BPS:90/94), Data Analysis System. LOAN REPAYMENT AND DEBT BURDEN cent of those in the lowest SES quartile were receiving help, compared with 17 percent of those in the two middle quartiles. Similar percentages of those owing less than $5,000 and $5,000 to $9,999 received help: 13 percent and 11 percent, respectively.24\nIn summary, then, large debt burdens appear to be a problem particularly for those with very low salaries (less than $15,000) or high loan amounts (more than $10,000). For example, 41 percent of the former group and 30 percent of the latter had debt burdens of 15 percent or more, much greater proportions than found among those with higher incomes or lower levels of debt. Because students who attend private, not-for-profit institutions tend to borrow more than those who attend public institutions, the former were more likely to have debt burdens of 10 percent or more.\n"}, {"section_title": "REPAYMENT STATUS Bachelor's Degree Recipients", "text": "The majority of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients (63 percent) had no debt a year after graduating, either because they had never borrowed or because they had repaid their loans (table 29 and figure 9). Another 8 percent owed money but were not required to make payments at the time, either because they were en rolled at least half time, were in the grace period, had a deferment because :of unemployment or hardship, or had taken loans only from family or friends and were not being required to make payments. Overall, 29 percent of all 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients were required to make loan payments in 1994. Because repayment can be deferred as long as a borrower is enrolled in postsecondary education at least half time, the percentage of bachelor's degree recipients required to make loan payments varied with their enrollment status. Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who were not enrolled for further education in spring 1994, 32 percent were required to make loan payments, and among those enrolled part time, 22 percent were required to do so. Although most student loan programs do not require borrowers who are enrolled full time to make payments, 7 percent of such borrowers did in fact report making or owing payments. These payments might have been on loans from families or from sources other than student loan programs; they might have been voluntary repayments; or students enrolled full time in spring 1994 might have started making payments earlier, when they were not enrolled at least half time and either had not requested or not yet received a deferment. Overall, 16 percent of the noncompleters and associate's degree or certificate recipients were making payments on their student loans in spring 1994; the remaining 84 percent either had not taken out a student loan or had paid back their loans (table 30). Noncompleters were less likely than associate's degree or certificate recipients to be making payments."}, {"section_title": "PAYMENT AMOUNTS", "text": "A borrower's monthly payment for student loans depends on the size of the loan and the interest rate at which the loan was made. The Stafford Loan program, the most commonly used undergraduate loan program, calls for a 10-year repayment schedule, with a minimum monthly payment of $50. If, for example, a student borrowed $1,000 or less at 8-percent interest, the monthly payment would be $50. For a $5,000 loan at that interest rate, the monthly payment would be $61, and for a $10,000 loan, $120. As indicated above, payments on loans from relatives and friends are negotiated by the lender and borrower. For the analysis of loan repayment and debt burden that follows, individuals whose monthly loan payments were more than 50 percent of their monthly salary were excluded. For individuals in this category, reported payments were examined along with the amount of their loan and the amount they would have been paying if their loan carried an 8-percent interest rate. In almost every case, the reported payment greatly exceeded the expected amount (and sometimes even exceeded their salary). While many individuals pay back their loans more quickly than is required, it did not seem credible that they would voluntarily increase their payments to the point that they were spending more than half their monthly salary to repay their loans. Because including such individuals greatly increases the average, excluding them from the analysis seemed to make sense. About 60 percent of the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who were in repayment were paying between $50 and $150 per month on loans from all sources (including relatives and friends), with an average payment of $136 (table 31 and figure 10). Reflecting the greater average amounts borrowed at private, not-for-profit institutions, bachelor's degree recipients from these institutions had higher average monthly payments than their counterparts who graduated from public institutions ($163 per month compared with $121).  "}, {"section_title": "E5", "text": "For almost three-quarters of the noncompleters and associate's degree or certificate recipients, monthly payments on their student loans were less than $100 (table 32 and figure 11).

When comparing the average amounts being paid by bachelor's degree recipients and by noncompleters and associate's degree or certificate recipients and the relative percentages of each group paying $150 or more per month (figures 10 and 11), it appears that bachelor's degree recipients have much greater loan payments. In making such comparisons, it is important to remember that payment amounts for bachelor's degree recipients include payments on loans from all sources, while the payment amounts for the nonbaccalaureate group include only payments on loans made through student loan programs. However, a relatively small proportion of bachelor's degree recipients had loans from family or friends outstanding in 1994. This makes it reasonably safe to assume that payments on such loans make up a minor proportion of bachelor's \"71 BEST COPY AVAIIILA 1:' 86 LE degree recipients' payments, and that they do indeed have much higher payments than the nonbaccalaureate group..

The most straightforward way to measure debt burden is to compute loan payments as a percentage of monthly income. In this analysis, salary data from B&B and earnings data from BPS are used as proxies for income. If borrowers have other sources of income, their debt burden will be overstated here. However, it seems unlikely' that students who borrowed to finance their undergraduate education would have significant amounts of nonearned income only a few years after graduating or leaving school."}, {"section_title": "8?", "text": "At what point does debt burden become excessive? No consensus has developed, largely because of the need to make subjective judgments about what percentage of their income new graduates should be expected to allocate to repaying their student loans. For example, should we be concerned that a borrower cannot afford buy a house or a new car as soon as a nonborrower? Nevertheless, several studies have suggested that debt burden beyond 10 to 15 percent may be excessive. One study conducted by Westat, Inc. recommends accepting 10 percent as a defensible threshold because mortgage lenders generally expect a family's non-housing debts not to exceed 10 percent.25 Hansen and Rhodes suggest that manageable debt burden varies with income, and propose a range from 10 percent to 15 percent.26 A recent analysis by Greiner starts with 12 percent, based on guidelines established by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1989 that state that total debt should not exceed 41 percent of income, and that mortgage payments should not exceed 29 percent.27 That leaves 12 percent for automobile, credit card, and student loans. If one argues that graduates should not expect to buy a home or new car immediately after graduating, 12 percent for student loans appears defensible. Factoring in the results of a survey of borrowers' perceptions of debt burden causes Greiner to propose 8 percent as an appropriate alternative. Contributing to this debate is beyond the scope of this analysis, but knowing what others have proposed as excessive provides a context within which to view the debt burden of the groups studied in this analysis."}, {"section_title": "Bachelor's Degree Recipients", "text": "For about two-thirds of the bachelor's degree recipients in repayment in 1994 and employed full time, loan payments amounted to less than 10 percent of their April 1994 monthly salary.

Aspects of a borrower's financial circumstances other than earnings can also affect the financial burden of the payments. For example, a borrower who had a nonworking spouse who also had student loan debt would probably find paying 9 percent of his or her monthly earnings in loan payments much more of a burden than would a borrower who had a working spouse with no loan debt.

The average for these was about $650 per month (table 35). As one might expect, graduates with higher monthly salaries had higher monthly expenditures for these items. In addition, as loan payments used up an increasing proportion of graduates' monthly salary, payments for these expenses generally decreased. However, the total amount owed for undergraduate debt and monthly expenses did not appear to be related. Monthly expenses for the items listed above were similar for borrowers and nonborrowers and did not increase with the total owed. In other words, while higher present loan payments (as a percent of monthly income) may hamper current spending on other items, the existence of outstanding loans does not seem to.

B&B:93/94 will provide data that can be used to assess the outcomes of postsecondary education, including graduate and professional program access, labor market experience, and rates of return on investment in education. Participants in the 1993 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93) who received their bachelor's degree between July 1992 and June 1993 form the base sample for the B&B study. Approximately 12,500 NPSAS:93 respondents were identified as eligible for the first followup survey, which was conducted between July 1993 and December 1994 (roughly one year after participants' graduation). Approximately 1,500 members of this initial sample were determined to be ineligible at the time of the followup interview, and about 900 others were not interviewed (usually because they could not be located or refused to participate), generating a final sample of 10,080 college graduates. An overall response rate of 92 percent was achieved for the first followup. The survey's methodology report provides additional detail on this survey.' NPSAS:93 was the third administration of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (earlier administrations were in 1986-87 and 1989-90).

In this family, k=1, and the comparison can be evaluated without adjusting the significance level. When students are divided into five racialethnic groups and comparisons between all five groups are possible, then k=10 and the significance level of each test must be .05/10, or p5 .005. The formula for calculating family size (k) is as follows: k=./(.1 -1) 2 where j is the number of categories for the variable being tested.

For example, when examining the percentages of those who were continuously employed, it is impossible to know to what extent the observed variation is due to SES differences and to what extent it is due to differences in other factors related to SES, such academic ability, raceethnicity, and so on. However, if a nested table were produced showing SES according to levels of academic ability by raceethnicity, the cell sizes would be too small to identify the patterns. When the sample size becomes too small to support controls for another level of variation, one must use other methods to take such variation into account. 5The standard that p < .05/k for each comparison is more, stringent than the criterion that the significance level of the comparisons should sum to p < .05. For tables showing the t statistic required to ensure that p < .05/k for a particular family size and degrees of freedom, see Olive Jean Dunn, \"Multiple Comparisons Among Means,\" Journal of the American Statistical Association 56: 52-64. ."}, {"section_title": "APPENDIX B-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY", "text": "To overcome this difficulty, multiple linear regression was used to obtain means that were adjusted for covariation among a list of control variables. Adjusted means for subgroups were obtained by regressing the dependent variable on a set of descriptive variables such as gender, raceethnicity, SES, and so on. Substituting ones or zeros for the subgroup characteristic(s) of interest and the mean proportions for the other variables results in an estimate of the adjusted proportion for the specified subgroup, holding all other variables constant. For example, consider a hypothetical case in which two variables, age and gender, are used to describe an outcome Y (such as completing a degree). The variables age and gender are recoded into a dummy variable representing age and a dummy variable representing gender: (3) To estimate the adjusted mean for any subgroup evaluated at the mean of all other variables, one substitutes the appropriate values for that subgroup's dummy variables (1 or 0) and the mean for the dummy variable(s) representing all other subgroups. For example, suppose we had a case where Y was being described by age (A) and gender (G), coded as shown above, and the means for A and G are as follows: In this case, the adjusted mean for older students is 0.325 and represents the expected outcome for older students who resemble the average student across the other variables (in this example, gender). It is relatively straightforward to produce a multivariate model using B&B and BPS data, since one of the output options of the DAS is a correlation matrix, computed using pairwise missing values.6 This matrix can be used by most commercial regression packages as the input data to produce least-squares regression estimates of the parameters. That was the general approach used for this report, with two additional adjustments described below to incorporate the complex sample design into the statistical significance tests of the parameter estimates. Most commercial regression packages assume simple random sampling when computing standard errors of parameter estimates. Because of the complex sampling design used for the B&B and BPS survey, this assumption is incorrect. One can get a better approximation of its standard errors by multiplying each standard error by the average design effect of the dependent variable (DEFT),7 where the DEFT is the ratio of the true standard error to the standard error computed under the assumption of simple random sampling. It is calculated by the DAS and produced with the correlation matrix. 6Although the DAS simplifies the process of making regression models, it also limits the range of models. Analysts who wish to use a procedure other than pairwise treatment of missing values or to estimate probit/logit models can apply for a restricted data license from NCES. "}]
