[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract-Sex differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels and trends with age have been consistently observed in both industrialized and unindustrialized populations. However, the impact of sex on pulse pressure, an index of vascular aging, in unindustrialized populations has not been addressed. The objective of this report was to characterize sex differences in aging trends of pulse pressure within unindustrialized populations. Using PubMed and Medline, we identified 60 articles with blood pressure data from unacculturated or partially acculturated populations. Data on 27 populations from 22 articles were included for analysis, on the basis of adequate description of study design and blood pressure measurement. Blood pressure means of adult age groups were modeled by linear and polynomial regression. The pulse pressure levels of women were lower than those of men in early adulthood and higher in older ages. Women had a steeper, steady increase in pulse pressure with age than men (P\u03fd0.001), whereas men had a stronger curvilinear upswing in pulse pressure with age (P\u03ed0.006). Partially acculturated populations had higher pulse pressures than unacculturated populations. Sex had a stronger effect on pulse pressure than acculturation. Pulse pressure trajectories of unindustrialized populations were slightly attenuated compared with those seen in National Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys III and IV of the US population. A sex effect on pulse pressure trends with age prevails across unacculturated and acculturated populations. Accordingly, the biological principles of arterial aging, as expressed in pulse pressure, are the same in all humans, regardless of demography.

Moreover, the sex effect on these PP trajectories points to different patterns of arterial aging in women and men.\nOn the basis of anthropological studies, it has been proposed that blood pressure may not increase or may increase only slightly with age during adulthood in some isolated societies. 18 This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to low salt consumption. 16 -20 However, questions have been raised about causality, particularly in unacculturated societies. 38 -40 In this context, the Intersalt Study was undertaken to focus on the relationship of blood pressure with sodium and potassium urinary excretion, which reflected salt intake, and with lifestyle factors in 52 populations across 32 countries. 41 Population differences in the increase of SBP with age were associated with sodium excretion, but the diversity was only partially attributable to salt intake; climate, physical activity, and societal factors were presumed confounders. 41 These findings of the Intersalt Study have contributed to the protracted debate about \"salt sensitivity,\" 17, 28, 29 which centers on the premise that, in humans, the effect of a \"high\" salt intake is ultimately and almost singularly expressed by blood pressure elevation.\nThe findings that monogenic forms of human hypertension arise from major mutations in genes encoding sodium transport proteins in the renal tubules 42 have only served to bolster the idea that a high salt intake causes hypertension in the general population. However, sodium is vital to diverse networks of biological pathways that are integral components of growth, development, and, therefore, aging. Because aging in industrialized societies is frequently accompanied by a rise in SBP and PP, the question that matters most is whether the influence of sodium on human biology should be defined in terms of blood pressure effects or within the framework of the potential relationship between sodium and biological aging. Another salient matter is how much of the effect of salt can be explained in genetic terms. The genetic argument in support of the role of salt in human biology is that our genetic makeup has been shaped primarily by natural selection during the preagricultural era, when individuals with avid renal sodium absorption capacity enjoyed an evolutionary advantage. The argument goes on to suggest that salt-mediated blood pressure elevation is a modern affliction of a subset of the human population with genetic predilection to retain sodium, because sodium intake of contemporary humans well exceeds the low-sodium/highpotassium diet of their Stone Age ancestors. 18 However, Paleolithic diet evolved to meet nutritional needs of humans with an average life span of \u03fd30 years.\nA central feature of evolution is that natural selection largely operates during the reproductive period. The upper boundary of this period is \u03f750 years, reflecting the onset of menopause. However, essential hypertension primarily occurs during the postreproductive years, among upper middle aged and elderly persons. Thus, essential hypertension is a modern problem, because humans live much longer than ever before. Moreover, approximately two thirds of patients with essential hypertension manifest systolic hypertension and, hence, a high PP. [43] [44] [45] The aging factor is, hence, relevant to understanding age-dependent PP trajectories. Accordingly, if salt intake impacted age-dependent blood pressure trajectories, its effect might largely be by accelerating the pace of arterial aging. Indeed, salt might exert a cardiovascular effect independent of that on blood pressure. 46, 47 Our findings suggest that, in populations not yet industrialized, women and men differ in their patterns of increasing PP with age. Broadly, regardless of acculturation, women tend to have lower SBP in early adulthood and to have a more rapid rise of this variable with age, resulting in a steeper climb of PP in women than in men. We have illustrated that the NHANES III/IV broad survey of the US population exhibits a similar crossover of women's and men's PP trends. In the Asklepios survey of healthy middle-aged Belgians, the PP age trend among women also crosses over that of men at age 50 years. 48 A sex difference in blood pressure trends with age is seen despite the variety of populations and study designs, underscoring the robustness of the sex effect. Although not all 27 of the within-population estimates show higher PP in women aged 20 years than in men or in PP slope, the within-population sex differences are significant, within and across acculturation classes. Most population subsets contain only a few age levels, with some relatively small sample sizes. We would expect, because of statistical variability alone, that not all of the observed within-population results would track overall trends. Trajectories on the basis of longitudinal follow-up of individuals in these populations might not have shown the same aging patterns. As noted by Pearson et al, 49 crosssectional aging trends may reflect selective mortality. The longitudinal Framingham Heart Study reported PP trends for healthy or untreated hypertensive women that were lower at a younger age and then converged or slightly overtook the PP levels of comparable men. 10 The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging of healthy volunteers observed little difference in results from cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Women had consistently lower SBP and DBP levels. Although SBP increased with age, the gap narrowed between men's higher SBP and women's lower SBP because of steeper SBP increases in women up to age 70 years. With a smaller sex difference in DBP levels and flatter trajectories, 49 the narrowing of the SBP differences would be reflected in PP trends, albeit without crossover.\nWe underscore limitations of our study. Our regression analyses are \"ecological,\" in that the observations are agegroup means, rather than individual BP measurements. We nevertheless have compared our trend results with those from well-known cross-sectional studies of individuals. Our designation of populations as unacculturated versus partially acculturated is subjective and crude. We note that degree of acculturation may be a surrogate for or confounded by differences in diet, cultural practices, and study procedures, particularly in measurement of blood pressure. We were unable to classify with any confidence the population diets. We cannot rule out the possibility that sex differences in PP trends are consequences of sex differences in a time-varying exposure to a covariate. However, the regression patterns, if indirect, would be attenuated from the underlying covariate trends, which would imply very strong covariate effects on PP. Furthermore, such sex-specific covariate effects and time trends would have to be consistent across our diverse populations to produce such an effect. It is more likely that the sex differences in PP trends seen cross-culturally in less acculturated and modern societies do not depend on external confounders such as lifestyle and diet. Although there is no doubt that PP and vascular stiffness are related to salt intake, a phenomenon that is clearly evident in the elderly, 47 it is unlikely that the age-related PP trajectory and its modification by sex can be solely explained by salt intake. PP may nevertheless be a surrogate for sex-dependent physiological differences, which is salient to our interpretation of the results.\nFinally, our study has focused on societies untouched by environmental confounders of modern times, an undertaking no longer feasible, as so few populations remain truly remote. For this reason alone, recognition that a sex effect on PP trajectories, and, by implication, arterial aging, is independent of acculturation is highly relevant to perspectives on essential hypertension and cardiovascular risk."}, {"section_title": "Perspectives", "text": "Among less acculturated populations, an effect of sex on the PP trajectory was observed regardless of interpopulation variations in environmental exposures, including salt intake. Thus, the age-dependent differences in PP trajectories between women and men seen across societies most likely stem from sex-related differences in arterial aging. It follows, then, that if a high salt intake increases the likelihood of cardiovascular disease, its effect is primarily mediated by accelerating arterial aging. To tackle the problem of age-dependent rises in PP, we must confront the underlying biology of the aging process itself."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Eileen Crimmins and Jung Ki Kim (Andrus Gerontology Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles) for their assistance in the analysis of the NHANES data.
