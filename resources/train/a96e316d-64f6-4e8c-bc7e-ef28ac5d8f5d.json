Their prominent clinical features are progressive ataxia comprising impairment of gait, balance, and limb coordination, as well as disturbances of speech swallowing and oculomotor control. Hereditary ataxias may present as purer forms with more isolated ataxia or as complicated forms with additional neurological symptoms.\nHereditary ataxias are subdivided into the autosomal-recessive ataxias with Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) as the most prevalent entity -except East Asia-, the autosomal-dominant ataxias designated as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), and X-linked ataxias with fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) as the most common form. Currently, more than 50 recessive ataxias (http://neuromuscular.wustl.edu/ataxia/recatax.html), and approximately 40 SCAs, have been genetically delineated (http://neuromuscular.wustl.edu/ataxia/domatax.html). Additionally, ataxias can be caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations as well. A subgroup of potentially hereditary ataxias are the sporadic adult-onset degenerative disorders with no identified etiology share many clinical features with the hereditary ataxias, but the causes of these ataxias are unknown. An overview of hereditary ataxias and causative gene mutations can be found online (http://neuromuscular.wustl.edu/).\nWith the genetic classification of hereditary ataxias, an increasing number of clinical studies aim to define the natural history of these disorders, develop biomarkers, and investigate therapeutic interventions. Early and preclinical disease stages are currently attracting particular interest. For such studies, generally accepted standards for sampling and storage of biomaterials, clinical and neuropsychological assessment, quantitative performance tests, as well as neuroimaging are highly needed.

Because sampling of PBMCs is less invasive and easier than that of fibroblasts, PBMCs are the currently recommended source of iPSCs. 2 Given the enormous potential of research with iPSCs, routine sampling of PBMCs in clinical studies, if feasible, is highly recommended. There are several systematic efforts for brain collections under standardized protocol. Here as well, effort and money are limiting factors. Additionally, the trust of potential donors and their families plays an important role in the success of building up brain collections.\nBiomaterials, such as blood samples, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), are required for the development of fluid biomarkers, which-other than in common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD)-are currently not available in ataxia.\nUsefulness of biomaterials critically depends on the clinical information on the subjects from whom the materials are derived. Biomaterial collections that are not linked to reliable clinical data are therefore of limited use. Another important aspect that is critical for the usefulness of biomaterials is the biophysical quality of the samples. 4 All procedures, including acquisition, handling, and preprocessing before final storage, storage, and retrieval, strongly influence the composition and stability of the samples. These steps should be therefore performed following standard operation procedures, as are generally recommended for biomaterial banking. 3, 5, 6 Furthermore, a documentation of the biomaterial quality is necessary and should be performed as detailed and internationally comprehensive as possible. An example of such documentation is the standard preanalytical (SPREC) code (http://www.isber.org/?page= SPREC). 7 For further information see supplemental material.\nOverall, DNA, RNA, serum, and-whenever possible-CSF and PBMC samples comprise a set of biomaterials that should be taken."}, {"section_title": "Clinical Scales", "text": "Clinical scales are the most important component of assessment in clinical studies.

It consists of 19 items grouped into four subscales that contribute to a total score of 100 points. Subdivisions of different ataxia components are postural and gait disturbance, limb ataxia, dysarthria, and oculomotor disorders. 9 ICARS has been evaluated in six published studies in MSA, SCA, and FRDA patients. 10 Standard psychometric variables, such as total Crohnbach's a, inter-rater reliability, and test-retest reliability, were reported to be good to very good. However, several investigators observed interdependencies between several items. Furthermore, principal component analysis showed that the ICARS score is determined by four different factors that do not coincide with the subscales. The ICARS also lacked linearity and showed floor and ceiling effects. 11 However, ICARS shows good sensitivity to change. There are two modified versions of the ICARS, the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS) for use by movement disorder specialists and general neurologists, and the modified ICARS (MICARS), in which further items were added. 12 Both scales lack further validation. Recently, the effect of age on ICARS, BARS, and SARA scores has been assessed in healthy children."}, {"section_title": "SARA 13", "text": "The SARA is a clinical scale based on a semiquantitative assessment of cerebellar ataxia. It has eight unequally weighted items evaluating to gait, stance, sitting, speech, finger-chase test, nose-finger test, fast alternating movements, and heel-shin test. Oculomotor functions are not included in the SARA. The SARA was initially validated in two studies of 167 and 119 SCA patients. 13, 14 Subsequent evaluation studies were done in mixed populations of ataxia patients 15 and in FRDA. 16 The SARA has been translated into Iberia-Brazilian, Japanese, and Chinese versions, and the translated versions were also validated. Recently, the SARA was also tested in healthy children of various age groups. 10 Overall, psychometric properties were shown to be as good as for the ICARS. In contrast to the ICARS, the SARA behaves linearly without ceiling or floor effects. In FRDA patients, sensitivity to change of SARA was greater than that of the Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) and ICARS. 17 In addition, clinically relevant changes were defined, and it was demonstrated that SARA is a major determinant of healthrelated quality of life in SCA patients. From the practical point of view, SARA has less repetitive items, is less time-consuming to administer, and easier to use than ICARS."}, {"section_title": "FARS 18", "text": "The FARS comprises neurological signs that specifically reflect FRDA symptoms assessed in three functional domains:\n(1) functional staging (overall mobility); (2) activity of daily living (ADL); (3) neurological assessments (bulbar, upper and lower limbs, peripheral nerve, upright stability, and gait functions). The FARS has been validated in two studies of 14 and 155 FRDA patients, respectively. 18 Regner et al. discussed that for longitudinal measurement in unselected cohorts, a 2-year period may be the minimum period to gain reasonable power. 19 Psychometric properties were good and comparable to ICARS and SARA. However, ceiling effects were observed. FARS meets essential criteria for validity for the measurement of disease progression. As a measure of sensitivity, FARS has greater effect size in FARDA patients than ICARS. 16, 17 Neurological Examination Score for Spinocerebellar Ataxia 20 The Neurological Examination Score for Spinocerebellar Ataxia (NESSCA) was developed specifically for SCA3 patients based on a standardized neurological examination. Thus, the 18 items selected comprise a global inventory of general neurological signs and of signs specific for SCA3. It has been validated in a cross-sectional study of 99 SCA3 patients. Inter-rater reliability (20 patients) was high. Scores correlated with SARA scores.

INAS has 30 items related to neurological signs, such as spasticity, and to reported abnormalities, such as dysphagia. The items are grouped into functional categories, reflecting 16 nonataxia and cerebellar oculomotor signs. 21 As a simple quantitative measure, the INAS count reflects the presence or absence of REVIEW nonataxia signs, when at least one item related to a nonataxia sign is present. The INAS performed very well in terms of inter-rater and test-retest reliability. There were mild floor and no ceiling effects. Responsiveness and sensitivity, however, were less satisfactory. Another limitation is that the INAS lacks precise definitions and instructions for investigators, which may cause variability in judgments of symptom severity. However, the INAS is an inventory -not a rating-scale, so the score depends on the presence, not on the severity of symptoms and signs. The INAS is easy to use, only requiring tests or procedures that are routinely performed in the neurological examination. Overall, it has proved to be a useful supplement to the SARA, but it is not an appropriate primary outcome measure in interventional trials in ataxia."}, {"section_title": "Other Scales", "text": "In some types of ataxias, specific symptoms are frequently encountered. Examples are spasticity in autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) and autonomic dysfunction in SCA3.

In SCA3 patients, the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS) has been validated. 22 In ARSACS and other spastic ataxias, the Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale (SPRS), which has been developed for hereditary spastic paraplegia patients, 23 can be applied.

Examples for generic health status measurement tools or disease-specific tools are Short Form Health Survey version 2 (SF-36 V2) 24 or the Friedreich Ataxia Impact Scale (FAIS). 25 The SF-36 is a general measurement of quality of life. Quality of life is an important secondary endpoint in clinical interventional trials. The SF-36 does not address many ataxia-related issues, though. The FAIS contains 126 items covering eight functional areas. It was developed and validated in over 400 FRDA patients grouped into different levels of disease severity. In a recent longitudinal study, the FAIS was found to provide valuable insight into the perspective of individuals with FRDA on their health status and morbidity. However, responsiveness to change appears limited and its use in intervention studies is questionable. The ADL part of FARS is another quality-of-life measure, which is used frequently. As an outcome in the EFACTS study, it showed effect sizes comparable to those of the SARA. 26 \nQuality of life and the perspective of individuals on their health status are important outcomes in clinical trials. FAIS or the ADL part of FARS may be suitable tools."}, {"section_title": "Assessment of Neuropsychological and Psychiatric Symptoms", "text": "Because the cerebellum has a prominent role in motor control, ataxia patients mainly present with motor symptoms.\nThe cerebellum plays a role also in nonmotor functions. Neuropsychological and psychiatric symptoms of variable severity are encountered in a number of ataxias. 27 The reasons for this are 3-fold: (1) Because of cerebellar connections to nonmotor cortical areas, cerebellar disease can be associated with neuropsychological symptoms, mainly disturbances of executive function; (2) in many ataxias, neurodegeneration extends beyond the sites that result in ataxia by involving forebrain structures. This results in intellectual impact and cognitive decline; (3) furthermore, as with many other chronic brain diseases, ataxia can be associated with depression. 28, 29 There are no instruments that were specifically designed for assessment of neuropsychological and psychiatric symptoms in ataxia. Thus, in studies of ataxia patients, various instruments are used that have been previously developed and validated in other populations. A comprehensive overview of such studies is given by Almeida-Silva et al. 30 Although neuropsychological and psychiatric abnormalities have been investigated in numerous studies, there are only a few multicenter and longitudinal studies. 31, 32 A major problem in the use of timed neuropsychological tests in ataxia patients is their motor slowness, which is a confounding factor in assessing cognitive function. This should be taken into account when selecting specific tests. Neuropsychological tests recommended in order to minimize motor skills' interference with special emphasis on covering executive, visuospatial, and verbal domains are given in Table 2 .\nThere are no instruments that were specifically designed for assessment of neuropsychological and psychiatric symptoms in ataxia. Thus, in studies of ataxia patients, various instruments are used that have been previously developed and validated in other populations.

For ataxia, these instruments need validation in longitudinal and multicenter studies."}, {"section_title": "Quantitative Performance Tests", "text": "For ataxia, a number of tests are in use that measure performance in specific coordinative tasks in a quantitative way. These tests yield metric, continuous data that facilitate analysis. In addition, inter-rater reliability is usually higher than in clinical scales. Assessments range from simple time measurements, for example, the time needed to complete a 25-foot (ft) walk, syllable repetition rate, and pegboard tests, to complex assessments that require specific equipment, for example, stride length variability measured with the GAITRite system, acoustic speech analysis systems, 33 and systems to analyse the kinematics and forces of reaching and grasping movements. 34 Each of the obtained measures reflects only performance in the respective task. But the results of various tests can be combined to composite measures that are thought to provide a more comprehensive account of disease severity.\nQuantitative performance tests have a great potential to serve as supplementary outcome measures in addition to clinical scales because they provide objective and quantitative information. It is therefore hoped that they are more sensitive than clinical scales. AFCS, SCAFI, and CCFS are each sets of simple timed tests that do not require expensive equipment or extensive training. Although they have been sufficiently validated so that they can be used in multicenter longitudinal studies, there is currently no evidence that they are more sensitive than clinical scales. Validated posturographic approaches using gold-standard laboratory methods or portable home-based devices are feasible options with the potential to be sensitive continuous outcome measures for use in multicentered studies. Associated with disease severity and balance impairment, sway speeds as measures of instability require careful standardization of sensory conditions to ensure short-and long-term test-retest reliability.

It is widely used for diagnosis of balance disorders. Posturography using gold-standard laboratory (Codamotion 3D motion analysis system with Visual 3D offline processing software) has been used to quantitatively investigate balance (static conditions) in adults with SCA6. Measures of overall sway speeds as well as pitch and roll directional components of sway have been used to comprehensively describe overall and directional components of instability. Quantitative reports of mean sway speeds correlate with same-day measures of disease severity (using the SARA), where an increase in SARA is associated with linear increases in sway speed. Posturography was additionally used to explore levels of axial instability. Laboratory investigations of sensory mechanisms of balance control (dynamic conditions) have incorporated the use of posturography in order to determine sensorimotor abnormalities in adults with SCA6. 42 Posturography requires careful control of sensory conditions to ensure reliability of highly sensitive measures, but, when achieved, is feasible as a measure to either track disease progression or to evaluate the treatment effect of therapies in both clinical and home settings. 43 In addition to standardization of stance width, foot splay angle, and underfoot surface, standardization of the visual environment is of considerable importance during testing given that hypermetric balance responses and increased overall measures of instability are notable when patients observe moving scenery in their visual environment. 42 "}, {"section_title": "REVIEW", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Quantitative Movement Analysis", "text": "Computerized gait analyses systems offer an objective and quantitative measure of gait as well as directed movements. It has been used in ataxia as an outcome measure in several nonpharmacological interventional studies.

GAITRite was validated in study of 25 healthy adults and showed strong concurrent validity and high test-retest reliability. 45 In ataxia, it was used in only a few single-center studies.\nOne study showed that dynamic properties of locomotion in cerebellar ataxia patients were markedly impaired and that shifting walking speed away from preferred walking speed resulted in a loss of dynamic stability. 46 The other study showed that discrete gait abnormalities precede manifest ataxia in SCA6 mutation carriers compared to manifest SCA6 patients. 47 In FRDA, the sensitivity in measuring disease severity was investigated. 48 There are no studies that validate Vicon or GAITRite as an assessment instrument in multicenter studies of ataxia patients. However, the feasibility of quantitative gait analysis as an outcome measure for clinical trials in SCAs has been assessed in a small monocentric study on a total of 20 SCA1, 2, 3, and 6 patients at two time points, and data indicated that a high test-retest reliability was demonstrated. Vicon would also allow quantifying the kinematics of reaching and grasping movements. Easy-to-apply hand-held objects that allow measurement of grip forces, an objective parameter of manual performance, have been used in single-center trials of patients with mixed cerebellar pathology. 49 They need to be validated in multicenter studies. The same is true for automatic speech analysis systems. 49 Electrophysiology (Nerve Conduction Studies, Evoked Potentials)\nPeripheral nerves, dorsal columns, and pyramidal tracts are frequently affected in degenerative ataxias and can be quantitatively assessed by neurophysiological tools, such as nerve conductions studies, somatosensory evoked potentials, and motor evoked potentials. Neurophysiological tests show characteristic findings in different subtypes of SCA, being present even in preclinical stages of SCA2. 50, 51 In FRDA, nerve conduction\nand evoked potential studies demonstrate the sensory neuronopathy, dorsal column degeneration, and pyramidal tract involvement that characterize the disease. Nerve conduction studies, by revealing the presence of a peripheral neuropathy and its type, provide an important support to the differential diagnosis of recessively inherited ataxias. 52 However, multicenter approaches 53 and longitudinal studies in ataxias 54, 55 are rare and face major challenges in standardization to assure reproducibility and intercenter comparability of quantitative neurophysiological measures, as required for multicenter interventional trials."}, {"section_title": "Eye Movement Tracking", "text": "Oculomotor disturbances are a common and often early sign in most hereditary ataxias.

Images have been analyzed with region of interest-based volumetry and voxel-based morphometry. A multicenter study of SCA1, 3, and 6 patients showed brain tissue loss in the cerebellum and brainstem with a genotype-specific pattern. In a 2-year longitudinal study of this cohort, the rate of tissue loss in these structures and basal ganglia nuclei was significantly greater in patients compared to controls.
