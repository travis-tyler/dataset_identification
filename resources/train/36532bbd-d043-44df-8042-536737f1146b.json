Very limited evidence exists about gender effects on brain aging and on the effect of CR on brain modulation in healthy aging and Alzheimer's Dementia (AD). We investigated gender differences in brain metabolic activity and resting-state network connectivity, as measured by 18 F-FDG-PET, in healthy aging and AD, also considering the effects of education and occupation. The clinical and imaging data were retrieved from large datasets of healthy elderly subjects (HE) (225) and AD patients (282). In HE, males showed more extended age-related reduction of brain metabolism than females in frontal medial cortex. We also found differences in brain modulation as metabolic increases induced by education and occupation, namely in posterior associative cortices in HE males and in the anterior limbic-affective and executive networks in HE females. In AD patients, the correlations between education and occupation levels and brain hypometabolism showed gender differences, namely a posterior temporo-parietal association in males and a frontal and limbic association in females, indicating the involvement of different networks. Finally, the metabolic connectivity in both HE and AD aligned with these results, suggesting greater efficiency in the posterior default mode network for males, and in the anterior frontal executive network for females.

Several factors impact on both BR and CR, including lifelong exposure to stimulating cognitive, social, and physical activities, as well as high socio-economic status, educational and occupational attainments [Steffener and Stern, 2013] . These lifelong experiences could influence the integrity of the brain itself, through a process that has been called brain maintenance, resulting in a higher BR, and also in a greater CR, allowing people to maintain function in the face of brain changes or pathology. Several research studies demonstrated brain plasticity and structural changes in healthy subjects in response to life-long experiences, and reduced pathology in neurodegenerative conditions [see for review Barulli and Stern, 2013] .\nThe concept of both CR and BR has greatly developed both at the theoretical and experimental levels thanks also to in vivo neuroimaging methods that provided insights into the anatomo-functional correlates both in healthy aging and in diseases [Stern, 2012; Tucker and Stern, 2011] .\nExploring the brain aging in healthy individuals, several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies reported evidence of age-related atrophy particularly in the frontal lobes [Kalpouzos et al., 2009; Lemaitre et al., 2012; Raz et al., 1997; Salat et al., 2004] . In addition, studies using positron emission tomography imaging with Fluorine-18-Flourodeoxiglucose ( 18 F-FDG-PET) also showed an association between age and decreased brain metabolism in the frontal cortex Kalpouzos et al., 2009; Pardo et al., 2007] . The protective effect of lifelong cognitive experiences on the aging brain has received consistent evidence by structural MRI investigations demonstrating positive correlations with increased gray and white matter volumes in frontal and temporo-parietal cortices [Arenaza-Urquijo et al., 2013; Foubert-Samier et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012] .\nFollowing this line of research, few studies evaluated also the gender effects on aging-related brain changes in healthy individuals, using MRI or 18 F-FDG-PET. The evaluation of gray matter (GM) atrophy with MRI showed, however, heterogeneous results, either a non-significant effect of gender on regional GM atrophy [Good et al., 2001 ; Lema\u00eetre et al., 2005; Salat et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2007] , or increasing brain atrophy associated with aging in several brain regions in males as compared to females [Coffey et al., 1998; Gur et al., 1991; Raz et al., 2004; Sullivan et al., 2004; Takahashi et al., 2011; Thambisetty et al., 2010] . In particular, a greater reduction in cortical thickness and volume of the frontal lobe in males seems to suggest a gender-related vulnerability [Cowell et al., 1994; Murphy et al., 1996; Xu et al., 2000] . Similarly to MRI evidence, also 18 F-FDG-PET findings of gender effects on cerebral metabolism are controversial, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the existence of gender effects on age-related changes in cerebral metabolism. Briefly, some 18 F-FDG-PET studies reported significant decreases in brain metabolic activity in turn for males or females, while others did not find gender differences in elderly population [Fujimoto et al., 2008; Kakimoto et al., 2015; Kawachi et al., 2002; Willis et al., 2002; Yoshizawa et al., 2014] . These inconsistent findings are possibly due to methodological aspects such as the characteristics and size of the considered samples and the statistical analyses. Only one 18 F-FDG-PET study explored the gender differences in the correlation between education and brain resting state metabolism in a group of healthy adults, taking into account 123 individuals [Yoshizawa et al., 2014] . A positive correlation between education and cerebral glucose metabolism was found in temporal and medial frontal regions, but without any evidence for gender effect.\nOther neuroimaging studies focused on the effects of CR in neurodegenerative disorders and in particular on AD. MRI showed reduced brain volumes and micro-structural changes in AD brain correlated with high education and occupation levels [Liu et al., 2012; Sol e-Padull es et al., 2009; Teipel et al., 2009] , and 18 F-FDG-PET a more severe brain hypometabolism in highly educated AD patients for a given level of clinical impairment [Alexander et al., 1997; Garibotto et al., 2008; Morbelli et al., 2013; Perneczky et al., 2006] . Garibotto et al. [2008] reported a significant correlation between higher education and occupation and a more severe 18 F-FDG-PET hypometabolism in temporo-parietal associative cortex and precuneus in subjects with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [Garibotto et al., 2008] . These results were also confirmed by Morbelli et al. [2013] , studying the effects of education on brain metabolism in patients with amnestic MCI who later converted to AD at follow-up [Morbelli et al., 2013] . Furthermore, in the field of molecular PET imaging, Garibotto et al. [2013] using [11C]-MP4A PET for the in vivo assessment of acetylcholinesterase activity, reported a correlation between higher levels of education and occupation and preserved cholinergic activity in temporal medial structures, both in AD and MCI [Garibotto et al., 2013] . Overall, these findings suggest that high levels of education and occupation allow some patients coping with brain degeneration, maintaining cognitive functions and possibly delaying the clinical manifestation of dementia. Up to now, there is, however, very limited evidence on the gender differences in the expression of CR in AD patients. To our knowledge, only one 18 F-FDG-PET study investigated gender differences on reserve in 93 AD patients [Perneczky et al., 2007] . Fifty males as compared to forty-three females showed a greater reduction of brain metabolism in the right inferior frontal cortex, superior temporal lobe, insula and hippocampus. Nevertheless, Perneczky et al. did not take into account the possible effects of education and occupation.\nThe topic is of utmost interest as gender differences were found in AD both in the epidemiology and in the expression of AD-related neurodegeneration. The prevalence and incidence of AD are higher in women as compared to men [Mielke et al., 2014] . The greater longevity of women as compared to men [Seshadri et al., 1997] and the interaction between gender and the apolipoprotein E4 allele [Corder et al., 2004] seem to be potential sources of the reported epidemiological differences. Additionally, also psychosocial and cultural discrepancies (e.g., as different educational and occupational attainments) between men and women have been considered as candidate causal factors [Mielke et al., 2014] . Notably, a study on post mortem specimen by Barnes et al. [2005] showed that the link between neuropathology and its clinical expression is stronger in women as compared to men. Specifically, they found that for every unit increase in pathology, women were significantly more likely to show clinical dementia (Odds-ratio: 22.67) as compared to men (Odds-ratio: 2.82) [Barnes et al., 2005] . Neuroimaging studies have also shown gender differences in AD-related neuropathology. Rowe et al. reported higher amyloid load (as assessed by PET with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)) in AD males than in females with comparable cognitive impairment [Rowe et al., 2010] .\nOverall, these findings suggest that, although AD-related brain changes are more severe in men [Perneczky et al., 2007; Rowe et al. 2010] , women are more likely to express these as clinical dementia [Barnes et al., 2005] , and these findings might be crucially related to a lower or different amount of CR.\nConsidering the above very limited reports on gender differences both in healthy aging and AD brain we investigated in a large dataset of healthy elderly subjects (HE) and AD patients, whether differences exist between males and females in brain metabolic activity, also including the effects of education and occupation. In addition, we also assessed brain metaboli connectivity in the main resting-state functional networks (i.e., the Default Mode Network [DMN] , the frontal executive control network [ECN] , and the Language network [LN] ), an approach never previously applied to explore gender differences in aging and dementia. This investigation might add important knowledge in the gender neurobiology of brain aging and AD dementia."}, {"section_title": "MATERIAL AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Healthy elderly subjects", "text": "Two hundred and twenty-five HE (115 males and 110 females) were selected for this study from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The ADNI is an American public-private partnership launched in 2003 to collect longitudinal data on MCI and AD patients as well as on HE subjects. The main goal of this initiative is to evaluate the combined prognostic value of several AD biomarkers and of clinical and neuropsychological assessments (see www.adni-info.org for more information). Only subjects older than 60 years (age range 61.2-85.9 years) were included in this study to explore aged population and with an age-range comparable to that of the AD patients.\nMales and females showed highly significant differences (P < 0.001) in educational and occupation scores, with males presenting higher levels of both the variables (education, Males: 17.10 6 2.75 years; Females: 15.59 6 2.51 years, and occupation scores: Males: 5.24 6 0.86; Females: 4.51 6 0.95). Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant differences between males and females in short and long term memory scores, which were significantly lower in males (P < 0.005) (see Table I ).\nAge showed highly statistically significant negative correlations with brain glucose metabolism in both males and females (Fig. 1) . In particular, increasing age correlated with significant and extended reduction of brain metabolism in the medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus in males. The average strength of the correlation in these regions in males was r 5 20.563. In females, there was less extended age-related hypometabolism, involving mainly the anterior cingulate cortex, with an average strength of r 5 20.520.\nPositive correlations of both education and occupation with brain metabolism were found in both HE gender, but with distinct metabolic patterns ( Fig. 2 and Supporting Information Table 2 for anatomical details and levels of significance). In males, both education (r 5 0.404) and occupation (r 5 0.506) were correlated with increased metabolism in posterior cerebral structures (education with brain metabolism in the precuneus, postcentral gyrus, inferior and superior parietal lobes and left rolandic operculum; occupation with the left inferior parietal cortex, the bilateral postcentral gyri and in the left temporal lobe and insula). In females, both education and occupation correlated with increased metabolism (education r 5 0.487 and occupation r 5 0.509) in the insula, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, the left superior parietal lobe and in the cerebellum. In addition, education involved also the anterior medial frontal gyrus, the orbitofrontal cortex and temporal pole bilaterally, while occupation the left inferior frontal gyrus. Notably, the voxel extents resulting from the correlation analyses were significantly more extended in females (voxel numbers: education 5,259; occupation 2,156) than in males (voxel numbers: education 1,817; occupation 947)."}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "F-FDG-PET scans for the assessment of brain metabolism, data on education and occupation, and full neuropsychological evaluation were available for each individual."}, {"section_title": "AD patients", "text": "Two hundred and eighty-two AD patients (123 males and 159 females) were included in this study from three databases: 118 were retrieved from the ADNI database, 135 from the Network for Efficiency and Standardization of Dementia Diagnosis (NEST-DD) database, 29 from the Nuclear Medicine database at San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy). We included in the study only patients aged 65 or older (age range 65.0-89.6 years) with a clinical diagnosis of AD according to standardized diagnostic criteria [McKhann et al., 2011] .\nThe study was performed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nTo match the neuropsychological assessments from different databases in both the HE and AD cases, we chose comparable tests for five neuropsychological domains, and z-scores were assessed for each test to allow comparisons (Supporting Information Table 1 ). Years of education were defined as the number of completed years of formal education. Occupational attainment (available for 225 HE and 253 AD patients: 114 males and 139 females) was rated on a six points scale as previously described in Garibotto et al. [2008] . In detail: (1) no occupation; (2) unskilled laborer; (3) housewife; (4) skilled laborer, tradesman, lower level civil servant, employee, self-employed small business, office or sales personal; (5) mid-level civil servant or management, head of a small business, academician or r Malpetti et al. r r 4214 r specialist in a subordinate position; (6) senior civil servant or management, senior academic position, self-employed with high degrees of responsibility [Garibotto et al., 2008] . In case of subjects who did more than one job during their life, the lifelong employment performed for the longest time was considered.\nDescriptive statistics (means and standard deviations) were considered separately for males and females in both HE (see Table I ) and AD patients (see Table II ), using SPSS 21.0 software for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Gender groups in the two cohorts were compared by means of two-sample independent sample t-tests (see Tables I and II) .\nIn addition, the AD diagnosis was supported by the presence of the AD-like hypometabolism pattern, as assessed by a single-subject validated SPM procedure of 18 F-FDG-PET images . We applied the SPM single-subject method that we validated in AD and in several neurodegenerative diseases with a very high sensitivity and specificity [Cerami et al., , 2017 Perani et al., 2014 Perani et al., , 2016 . We included only patients with the clinical diagnosis of AD and the typical hypometabolism pattern as indicated in the diagnostic research criteria [McKhann et al., 2011] . We thus used both clinical diagnosis and 18 F-FDG-PET hypometabolism evidence to enhance the accuracy of patients' inclusion.\nGLM was used to test the whole brain voxel-level correlations between educational and occupational attainments and brain hypometabolism in male and female AD patients. These correlation analyses for AD patients were tested at the second level, that is on contrast images derived from single-subject comparisons. Each first level analysis includes the age as covariate and all the resulting contrast images have this effect factored out. MMSE scores, disease duration and neuropsychological z-scores for the five described domains, were entered as nuisance variables. The significant thresholds were set at P < 0.001, P< 0.005, and P < 0.01 (uncorrected for multiple comparisons) with minimum cluster extent k 5 50, given the exploratory nature of this voxel-based analysis based on a very large dataset (N 5 282).\nMales and females significantly differed (P < 0.001) in educational years and occupation scores, with males showing higher levels (education of 13.25 6 4.82 years and occupation scores 4.57 6 1.28) than females (10.45 6 4.47 years and occupation scores mean of 3.76 6 1.06). Male and female AD patients did not differ in age, disease duration and MMSE. Neuropsychological assessment revealed deficits across all the investigated cognitive domains in both the groups. However, males were significantly more impaired in short-memory domain as compared to females (see Table II ).\nEducation and occupation significantly correlated with brain hypometabolism in both males and females, but with differences (see Fig. 3 and Supporting Information Table 3 for anatomical details and levels of significance). In females, education showed significant correlations in both anterior and posterior brain structures, namely the anterior cingulate cortex, the medial frontal cortex, and the posterior cingulate and precuneus (r 5 20.428). Moreover, education effect in females was also evident in limbic structures, such as the left insula and parahippocampal gyrus. In males, education correlated with hypometabolism (r 5 20.365), in the left inferior and middle temporal gyri, the left angular gyrus and bilaterally in the cerebellum (i.e., VIIa Crus I). There was a more extended pattern in females (voxel number 4,731) than in males (voxel number 749). In females, occupation showed limited effects and only in inferior temporal lobes (r 5 20.316). In males, occupation was the most relevant proxy that correlated with hypometabolism in the precuneus r Gender, Brain Reserve in Aging, and AD r r 4217 r bilaterally, and in the left posterior cingulate cortex, lateral temporal, and parietal cortex (r 5 20.415). The correlation pattern was more extended in males (voxel number 2,341) than in females (voxel number 962).\nDefault Mode Network. The pattern of metabolic connectivity in AD patients was restricted to the seed regions in the parietal lobes, with limited connectivity to the dorsolateral frontal cortex. Differences between males and females were evident in the lateralization of the pattern. Specifically, males showed more connectivity in the right prefrontal cortex and females in the left prefrontal cortex (Fig. 4B) .\nExecutive control network. Male and female AD patients, both showed significant metabolic connectivity within the frontal cortex. The ECN, however, was more extended in r Gender, Brain Reserve in Aging, and AD r r 4219 r females involving also parietal and temporal cortex, especially in the left hemisphere (Fig. 4D) .\nLanguage network. Metabolic connectivity for the chosen seeds was more extended in females involving the left hemisphere the dorsolateral frontal, temporal and parietal cortex. In AD males, the metabolic connectivity was limited to the left temporo-parietal cortex only surrounding the seed regions.

We created a single averaged 15-min frame for each image starting at 30 or, in the majority of cases, at 45 min after radio-ligand injection.

In summary, there were gender differences in elderly brains, with males showing more age-related reduction of brain metabolism than females in frontal medial regions for cognitive control. Both HE subjects and AD patients showed correlations between levels of education and occupation and brain metabolism and, these were positive in aging and negative in AD. Indeed, we found increases in regional brain metabolism as a major effect of these life factors in healthy aging and a more severe cerebral hypometabolism in highly educated and lifelong occupied patients with AD. The effect of gender on these correlations emerged as an involvement of different brain networks, a result confirmed also by the metabolic connectivity analyses. In summary, the present findings reveal a greater aging effect on frontal cortex in males than females. Both in HE and AD, the effect of education and occupation was greater in anterior executive control and socio-affective networks in females, and in the posterior associative brain regions and the DMN in males. The following discussion highlights the results for HE and AD separately."}, {"section_title": "Healthy Aging", "text": "A significant correlation between age and a decreased brain metabolism was found in frontal medial brain regions in both genders, with a lesser voxel extent in females than in males. The GAM confirmed that the best fitting model to explain the relationship between age and frontal metabolism was linear (see Fig. 1 ), with significant differences for females and males indicating a more severe effect of aging in males in frontal medial cortex (Fig. 1) .\nIn general, this aging evidence aligns with the frontal aging hypothesis [Tisserand and Jolles, 2003 ], which suggests that aging is associated with a reduction in metabolic activity in the frontal lobe and mainly in the anterior cingulate gyrus. MRI studies on healthy aging reported structural evidence of age-related atrophy in the frontal lobe [Kalpouzos et al., 2009; Lema\u00eetre et al., 2005; Raz et al., 1997; Salat et al., 2004] . Of note, previous findings from MRI studies considering gender, identified differences in age-related atrophy, with a more severe frontal GM atrophy in males than in females [Cowell et al., 1994; Murphy et al., 1996; Xu et al., 2000] .\nBeside confirming these MRI results on a larger independent database, we revealed gender differences also in the amount of neuronal dysfunction, measured as reduced brain metabolic activity that was more severe in males as compared to females, thus suggesting a major gender susceptibility to age-related decline. The age-related dysfunctional changes in females were limited only to the anterior cingulate gyrus while extensively encompassed also a large part of the superior frontal gyrus in males (Fig. 1) . As aforementioned, results from previous 18 F-FDG-PET studies on this topic are controversial, reporting inconsistent findings, possibly due to methodological aspects. Our 18 F-FDG-PET study in a very large cohort of HE subjects (n 5 225) demonstrated that gender differences exist in the correlation between age and frontal hypometabolism. The medial frontal cortex that was more hypometabolic in males is involved in executive functioning, cognitive control and top-down modulation of information processing toward the posterior associative cortex [see for reviews Ridderinkhof et al., 2004; Rushworth et al., 2007] . The more limited frontal lobe impairment found in women as compared to men also parallels gender differences on cognitive performances in aging. In this respect, we found a female advantage in the short-term memory domain. Crucially and related, fMRI studies reported different brain activations in males and females during cognitive control and working memory tasks, suggesting a higher involvement of the prefrontal cortex in adult females and parietal cortex in males [Christakou et al., 2009; Hill et al., 2014] . Such a difference may arise from distinct lifelong neural mechanisms in males and females underpinning the same cognitive processes. Several theories were advanced to explain age-related cognitive and brain changes, with a selective topographical vulnerability (e.g., in the frontal lobe), hypothesizing multiple possible causative factors and their interaction such as neurochemical deficiencies (e.g., dysregulation in the dopamine system), and decrease of inhibition and speed processing [see for review Drag and Bieliauskas, 2010] . The causes of gender differences in age-related hypometabolism however, are still elusive, but crucial factors might be considered, such as education, occupation and lifestyle habits, together with biological factors, including hormones, genes and differences in neurotransmission in the brain.\nThe second main result in HE was the significant gender differences in the correlations of educational and occupational attainments with brain metabolic activity. We found in males and females positive correlations between both education and occupation and increased brain metabolism, indicating the significant effect of education and occupation on healthy aging brain [Arenaza-Urquijo et al., 2013; Yoshizawa et al., 2014] . These findings are compatible with the concept of BR. As above reported, healthy aging is typically associated with reduced metabolism, particularly in frontal lobes. Thus, the reported correlations of higher education or occupation with higher metabolism in specific brain regions could represent increased BR as a function of these life experiences.\nHowever, the correlations for males and females emerged in spatially distinct patterns (see Fig. 2 ). On one hand, females showed a higher BR, as increased metabolism, in anterior medial frontal and orbitofrontal cortex, as well as in limbic structures. These brain regions are part of neural networks involved in cognitive control [see for reviews Koechlin and Hyafil, 2007; Ramnani and Owen, 2004] and in social-emotional processes [see for reviews Behrens et al., 2009; Lindquist et al., 2012] . Aging is typically associated with reduced metabolism in the frontal lobes, thus the reported correlations of higher education or occupation with relatively higher metabolism in these areas could represent increased BR as a function of these life experiences. On the other hand, in males, the BR was strong in parieto-temporal association cortex subserving cognitive functions such as visuospatial processes, attention, memory and actionrelated functions [see for reviews Cabeza et al., 2008; Husain and Nachev, 2007] . The differential involvement of these functional networks aligns with evidence from cognitive studies showing that females outperform males on emotion and social processing, such as labelling of facial expressions and memory for highly emotional events [see for review Christov-Moore et al., 2014] , while males are better on visuospatial performances and on tasks for visuo-spatial memory [Hamilton, 2008; Le on et al., 2016; Postma et al., 2004] . Some MRI and fMRI studies reinforce these cognitive evidence reporting lifelong gender differences in GM volume and in the amount of task-induced BOLD changes in specific brain networks. For example, according to Gur et al. [2002] females have higher GM volume in orbitofrontal cortex, a core brain region involved in emotion processing, and ratio of orbitofrontal to amygdala volume, suggesting greater modulation of amygdala inputs by orbitofrontal cortex [Gur et al., 2002] . Moreover, several fMRI studies reported gender differences in the neural activations associated with the same tasks. For example, when dealing with cognitive control of emotions or social and empathic processes females compared to males showed more increased BOLD signal in the limbic structures and orbitofrontal cortex [Canessa et al., 2009 [Canessa et al., , 2011 Koch et al., 2007] , while males in the parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [Koch et al., 2007] . Similarly, when performing a mental rotation task, males compared to females showed higher activation in the parietal cortex, while females showed additional activation in the inferior frontal gyrus [Hugdahl et al., 2006] . These brain structural and functional differences may reflect gender differences in strategies for cognitive processes.\nCrucially, the aging effects here described in frontal regions were more limited in females, possibly as a result of the major influence of the life experiences in these structures (see Fig. 2 ). We found a pattern of positive correlations with education and occupation in anterior frontal regions related to cognitive control in females, coherent with the Posterior Anterior Shift Aging (PASA) model [Davis et al., 2008] . According to the PASA model, an increased and compensatory frontal engagement in healthy individuals with high cognitive functioning might allow the maintenance of normal cognitive performances associated with specific cognitive demands. As for males, our results fit with previous evidence of age-related and task independent increases in parietal activity [Cabeza et al., 2004; Madden et al., 2007] , indicating a compensatory function of parietal activity in aging, that we found stronger in males. The neurobiological reasons for these identified differences in BR between males and females need however, to be determined. Crucial aspects might be the different levels of education and occupation between genders that were present in our HE series, with males showing significant higher scores than females on both education and occupation levels. Specifically, we hypothesize that the different levels and type of education and occupation, as well as different lifelong strategies for cognitive processes might explain at least in part the observed gender effects on BR. Social and educational gender differences throughout the entire life, together and in interaction with other biological factors, may lead to gender specific reorganization of brain structural and functional networks. This in turn leads to different neuroprotective and compensatory mechanisms of reserve in older age. Furthermore, our results show that despite elderly females reach lower levels of education and occupation during life, they obtained higher scores in short and long term memory, as compared to males. A similar finding was reported by van Exel et al. [2001] who described better cognitive functions in females despite their lower level of education. The origin of the specificity of compensatory cerebral activities in females and males, as well as the differences in cognitive performance are in need of further investigation, considering also other constitutional and biological (e.g., hormonal and genetic) sex specificities."}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Dementia", "text": "The analyses on the whole AD group revealed significant correlations between high levels of educational and occupational attainments and more severe brain hypometabolism, as shown by previous 18 F-FDG-PET studies [Garibotto et al., 2008; Morbelli et al., 2013; Perneczky et al., 2006] . Accordingly, in our study, both female and male patients showed a more severe hypometabolism with increasing education and occupation levels in posterior AD-related brain regions (see Fig. 3 ).\nOf note, we report here for the first time that the effect of education and occupation, on brain hypometabolism in AD are different according to gender. Specifically, in males, occupation and, to a minor extent, education had a relevant effect on the posterior cerebral associative cortices (i.e., posterior cingulum/precuneus and temporo-parietal cortex), especially on the left hemisphere. In AD females, education not only had a comparable effect on the brain metabolism in the same posterior brain regions but also a strong effect in the medial frontal executive networks and in temporo-limbic structures involved in socio-affective processes (see Fig. 3 ). This specific regional involvement in females encompassing mainly anterior brain networks, parallels the effects we found in HE females, namely a major sparing of the age-related hypometabolism in frontal medial cortex in comparison to males. This finding in AD females might be interpreted as a further efficient mechanism that helps to support cognitive performances in dementia. In the light of these results, we hypothesize that gender differences in the correlations of education and occupation with brain hypometabolism in AD might reflect different effects coping with neurodegeneration, with the recruitment of frontal executive neural resources in females.\nTo our knowledge, only another study investigated gender differences in brain glucose metabolism in AD patients, taking into account the concept of reserve and finding more severely reduced brain metabolism in males than in females [Perneczky et al., 2007] . Differently from our study, Perneczky et al. performed a group-comparison analysis between females and males restricted to only few a priori brain ROI. Moreover, they considered only education as a confounding variable, together with age and r Malpetti et al. r r 4222 r clinical severity, thus assessing only the passive model of reserve. Finally, also the sample size may contribute to the observed different results as compared to our study. In fact, they considered 93 AD patients, while we evaluated 282 AD cases.\nIn addition, applying the GAM in the AD group, the results showed the effect of aging on brain metabolism in the frontal medial regions and in the hippocampal structures (see Supporting Information Figure 2) , only in AD males. This further confirms a higher susceptibility to aging effect in frontal lobe in males as compared to females. We suggest that frontal medial cortex and limbic hippocampal structures are more resistant in females coping better with aging and AD."}, {"section_title": "Brain Metabolic Connectivity", "text": "Finally, the whole-brain metabolic connectivity analyses in three functional brain networks, namely the DMN, ECN, and LN, revealed gender differences in both healthy aging and AD. In the HE, males showed a more extended pattern of metabolic connectivity in dorsal DMN as compared to females (see Fig. 4A ). This result is consistent with the finding of reserve-related increased metabolism in posterior regions in HE males. In AD patients, the dorsal DMN metabolic connectivity in parietal and temporal cortices was reduced in both genders, but the effect was particularly marked in male patients (see Fig. 4B ). Overall, this is consistent with the severe damage of the dorsal DMN frequently reported in AD patients [Buckner et al., 2008; Greicius et al., 2004] . Notably, both female and male AD patients showed preserved metabolic connectivity between posterior cingulum/precuneus and dorsolateral frontal cortex, but with different lateralization (left for females and right for males) that again might be associated with gender differences in lifelong cognitive strategies. Indeed, several studies reported that during the same task, males showed more activation in the right cerebral hemisphere, while females in the left hemisphere [Frings et al., 2006; Speck et al., 2000] . A similar gender asymmetry was reported also in resting-state fMRI functional connectivity with visual network more right-lateralized in males and attentional networks more left-lateralized in females [Agcaoglu et al., 2015] .\nAs for the ECN, Morbelli et al. [2013] showed an enhanced brain connectivity in AD patients with high educational levels [Morbelli et al., 2013] . In our study, metabolic connectivity in ECN was largely overlapped between males and females in the HE group (see Fig. 4C ). In AD patients, metabolic connectivity within the frontal cortex was even more extended than in HE (see Fig. 4D ). This aligns with the assumption of Grady et al. [Grady et al., 2003] for which recruitment of additional prefrontal regions in AD patients may reflect a compensative strategy to maintain cognitive function. Of note, female AD patients showed a more extended metabolic connectivity in fronto-parietal network (Fig. 4D) .\nLastly, we evaluated the metabolic connectivity in the LN, which is considerably involved in the debate on gender differences [Wallentin, 2009] . In HE, males compared to females showed a less left lateralized LN, thus involving bilaterally, frontal, temporal, parietal, and cingulate cortices (see Fig. 4E ). These results supporting the hypothesis of reduced hemispheric asymmetry in older age with neural recruitment in the opposite hemisphere as proposed by the HAROLD (hemispheric asymmetry reduction in older adults) and by the CRUNCH (compensatoryrelated utilization of neural circuits hypothesis) models [Cabeza et al., 2002; Reuter-Lorenz and Cappell, 2008] , suggest a major compensative strategy to maintain the same performance levels in males. In contrast, HE females showed a more asymmetric LN as compared to males. A better performance on language tasks, such as verbal recognition and fluency tests, was reported for females as compared to males in adult and elderly individuals [de Frias et al., 2006; McCarrey et al., 2016] . Consistently, structural MRI studies reported greater volume in brain regions of the LN (i.e., Broca's area and Wernicke's area) in adult females [Harasty et al., 1997; Luders et al., 2009 ]. This cognitive and structural evidence aligns with the LN metabolic connectivity in HE, suggesting a more efficient LN in females than in males. Consistently, female AD patients showed a more extended metabolic connectivity pattern than AD males (see Fig. 4F ). This result might reflect higher neuroprotective effects on LN in females than in males."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Our findings support the significant gender differences in the effects of education and occupation on brain metabolism and cognitive resilience both in healthy aging and AD. In HE individuals, we found age-related reduction of brain metabolism in frontal regions, more severe in males than in females. Accordingly, females showed metabolic increases related to higher levels of education and occupation and more metabolic connectivity in the anterior frontal and limbic brain networks, whereas for males in structures of the posterior DMN. These patterns, characterizing HE females and males, are in some way consistent with the results in the AD cohort in which males showed a more severe hypometabolism, related to high levels of education and occupation, in posterior associative regions, while females in frontal and temporo-limbic networks.\nIn this context, we want to highlight the importance of considering that in the past century, due to socio-economic factors, women had fewer opportunities for higher education and occupational attainments and were more engaged in familial and social activities. These historical aspects with socially constructed gender roles, behaviors, activities, and attributes that given society considers appropriate for men and women, are here mirrored in our elderly and AD samples. The gender differences we found might be explained by the levels and types of education and occupation and also by other sociodemographic factors that might contribute to differences between females and males in lifelong cognitive strategies and consequentially in brain function and networks. In addition, we should also consider other fundamental underlying biological determinants, such as genes and sex hormones that in turn contribute to brain modulation. The basis of gender differences in our findings is likely at the intersection between several sociodemographic and biological factors."}]
