[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Purpose: Acceleration capacity affects physical function, but whether it differentially affects men versus women or weak versus strong individuals is less known. We investigated whether knee extension rate of velocity development (RVD, a measure of acceleration) is associated with walking performance independent of peak torque and whether the relationships differ in men versus women and in weak versus strong individuals. Methods: Relationships of RVD with walking performance were assessed in 326 women and 365 men aged 26-96 years enrolled in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Tests included knee extension peak torque and RVD assessed during a 180\u00b0\u00b7s \u22121 isokinetic strength test and four walking performance measures (usualpaced and fast-paced 6 m walks and 2.5 min usual-paced and 400 m fast-paced walks). Sex-stratified linear regression models were adjusted for age, race, height, appendicular lean mass, fat mass, peak torque, knee pain, and RVD*peak torque interaction. Results: In men, RVD was not independently associated with any walking performance measure (p > 0.05), and, for the 6 m-usual walk only, there was a significant RVD*peak torque interaction (p < 0.0001). In women, RVD was independently associated with usual-paced walks (p < 0.05) and there were significant RVD * peak torque interactions for all measures. Strength-specific analyses indicated that RVD was most associated with performance among weaker individuals. Conclusion: RVD is associated with walking performance in women, but less in men, and is most related to performance when strength is low. Strategies to accomplish motor tasks may be sex-specific. Future studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying such sex differences."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Muscle strength is important to walking performance (Bohannon, 1997) . The relationship between muscle strength and walking performance is usually explored by studying the independent correlation between maximum muscle strength, often as peak torque or force and some performance measure of walking capacity. Few and relatively small studies have selectively addressed acceleration capacity. The capacity to accelerate the limbs is important for various physical performance tasks (Murray et al., 2007; Wilk et al., 1994) . Thus, assessing acceleration capacity may help gain insight into the motor strategies that individuals use to purposefully and efficiently move their limbs.\nRate of velocity development (RVD) is a metric of acceleration capacity during initial muscle contraction that is usually estimated from the time-velocity curve during the unloaded acceleration phase of isokinetic testing (Brown & Whitehurst, 2003; Brown et al., 2005) . RVD can be operationally defined as the time required to reach a predetermined angular velocity (Brown & Whitehurst, 2003) . The relationships between RVD at various predetermined angular velocities and peak torques are weak (r = \u22120.09 to \u22120.29), suggesting that RVD captures a different aspect of muscle function than peak torque (Brown et al., 2005) . In adults who are physically active, short-term velocityspecific training causes improvement of knee extension RVD, with little or no improvement in knee extension peak torque (Brown & Whitehurst, 2003; Murray et al., 2007) . Since RVD reflects some effect of aging on muscle, especially neuromuscular changes (Chen et al., 1994) , studying this parameter may help better understanding the effect of aging on mobility performance and provide novel insights into T mechanisms and intervention strategies to prevent or treat mobility decline with aging.\nOverall, men are stronger than women of the same size (Brown et al., 1995; Doldo et al., 2006; Musselman & Brouwer, 2005) . In contrast, whether acceleration capacity during knee extension differs by sex remains controversial. One study reported that healthy young women compared to men, require on average more time to reach the target velocity, but only at velocities > 240\u00b0\u00b7s \u22121 (Brown et al., 1995) , whereas another study did not find any sex differences in healthy young adults at angular velocities ranging from 30 to 300\u00b0\u00b7s \u22121 (Chen et al., 1994) . Sex differences also exist in walking performance (Tolea et al., 2010) , which are only in part explained by differences in anthropometric characteristics (Fragala et al., 2012; Musselman & Brouwer, 2005; Tseng et al., 2014) . Further studies are needed to investigate how acceleration capacity contributes to walking performance, independent of peak torque in men and women. We investigated whether knee extension RVD contributes to walking performance independent of peak torque in women and men aged 20 to 90 years. We further investigated whether, among men and women, the contribution of RVD to mobility performance differs in participants with higher and lower muscle strength. Addressing these questions may help inform mechanisms underlying walking performance and thus provide a rationale for sex and strength-specific exercise programs for the prevention or treatment of mobility disability."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "This study used cross-sectional data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA).

Between January 2006 and February 2011, 691 BLSA participants (26-96 years old) performed isokinetic, concentric knee extension tests and at least one of four walking performance measures (see legend in Table 1 ). The present study used data from the most recent visit when these measures were performed in each participant.

Range of motion of the knee joint angle was set between 100 and 160\u00b0(full extension = 180\u00b0). Participants were asked to extend their knee as hard as possible with an instructor's verbal encouragement (Lindle et al., 1997; Lynch et al., 1999) . Resting periods between trials were set as 15 s. All signals were sampled at 100 Hz. After exporting the raw data, we excluded trials where participants could not reach target velocity (n = 9). Participants who performed these trials were older (76.0 \u00b1 10.4 years) compared to those who were able to reach target velocity (66.4 \u00b1 14.2 years). RVD was calculated as the slope of the velocity-time relationship obtained from the time of movement onset and the time when angular velocity first exceeded 178\u00b0\u00b7s \u22121 (Fig. 1) . For peak torque assessment, we considered the maximum torque generated over the period between the time when angular velocity first exceeded 178\u00b0\u00b7s \u22121 and the time when angular velocity started to decelerate at the end of movement. We selected the trial with the highest peak torque from either leg for both RVD and peak torque."}, {"section_title": "Walking performance", "text": "The BLSA study began measuring walking performance between January 2006 and July 2007.

For long-distance walking performance measures, participants performed a 2.5 min walk at usual pace (2.5 min, m/s) and then 400 m walk at fast pace (400 m, m/s) (Simonsick et al., 2001; Simonsick et al., 2014) .

Normality of distributions were verified using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. A sex difference in age was assessed with an unpaired t-test and race difference (black versus non-blacks) was assessed with the chi-square test. Since anthropometric, morphological, and performance characteristics are affected by age, sex differences were assessed by using age-adjusted generalized linear regression models.\nBecause men and women tend to differ in skeletal muscle mass and performance, and because we hypothesized \"a priori\" that the role of RVD in walking performance would have been different between men Experimental Gerontology 112 (2018) 63-67 and women, all analyses were sex-stratified. Nested linear regression models were used to assess the cross-sectional associations between RVD and each walking performance measures after adjusting for covariates. In Model 1, we examined the independent associations between RVD and four different walking performance measures after adjusting for age, race, body height, ALM, whole body fat mass, knee pain, and peak torque. In Model 2, we further included an interaction term \"RVD * peak torque\" to test whether the effect of RVD on walking performance was conditional to peak torque. Because including an \"RVD * peak torque\" interaction significantly improved the fit of the model predicting at least one of the mobility performance measures in men and women, we further tested the effect of RVD on walking performance separately in participants with low (< sex-specific median) versus high (> sex-specific median) peak torque.\nBased on our exploratory analyses, we assumed that RVD and walking performances both decline with aging and even more rapidly after the age of 50 years. Therefore, we repeated the analyses limited to participants who were 50 years old or older.\nSAS software version 9.4 for Windows (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) was used for all data processing and statistical analyses. The level of statistical significance was set as p < 0.05 (two-sided)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "A total of 691 participants (47.2% women) were included in the analysis. Participant characteristics are presented in Table 1 . Significant sex differences were observed in all characteristics except 6 m-usual (p = 0.47).\nWe examined whether relationships of RVD with each walking performance are independent of peak torque in sex-stratified analyses (Table 2 ). In men, RVD was not associated with any measures of walking performance independent of peak torque, suggesting that RVD does not independently contribute to walking performance after accounting for the effect of peak torque (Model 1). A significant RVD * peak torque interaction (p < 0.0001) was found only for 6 musual gait speed, suggesting that the association between RVD and 6 musual pace walk is different between weaker and stronger men (Model 2, p < 0.05).\nIn women, RVD, significantly accounted for the 2.5 min walk and 6 m-usual walk independent of peak torque (Model 1, p < 0.05). For all performance measures examined, we found a significant \"RVD * peak torque\" interaction term, suggesting that the association between RVD and walking performance is different between weaker and stronger individuals (Model 2, p < 0.05).\nTo better understand and quantify the implications of the significant interaction terms in the analyses, we analyzed the effect of RVD on walking performance among participants with peak torque below and above the median value (men, 102-105 Nm; women, 70.5 or 71.0 Nm), separately in men and women and for the different walking performance measure (Table 3 ). Among men with low peak torque, higher RVD was significantly associated with faster gait speed in 6 m-usual only (p = 0.001), while among men with high peak torque, RVD was not significantly associated with any of the mobility performance examined (Model 2), suggesting that for this task, the effect of RVD on performance is greater for weaker participants. Among women with low peak torque, higher RVD was significantly associated with better performance in all measures except 6 m-fast test (p = 0.050). As in men, among women with high peak torque, RVD was not significantly associated with any of the mobility performance tasks.\nIn sensitivity analyses including participants aged 50 years and over, we observed substantially similar results compared to those that included all participants except that no significant interactions \"RVD * peak torque\" were observed in 2.5 min and 6 m-fast walks in women (Supplemental Table) . "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we found that the relationship between RVD and walking performance is different in men and women. In men, RVD was not associated with any walking performance measure independent of peak torque, and RVD contributed to performance only for the 6 musual among men with weak peak torque. In contrast, in women, the effect of RVD on walking performance was associated with usual pace walks and consistently depends on peak torque. In women with low but not in those with high peak torque, higher RVD was associated with significantly better walking performance.\nWhy is RVD associated with walking performance only in persons with low strength, especially among women? A possible explanation is to consider relevant sex differences. Women have lower muscle strength than men, mainly due to morphological and muscle architectural characteristics such as muscle mass, the relative proportion of muscle fiber types, and the pennation angle of muscles (Abe et al., 1998; Staron et al., 2000) . In addition, supra-and sub-spinal nervous systems involved in force production may differ, as indirectly demonstrated by Macaluso et al. (2002) , who found that women, especially older women, have greater co-activation of antagonist muscles, possibly to stabilize the involved joint (Macaluso et al., 2002) . Factors such as less muscle mass, greater fat mass, shorter limb length, and/or greater joint instability, may disadvantage women's ability, compared to men, to generate force. To overcome these disadvantages, women might depend on not only the ability to produce force but also initial acceleration capacity to move a limb. Our study does not have sufficient sample size and power among younger adults to determine if these sex effects are already present at younger ages (Hicks et al., 2001) . The individual and separate effects of weakness, age and sex on the relationships between RVD and walking performance would require a larger sample with greater representation of young adults.\nTo understand how RVD is affected by age or sex, valid and feasible measures are needed. The approach to measuring RVD should account for feasibility and functional relevance. A feasible measure should be testable in a wide range of older adults, including those who are frail. When testing velocity using a unilateral isokinetic dynamometer, acceleration time is affected by the target angular velocity set by the machine and by the specific instructions given (Chen et al., 1994; Christ et al., 1993) . In knee extension, physically active young women and men may reach a target velocity up to 300\u00b0\u00b7s \u22121 (Brown et al., 1995; Chen et al., 1994; Lanza et al., 2003) . In contrast, some physically active 65-85 year old cannot reach target velocity at 300\u00b0\u00b7s \u22121 (Lanza et al., 2003) , and our study additionally shows some frail older cannot reach target velocity even at 180\u00b0\u00b7s \u22121 . It is possible that sex and agerelated associations might reveal additional insights at very fast angular velocities, but the functional relevance of such very high angular velocities is not clear. In addition, a higher RVD may be obtained with the instruction \"as fast as possible\" rather than \"as hard as possible\" (Christ et al., 1993 ). Since we found strong and consistent associations using \u03b2 values are standardized regression coefficients from generalized linear regression models. Model 1 included age, race, height, appendicular lean mass, whole body fat mass, and peak torque. Model 2 further included the interaction of RVD and PT.

It is possible that associations might be even stronger using \"fast as possible\". RVD obtained using 180\u00b0\u00b7s\n, as reported here, may be both feasible across a range of ages and in both sexes, and is functionally relevant (Lanza et al., 2003) . Testing at slower angular velocities may increase feasibility for some frail older adults who cannot even reach 180\u00b0\u00b7s \u22121 .\nOur study has important strengths. The sample size of older adults is large. We adjusted for multiple confounders such as age, sex, race, body composition, and knee pain (Doldo et al., 2006) . We analyzed a variety of walking performance tests. In addition, the Kin-Com is highly reliable, with a velocity error within 1.5% (Farrell & Richards, 1986) . One limitation is that our participants are quite healthy. While some participants might have had joint pain in the past, we excluded those who reported pain on the day of testing. Findings might differ in persons with joint pain."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In summary, there are sex-specific associations between acceleration capacity and walking performance after taking muscle strength into account. In men, RVD is associated with performance on the 6 musual in men with a lower peak torque. In women, the relationship depends on muscle strength. In those who have a lower peak torque, acceleration capacity plays a key role in a variety of walking performance measures. Future longitudinal studies, including both women and men and a wide range of age are needed to test the hypothesis that the decline in RVD is linked to disability. From a practical perspective, RVD could be assessed during interventions for mobility disability prevention, especially among older adults with weak muscle strength."}]
