[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "HEART FAILURE: A CARDIOGERIATRIC SYNDROME Heart failure (HF) is a disease syndrome cha racterised by large incidence and prevalence, which has been estimated in the developed countries at 5-10/1000 persons per year and 1-2%, respectively [1] , with a clear rise of these indices with age [2] [3] [4] . In the Bri tish Hillingdon study [2] , the incidence of HF among subjects aged 25-34 years was only 0.02/1000 persons per year, rising to 11.6/1000 persons per years among subjects aged \u2265 85 years. Similar trends were observed for the prevalence of HF which was less than 1% among subjects aged 55-64 years but ex ceeded 10% among subjects aged \u2265 85 years in the Rotterdam Study [4] . In the United States, HF is the major diagnostic group in hospitalised patients aged > 65 years [5, 6] , and British data indicate that nearly 5% of acute admissions are related to HF [7] . Age is an adverse prognostic factor in patients with HF [1], including de novo HF [8] , and in the ADHERE registry [9] , acute decompensations of HF were observed mostly among the elderly. With these characteristics, HF has been considered a cardiogeriatric syndrome by some experts [10] and is major medical and socioeconomical problem in modern aging populations [11] [12] [13] [14] .\nDespite recent advances in cardiac investigations and therapy, outcomes in HF continue to be unacceptably poor.\nAccording to the data from the European Society of Cardio logy (ESC) HFPilot registry [15] , annual rehospitalisation rate and mortality among outpatients with chronic HF has been estimated at 31.9% and 7.2%, respectively.

In the current research on the pathophysiology and natural history of HF, attention has been paid to renal dysfunc tion [18] [19] [20] , hepatic dysfunction [21, 22] , immune activation [23] , autonomic sympathetic/parasympathetic imbalance [24] , skeletal muscle dysfunction [16, 25, 26] , anaemia [27] [28] [29] , iron deficiency [30] [31] [32] [33] and insulin resistance [34] . Another important feature of the pathophysiology of HF is impaired hormone metabolism [35] , with anabolic/catabolic balance shifted towards the latter [17, 36, 37] .

It is synthesized by the interstitial cells of Leydig (producing more than 90% of plasma testosterone) and transported in blood mostly in a proteinbound form (98%; mainly bound to sex hormone binding globulin [SHBG] , and to a lesser extent to albumins) [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . Only 1-2% of testosterone circulates in blood as free testosterone (FT) but this fraction exhibits the most potent biological activity [46] . However, both FT and albuminbound testosterone are readily available for peripheral tissues, com prising socalled bioavailable testosterone (BT) fraction [46] . Testosterone and its derivative, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is the most biologically active androgen synthesized from testosterone by 5areductase, exert their effects on peripheral tissues by interacting with the androgen recep tor. Some biological effects of testosterone are a result of its aromatisation to oestradiol and subsequent interaction with the oestrogen receptor [47, 48] .\nThe preferred method for measuring total testosterone (TT) is extraction and chromatography followed by mass spectrometry, although immunoenzymatic methods, including ELISA, are routinely used [49] . The gold standard laboratory method for FT level determination is equilibrium dialysis [50, 51] . However, this method is expensive and timeconsuming, which significantly reduces its routine use outside specialised laboratories [51] . Blood FT pool may also be estimated (esti mated FT [eFT]) using a formula proposed by Vermeulen et al. [51] , based on blood TT, SHBG, and albumin levels (a sample calculator is available online at http://www.issam.ch/freetesto. htm). Use of this formula has been approved in the current guidelines of the Endocrine Society on testosterone treatment in men with androgen deficiency, although experts have indi cated that the reliability of eFT largely depends on the quality of TT and SHBG assays [52] . Of note, FT estimates have been used in large population studies on male hypogonadism [53] . For the evaluation of BT, the level of this fraction is measured by ammonium sulfate precipitation, or estimated using the formula of Vermeulen et al. [51, 52] .\nA gradual agerelated decrease in circulating testoste rone by about 1% per year begins in men in the third decade of life [46] . In the populationbased Massachusetts Male Aging Study (MMAS) [54] including 1709 men (age at baseline: 40-70 years; duration of followup: 7-10 years), it has been shown using continuous models that TT, FT, and albuminbound testosterone decreases with age in men by 1.6%, 2.8%, and 2.5% per year, respectively. This agerelated decrease in testosterone level was significantly higher com pared to that found in crosssectional analyses (at baseline, by 0.3%, 1.0%, and 0.9% per year, respectively) [54] . The authors suggested that this may indicate an effect of other factors (e.g., coexisting diseases) on acceleration of agerelated decrease in circulating testosterone level [54] . In the MMAS study [54] , an increase in serum SHBG level by 1.3% per year was also noted in continuous models (a value comparable to estimates in crosssectional analyses), which implicates a need for comprehensive evaluation of blood testosterone level in the clinical practice, i.e. taking into account its fractions and not only TT (although TT may be within normal levels, FT and BT may reduced due to agerelated changes in SHBG level) [46] . In another study in 890 men, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) [55] , an agerelated decrease in TT level was also noted, along with low serum TT levels (defined as < 11.3 nmol/L) found in 12%, 19%, 28% and 49% of men aged 50-59, 60-69, 70-79 and \u2265 80 years, respectively."}, {"section_title": "DEFINITION OF TESTOSTERONE DEFICIENCY", "text": "There are controversies regarding the exact laboratory defini tion of testosterone deficiency in the general male population. In general, 2 methodological approaches have been used to determine the cutoff value of low TT level. Some experts believe [52, [56] [57] [58] that in all adult men regardless of age, a fixed cutoff value of decreased TT level should be deter mined based on, e.g., a specified percentile (2. in young healthy men. Such a definition was used in the BLSA study [55] , in which hypogonadal TT level was defined in all men as < 2.5 th percentile in the 21-45 years age group in the same study, i.e. < 11.3 nmol/L (to convert for ng/mL, a value in nmol/L should be divided by 3.467, which in this case gives < 3.26 ng/mL). A deficiency of FT may also be calculated using the same approach. An alternative methodological ap proach is based on the assumption that values defining TT and FT deficiency should be defined for specific age groups (e.g. decades) separately, e.g., as < 2.5 th percentile among healthy men of the same age [59] . Undoubtedly, an advantage of the latter approach is the fact that it takes into account physiologi cal, agerelated decrease in blood testosterone level. From the clinical point of view, androgen deficiency syndrome has been defined in the current guidelines of the Endocrine Society as a constellation of specific signs and symptoms accompanied by low serum testosterone level. [52] . A detailed list of signs and symptoms suggesting androgen deficiency in men (ca tegorised as more or less specific) has been included in these guidelines [52] . Determination of TT level is clearly indicated when more specific signs are present including abnormalities of sexual development, sexual dysfunction, gynaecomastia, small testicular size, infertility, and lowenergy fractures [52] . Experts also suggest consideration of TT level measurements in patients with less specific symptoms, such as attention and sleep problems, depressive mood etc. [52] . For initial evalua tion, morning TT level should be determined, with repeated measurements to confirm the diagnosis [49, 52] . According to the expert panel of the Endocrine Society, the cutoff value for decreased TT level should be defined as the lower limit of normal values among healthy young men in a given laboratory [52] . At the same time, determination of FT and/or BT level has been recommended in the guidelines when the measured TT level is difficult to interpret (e.g., close to the lower limit of the reference range), concomitant conditions are present (e.g., obesity, diabetes, thyroid dysfunction), or the patient is treated with drugs potentially affecting SHBG level (e.g., anticonvulsants, glucocorticosteroids) [52] ."}, {"section_title": "TESTOSTERONE AND THE CVS, METABOLISM", "text": "AND INFLAMMATORY PROCESSES Testosterone, enzymes that metabolise testosterone, and androgen receptors are present in CVS structures including cardiomyocytes [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] . Similarly to metabolic processes that occur in testes, skin, and skeletal muscle, testosterone in the heart may also be reduced to DHT [65] [66] [67] and aromatised to oestradiol [42] . Also similarly to other tissues, both DHT and testosterone exert biological effects in cardiomyocytes through an interaction with androgen receptors [67] , and testosteronederived oestradiol through an interaction with oestrogen receptors [42] . It was shown that steroid hormones act in the CVS and nervous system not only via the classical genomic mechanism but also through interactions with cyto plasmic and membrane structures, leading to changes in the spatial configuration of membrane channels and modulation of cellular signalling [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] . Multiple experimental studies showed a major importance of testosterone for normal CVS functioning [74] . Changes seen in surgically or pharmaco logically castrated male rodents include smaller heart mass [75] , systolic and diastolic dysfunction [75, 76] , changes in proportions between different types of myosin heavy chains (MHC) in cardiomyocytes, with an increase in MHCb and a decrease in MHCa [77] , and a decrease in the amount of mRNA for androgen receptors, Na + /Ca 2+ ion channels, L type calcium channels, and b 1 adrenergic receptors in cardiomyo cytes [78, 79] . Most aforementioned disturbances normalise following testosterone supplementation [76] [77] [78] [79] . Testosterone also modulates electrical activity of the myocardium [80] , e.g. through an effect on membrane Ca 2+ and K + channels that was shown experimentally [81] [82] [83] . This steroid also has vasodilating properties in the CVS, both in the systemic and pulmonary arterial beds [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] .\nSome evidence indicates that testosterone may prevent or reverse pathological myocardial remodelling in experimental models [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] , although this was not confirmed by some authors [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] . A potential beneficial effect of testosterone on the myocardium may be related to its antiinflammatory [102] and antioxidant [103] properties. Administration of testosterone and DHT to healthy male rats decreases interleu kin6 level in the myocardium [102] , while castration reduces myocardial activity of superoxide dysmutase (an important element of cellular antioxidative system [103] ) and activates matrix metalloproteases [104] . In addition, a protective ef fect of testosterone on the myocardium was shown in an experimental model of ischaemia and reperfusion [93, 95, 96] ."}, {"section_title": "TESTOSTERONE DEFICIENCY IN MEN WITH HF: PREVALENCE, PATHOMECHANISM, AND CLINICAL AND PROGNOSTIC IMPLICATIONS", "text": "Testosterone has a major effect on the overall mental and physical wellbeing of men during the whole ontogenetic pro cess [42, 43] , and its deficiency is associated with a number of adverse clinical and prognostic consequences which are sum marised in Figure 1 . Evidence from clinical and experimental studies indicates a significant relationship between testoster one deficiency in men and incidence and/or progression of cardiovascular disease [105] . An initial report on hormonal disturbances in men with HF was published in 1979 [106] . Tappler and Katz [106] showed that low testosterone level cor related with decreased cardiac output, and digoxin treatment improved both haemodynamic parameters and circulating tes tosterone level. However, subsequent studies in small groups of HF patients yielded divergent results. Anker et al. [37, 107] did not confirm TT deficiency in men with HF, while Konto leon et al. [108] showed that FT level in 23 men with dilated cardiomyopathy (mean age 51 \u00b1 9 years) was significantly lower compared to healthy men of the same age. Interesting results were also reported by Noirhomme et al. [109] who showed that mechanical circulatory support in patients with severe HF not only improved haemodynamic parameters but also normalised blood testosterone level.\nIn 2006, we reported a large study on deficiencies of anabolic hormones including testosterone in an unselected group of 208 men with stable systolic HF [35] . TT and eFT levels (the latter estimated using the formula by Vermeulen et al. [51] ) were compared with a reference group of 366 healthy men inhabiting the same area [35] . TT and eFT deficiency (defined as blood levels \u2264 10 th percentile in a population of healthy men of the same age) was found in 39%, 17%, 13%, and 27% (TT), and 62%, 22%, 17%, and 36% (eFT) of men with HF aged \u2264 45, 46-55, 56-65, and \u2265 66 years, respectively [35] . Most recent data from our centre indicate that in a group of 382 men with systolic HF treated according to the current standards, TT and eFT deficiency (defined as blood levels \u2264 10 th percentile in a population of healthy men of the same age) was found in 23% and 30% of men with HF aged < 60 years, and 23% and 34% of men aged \u2265 60 years, respectively [110] . Similar rates of testosterone deficiency in HF were reported by other authors [111] . In a group of 175 men with systolic HF aged \u2265 60 years, TT and eFT defi ciency (defined as levels < 10 th percentile in healthy peers) was found in 22% and 27% of patients, respectively [111] . G\u00fcder et al. [112] found TT and eFT deficiency (defined based on the lower reference limit in a local laboratory: TT -1.8 ng/mL in the age group > 50 years and 2.6 ng/mL in the age group \u2264 50 years, eFT -90 pg/mL) in 9% and 79%, respectively, of 191 men with HF (including 96 with systolic HF) in an average age of 64 years.\nAbnormalities of the gonadal anabolic axis may be re lated to damage involving the central nervous system (CNS) [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] , the anterior lobe of the hypothalamus [113] [114] [115] 118] or the Leydig cells [113, 114] . The pathogenesis of testosterone deficiency in men with HF is unclear. The mechanism of reduced secretion of this androgen in HF has been postulated to be similar to the mechanism that operates during aging. Increased systemic inflammation is believed to be the major cause of agerelated impairment of gonadal steroidogenesis. Macrophages play a major role in matura tion of the Leydig cells and regulation of their function [119, 120] but their activation also results in release of proinflam matory cytokines (tumour necrosis factora, interleukin1) and free oxygen radicals which inhibit enzymes involved in steroidogenesis [119] . Through this mechanism, excessive macrophage activation along with local gonadal increase in inflammation leads to inhibition of androgen synthesis [119] [120] [121] . In this context, increased inflammation, which is the important pathogenetic component of HF [122] , may significantly contribute to gonadal dysfunction in men with this cardiac disease. It has also been believed that a com mon mechanism of impaired gonadal steroidogenesis in both aging and HF may be progressive insulin resistance which impairs endocrine activity of the Leydig cells [123] [124] [125] . Testosterone deficiency in HF may also be secondary to the cardiac disease. One pathogenetic theory holds that myo cardial damage leads to reflex activation of inflammatory processes in the autonomic CNS centres (socalled microglial neuroinflammation) which result in impaired autonomic ba lance [126] . As the Leydig cells are linked to these centres via autonomic nervous fibres, inflammation in the CNS may result in impaired gonadal steroidogenesis [126] . It cannot also be excluded that testosterone deficiency in HF is related to the use of specific medications (e.g. spironolactone has an antiandrogenic effect [127] ) or comorbidities that potentially lead to secondary hypogonadism (e.g. obesity and diabetes [43] ), although these hypotheses are only partially supported by our results [110] .\nTestosterone deficiency in men with HF is associated with a number of adverse clinical consequences that are summarised in Figure 2 . Hypotestosteronaemia is also as sociated with the severity of cardiac disease. Low TT level was found to correlate with higher severity of HF symptoms (higher New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class [35] ) and neurohormonal activation (higher level of Nterminal proB type natriuretic peptide [NTproBNP] [111] ), and worse renal function (lower estimated glomerular filtration rate [35] ). Associations were also shown between low eFT level and higher NYHA class [35, 112, 110] , higher NTproBNP level [111, 112] , impaired renal function [35] , and higher degree of inflammation (higher level of Creactive protein [112] ). However, an association between low testosterone level and longterm mortality in men with HF remains unclear. In three published large crosssectional studies that overall included 574 men with HF, in univariate analyses both TT and eFT deficiency were found to be adverse longterm prognostic fac tors in this group of patients [35, 111, 112] . When additional Figure 1 . Adverse clinical and prognostic consequences of testosterone deficiency in men; ANS -autonomic nervous system; references: 1 [139] [140] [141] [142] [172, 173] , 12 [174, 175] , 13 [176, 177] clinical prognostic factors were also included, however, results became less evident [35, 111, 112] and in only one of these studies (in 208 men with systolic HF, median age 63 years, 3year followup [35] ) low TT and eFT levels were shown to be independent adverse prognosticators. Of note, HF is also associated with other disturbances than involving the gonadal anabolic axis. If disturbances of the adrenal axis (dehydroe piandrosterone sulfate deficiency) and the somatotropin axis (insulinlike growth factor 1 deficiency) are also included in survival analyses, a relation is noted between an increasing number of disturbed anabolic axes in men with systolic HF and increasing longterm mortality [35] . In addition, low eFT level in men referred for coronary angiography predicted increased mortality due to HF during longterm followup (median duration 7.7 years) in the German LURIC study [128] ."}, {"section_title": "TESTOSTERONE TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE", "text": "Evidence of effectiveness and safety of testosterone treatment in patients with HF is limited, and in most studies testosterone was administered regardless of the baseline hormonal status of the patients [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] (except for the study by Stout et al. [133] which included patients with systolic HF, low TT level, and symptoms of hypogonadism). Thus, these studies dealt not with androgen supplementation but rather with testoster one treatment in men with HF. Table 1 summarises results of at least singleblind randomised controlled trials (RCT) with a placebo control group that evaluated testosterone therapy in men with systolic HF. In a metaanalysis of four RCTs [131, 132, 134, 137] on the effect of testosterone therapy on ex ercise tolerance in patients with systolic HF (n = 198; 84% of men, mean age 67 years) that was published in 2012 by Toma et al. [136] , therapy with this androgen (a suspension of testosterone esters or longacting testosterone undecanoate administered intramuscularly and transcutaneous systems, treatment duration ranging from 12 weeks to 12 months) was associated with a significant improvement in exercise tolerance (measured by the 6min walking test or incremental shuttle walking test or peak oxygen consumption [peakVO 2 ]) [131, 132, 134, 136, 137] . Among studies included in the metaanalysis, particularly interesting findings were reported by Caminiti et al. [134] . These authors showed that testoster one treatment resulted in a better improvement of exercise tole rance (measured by peakVO 2 ) in men with HF and low baseline testosterone level (< 12 nmol/L [< 3.46 ng/mL]) compared to men with normal testosterone level at baseline [134] . Toma et al. [136] also evaluated safety of testosterone treatment and showed similar incidence of adverse cardio vascular events in the testosterone and placebo groups. In addition, no increase in prostatespecific antigen (PSA) level following hormonal treatment was noted in either of the three studies performed in men [131, 132, 134] (the fourth study included 32 women with HF [137] ). However, no large RCT has been performed yet that would clearly prove longterm benefits and safety of testosterone treatment in men with HF and low baseline testosterone level [17] , and this therapy has not been included in the current ESC guidelines on the diagno sis and treatment of acute and chronic HF [138] . In addition, poorly controlled HF has been listed as a contraindication for testosterone administration in the Endocrine Society guide lines [52] . Other conditions in which testosterone therapy should not be used include metastatic prostate cancer, breast cancer, some unevaluated prostate lesions, lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia, PSA level > 4 ng/mL (> 3 ng/mL in patients at high risk of prostate cancer), and haematocrit > 50% [52] .
