[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System (APES) is the second largest estuarine system within the mainland of the United States and is estimated to have lost about half of its submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) over the past several decades. The issue of herbicide runoff and subsequent toxic effects to SAV is important because of the extensive agricultural production that occurs in the APES region. The aim of this study was to conduct a retrospective analysis of herbicide influx to waters of the APES region during the time period of documented SAV declines and to compare the measured concentrations to SAV toxicity thresholds and changes in agricultural land use. Surface water grab samples were collected at 26 sites in the APES region during May through July 2000. The most consistently measured herbicides were alachlor, atrazine, and metolachlor with geometric mean concentrations ranging from 29 to 2463 ng/L for alachlor, 14 to 7171 ng/L for atrazine, and 17 to 5866 ng/L for metolachlor. Concentrations of alachlor, atrazine, and metolachlor measured in water samples from the APES region in 2000 exceeded several of the established benchmarks, standards, or guidelines for protection of aquatic plants. Although this evaluation was of point-in-time herbicide samples (year 2000) and not analyzed for all possible herbicides used at the time, they were taken during the period of SAV declines, reveal the plausibility of exposure risk to SAV, and suggest that herbicide runoff should be studied along with other variables that influence SAV growth and distribution in future studies."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds are the two primary water bodies that comprise the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System (APES).

One additional herbicide (pendimethalin) not shown in Figure 2 was measured in surface water samples from the 26 sites in the APES region in 2000 (Table S1 ), and one additional herbicide metabolite (cyanazine-amide) was measured in surface water samples from the large commercial farm in Beaufort County.\nconcentrations for the predominant herbicides among locations ranged from 29 to 2463 ng/L for alachlor, 14 to 7171 ng/L for atrazine, and 17 to 5866 ng/L for metolachlor. The maximum concentrations of these three herbicides measured during any single sampling period were 6100 ng/L for alachlor, 41,000 ng/L for atrazine, and 82,000 ng/L for metolachlor. The maximum concentrations for these herbicides were all measured in the Tar River tributaries.

In evaluating potential herbicide transport and measurement in relation to timing of application, the water samples taken over time from the ditches near the Beaufort County farm showed that atrazine, used as a pre-emergent herbicide on corn, demonstrated peak concentrations of 1050 to 1600 ng/L in the April-May period after its spring application around mid-March. Likewise, its main metabolite, atrazine-desethyl, exhibited a similar pattern, but in lesser concentrations ( Figure 3) . Concentrations of cyanazine, used as a post-emergent herbicide on corn and cotton, and its major metabolite, cyanazine-amide, peaked later in the season (July-August) than atrazine, and attained greater maximum sustained concentrations (3100-4600 ng/L for cyanazine, 510-790 ng/L for cyanazine-amide) compared to atrazine ( Figure 3 ). A comparison of spatial coverage of sampling locations among the Tar, Pamlico, and Pungo River drainages showed that the greatest concentrations of these herbicides were measured in the Tar River tributaries in the freshwater portion of the river (upstream of Washington, North Carolina) (Figure 2 ), as compared to the brackish Pamlico and Pungo Rivers.

That study measured atrazine in all samples from the five tidal areas and specifically identified the Chester River as having metolachlor in 100% of samples; this river also contained the maximum measured concentration of atrazine (820 ng/L). The McConnell et al. [24] study did not measure concentrations of alachlor. Among the 26 sampling sites in the APES in 2000, again, the maximum concentrations of atrazine and metolachlor were 41,000 ng/L and 82,000 ng/L, respectively. By comparison, in McConnell et al. [24] , the maximum concentration of atrazine was 820 ng/L as recorded in 2004 in the Chester River, while the maximum for metolachlor ethane sulfonic acid (MESA) was documented at 2900 ng/L in the Nanticoke River.\nAnother study in the Chesapeake Bay system conducted in 1996 showed that for Patuxent River Estuary water samples, atrazine was measured at all stations and, overall, was found in the highest concentrations (1290 ng/L) of all the target compounds [25] . While metolachlor was detected in their study at two upstream locations, the concentrations were typically below the limit of detection at downstream sites. Alachlor was found only at two upper river locations [25] .\nFor comparison, along the west coast of the U.S. in July of 1999 and 2000, the San Francisco Estuary Regional Monitoring Program (RMP) collected water samples during a study directed at the identification of previously unmonitored synthetic organic contaminants in the San Francisco Estuary. The pesticides detected included atrazine (81 ng/L) and metolachlor (89 ng/L), both of which were found in the Delta region, which is made up of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. Metolachlor was also measured at a concentration of 35 ng/L in the North Bay, which included the Petaluma River, San Pablo Bay, Napa River, and Grizzly Bay [26] .\nIn and around the year 2000, only the data evaluated here and the few studies just mentioned had measured the extent of pesticide contamination in the nation's estuaries. Prior to this time, the majority of studies in U.S. estuarine systems were largely focused on organochlorine pesticides. In the APES region, prior to the analyses of McCarthy [15] , few studies had been performed to evaluate pesticide contamination; those that had been done were concentrated on the region known as the inner coastal plain of the APES [27] . The pesticide detection rates in the inner coastal plain from those studies were then among the highest nationally [28, 29] .\nThe congruent findings of our study and the other studies previously discussed from estuary systems around the U.S. during this time were supported by a USGS Scientific Investigations Report that summarized pesticide use trends in the U.S. from 1992 through 2010. It was found that by 2007 more than 1131 million pounds of pesticides were used for agricultural and nonagricultural uses, with periods of increase and decrease in agricultural uses throughout, but that the pesticides most commonly used in agricultural applications were the herbicides alachlor, atrazine, and metolachlor [30] .\nConcentrations of alachlor, atrazine, and metolachlor measured in surface water samples from the APES region in 2000 exceeded several of the established benchmarks, standards, or guidelines for protection of aquatic life. The measured concentrations of these chemicals did not, however, exceed benchmarks for fish and invertebrates. The presence of these compounds along with the exceedance of these benchmarks, especially the US EPA OPP Aquatic Life Benchmark of nonvascular and vascular plants for alachlor and atrazine, supports the plausibility for certain agriculturally applied herbicides to runoff and elicit toxic effects on SAV.\nMoreover, our findings relating herbicide transport and measurement in surface waters to the timing of application (Figure 3 ), demonstrate that herbicides are present in the water at relatively high concentrations at a time period (i.e., early spring) when young or immature SAV is actively growing and susceptibility to herbicide exposures may be greater (or different) than in mature plants.\nFor example, experimentally observed physiological effects of herbicides, including atrazine, on SAV include decreased relative growth rate and chlorophyll-a content, and differences in sensitivity to herbicides have been noted among SAV species [31] . Specifically, atrazine has been found to affect SAV root growth and node development [32] . Because its mechanism of action depends on light, however, atrazine is thought to have diminished toxicity in surface waters experiencing turbid conditions, as might likely be the case in waters receiving agricultural runoff [33] . Previous studies have suggested that atrazine does not cause considerable risk to aquatic plants, with established EC 50 values for growth and photosynthesis at 22 to 474 \u00b5g/L for SAV and algae; however, fast-growing SAV tends to be more sensitive to atrazine than slow-growing plants [34] . Also, as shown by our analysis, SAV can be exposed to multiple herbicides simultaneously. If a particular SAV species were sensitive to multiple herbicides present in the system, such as a class of herbicides like the triazines, which represented two of three predominant herbicides measured during collection of our data, the outcome could be detrimental to that species when considering combined or cumulative toxicities [34] .\nHerbicides have been previously implicated in the decline of SAV [35] . Aquatic plants have a relatively large exposure surface area and duration, particularly in stagnant or minimally flowing waters, and thus, their sensitivity to herbicides may be greater than those of certain terrestrial plants. Conversely, diluted herbicides in surface water runoff could be less toxic to aquatic plants than to terrestrial species [36] , although in tidally influenced waters, like many of those in the APES region, the transport and movement of herbicides with tidal action [37] may result in SAV being repeatedly exposed with pulses of herbicides.\nIn addition to herbicide toxicity, SAV decline in the APES and elsewhere may be attributed to other factors, including decreased light penetration due to sedimentation and excess phytoplankton growth related to nutrient enrichment [8, 10, 11] . While herbicides in surface waters may not affect healthy plants or animals, the presence of herbicides may adversely affect sensitive species already experiencing stressful conditions such as habitat degradation or poor water quality [38] . Dantin et al. [39] assessed the toxic effects of chemical stressors, including herbicides, on aquatic plants in the presence of excessive nutrients. Under experimental settings, the field-collected species of SAV were pre-treated to three nutrients (ammonium, nitrogen, and phosphorous) for 3 months and then exposed to 11 and 110 \u00b5g/L of atrazine for 96 h. By measuring the chlorophyll fluorescence activity, they found that nutrient pre-treatment increased the toxicity of atrazine. Even in the presence of low and ambient nutrient concentrations and average levels of atrazine, the electron transport rates were 48 to 59% less. They concluded that the presence of nutrients should be considered in risk assessments, especially in those involving phytotoxicants and non-target vascular plants [39] . Other variables implicated in SAV declines include diminished light penetration from harmful algal blooms and invasive plant species that shade or outcompete native species of SAV [10] , as well as rising sea levels that have led to increased salinity (saltwater intrusion) in certain areas and its associated shoreline transformation and increased depth resulting in unsuitable habitat [40] [41] [42] .\nOur assessment of the crops produced, changes in agricultural land use, herbicides applied, and the number of farms in the APES region showed that, although there were expected fluctuations, the percent of acres harvested in the 12 counties for corn and soybeans remained steady from 1997 to 2012, averaging 35% for corn and 48.5% for soybeans. In contrast, cotton averaged 16.5% with a significant increase from 13 to 23% from 1997 to 2002. For corn crops, alachlor and atrazine were typically used. Alachlor was also used for soybean and peanut crops, and the pre-emergent chloracetanilide herbicide metolachlor was regularly used on corn, cotton, and sorghum [12, 15] . Thus, changes in agricultural land use (i.e., specific crops grown), associated herbicide use on those crops, and measurements of herbicides in adjacent surface waters sometimes exceeding safety thresholds or guidelines are multiple lines of evidence of potential herbicide exposure and effects on SAV that were observed during this time period. In Beaufort and Hyde counties, where the percent of acres harvested for cotton rose sharply from 4 to 24% and from 6 to 23%, respectively, from 1997 to 2002 (Figures 4 and 5) , there would have been a concomitant increase in the use cotton herbicides (and potentially growth regulators and defoliants used in cotton production), which may have adversely affected SAV in the adjacent waters and specifically in Lake Mattamuskeet where few herbicide samples have been taken and analyzed [11] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Native SAV provides critical habitat (food and cover) for many waterfowl and fish species, and its loss may be influencing their population density, diversity, and distribution, as well as overall water quality through diminished ecosystem services [11, 42] . Many factors are known to influence the presence of SAV, and agricultural herbicide runoff and toxicity is among them. The potential adverse effects of herbicides have been a concern over the extended time period of SAV losses in the APES region, but targeted, in-depth studies addressing the topic have not been done.\nAlthough this evaluation was of point-in-time (year 2000) herbicide samples, which were not analyzed for all possible herbicides used at the time (e.g., glyphosate on genetically modified corn and soybeans), they were taken during the period of SAV declines, revealed the presence of potentially toxic concentrations in surface waters, and infer the plausibility of exposure risk to SAV. Moreover, new herbicide products may have been introduced to the market and used during this period of continuing declines in SAV in waters of the region, since the time our samples were analyzed. Therefore, we suggest that herbicide runoff should not be discounted in the historic and ongoing declines of SAV and should be studied along with other variables that influence SAV growth and distribution in future studies. Specifically, we recommend that targeted, hypothesis-driven laboratory and field research and monitoring are needed to further assess the relations between herbicide exposures and SAV decline in the APES, including in Lake Mattamuskeet, by incorporating the potential impacts of varying SAV species sensitivity, cumulative effects of herbicide mixtures, and influence of pre-existing natural or anthropogenic stressors such as climate change and nutrient enrichment.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at www.mdpi.com/2305-6304/5/3/21/s1, Table S1 , Herbicide concentrations (ug/L) measured in water samples collected from the 26 sites in the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuary System in 2000."}]
