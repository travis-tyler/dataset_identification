[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Nations with high intelligence (IQ) societies contribute most to the global income because they are more efficient and productive than those with low IQs. However, the difference in national average IQ has produced a large productivity gap between countries. In particular, global discrepancies in productivity growth owing to differences in IQ will further worsen the wealth inequality between rich and poor countries (Jones & Schneider, 2006; Lynn & Vanhanen, 2002 . Therefore, considering that IQ is the most significant human capital variable for economic growth, improving the national IQ of poor countries can be the best approach to reduce global inequality in wealth. It has been suggested that long-term increases in a population's IQ, known as the 'Flynn effect' (Flynn, 2009; Neisser, 1997) , are achievable, especially because the IQs of children are partially determined by environmental influences such as socioeconomic factors before they start school (Carlsson, Dahl, \u00d6ckert, & Rooth, 2015; Cunha & Heckman, 2007) . Cognitive development occurs mostly in childhood, and thus a person's lifetime IQ is strongly associated with socioeconomic factors experienced in childhood (Brinch & Galloway, 2012) , when children spend most of their time with family, under parental decisions and responsibility (Sclafani, 2004) .\nMost of the evidence in the literature suggests that three socioeconomic factors, namely, children's schooling, fertility rate (i.e., density of siblings), and children's health, are interrelated and have direct impacts on children's IQ at a population level (e.g., Aslund & Gronqvist, 2010; Black, Devereux, & Salvanes, 2007; Le Carret, Lafont, Letenneur, Dartigues, Mayo, & Fabrigoule, 2003) . On the other hand, some studies argue that parents' income and educational levels are antecedent factors that influence variation in IQ-associated socioeconomic factors (e.g., Bacharach & Baumeister, 1998; Johnson et al., 2007) . From this it can be understood that, in the long term, these socioeconomic factors are linked in a way through which a variable can indirectly determine children's IQ through the effects of other variables. However, the majority of previous studies on this subject have focused on individual, developed countries where cohort data are readily available for conducting longitudinal studies; thus, the least-developed countries have not been studied extensively.\nEven at the global scale, for example, the international data on children's cognitive skills, such as test scores in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) presented by the United Nations, are not available for most of the least-developed countries, especially those in Africa (OECD, 2016) . However, in this study, we suggest that the least-developed countries with low IQs Vanhanen, 2002, 2006; Meisenberg & Lynn, 2011) can learn from the global trend of socioeconomic development that has influenced the variation in IQ across the more developed countries over the past few decades. In particular, while the literature lacks a study examining the interactions among the five aforementioned socioeconomic factors and their impact on children's IQ at the global scale, it is more informative to concentrate on specific socioeconomic factors across countries rather than specific countries across many factors to provide useful models and lessons for most of the least-developed countries to emulate. For that reason, we investigated how these socioeconomic factors interact to influence variation in children's IQ. By determining the strength of the effect of each major socioeconomic factor on children's IQ, especially in the least-developed countries, the long-term increase in IQ can be modelled with an aim to reduce the productivity gap at the global scale."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Framework", "text": "Initially, the definition of intelligence (IQ) assumed that an individual's IQ or cognitive ability is innate and genetically determined; thus, it was assumed that IQ is fixed and stable over time. Nevertheless, it has become clear that an individual's IQ is not static, but is adaptable and sensitive to environmental influences (Perkins, 1996) . IQ is not entirely hereditary, but rather results from interactions between genes and environments that help shape cognitive skills, encompassing both genetic and acquired characters (Cunha & Heckman, 2007) . In this study, we consider two components of intelligence, namely, phenotypic intelligence, which is measured intelligence due to environmental factors, and genotypic intelligence, the genetic component of intelligence (Lynn & Harvey, 2008; Retherford & Sewell, 1998 Hanushek and Kimko (2000) and Hanushek and Woessmann (2012) have employed the international scholastic achievement test scores as a proxy for cognitive achievement and have used them to compare nations. These two studies averaged the test scores for two study subjects, mathematics and science, to construct a single value to measure the cognitive skills of each country, assuming that math and science abilities are the main elements of cognitive ability. On the other hand, well-known studies such as Mikk (2009), Lynn, Meisenberg, Mikk, and Williams (2007) , Lynn and Vanhanen (2012) , Rindermann and Thompson (2011), and Rindermann, Sailer, and Thompson (2009) averaged the values for reading achievement along with math and science tests scores to construct cross-country data on cognitive ability, acknowledging that reading literacy is an important element of human intelligence, as suggested by Carroll (1993, pp. 598-599) . 1 However, Rindermann (2007) reported that combining the math, science, and reading subtest scores of PISA does not lead to significant differences in results compared to using mathematics achievement alone, because the three subtests are heavily loaded with tests of general cognitive ability. Because of this, a high correlation (r > .90) reported between IQ and scholastic achievement scores has been interpreted to mean that these two variables may be measures of the same construct (Lynn, Meisenberg, Mikk, & Williams, 2007; Rindermann, 2007) . However, in the current study, we suggest that employing PISA test scores is more relevant than national average IQ (e.g., Lynn & Vanhanen, 2002 , 2012 because the test scores are obtained during a specific year for each country. This is essential to understand the effects of socioeconomic variables on children's cognitive ability during specific periods.\nPrevious studies have established that cognitive ability is significantly associated -at both individual and country levels-with socioeconomic indicators such as corruption, somatic health, income and productivity data, and self-employment rates among immigrants (Kuncel, Rose, Ejiogu, & Yang, 2014; Lynn & Vanhanen, 2012; Potrafke, 2012; Ram, 2007; S\u00f6rberg, Allebeck, & Hemmingsson, 2014; Vinogradov & Kolvereid, 2010) . For instance, For instance, Lynn and Vanhanen (2012, pp. 70-72, 76-77) matching when they work in groups (state or country). This results into a magnified effect of cognitive ability on income at a country level (Burhan, Sidek, Kurniawan, & Mohamad, 2015; Hanushek & Kimko, 2000; Jones, 2013; Jones, 2011; Jones & Schneider, 2010; Kremer, 1993) . The direction of the relationship between cognitive ability and socioeconomic factors is consistent across individuals and populations.\nIn this paper, first, we explore the economics, psychology, and sociology literature to identify important socioeconomic factors that influence children's level of cognitive ability.\nSecond, we employ a path analysis to empirically examine how these identified socioeconomic variables interact to influence cognitive ability, as described in Figure 1 . Based on the literature, we hypothesize that schooling has a direct impact on raising cognitive ability because formal education enriches the cognitive skills and knowledge of Child mortality (Brinch & Galloway, 2012; Cascio & Lewis, 2006; Falch & Massih, 2011; Glymour et al., 2008; Hansen, Heckman, & Mullen, 2004; Haworth, Daleb, & Plomin, 2008) . It has been observed that the impact of extra school days on cognitive skills is homogeneous across individuals with different school grade history and whose parents have different levels of education (e.g., Carlsson, Dahl, \u00d6ckert, & Rooth, 2015) . This partially supports previous findings that schooling is more significant than family background in determining academic performance across countries (e.g., Heyneman, 1976; Heyneman & Loxley, 1983; Hungi & Thuku, 2010 ).\nOther than schooling, studies have shown that children's health is an indispensable determinant of human capital across countries, in which health is a component that forms other types of human capital (Bleakley, 2010) . In particular, deprived health and nutrition during childhood will discourage schooling and hinder children's capacity to learn (Glewwe & Miguel, 2007; Sigman, Newman, Jansen, & Bwibo, 1989) . In recent decades, there have still been a large number of children with poor health in certain populations. In 1990, 12.4 million children below the age of 5 years died worldwide. This was reduced to 6.9 million in 2011 (UNICEF, 2012a) , in which about two-fifth of this mortality resulted from acute respiratory illnesses, diarrhea, and undernourishment (Black, Morris & Bryce, 2003) ; malaria and measles were also important causes (UNICEF, 2012b) . Studies have raised concern about the impact of early childhood health on future cognitive ability. For example, efficient cognitive functioning requires sufficient intake of nutrition because nutrients help the development of brain cells (Grantham-McGregor, Walker, Chang, & Powell, 1997) . Children who are malnourished or have low birth weights are more likely to score lower on IQ or academic tests, and consequently, may experience grade repetition and lower educational attainment (Behrman & Rosenzweig, 2004; Black, Devereux, & Salvanes, 2005a Currie & Stabile, 2003; Ding, Lehrer, Rosenquist, & Audrain-McGovern, 2009; Glewwe, Jacoby & King, 2001 ). This implies that government interventions such as medication endowment policies are essential to help raise the level of schooling and academic performance (Leslie & Jamison, 1990; Miguel & Kremer, 2004) .\nA universal finding in the literature related to family background and children's outcome is that adult fertility rate has negative impacts on children's intellectual, educational, and health outcomes (e.g., Aslund & Gronqvist, 2010; Black, Devereux & Salvanes, 2005a; Hatton & Martin, 2010; Rosenzweig & Zhang, 2009; Silles, 2010) . These impacts are associated with the quantity-quality trade-off theory of fertility, which states that an increasing number of children within a family will compel the parents to decrease human capital investments per child (e.g., Angrist, Lavy, & Schlosser, 2010; Becker & Lewis, 1973; Becker & Tomes, 1976; Kalemli-Ozcan, 2003; Rosenzweig & Zhang, 2009 ). On a larger scale, the theory states that due to technological progress within a society, returns to education have increased, and therefore, parents are more likely to invest heavily in the quality of their children. Regarding the relationship between fertility rate and children's outcome, psychology literature often employs two main theories, namely, confluence theory and the resource-dilution hypothesis. Confluence theory asserts that a child's cognitive ability is fashioned by the average intellectual skills in his or her family. In particular, parents possess much greater intellectual skills than children. Therefore, the arrival of newborn children with lower initial cognitive skills will reduce the family's average intellectual ability. As a result, families with a larger number of children will exhibit an intellectually 'immature' environment because of the larger ratio of individuals with lower absolute intelligence (Zajonc, 1976 (Zajonc, , 1983 (Zajonc, , 2001 Zajonc & Markus, 1975) . In contrast, the resourcedilution hypothesis claims that the growing dilution of parental resources in a large family is the grounds for why children with fewer siblings are more educated and healthier than those with larger sibship size (e.g. Anastasi, 1956; Blake, 1981 Blake, , 1985 Blake, , 1989 Downey, 2001; Steelman, Powell, Werum & Carter, 2002) . As the sibship size expands, the amount of parental income and other resources allocated to each child in the family shrinks. Rivalrous resources, for instance, money to be spent for better healthcare and education, will become diluted proportionately as the number of children in a family escalates (Downey, 1995; Jaeger, 2009; Steelman et al., 2002) . Therefore, a high fertility rate will directly and indirectly bring about poor outcomes regarding children's level of health, schooling, and cognitive ability.\nMoreover, the literature suggests that parents' educational attainment has a significant relationship with their children's level of cognitive ability. This is owing to the fact that a higher educational level in parents indicates a superior level of intelligence, which is then transmitted to children. For example, Black et al. (2005b) and Clouston, Kuh, Herd et al.\n(2012) suggested that parents' educational attainment is reflected by their own IQ, which is then passed on through their children. Therefore, one can find significantly positive correlations between parents' and children's educational attainment and income across populations (Dearden, Machin, & Reed, 1997; Hertz, 2007; Solon, 1999) . In addition, parents' education level may have indirect effects on children's IQ through its direct effects on fertility rate, children's health, and children's schooling. In particular, well-educated parents are more aware of the importance of formal schooling in enriching the intellectual capital of their children. Thus, they are more engaged in their children's schooling, while at the same time, they provide a mentally stimulating environment that favors the intergenerational transmission of human capital (Ann, 1993; Davis-Kean, 2005; De Fraja, Oliveira, & Zanchi, 2010; Mahamood et al., 2002; Neuman & Dickinson, 2002; Sclafani, 2004; Umek, Podlesek, & Fekonja, 2005) . Therefore, parents' educational level has a positive relationship with children's school enrollment (Dearden, Machin, & Reed, 1997; Hertz et al., 2007; Oreopoulos, Page, & Stevens, 2006; Solon, 1999) . Furthermore, more education improves parents' ability to acquire health knowledge, which helps them to learn about the prevention of diseases and to understand medical treatment instructions (National Science Foundation, 2000; Case, Fertig, & Paxson, 2005; Lakdawalla & Goldman, 2001; Goldman & Smith, 2002; William et al., 1998) . Therefore, well-educated parents have healthier children because they can provide their children with healthier lifestyles, such as better nourishment and a hygienic environment (Arya & Devi, 1991; Behrman & Deolalikar, 1988; Cutler & Lleras-Muney, 2008; Desai & Alva, 1998; Glewwe, 1999; Kunwar & Pillai, 2002; Lindeboom, Llena-Nozal & Van Der Klaauw, 2009; Lleras-Muney, 2005; Meara, 2001; Sive, Subotzky & Malan, 1993; Strauss & Thomas, 1998) . Finally, regarding the relationships between parents' education level and their children's education and health, more-educated parents tend to have higher incomes with which to afford the costs of schooling and health care for their children (Autor, Katz, Kearney, 2008; Case, Lubotsky, & Paxson, 2002; Ermisch, 2003; Ermisch & Pronzato, 2010) . Due to strong preferences for pursuing professional careers, highly educated parents tend to experience a delay in having children and to incur a greater opportunity cost of leaving high-income jobs for child rearing (Barro & Becker, 1988; Black, Devereux, & Salvanes, 2008; Fort, 2009; Handa, 2000; Livi-Baci, 1997; Monstad, Propper, & Salvanes, 2008; Montgomery & Trussell, 1986; Subbarao & Raney, 1995) . Therefore, highly educated parents often desire fewer children of the best quality, consistent with the quantity--quality trade-off theory of fertility (Becker & Lewis, 1973; Bongarts, 2003 Bongarts, , 2010 ."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Variables and Data", "text": "To examine the socioeconomic determinants of cognitive ability, we employed PISA test scores as a proxy for the cognitive ability of nations. The PISA is the largest ongoing international study of cognitive performance, and it is conducted on 15-year-old children.\nPISA scores are advantageous because the data are obtained during a specific year for each country, which is fundamental to understand the timing of the effects of socioeconomic variables on children's cognitive ability. In the present study, the data were retrieved from the OECD database (OECD, 2010 (OECD, , 2013 . For each country, the scores were then averaged for the years 2009 and 2012 for mathematics, reading, and science achievements. This produced a more stable value of cognitive skills for each country covered in this study. The PISA scores were employed instead of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) test scores because the former measures how much children can apply the science and mathematics skills they have learned in schools, rather than how much they had learned in their classrooms as applied in the TIMSS (Hutchison & Schagen, 2007) . Hence, PISA scores are the most comparable to standard IQ tests because they emphasize items that require connections between existing knowledge rather than simple recollection of facts.\nThe literature suggests that adult fertility rate has a significant influence on children's level of cognitive ability, health, and schooling outcomes. In particular, larger sibship size directly and indirectly slow down the cognitive development of children, as explained by confluence theory and the resource-dilution hypothesis. To measure this, we employed the total fertility rate of the population to represent children's sibship size. Considering that the PISA test was conducted on 15-year-old children during the years 2009 and 2012, we concluded that they were born in 1994 to 1997. Hence, we employed the total fertility rate (births per woman) averaged for the period 1994 to 1997. The data were obtained from the World Development Indicators (WDI) database (World Bank, 2013) .\nMoreover, children's health is an important factor influencing school enrollment and cognitive ability. To represent children's health status, we employed the under-five mortality rate, which is the probability per 1,000 that a newborn baby will die before reaching the age of 5 years. Early childhood health is very crucial for the development of brain cells and cognitive skills in children. Furthermore, deterioration of health in children will prevent them from attending school. Because the PISA's 2009 and 2012 candidates were born in 1994 to 1997, respectively, the data on under-five mortality rate were averaged for 8 years, from 1994\nto 2001. The data were obtained from the WDI database (World Bank, 2013) .\nOne of the foremost determinants of children's cognitive ability is the knowledge and skills they learn at school. In this paper, we employ the secondary school enrollment rate as a proxy for children's schooling. The data were obtained from the WDI database (World Bank, 2013), and were averaged for 10 years, from 2000 to 2009. There are several reasons why employing secondary school enrollment is better than primary or tertiary education enrollment rates when determining PISA scores. First, secondary education enrollment indicates the completion of primary education. Students are assumed to have learned basic literacy, numeracy, and cognitive skills in primary school. Second, students internationally take the PISA test when they are 15 years old, which is commonly accepted as the age of secondary school where more complex skills are taught. Therefore, there is no effect of tertiary education on the PISA scores.\nOther than children's schooling, parents' education level may have both direct and indirect effects on children's cognitive ability. To represent the parents' level of education, we employed the average number of years of education of adults (age\u226525) obtained from the Barro and Lee (2010) dataset. For each country, the values were averaged for the years 1970-1995. This variable is useful because it may reflect the direct intergenerational transmission of intelligence for parents and their children in the long term, since higher educational attainment among parents may indicate their higher cognitive ability (Black et al., 2005b; Clouston et al., 2012) .\nFinally, the literature suggests that household level of income may have indirect effects on children's cognitive ability through its effects on fertility, health, and schooling. A higher income may directly reduce the fertility rate because a rise in income may discourage parents from leaving the labor market for child rearing. Furthermore, the household level of income is influenced by parents' level of education. We suggest employing the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita as a proxy for household income. Considering that the oldest children in our study sample were born in 1994, and the youngest group took the PISA in 2012, we employed the GDP per capita (constant 2005 USD) averaged for 1994-2011. The data were obtained from the Penn World Table 7 .1 (Heston, Summers, & Aten, 2012) , which were then log-transformed because an increase in expenditure or wealth at lower levels would have been more important than at higher levels (Rindermann & Thompson, 2011) . Table 1 lists the countries included in this study, ranked by cognitive ability. "}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "text": "We conducted a path analysis using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to examine the interactions among socioeconomic variables and their effects on children's cognitive ability, as illustrated in Figure 1 . Amos 21.0 (SPSS, Inc) was used to conduct CFA on the relationships among parents' education level, household income, fertility rate, children's schooling, child mortality, and cognitive ability. Following Shrout and Bolger (2002) , we performed random sampling with replacement to generate 10,000 bootstrap samples from the original dataset (N = 55) to determine the significance of the mediating effects. With these bootstrap samples, the model was tested 10,000 times, which resulted in 10,000 estimates of path coefficients of the indirect effects. Indirect effects were considered to be statistically significant at the .05 level if the 95% confidence interval for these estimates did not contain 0 (Frazier et al., 2004; Preacher & Hayes, 2004; Shrout & Bolger, 2002) .

It was positively correlated with parents' education level, per capita income, and children's schooling, but negatively correlated with fertility rate and child mortality.

Figure 2 shows the results of path analysis. 2 We found that fertility rate, child mortality, and children's schooling had statistically significant effects on cognitive ability.\nFertility rate had a nonsignificant effect on children's schooling. Parents' education had a statistically significant effect on income, fertility rate, and children's schooling, but a 2 See Table A1 in Appendix A for details on the results. Tables 3 and 4 , respectively, show the indirect and total effects of variables in the model. 7 Most of the indirect and total effects were statistically significant at the p<.01 level.\nParents' education (\u03b2=.546) had the largest indirect effect on children's cognitive ability, followed by per capita income (\u03b2=.409), fertility rate (\u03b2=-.142), and child mortality (\u03b2=-.112). However, considering the total effect of each variable, we found that child mortality (\u03b2=-.560) and parents' education (\u03b2=.546) had the largest total effects on the cognitive ability of children. These were followed by the fertility rate (\u03b2=-.493), per capita income (\u03b2=.409), and children's schooling (\u03b2=.274). Therefore, the total effect of parents' education and child mortality on cognitive ability were two times larger than that of children's schooling. Table A3 in Appendix A for details on the results. Table A4 in Appendix A for details on the results."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In summary, the results showed that there are three socioeconomic factors that have statistically significant direct effects on children's cognitive ability: child mortality (\u03b2=-.45), total fertility rate (\u03b2=-.35), and children's school enrollment (\u03b2=.27). At a cross-country level, cognitive ability can be greatly improved by reducing child mortality. This is in line with the literature, which suggests that improving children's health in their early years has a very significant effect on boosting their cognitive abilities in the teenage years. Additionally, in the model, child mortality had the largest total effect (\u03b2=-.56) on cognitive ability. This finding is consistent with the literature, which indicates that high cognitive functioning requires excellent health in childhood especially for cognitive development (e.g., Currie & Stabile, 2003; Ding et al., 2009 ). Moreover, we verified that reducing the fertility rate has a statistically significant effect on increasing children's level of cognitive ability. This finding is in accordance with confluence theory, which claims that a decline in the expected number of children born in a given year will improve the total intellectual level of a family, thereby raising the aggregate IQ level per child (Zajonc, 2001; Zajonc & Markus, 1975) . Finally, a rise in school enrollment among children has a statistically significant effect on increasing their level of cognitive ability, although its direct effect is lower than that of child mortality and fertility rate. Schooling improves knowledge and cognitive skills in children through cognitively demanding activities that improve their working memory and executive functioning (Deary et al., 2004; Haworth et al., 2008; Whalley & Deary, 2001 ).\nReducing the fertility rate and raising the per capita income were found to have positive direct effects on children's health. This may occur through two mechanisms. First, a reduction in fertility rate may directly reduce child mortality (\u03b2=.25) by increasing the amount of health resources allocated to each child in a family, which is consistent with the resource-dilution hypothesis. These health resources include medications and treatments, as well as a healthy and sufficient food supply, which are essential for cognitive development (Downey, 2001; Steelman et al., 2002) . This explains why fertility rate has a large total effect (\u03b2=-.49) on cognitive ability. Second, a rise in income may reduce the rate of child mortality, with a very strong effect size (\u03b2=-.73). Consistent with the literature, we suggest that chronic diseases that require a higher proportion of household income to be spent on medical costs predominantly cause child mortality. Education may help parents to acquire knowledge on children's health, but their income is indispensable to reduce child mortality through the treatment of chronic diseases (Autor et al., 2008; Case et al., 2002; Lahema, Martikainen, Laaksonen, & Aittomaki, 2004) . On the other hand, parents' education level has statistically significant indirect effects on reducing child mortality because it significantly increases their level of income (\u03b2=.44) and reduces the fertility rate (\u03b2=.49). This explains why parents' education has the largest indirect effect (\u03b2=.55) on the cognitive ability of children.\nMoreover, the significant effect of parents' education level (\u03b2=.46) on children's schooling supports previous evidence that well-educated parents have positive attitudes towards children 's schooling (e.g., De Fraja et al., 2010; Umek et al., 2005) . However, child mortality rate has an adverse effect (\u03b2=-.41) on their schooling, thus showing that sick children are deprived of attending school (Bleakley, 2010; Case et al., 2005) . Controlling for the effects of parents' education level and child mortality, we did not find any significant direct effects of per capita income and fertility rate on children's schooling. These findings provide empirical support for the literature that suggests that household income has negligible effects on school enrollment decisions (e.g., Carneiro & Heckman, 2002; Chevalier & Lanot, 2002) , and that most of the total effect of parents' education level on children's schooling is direct and independent of income or the number of children in the household (Chevalier, 2004) .\nFinally, an increase in per capita income has a nonsignificant effect on reducing the fertility rate. It can be suggested that a rise in income may increase the opportunity cost of leaving the labor market for child rearing, as the two variables in our study were significantly correlated (r=-.32) at the 5% level. However, this effect was attenuated by a strong effect of parents' education level (\u03b2=-.49) on fertility rate. This finding, along with our findings on the significant effect of parents' education (\u03b2=.46) rather than income and fertility rate on children's level of schooling, suggest that parents' education level has the largest indirect effect (\u03b2=.55) on children's cognitive ability because well-educated parents provide their children with high-quality early-life environments that contribute to the development of cognitive skills.\nThe results of our path analysis showed that a reduction in child mortality has the largest total effect (\u03b2=-.56) on cognitive ability. Based on this finding, we recommend that government subsidies for children's healthcare should be a main concern, because health is an important factor that facilitates other types of human capital (Bleakley, 2010) .\nFurthermore, the exceptionally stronger effect of per capita income (\u03b2=-.73) than fertility rate (\u03b2=.25) on child mortality suggests that the government needs to put more effort into raising the income of the poor, so that all parents can afford healthcare for their children. In relation to this, it is important to ensure that domestic and foreign direct investments benefit not only the high-skilled industries but also create employment opportunities for the poor, especially those with low skills. Moreover, the credit market should be made more lenient to stimulate self-employment among the poor (Blanchflower & Oswald, 1998; Karlan & Zinman, 2008) .\nAltogether, increasing government healthcare subsidies, income, and the employment rate among the poor must be of high priority to improve children's health, especially because parents' educational level can only have an indirect effect in this process.\nReducing the fertility rate is very effective for improving children's health and cognitive ability. Modern societies should be educated about birth-control methods and the negative effects that high fertility rates have on children's cognitive abilities. Although governmental intervention may contribute to population control, it is important to realize that parents' educational level has a large direct effect (\u03b2=-.49) on the fertility rate. We suggest that parents' level of educational plays an essential role in shaping the future quality and well-being of children. In previous studies related to quality of life, for instance, highly educated parents were more likely to stick with birth-control methods (e.g., De Walque, 2007; Rosenzweig & Schultz, 1985 , 1989 Sedgh, Hussain, Bankole, & Singh, 2007) and provide their children with healthier lifestyles (e.g., Desai & Alva, 1998; Glewwe, 1999 , Lindeboom, Llena-Nozal & Van Der Klaauw, 2009 ). Additionally, well-educated parents also tend to send their children to school rather than to work (e.g., Hussain & Maskus, 2003;  that the educational level of parents may reflect their degree of awareness of children's quality of life, and those who are highly educated are more likely to focus on broad, longterm goals for their children. We suggest that the educational institution is a key element that contributes to societal quality of life, which then facilitates the transmission of desirable attitudes, values, knowledge, and skills to the next generation. In the short term, children's schooling has a modest direct impact (\u03b2=.27) on their cognitive ability, but in the long-term, when the children become parents, their educational background will result in a large total effect (\u03b2=.55) on the ability of the next generation, indirectly through the effects of fertility, household income, and children's schooling, as we have found in this study. Our study corroborates evidence that intergenerational transmission of human capital is more likely to occur through a stimulating environment provided by well-educated parents (Bj\u00f6rklund, Lindahl, & Plug, 2006; Johnson et al., 2007; Sacerdote, 2002; Umek, Podlesek, & Fekonja, 2005) . Therefore, as the basis of societal progress across generations, we suggest that formal education should not merely focus on attracting children to stay longer in school through an old-fashioned examination-oriented education system. Instead, educational institutions should be able to enhance children's understanding of the world they live in, and empower them to become active participants in the future transformation of their societies (United Nations, 2014).\nFinally, an interesting finding from our study is the fact that parents' education level does not have a direct impact on children's cognitive ability. This implies that an increase in the educational attainment of parents will not directly translate into higher cognitive skills of the population. Specifically, we suggest that if parents' educational attainment indicates their level of cognitive skills, we should have observed a statistically significant effect of parents' educational level on children's cognitive ability, owing to genetic transmission of intelligence from parents to children (Black, Devereux, & Salvanes, 2009; Bouchard, Lykken, McGue, Segal, & Tellegen, 1990; Krapohl & Plomin, 2016; Plomin & Deary, 2015) . Therefore, it is worth suggesting that education and health policies to improve the societal level of cognitive ability must be focused on children and implemented during the early stages of childhood.\nEducation in adulthood or late teenage years with extra effort may have a positive effect on cognitive skills, but is more difficult than that of early childhood (Brinch & Galloway, 2012; Cunha & Heckman, 2007) ."}, {"section_title": "28", "text": "Appendix A, Please note that not all the parameters are shown in Figure 2 . Since the direct effect of per capita income on children's schooling -highlighted in shading-had the largest pvalue (.972), we removed it from the path model. By doing so, we found that the direct effect of fertility rate on schooling was non-significant even at the 10% level, while the direct effect of child mortality on schooling become significant at the 1% level. Moreover, our bootstrap analysis indicate that the direct effect of child mortality on schooling (\u03b2=-.342; p=.120) was significant at the p<.01 level when the direct effects of fertility rate (\u03b2=-.187; p=.139) and per capita income (\u03b2=.011; p=.972) on schooling were removed from the path model. Therefore, we chose to maintain the direct effect of child mortality on children's schooling in the model. See Table A2 of Appendix A."}, {"section_title": "29", "text": "Appendix A, "}]
