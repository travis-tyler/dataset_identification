[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The black-white gap in achievement, as measured by performance on standardized tests, has received considerable attention from researchers in the past five years. Claude Steele's stereotype threat and disidentification mechanism is perhaps the most heralded of the new explanations for residual racial differences that persist after adjustments for social background are performed. Analyzing data from the National Education Longitudinal Study, we found qualified support for portions of the disidentification explanation. Black students' academic selfevaluations are more weakly associated with their measured academic performances, a difference that could stem from stereotype threat or a belief that the evaluations are racially biased.\nBut this discounting of performance evaluations does not seem to provoke a more complete disidentification with the schooling process or with academic achievement in general. The findings suggest that there is no clear path from being stereotyped to disidentifying, and in conclusion we discuss alternative explanations for why it may be so. "}, {"section_title": "", "text": "As is best exemplified by the widely read volume The Black-White Test Score Gap, edited by jencks and Phillips (1998), sociologists have recently focused attention on differences in test scores as an important source of racial inequality in educational attainment and earnings. While racial differences in test scores have narrowed substantially over the past few decades, a sizable gap remains (Hedges and Nowell 1998), even after adjustments for family background are made. Recent attempts to explain this gap have focused on racial differences in parenting practices (Phillips et al. 1998 ), teachers' expectations (Ferguson 1998 . None of these explanations has proved sufficient for explaining the racial gap in achievement, particularly among students of middle and upper socioeconomic status (SES) who are not afflicted with the multiple disadvantages that affect many poor urban minority youths (Wilson 1987 (Wilson , 1995 Steele (1992 Steele ( , 1997 then contended that the piecemeal effects induced by stereotype threat are steadily amplified by black students' disidentification with educational success, a protective process through which the motivation to achieve declines because conceptions of overall self-worth are gradually separated from performance in school. In this article, we conditionally accept the psychological evidence on stereotype threat and instead focus our empirical examination on the disidentification portion of the explanation. The disidentification process unfolds over time, is not subject to a laboratory test, and is ripe for investigation with available national survey data. Moreover, the concept of disidentification has substantial theoretical utility for sociologists, since it parsimoniously links possible racial differences in achievement orientations to typically unobserved courses of individual behavior via a set of well-defined social psychological constructs with accepted measurement protocols. For both these reasons, the disidentification explanation deserves careful evaluation with the available survey data.\nThe article proceeds as follows. After we introduce the origins and details of the disidentification explanation, we derive three implications of the framework and evaluate them in an analysis of the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS, 1988 (NELS, to 1994 . The results we offer provide mixed support for the disidentification explanation, and we discuss alternative interpretations in the Conclusion."}, {"section_title": "THE DISIDENTIFICATION EXPLANATION", "text": "As initially delineated by Steele and his colleagues (Steele 1992, 1997; Steele and Aronson 1995), the disidentification explanation of racial differences in achievement is an extension of past research in social psychology on black-white differences in the relationship between self-esteem and educational achievement (Demo and Parker 1987; Porter and Washington 1979, 1993; Rosenberg 1979) . These earlier studies showed that (1) self-esteem and academic achievement are correlated among white students and among black students and (2) black students have levels of self-esteem that are at least as high as those of white students, even though black students, on average, do not perform as well in school. In an attempt to explain this apparent paradox, Rosenberg (1979: 267) drew on William James's principle of selective valuation and asserted that \"we not only seek to excel in those areas on which we have staked ourselves but we tend to stake ourselves on those areas in which we excel.\" According to this line of thinking, black students are able to maintain self-esteem, in spite of lower educational achievement, by selectively valuing performance in nonacademic domains (see also Hare and Castenell 1985) .\nThe disidentification explanation is another variant of James's principle of selective valuation, but one that is grounded on a more specific generative process. According to the core tenets of the explanation, black students from all levels of the socioeconomic spectrum are haunted by the specter of confirming stereotypes of inherent black inferiority. These threatening stereotypes interfere with their everyday educational performance in school, especially on important tests, because black students try too hard to avoid the low performance that \"makes the stereotype more plausible as a self-characterization in the eyes of others, and perhaps even in [their] own eyes\" (Steele and Aronson 1995:797 Over time, black students adapt to their predicament, and this adaptation results in disidentification. To maintain positive selfimages, they innoculate their global selfesteem against performance evaluations in schooling. In so doing, they disidentify with educational achievement in general to claim a psychic victory that preserves self-worth. Unfortunately, however, disidentification does not offer a costless victory because it undermines the motivation and commitment that are necessary for continued educational achievement. Thus, unlike stereotype threat, disidentification directly lowers motivation and an individual's own performance expectations, further depressing future achievement.\nWhat is the mechanism that links poor performance on tests (perhaps in response to stereotype threat) to full-blown disidentification with schooling? In reviewing the literature on stereotypes and social stigma, Crocker, Major, and Steele (1998) suggested that an intermediate psychological state develops in which students adopt coping strategies to reconcile their disappointment with their performance with their valuation of schooling. They stated:\n[One] way the stigmatized may deal with threats to personal and collective self-esteem posed by their predicaments is to psychologically disengage their self-esteem from their outcomes in a particular domain or context. When one disengages one's self-evaluation in a domain from one's outcomes in the domain, those outcomes become less relevant to one's self-esteem. We use the term disengagement to refer to the initial disconnecting of one's self-esteem from one's outcomes in a particular stigma-threatening situation-the first reaction. And we use the term disidentification to refer to the more chronic adaptationin response to the chronic threat of stigmatization in a domain-of dropping, or not taking on the domain as a personal identity, as a long-term basis of self-esteem. "}, {"section_title": "Disidentification and Oppositional Culture", "text": "Our evaluation of the disidentification explanation is relevant to the sociological debate on the tenability of the oppositional-culture explanation of Ogbu (1978 Ogbu ( , 2003 ; see also Fordham 1996; Fordham and Ogbu 1986 ). On the basis of ethnographic research, Ogbu posited that black students who strive for achievement in schooling are accused of acting white. These threatening social sanctions, which originate in a generalized rejection of white domination, paired with a survivalist reaffirmation of loyalty to one's marginalized group, constitute an oppositional culture that compels a disproportionate share of talented black youths to disavow performance in schooling.\nAs explanations for the black-white gap in achievement, the disidentification and oppositional-culture explanations identify some common proximate causes. For both, a general devaluation of achievement among black Beyond the Laboratory 85 8A students results in decreased motivation.\nWhere the perspectives differ is in the mechanism that generates this tendency toward devaluation. Steele and his colleagues argue that generalized stereotypes function as threats \"in the air\" that work their way into individuals' behavior through a mostly subconscious process; thus, devaluation emerges in the aggregate as a series of individual responses to pervasive stereotypes. In contrast, for Ogbu and his colleagues, the threats are genuine social sanctions that emerge in everyday interaction, and the responses among black students are self-consciously behavioral. Empirical support for Implications 2 and 3, which suggest that black students devalue achievement, could be regarded as support for the oppositional-culture explanation, as well as for the disidentification explanation. However, support for Implication 1 would not necessarily strengthen the case for the oppositional-culture explanation. An oppositional culture need not entail the discounting of performance evaluations, since the sanctions against acting white are driven by loyalty to one's marginalized group, rather than a rejection of performance evaluations as inherently unfair. Indeed, one could argue that such a pattern of evidence-in support of Implications 2 and 3 but against Implication 1-would favor the oppositional-culture explanation at the expense of the disidentification explanation, since devaluation without discounting is inconsistent with the disidentification explanation but not necessarily with the oppositional-culture explanation."}, {"section_title": "METHODOLOGY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The data for our analyses were drawn from the 1988-94 waves of the NELS, a two-stage stratified random sample of students nested within schools (U.S. Department of Education 1996). We selected white and black respondents who participated in all four waves of the study. These students were in the 8th grade in 1988 and if they stayed on track, would all have been in the 10th and 12th grades for the first and second follow-ups in 1990 and 1992. Because we chose not to include \"freshened students\"-additional respondents who were randomly selected from NELS schools in both 1990 and 1992 to allow for analyses of nationally representative cross-sectional samples of 10th graders in 1990 and 12th graders in 1992-our findings can be generalized only to the population of middle school students who were in the 8th grade in the continental United States in 1988. Including freshened students would have forsaken the panel nature of the sample, limiting the possibilities for longitudinal analyses. Table 1 presents the means and standard deviations of the variables used in the subsequent empirical analysis. For test scores, we used the base-year, first follow-up, and second follow-up item-response theory (IRT) estimated number-right scores for mathematics and reading (see Rock and Pollack 1995 for details of the IRT scaling). We combined the two tests by first rescaling the reading tests in each year using the 1988 mean and standard deviation of the mathematics test. We then took the average within year of the two component mathematics and reading tests (while imputing one from the other in the few cases in which only one score was available)."}, {"section_title": "Variables", "text": "For grade point average (GPA), we used the base-year and first follow-up self-reported grades. For the base-year self-reports, we took the mean response to four separate prompts for grades in English, mathematics, science, and social studies after we rescaled the response categories to a standard four-point GPA scale. For students who remained in school for the first follow-up, we used the same procedure to construct the 1990 grades. However, for students who took the dropout questionnaire for the first follow-up, only one question on grades was available (i.e., one covering all subjects), which presumably refers to grades they obtained just before they dropped out. The responses to this omnibus self-report of grades were likewise recoded to a standard four-point scale.

Academic self-concept is a standardized factor composite of responses (on four-point scales of agreement-disagreement, which were reverse coded when necessary) to the statements: \"I learn things quickly in English classes,\" \"Mathematics is one of my best subjects,\" \"English is one of my best subjects,\" \"I get good marks in English,\" \"I have always done well in mathematics,\" \"I'm hopeless in English classes,\" \"I get good marks in mathematics,\" and \"I do badly in tests of mathematics.\"7\nPeer relations self-concept is a standardized factor composite of responses (on four-point scales of agreement-disagreement, which were reverse coded when necessary) to the statements: \"I have good friends who are members of my own sex,\" \"I get a lot of attention from members of the opposite sex,\" \"I make friends easily with girls,\" \"I make friends easily with boys,\" \"I do not get along very well with girls,\" \"I do not get along very well with boys,\" \"It is difficult to make friends with members of my own sex,\" and \"I'm not very popular with members of the opposite sex.\"\nParental relations self-concept is a standardized factor composite of responses (on fourpoint scales of agreement-disagreement, which were reverse coded when necessary) to the statements: \"My parents treat me fairly,\" \"I do not like my parents very much,\" \"I get along well with my parents,\" \"My parents are usually unhappy or disappointed with what I do,\" and \"My parents treat me unfairly.\"\nFor SES, we used five separate variables: mother's education, father's education, mother's occupational prestige (1989 GSS scale; see Nakao and Treas 1992), father's occupational prestige (1989 GSS scale), and the natural logarithm of family income.8 For all these variables, we used data from the 1988 parent survey, supplemented, when data were missing, with responses to the 1988 student survey (including a set of best-subset regression imputations of family income from the roster of household possessions reported by the students). For all SES variables, we then used best-subset regression imputation of missing values before we entered them in the regression models.\nTwo off-track dummy variables were used that indicate whether or not, by 1990 and 1992, respectively, the respondents had fallen off the most common high school sequence of remaining in school and in the proper grade. All students who experienced at least one drop-out spell or who were held back a grade by 1990 received a 1 for the 1990 offtrack variable and likewise for the 1992 offtrack variable. By definition, any student who had gone off-track by 1990 was also coded as off-track in 1992, regardless of whether he or she was back on track."}, {"section_title": "Analytic Procedures", "text": "Since the NELS is a complex longitudinal study, some care must be taken in defining the sample, modeling missing data patterns, and estimating standard errors. We provide a sketch of our methodological decisions in this section. Further details are available from us on request.\nMissing Data and Sample Attrition We did not impute missing data for any of the variables that were central to our analysis-global self-esteem and the three dimensions of self-concept-since these variables often served as the dependent variables for our models. Likewise, we did not impute missing values for scores on the 1990 and 1992 achievement tests and GPA, since these are the crucial measures of achievement. Instead, we attempted explicitly to adjust for the unknown missing data mechanism, simultaneously modeling the more general sample attrition that masquerades as progressive rates of missing data for self-esteem and test scores in 1990 and 1992.\nTo model the missing data mechanism, we took the 9,954 black and white respondents who were in the panel data set from the 1988-94 NELS and for whom we had data on race, sex, and scores on achievement tests from the 8th grade in 1988. For this full base- Tables 1-4 were then estimated for the 6,326 cases, which we hereafter label the analysis sample. The models were weighted by the third follow-up panel weight (f3pnlwt, which adjusts for random subsampling across waves), multiplied by the estimated probability of being in the baseline sample but not in the analysis sample (which represents how we adjusted for sample attrition and missing data patterns). This procedure is thus an implementation of inverseprobability weighting with propensity scores, where individuals in the baseline sample who are the least likely to have been retained in the data are given proportionately more weight in the analysis sample on which the regression models are based.\nWe chose this analytic strategy for two main reasons. First, it allowed us to estimate models across a consistent set of respondents, enabling easy comparisons across time with cross-sectional models. Second, adjusting for attrition bias must be accomplished within an estimated model, and we chose to do so uniformly across a closely related class of models, relying on the reweighting justification of propensity scores. As a final check, we determined, through an analysis of broader samples (generally a higher number of respondents by 15 percent to 30 percent, depending on the year and on how item-specific missing data were or were not imputed), that the qualitative conclusions we derived in evaluating the three implications are unrelated to this analytic decision.

Accordingly, we first evaluate Implications 1 and 2 using only the 1990 data, assessing whether or not there are cross-sectional racial differences in the associations among academic achievement, academic self-concept, and global self-esteem. Fortunately, scores on global self-esteem and achievement tests are available in 1988, 1990, and 1992, and GPA is available in 1988 and 1990.

In Table 2 , we present models that test for racial differences in the net linear relationship between academic selfconcept and academic achievement. For three separate specifications of covariates, academic self-concept is regressed, successively, on standardized tests and then on cumulative GPA by 1990.\nConsider the coefficients reported in the first column. For this model, academic selfconcept in 1990 was regressed on (1) three dummy variables for race-sex group (one for white females, one for black males, and one Note: Coefficients for the test scores were multiplied by 10. Standard errors are in parentheses and were calculated with a modified Huber-White sandwich variance estimator, further adjusted for the clustered nature of the NELS sample.

The main effect for achievement, dardized test score (along with its interactions .629, suggests that for the reference category with the three race-sex dummy variables), of white males, a difference of 1 standard and (3) the five SES variables (along with their deviation in achievement in 1990 is associatinteractions with the three race-sex dummy ed with a .43 standard deviation increase in 409 (i.e., .629 -.220 ). An even more pronounced difference is found for females. For white females, the net linear relationship is .675 (i.e., .629 + .046), whereas for black females, it is .380 (i.e., .629 -.249). Apparently, either black students who perform relatively poorly in school are less likely to see their performance as a strong indication that they are less competent than their peers, or black students who perform relatively well in school are less likely to see their performance as a strong indication that they are more competent than their peers.\nFor a formal statistical test of these apparent racial differences, and hence for a direct evaluation of Implication 1, we constructed a linear composite of coefficients and tested the linear composite against a null hypothesis of a joint sex-specific uniformity across race. To be precise, the model estimated in the first column of Table 2 All six models reported in Table 2 reveal the same empirical pattern. Across students who are equivalent in family background, school-specific factors, and on-track status, there is a consistent racial difference in the estimated net linear relationship between academic self-concept and achievement. On average, this relationship is 30 percent to 40 percent weaker for black students. It may be surprising that there is little difference across the two measures of achievement, since students are presumably more aware of their relative GPA than of their relative scores on achievement tests. The simplest interpretation of this commonality of results is that both measures tap the same relative achievement ranking, which is plausible because the tests are designed to capture aptitude and learning in specific subject areas.9\nTaken together, the findings presented in Table 2 suggest to us that blacks discount, relative to whites, the relevance of past and present academic performance when they formulate beliefs about their own academic competence.10 Accordingly, we conclude that Implication 1 of the disidentification explanation is supported by the NELS data."}, {"section_title": "No Difference in Components of Self-esteem Does the apparent discounting of performance evaluations, revealed in the previous", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Beyond the Laboratory", "text": "Morgan and Mehta section, imply that blacks are substantially more disidentified with achievement than are whites? According to Crocker et al. (1998) , the discounting of performance evaluations should undermine black students' motivation to achieve by weakening the tie between academic and overall sense of self. If this conjecture is true, after having concluded that performance evaluations are unreliable (if not blatantly and systematically unfair), black students should shift their overall self-esteem away from their own academic self-concept and ground it more solidly in other domains, such as personal relationships with peers or parents.\nTo evaluate this conjecture, specified earlier as Implication 2, we regressed global selfesteem in 1990 on the same measure of academic self-concept that served as the dependent variable for the models reported in Table  2 . As is shown in the first column of Table 3 , after a covariance adjustment for differences in family background is made, there are no statistically significant racial differences in the substantial relationship between academic self-concept and global self-esteem. And as is shown in the second column, the addition of school-level fixed effects as proxies for all omitted school-level variables does not change the coefficients to any substantial degree. These basic patterns suggest that black students who have a relatively high regard for their own academic competence are no less likely than are white students to feel good, in general, about their overall sense of self. Likewise, black students who have a relatively low regard for their own academic competence are no less likely than are white students to feel bad, in general, about their overall sense of self. When peer and parental relations self-concepts are added to the covariate vector, as for the model reported in the third column, there is still no racial difference in the relationship between academic self-concept and selfesteem. Apparently, black students are no more likely than are white students to stake their self-esteem on their ability to make friends or to relate well to their parents. This finding stands in opposition to Rosenberg's theory of selective valuation as an explanation for how black students maintain self-esteem in spite of their relatively low school performance (see, e.g., Hare and Castenell 1985; Rosenberg 1979 ).\nFor the model reported in the fourth column, achievement tests, GPA, and an offtrack dummy variable are added to the covariate vector. The results are unchanged. And when prior self-esteem in the eighth grade is further adjusted for in the fifth column, no otherwise suppressed racial difference is revealed.\nThus, under the five different specifications reported in Table 3 , the results suggest that although there is a moderately strong positive association between academic self-concept and global self-esteem, there is no evidence that this relationship varies by race. If anything, the point estimates imply that the relationship between academic self-concept and global self-esteem is stronger for blacks than for whites, even though the p-values of the statistical test indicate that the null hypothesis of no racial difference cannot be rejected.11"}, {"section_title": "No Selective Valuation", "text": "We evaluate Implication 3 in the models reported in Table 4 , offering estimates of racial differences in the net linear relationship between achievement and global self-esteem over the first three waves of the NELS.

We then regressed global self-esteem on the alternative measure of achievement, the selfreported GPA that was available in 1988 and 1990 but not in 1992.

The models in the third columns of the panels for 1990 and 1992 reestimate the same net linear associations between global self-esteem and achievement; they include within the covariate vector the self-esteem variable from the immediately prior wave, along with dummy variables for ever having gone off track. Although these variables explain a good deal of the variance in self-esteem (i.e., raising the percentage of variance explained by 47 percent to 70 percent and substantially reducing the current-year coefficient esti- Table 4 provides support for Implication 3 of the disidentification explanation. There is no evidence that the association between global self-esteem and achievement varies meaningfully over race, over sex, or between the 8th and 12th grades. A few of the coefficients approach conventional levels of statistical significance, but, in general, there is no discernible pattern to the variation in the point estimates. As a consequence, none of the ttests indicates significant racial differences in support of implication 3.12\nGiven the care with which we handled the data and the robustness of these findings to a variety of specifications, we are confident that the NELS data do not support the selective-valuation component of the disidentification thesis, contra the results of Osborne (1995, 1997). As we mentioned earlier in the description of our variables, Osborne misrepresented his measure of GPA (see note 5) and used a weak adjustment for family background (see note 7).13 However, even when one takes the most charitable reading of Osborne's results, the racial difference, which Steele (1997:623) cited as supportive of the disidentification explanation, is present only for males.\nIn sum, we have presented three main empirical results in this section. First, when black students formulate self-evaluations of their own academic competence, they are less sensitive to external performance evaluations. Second, however, when black students select levels of global self-esteem, they are as likely as are white students to rely on their own evaluations of their academic competence. Third, when black students select levels of global self-esteem, they are as likely as whites to rely on their own academic performance. These findings support Implication 1 and contradict Implications 2 and 3 of the disidentification explanation."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Stereotype threat and disidentification provide an important new entry into the long-running debate over the causes of racial differences in achievement. Our findings suggest that there is support for a limited form of disidentification; across black students, there is a weaker relationship between academic self-concept and academic achievement. We interpret this weaker relationship as a sign that black students discount performance evaluations more than do their white peers. Although it is important to stress that this relationship is still positive for black students, it is about 30 percent to 40 percent weaker. Thus, while blacks do not completely reject the evaluations they receive, our models suggest that, on average, they are less likely to believe that these evaluations provide accurate information about their abilities. We cannot say exactly why this is so from our survey data. It is consistent with the claim that black students believe that the tests themselves are culturally biased (Chan 1997; Chan et al. 1997) . It is also consistent with the claim that black students feel stereotype anxiety when they take the tests and then intuit that the tests are poor measures of their own capacities (Steele 1997) .\nHowever, as best as we can tell, this discounting is not the first step down a slippery slope. White and black students similarly ground their overall self-esteem on academic performance at the three different points at which the NELS data enabled us to measure the relationship. Black students remain as fully identified with schooling as do white students, a finding that stands in clear opposition to the selective-valuation component of the disidentification explanation. And, as we discuss later, this finding is also consistent with other assessments of national survey data that have shown that the behavior of black students in school (i.e., absenteeism, homework time, and so on) is similar to that of white students after family background is adjusted for (Ainsworth-Darnell and Downey 1998; Cook and Ludwig 1997).\nWhy might black students discount performance evaluations but remain identified with achievement in school? One possibility is that the discounting of performance evaluations aids in the process of remaining identified with achievement, providing a buffer against the internalization of depressed achievement results. In this way, instead of allowing lower IA performance on tests to undermine the motivation to succeed, as disidentification theorists have suggested, the discounting of performance evaluations may provide a way to maintain motivation in the face of discouraging results.\nAnother (not mutually exclusive) possibility is that despite their wariness about performance evaluations, black students do not disidentify with schooling because of the variety of external reinforcements that make doing well in school important in both the present and future. Despite the fact that being overly academic has never been cool among any group of American students (Coleman 1961) , survey data have revealed that black and white high achievers are often well regarded by their classmates (Cook and Ludwig 1997), not to mention strongly prized by parents and teachers. School achievement is also the primary ticket to the educational credentialing that is needed for success in the postindustrial economy, and it may be that these realities press students to remain identified with academic achievement, even though they regard that achievement as a relatively poor indicator of their true capacities.\nIn either case, our results suggest that one should be cautious about extrapolating laboratory results about stereotype threat into a real-world argument about disidentification. Some students who experience stereotype threat may redouble their efforts on everyday schoolwork; others may turn away from schooling entirely. These reactions are conditional on a variety of external factors, such as the salience of achievement to an individual's other goals and societal expectations and requirements about performance in school. Without a more thorough understanding of these other factors, it would be naive to suggest that stereotype-threatened students necessarily move seamlessly into disidentification; our evidence suggests that, at least for black students in the academic domain, disidentification is not the likely outcome. After all, the most truly creative and hence particularly effective antischool behavior is, almost by definition, impossible for academic researchers to know in advance when they design survey instruments. The appeal of the disidentification explanation is that the relationship between global self-esteem and achievement should reflect the devaluing that these hard-to-measure antischool behaviors would more directly demarcate. Our negative judgment, at least on the selective-valuation component of the disidentification explanation, could be seen as yet more support for the case against the oppositional-culture explanation."}, {"section_title": "Implications of the", "text": "Again, however, discounting the relevance of performance evaluations may nonetheless represent, in the aggregate, a generic type of oppositional culture-one that takes the form of resistance to the school as an institution and yet does not break black students' beliefs in the importance of achievement or the desirability of pursuing schoolwork. Since this type of oppositional culture does not necessarily generate social sanctions against students who strive for academic achievement, it may serve as a buffer against the development of an even more destructive oppositional culture along the lines that Ogbu and others have argued already exists."}, {"section_title": "96", "text": "Morgan and Mehta"}, {"section_title": "I y", "text": "The reality of racial inequality in America, especially if Steele is correct that blacks are haunted daily by stereotypes, is that blacks face a stark choice. They can accept relatively depressed achievement results and conclude that their shortfalls in achievement are valid indicators that they are not cut out for postsecondary schooling. Or they can reject tests and grades, maintaining that their performance results do not reflect their true academic abilities. In this latter frame of mind, black students may remain disappointed by the shortfalls in their performance, even as they reject the evaluative criteria that delineate their underperformance. More important, however, they can remain committed to the pursuit of postsecondary education, with the hope that their true potential will be recognized in the future. 7. One reviewer noted that the statements \"Mathematics is one of my best subjects\" and \"English is one of my best subjects\" are not good measures of academic self-concept because they measure how well a student feels about his or her performance implicitly in comparison with other subjects. However, because the correlation between our eightitem scale and the six-item scale suggested by the reviewer is .977, the results are nearly identical, regardless of which scale we used. Thus, although we accept the reviewer's point, we decided to use Marsh's eight-item scale so that our results will be directly comparable to those of others in the literature.\n8.
