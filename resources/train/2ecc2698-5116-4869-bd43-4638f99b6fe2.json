[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)\nPurpose: In diffusion MRI (dMRI), fractional anisotropy derived from the single-tensor model (FA DTI ) is the most widely used metric to characterize white matter (WM) microarchitecture, despite known limitations in regions with crossing fibers. Due to time constraints when scanning patients in clinical settings, high angular resolution diffusion imaging acquisition protocols, often used to overcome these limitations, are still rare in clinical population studies. However, the tensor distribution function (TDF) may be used to model multiple underlying fibers by representing the diffusion profile as a probabilistic mixture of tensors. Methods: We compared the ability of standard FA DTI and TDF-derived FA (FA TDF ), calculated from a range of dMRI angular resolutions (41, 30, 15, and 7 gradient directions), to profile WM deficits in 251 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and to detect associations with 1) Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, 2) Clinical Dementia Rating scores, and 3) average hippocampal volume. Results: Across angular resolutions and statistical tests, FA TDF showed larger effect sizes than FA DTI , particularly in regions preferentially affected by Alzheimer's disease, and was less susceptible to crossing fiber anomalies. Conclusion: The TDF \"corrected\" form of FA may be a more sensitive and accurate alternative to the commonly used FA DTI , even in clinical quality dMRI data."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) is a variant of standard MRI that can measure the diffusion of water molecules in biological tissues, such as the brain. By characterizing the diffusion process at the voxel level, we can make tentative inferences about the underlying white matter (WM) microstructure and factors that affect it (1) . Since dMRI was developed, acquisition protocols have improved to increase angular, spatial, and spectral resolution. Multiple mathematical models have been developed to describe the diffusion process. One of the firstand still most popular-methods of summarizing diffusion properties in a specific voxel is the single tensor model (2) , commonly referred to as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (3) . This model is limited because it assumes diffusion is purely Gaussian; it can only model a single fiber population, with a single dominant orientation, at every voxel. It cannot resolve complex WM architecture, such as dispersing, crossing, or kissing fibers. Yet, at the current resolution of dMRI, between one third and two thirds of WM voxels contain fiber crossings (4, 5) . dMRI can also be used to evaluate disease-related gray matter (GM) abnormalities, where the microarchitecture is even more complex (6) . Nevertheless, the tensor-derived fractional anisotropy (FA DTI ) metric is still the most widely used scalar measure to characterize tissue microarchitecture. It is widely used in research studies of schizophrenia, depression, autism, HIV/AIDS, and other developmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) (7, 8) .\nIn recent years, many new models have been proposed to overcome limitations of the tensor model, including qball imaging and diffusion orientation distribution functions (ODFs) (9) , constrained spherical deconvolution (10) , diffusion spectrum MRI (11) , multicompartment models such as the \u00f4 \"ball and stick\"\u00f4 model (4) , and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) (12) . Due to the numerous types of biological, neuropsychiatric, and imaging data often acquired for clinical populations, time constraints are often placed on imaging protocols to reduce patient attrition or motion and ensure adequate sample sizes. This currently precludes state of the art models such as NODDI and those derived from diffusion spectrum MRI, which require extremely dense or multishell acquisitions, and may prevent the reliable reconstruction of many other higherorder diffusion models. However, the tensor distribution function (TDF), as proposed by Leow et al (13) , may still be feasible. The TDF is a probabilistic extension of a multitensor model that describes crossing fibers mathematically as an ensemble of Gaussian tensors. However, unlike other multicompartment models (4, 12, (14) (15) (16) in which one needs to specify in advance the total number of compartments in the tissue, the authors propose a continuous distribution of tensors, with a profile of \"weights\" or relative contributions estimated for tensors with a continuously varying range of shapes and sizes in the tensor space.\nThe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a large, longitudinal, multisite study of healthy elderly controls, individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and AD. The goal is to identify sensitive imaging biomarkers that can be used to track or predict changes in the brain, which is vital for drug trials to identify candidates for treatment and monitor effectiveness. In addition to the battery of cognitive tests, cerebrospinal fluid and blood tests, the ADNI collects several functional and structural MRI modalities, including T1-and T2weighted anatomical MRI, positron emission tomography, arterial spin labeling, resting state functional MRI, and dMRI. In such longitudinal studies, there is a real concern about patient attrition, especially in elderly individuals who may not be able to tolerate being confined to a scanner for long periods. In an effort to collect such a wide range of data types and maintain patient enrollment, time constraints are placed on possible dMRI protocols, including debates as to whether or not to continue acquiring dMRI in the next phase of the ADNI. Clearly it is of great interest to maximize the power of the available scans and show that even clinical quality diffusion scans can be powerful tools for uncovering disease-related abnormalities in tissue microstructure and WM neurocircuitry.\nThe goal of this study was to determine whether FA metrics derived using the TDF model (FA TDF ) may be more sensitive to disease-related differences than the corresponding FA DTI measure that is now widely used. Building on preliminary findings reported by Nir et al (17) , our goal was to understand how the imaging protocol may influence the sensitivity of the FA metrics, and further compared performance for each metric computed from subsamples of the full ADNI dMRI 41 gradient direction angular resolution, including subsets of 30, 15, and 7 gradient directions. Voxel-wise association tests were used to compare FA TDF and FA DTI metrics computed from a range of angular resolutions and their ability to detect microstructural differences between AD patients and healthy elderly controls. We also evaluated associations between the two FA metrics and common AD biomarkers-hippocampal volume and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores. Finally, we evaluated the test/retest reliability of each model's fit and the resulting scalar FA maps. In comparing models, there is interest in detecting clinical associations with maximal sensitivity and power, ideally using improved metrics, which measure standard properties more accurately."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects and Image Acquisition", "text": "Standard MRI, dMRI, and clinical data were downloaded from the publicly available ADNI database (www.loni. usc.edu/ADNI).

(20) to \"downsample\" the angular resolution from 41 gradient directions to include only a subset of either 30, 15, or 7 gradient images. Gradient subsets were selected by optimizing the spherical angular distribution energy. Briefly, the angular distribution energy, E ij , of a pair of points, i and j, on the unit sphere may be defined as the inverse of the sum of the squares of (1) the least spherical distance between point i and point j, and (2) the least spherical distance between point i and point j's antipodal, symmetric point J. As in previous work, we acknowledge that protocols with fewer gradients would be independently optimized for angular distribution rather than subsample directions from an existing protocol, but the subsampling we use is designed to lead to the most equally distributed sampling on the sphere possible. It also helps us to assess effects of gradient count while keeping other factors of the patient's scan constant (e.g., motion, artifacts)."}, {"section_title": "dMRI Reconstruction Models and Scalar Maps", "text": "For each angular resolution (41, 30, 15, or 7 gradient directions), three different dMRI reconstruction models were used to generate scalar FA maps. First, a single diffusion tensor (3)-equivalent to a 3D ellipsoid capturing a single fiber orientation-was modeled at each voxel in the brain from the corrected DWI scans. This model assumes that the diffusion is a 3D Gaussian process, fitted using just six independent parameters of a tensor (3 eigenvalues describing its shape, and 3 Euler angles describing its orientation). Scalar fractional anisotropy (FA DTI ) maps were obtained from the resulting diffusion tensor eigenvalues (l 1 , l 2 , l 3 ):\nIn contrast to the single tensor model, the tensor distribution function (TDF) represents the diffusion profile as a probabilistic mixture of tensors that optimally explain the observed DWI data, allowing for the reconstruction of multiple underlying fibers per voxel, together with a distribution of weights or probabilities. We applied the framework proposed by Leow et al. (13) and Zhan et al. (21) to the angular diffusion signal to compute the voxel-wise optimal TDF, P * (D(h, k))-the probability distribution function of all feasible Gaussian tensors D(h, k) that best describes the observed signal. As described by Leow et al., to reduce the solution space, each tensor D(h, k) at spherical angle u was assumed to be cylindrical such that l \u00bc (l 1 , l 2 \u00bc l 3 ) and l 1 ! l 2 . However, unlike the gradient descent approach used by Leow et al. to solve for this optimal TDF, we used a quadratic programming approach (see Appendix for details). The tensor orientation distribution function (TOD) was then calculated by computing the marginal density function of the TDF with the eigenvalues l \u00bc (l 1 , l 2 ) integrated out.\nFor each u, the eigenvalues are calculated by computing the expected value of each eigenvalue along u, from which a corresponding scalar FA metric is calculated:\nAt each voxel, the final scalar FA TDF metric across all u is then calculated as the sum of all FA(h) weighted by the probability that u is the principal fiber direction, TOD(h).\nA healthy control subject's FA DTI and FA TDF maps, calculated from various angular resolutions, are shown in Figure 1a and 1b for visual comparison. A voxel-wise, two-tailed, paired t test was performed to quantitatively compare TDF and DTI FA values in the healthy control group. All resulting statistical maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using the standard false discovery rate (FDR) method at q \u00bc 0.05 (22) and thresholded at the FDR critical P value. For comparison to an established high angular resolution diffusion imaging technique also designed to reconstruct multiple fiber orientations in a given voxel, we fitted ODFs at each voxel, with a nonparametric q-ball reconstruction technique, using the normalized and dimensionless constant solid angle (CSA) method (9, 23) . The generalized FA (GFA ODF ) was then calculated from the CSA-ODF. GFA ODF is analogous to FA DTI , but calculated at each diffusion direction of the ODF (9) and is defined as:\nHere, C(u) is the ODF, i is each diffusion direction, and C \u00bc 1 n P n i\u00bc1 C\u00f0u i \u00de is the mean of the ODF."}, {"section_title": "Template Creation and Spatial Normalization", "text": "To avoid bias in the diffusion-based registrations, we created a multichannel, study-specific minimal deformation template with the ANTs registration software (24), equally weighting FA DTI , FA TDF , GFA ODF and T1-weighted maps. Similarly, to spatially normalize each subject's three FA maps, we performed a three-channel linear then nonlinear registration to the minimal deformation template. In this way, all FA maps were used to drive the registration, and they were all normalized to the same space. To avoid differences in registration accuracy, the deformations from the full angular resolution registration were applied to the FA maps calculated from the various DWI gradient subsets for each individual. Test/retest FA DTI and FA TDF maps generated from baseline and 3-month follow-up dMRI scans were each linearly aligned to an intermediate space halfway between each subject's two time points (25) . Baseline and follow-up maps were each spatially normalized to the baseline minimal deformation template with twochannel linear then nonlinear registrations. The deformations from the full angular resolution registration were applied to the various test/retest DWI gradient subsets as well as the respective FA maps."}, {"section_title": "Clinical Associations and Effect Sizes", "text": "To test for statistical effects of AD diagnosis on measures of white matter microstructure-FA DTI , FA TDF , and GFA ODF maps calculated at various angular resolutionswe ran voxel-wise, random-effects linear regressions, covarying for age and sex, and using the acquisition site as the random grouping variable. In an effort to try and tease apart microstructural associations from those driven by atrophy and registration, for each voxel, we also covaried for the log Jacobian determinant derived from the nonlinear spatial normalization of each map to the template. In addition to AD diagnosis, we also tested for voxel-wise associations between FA and CDR-sob scores as well as average bilateral hippocampal volume (after covarying for intracranial volume) across the entire study sample. All statistical tests were limited to voxels present in all subject scans, as some scans had a slightly cropped field of view. As such, we did not consider the inferior parts of the cerebellum and brain stem. All resulting statistical maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using the standard FDR method at q \u00bc 0.05 (22) , and thresholded at the FDR critical P value. We show regression coefficients (b values) only in regions where the false discovery rate was controlled.\nWe computed cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots to visualize and rank effect sizes across voxel-wise tests. The sorted observed voxel P values from each regression were plotted against the P values from the expected null distribution. If the CDF curve initially rises at a rate steeper than 20 times the null CDF (y \u00bc 20x), then the corresponding maps have suprathreshold or FDR significant voxels at q \u00bc 0.05. Curves that rise at a steeper rate than that line represent significant voxels and larger deviations represent larger effect sizes.\nEffect sizes for detecting AD versus control group differences were also compared using Cohen's d calculated as (m AD \u00c0m CN )/s pooled , where s pooled \u00bc \u0371\u00bd\u00f0s 2 CN \u00fe s 2 AD \u00de=2 (26). This metric has been widely used in studies of disease effects on imaging measures (27) (28) (29) . For each FA metric and angular resolution, we used the average FA from the respective statistical test's significant cluster. To avoid overfitting, a 10-fold cross-validation approach was used. In each fold, 80% of the data were used for voxel-wise regressions to estimate the significant clusters (training data), and the remaining test data were used to compute the Cohen's d effect sizes.\nAs expected, across all of the FA metrics, AD diagnosis, greater cognitive impairment (higher CDR-sob score), and lower average hippocampal volume were associated with significant WM deficits (lower FA) after correction for multiple comparisons (Fig. 2a ). However, across statistical tests, larger effect sizes, as denoted by greater b value magnitude and more widespread differences, were detected with FA TDF voxel maps compared with FA DTI and GFA ODF . Moreover, FA TDF findings are highly localized to the temporal lobe and hippocampal regions most vulnerable to early changes in AD. CDF plots further reflect the increased sensitivity of FA TDF for differentiating disease groups, and for detecting clinical associations (Fig. 2b) .\nAcross maps, some very small regions exhibited significant associations with FA in a direction contrary to what would traditionally be accepted as showing impairment (i.e., higher FA with impairment; Fig. 2a , boxed regions). These regions were largely found at the junction of the corpus callosum commissural fibers and the corona radiata, a region notorious for fiber crossings that may reduce the FA, as computed from the tensor model (32) . However, across analyses, FA TDF showed fewer associations that were contrary to the hypothesized effects of the disease (Fig. 2c ). Relative to the total number of significant voxels, FA DTI showed between $13% and 15% of these voxels, GFA ODF showed between $8% and 10%, and FA TDF showed < 0.5% across tests, suggesting that FA TDF may be handling computations better for crossing fibers.\nA comparison of the same three clinical associations with FA DTI and FA TDF computed from a subset of 30, 15, and 7 gradient directions revealed that even at 7 gradient directions, FA TDF was consistently the most sensitive metric across statistical tests (Table 1, Fig. 3 ). In fact, FA TDF calculated from 7 gradient directions had larger effect sizes than FA DTI calculated at the full angular resolution. Across statistical tests performed at each angular "}, {"section_title": "Test/Retest Reliability and Model Fit", "text": "We Here, RMSE(M1,D2) is the RMSE between the data observed in the follow-up scan and predicted from the first scan, RMSE(M2,D1) is the RMSE between the observed data in the first scan and that predicted from the follow-up scan, and RMSE(D1,D2) is the RMSE between the observed data from both scans. A model that predicts the repeated measurement more accurately than the original will result in an rRMSE < 1 (30) . To compute RMSE (M1,D2), we used parameters learned from the first scan, and the bvecs (scanner gradient directions) and b 0 from the follow-up scan, and vice versa for RMSE(M2,D1). A voxel-wise two-tailed paired t test was performed to compare TDF and DTI baseline RMSE and rRMSE values in the healthy control group. All resulting statistical maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using the standard FDR method at q \u00bc 0.05 (22) ; resulting maps were thresholded at the FDR critical P value.\nWe also evaluated the test/retest reliability for FA DTI and FA TDF maps calculated from each angular resolution by computing the voxel-wise intraclass correlation (ICC) between baseline and 3-month follow-up healthy control FA maps, with the R PSYCH package (personality-project.org/r/html/ICC.html). Again, the FDR method was used to correct for multiple comparisons.\nMean maps of the RMSE calculated from the DTI and TDF model fit in the subset of 53 healthy control subjects are shown in Figure 4a and 4b. A voxel-wise t test revealed significantly lower error in the TDF fit throughout the tissue regardless of angular resolution ( Fig. 5a ; FDR critical P value for 41 gradients \u00bc 0.041, 30 gradients \u00bc 0.041, 15 gradients \u00bc 0.042, and 7 gradients \u00bc 0.043). The mean rRMSE maps from DTI and TDF models from 33 healthy control individuals at two time points are shown in Figure  4c and 4d. While the rRMSE was high in both the TDF and DTI models in the superior cortical gray matter (mean rRMSE > 1), the fit was stable ( < 1) in WM and overall temporal lobe regions where most of the AD-related effects were detected. A t test between the DTI and TDF rRMSE maps (Fig. 5b ) revealed significantly lower rRMSE for the TDF fit, in not only the temporal lobes, but in the region of the superior WM where commissural fibers and the corona radiata intersect, often leading to depleted FA DTI . The TDF model showed higher error only in cerebrospinal fluid. TDF rRMSE was progressively more similar to DTI (i.e., less area of significant differences) with lower angular resolution (FDR critical P value for 41 gradients \u00bc 0.024, 30 gradients \u00bc 0.021, 15 gradients \u00bc 0.017, and 7 gradients \u00bc 0.001).\nIn terms of test/retest reliability of the scalar FA maps, we found that across resolutions there was an overall stable and strong ICC between baseline and follow-up FA TDF maps (mean ICC $0.8; Fig. 5c ), whereas, as might be expected, there was a degradation in FA DTI ICC at the lowest angular resolutions (Fig. 5d )."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Both a visual comparison of FA DTI and FA TDF maps ( Fig.  1a and 1b) and t test between maps (Fig. 1c ) reveal that FA TDF maps have higher FA values not only in the core, coherent WM structures but throughout the tissue, including near GM/WM boundaries. The standard FA DTI measure tends to show loss of signal near cortical boundaries and in regions with known fiber crossings and complex gray matter architecture."}, {"section_title": "4.52% (72)", "text": "Comparison is based on the FDR critical P value and percent of voxels surviving FDR (22) for the full 41 gradients angular resolution and each of the 30, 15, and 7 gradient subsets, followed by the absolute number and percent of total significant voxels surviving FDR correction, showing an association direction opposite to that traditionally accepted as showing impairment (i.e., higher FA with increased deficits).\nresolution, FA TDF consistently showed less than 0.5% of significant voxels with a direction of association opposite to that hypothesized, compared with FA DTI which showed between $5% and 15% (Table 1) . Finally, the mean Cohen's d effect sizes for picking up AD versus control group differences-which were calculated using test data from the 10-fold cross-validation-once again confirmed that across all angular resolutions, FA TDF showed larger effect sizes ( Table 2) ."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "FA metrics derived from the tensor distribution function (TDF) may be more sensitive to disease-related microstructural abnormalities than corresponding single tensor-derived FA metrics that are now widely used to assess clinical data. FA is highly affected by numerous factors, including the number of dominant fiber directions and orientation coherence as well as partial volume effects from neighboring GM. By using the TDF approach, we can still employ an extension of the tensor model, adapted to identify contributions to FA from separate crossing fiber compartments in tissue with more complex microarchitecture and in voxels on tissue boundaries that are susceptible to partial voluming.\nAD is characterized by cortical and hippocampal neuronal loss and widespread GM atrophy driven in part by cortical amyloid plaque, neurofibrillary tangle deposits, and vascular changes. Structural and diffusion MRI studies show WM injury, perhaps due to myelin degeneration, and neuronal loss leading to progressive disconnection of cortical and subcortical regions (7, (33) (34) (35) (36) . Standard anatomical MRI is still the imaging technique most often used in AD studies and clinical trials, but dMRI is sensitive to microscopic changes in WM integrity not always detectable with standard anatomical MRI (37, 38) . In addition to WM, dMRI is an emerging tool for the evaluation of disease-related GM abnormalities as well (6, (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) . A growing number of studies are assessing cortical and subcortical GM diffusivity changes in AD that may reflect GM cellular microstructure breakdown (6) . Several studies report microscopic changes in Table 1 . the hippocampi that may be detectable prior to volumetric changes (43, 44) . Because dMRI changes may be detectable before (and therefore predict) gross volume loss (45, 46) , it is important to maximize the power to detect such changes.\nIn this study, we found that compared with both GFA ODF and FA DTI , FA TDF showed increased power to detect subtle or diffuse disease effects, especially in hippocampal and temporal lobe regions. AD pathology targets GM regions, especially in the temporal lobe and hippocampus. In these regions, FA DTI might be suboptimal, as it is best suited to detect differences in cohesive WM fiber bundles (e.g., the corpus callosum). We also found more significant FA TDF associations in voxels at GM or cerebrospinal fluid boundaries that may otherwise be susceptible to partial volume effects with FA DTI . Compared with FA DTI , larger FA TDF effect sizes were preserved even when the dMRI angular resolution was subsampled from 41 gradient directions to 30, 15, or even 7 gradient directions. Perhaps surprisingly, FA TDF calculated from 7 gradient directions had larger effect sizes than FA DTI calculated at the full angular resolution. Whereas some higher-order models require extremely dense or multishell acquisitions, TDF may better extract the information typically available in clinical settings, where time constraints limit scan times. It may also be helpful for studies of valuable but lower-resolution legacy data. The TDF as proposed by Leow et al. (13) makes no assumptions about the number of compartments per voxel and, unlike the tensor distribution function previously proposed by Jian et al. (47) , does not impose the same anisotropy profile on all fiber compartments. This may lead to better estimates if there are higher levels of uncertainty in the data, such as may arise with low resolution data.\nFurthermore, FA TDF may also help to interpret apparent increases in FA DTI found in disease. In many contexts, lower FA is hypothesized to reflect impairment. However, relative increases in FA have been reported in FA DTI studies of AD, which may reflect a selective sparing or selective degeneration of one of the pathways in a region with crossing fibers (48) . However, without histologic data, we cannot be certain whether selective degeneration or increased integrity-or some combination of both-is driving higher FA DTI values in a neuroimaging study. FA TDF , on the other hand, takes into account crossing fiber compartments. A relatively higher FA may more consistently reflect healthier tissue, whereas lower FA more consistently reflects deficits, making the direction of associations easier to interpret. Across analyses, we found that FA TDF showed fewer \"contrary to hypothesis\" regions (i.e., higher FA associated with greater deficits). Across all statistical tests and angular resolutions, compared with FA TDF , FA DTI showed both a higher absolute number of these types of significant voxels and a higher percentage relative to the total number of significant voxels ($5%-15% of voxels versus < 0.5% with FA TDF ), suggesting that FA TDF may in fact be resolving crossing fibers.\nAnalyses of test/retest reliability and model fit showed that the TDF was quite reliable and robust in regions that showed disease effects in this analysis. Some instability in test/retest reliability is to be expected when using the ADNI dataset; the scans were performed 3 months apart, and the healthy control participants were elderly (mean age, 72.8 6 6.5 y). Furthermore, these individuals may have exhibited some biological aging and WM deterioration, even over the 3month interscan interval. All registrations were visually evaluated, but age-related changes and minor geometric miscalibration of the scanner may have also contributed to minor discrepancies in alignment between two scans from the same subject, further contributing to both the final test/retest ICC and rRMSE measures in both the DTI and TDF models.\nA previous study also showed that FA TDF was a more stable metric with decreasing spatial resolution, whereas FA DTI values decreased more rapidly due to more fiber incoherence and greater partial voluming in larger voxels (49) . However, further analyses of FA TDF limitations on a wider range of diffusion protocols and comparisons of performance to numerous other proposed scalar metrics are necessary. In addition to FA, there is also a growing interest in assessing complementary diffusivity metrics, including mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity. Because FA is an inherently normalized measure and diffusivity metrics are not, future work is necessary to define analogous measures within the TDF framework.\nMultishell and other diffusion spectrum MRI or qspace techniques may ultimately outperform tensor model metrics, but they are often less feasible given the time constraints on dMRI protocols in clinical settings, as well as for recovering information from valuable legacy data. The TDF model may ultimately allow us to take advantage of such available clinical quality diffusion data with more sensitivity and fewer limitations than the classic DTI model."}, {"section_title": "APPENDIX", "text": "As the probability distribution we fit to the tensors, P(D(h, k)), is defined as a nonparametric distribution, we sampled the tensor space to solve the optimization problem. As in Leow et al. (13), we set l 2 \u00bc l 3 and l 1 ! l 2 , thus reducing the search of tensors to 2 eigenvalues and a principal eigenvector direction. The cost function could be rewritten (up to a constant multipier S 0 ) as\nwhere M is the number of elements in sampling); s 2 R N is the vector of observed intensities of the DW measures (where N is the number of DW scans); and F 2 R M \u00c2N is the matrix of elements F ij \u00bc exp\u00f0\u00c0q T j D i q j \u00de. Clearly, we search for a vector x that minimizes the cost function with two constraints:\nwhich lends itself to a classic quadratic programming (QP) problem (50) . By definition, the matrix H \u00bc 2FF T is positive semidefinite, which means that the problem is convex. However, by construction, the rank of the matrix H cannot exceed N (the number of observations). Therefore, if the tensor space sampling has more than N points, the problem has multiple optimal solutions. The original gradient descent approach described by Leow et al.

Even so, as long as P is sought as a nonparametric distribution based on a sampling at predefined grid points, multiple optimal solutions still remain a problem. Instead, we used the primal-dual predictor-corrector interior-point method (51) to solve the optimization problem.
