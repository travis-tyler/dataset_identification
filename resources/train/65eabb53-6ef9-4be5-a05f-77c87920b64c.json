[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common agerelated neurodegenerative disease, affecting nearly 5.2 million older adults in the United States [1] . Many AD researchers believe that effective treatments for AD will require intervention early in the disease course, even before clinical symptoms [2] . Thus, a significant goal is to identify participants likely to progress to AD (i.e., \"at-risk\") before significant cognitive decline.\nOne group thought to be at risk is cognitively normal older adults with subjective reports of cognitive changes [2] [3] [4] . Recently, an international consortium defined this group as subjective cognitive decline (SCD) [3] . In the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a comparable group of older adults were recruited with significant memory concerns (SMC) in the form of self-only complaints exceeding a predefined cut-off score on memory ratings. Previous studies have shown that older adults with SCD/SMC have an increased risk for future progression to AD [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] and AD-like changes in neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers [4, 13, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . In addition, SCD/SMC participants who are carriers of the most commonly reported genetic variant associated with late onset AD, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 allele, show greater medial temporal lobe (MTL) hypometabolism and atrophy, increased cerebral amyloid, and altered CSF measures of amyloid and tau [22, 23, 28, 29] . However, to date, no studies have looked at the role of APOE \u03b54 status in SCD/SMC across a comprehensive multimodal panel of major imaging and CSF AD biomarkers. Evaluating multiple biomarkers in the same cohort will help to define the staging of the SCD/SMC participants in relation to the Jack et al. (2013) model [30] and help determine the implication of APOE genotype for key AD pathophysiological processes, including amyloid deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, and brain atrophy, in this important at-risk group.\nWe recently reported on the role of APOE \u03b54 carrier status on several multimodal biomarkers in early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) participants and demonstrated a significant association between carrying an APOE \u03b54 allele and amyloid pathology in both cognitively normal (CN) older adults without complaints and EMCI participants [31] . However, the effect of APOE \u03b54 carrier status was minimal on CSF tau levels and brain atrophy. Thus, we sought to evaluate a similar question in SCD/SMC participants, as they are cognitively normal and thus less clinically affected than EMCI participants, but are at risk for AD due to subjective memory changes. We now also include [ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) for these groups and an expanded sample.\nThe goal of the present study was to evaluate the following hypotheses: (1) older adults with SMC who are APOE \u03b54 carriers show AD-like pathology on neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers, including increased amyloid deposition, decreased CSF amyloid beta (Ab)1-42, increased CSF total tau (t-tau) and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau), glucose hypometabolism, and MTL neurodegeneration relative to APOE \u03b54 noncarriers; and (2) SMC APOE \u03b54 carriers with cerebral amyloid positivity would show the most abnormalities on CSF biomarkers of amyloid and tau, as these SMC participants carry additional genetic risk and are most likely to show AD-related pathological changes. The analyses associated with the latter hypothesis will allow us to determine whether pathological CSF Ab1-42 changes are occurring in SMC who are APOE \u03b54 positive but below the threshold for amyloid PET positivity, as has been suggested by studies in autosomal dominant AD [32] . Furthermore, these analyses will evaluate whether APOE \u03b54 positive SMC show the most abnormal changes in tau which would suggest that these individuals are at a highest risk for future cognitive decline. In these analyses, CN and EMCI participants were included as boundary groups to better characterize the SMC group."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

Given the previous research in participants with SCD/SMC, the lack of hypometabolism or atrophy is somewhat surprising. However, the absence of these findings is potentially due to different participant recruitment, as SMC participants in the present study were recruited on the basis of subjective memory concerns, whereas many previous reports included participants who also had informant-based complaints. In fact, informant-based complaints have been shown to provide additional predictive ability for the progression to dementia to self-based complaints [5] . Furthermore, the lack of an APOE effect on MTL atrophy in all groups and metabolism in CN and SMC participants carrier status were significantly associated with CSF levels of (A) Ab1-42, (B) t-tau, and (C) phosphorylated tau (p-tau).

On post-hoc analysis, \u03b541 participants showed lower CSF Ab1-42 than \u03b542 participants regardless of diagnostic group (i.e., CN \u03b542, SMC \u03b542, EMCI \u03b542 . CN \u03b541, SMC \u03b541, EMCI \u03b541; all P , .05). (B) Significant independent effects of diagnosis and APOE \u03b54 carrier status (P , .001), and an interaction effect between diagnostic group and APOE \u03b54 carrier status (P 5.002), on CSF t-tau were also observed. EMCI \u03b541 participants showed higher t-tau levels than CN \u03b542, CN \u03b541, SMC \u03b542, and EMCI \u03b542 participants (all P , .05) on post-hoc analysis. (C) CSF p-tau level was significantly associated with APOE \u03b54 carrier status only (P , .001). On post-hoc analysis, EMCI and SMC \u03b541 participants showed higher p-tau levels than CN, SMC, and EMCI \u03b542 participants (all P , .05).

However, the previously observed differences were mild and differences in methodology likely resulted in the lack of significance in the present study, despite a slight trend for decreased glucose metabolism and hippocampal volume in \u03b541 CN.\nInterestingly, we observed a trend toward higher cortical glucose metabolism and larger hippocampal volume in SMC APOE \u03b541, although this did not reach significance after Bonferroni-correction possibly due to the relatively small group size and attenuated power or an unknown confounding variable. Although only a nonsignificant trend, the SMC participants showed this strikingly different pattern of APOE effects on metabolism and atrophy than CN or EMCI participants, suggesting that individuals with SMC may have different processes taking place than the latter groups. Further cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of changes in SCD/SMC samples are warranted to determine if these seemingly anomalous findings are of pathophysiological significance. It is noteworthy that previous studies have observed increased cortical thickness in at-risk populations, including in middle-aged APOE \u03b54 carriers [50] , CN who are transitioning to become CSF Ab positive [51] , and asymptomatic PSEN1 mutation carriers before the onset of the clinical changes [52] . Furthermore, a previous study in older adults with SCD/SMC demonstrated a quadratic effects of APOE \u03b54 carrier status and cerebral amyloid status (positive or negative), but no interaction effect on CSF Ab1-42 were observed (both P , .001). Post-hoc analysis indicated a pattern of decreasing CSF level Ab1-42 by the interaction of amyloid positivity and APOE \u03b541 was seen with SMC APOE \u03b542/Ab2 showing higher levels than SMC APOE \u03b541/Ab1, SMC APOE \u03b541/Ab2, and SMC APOE \u03b542/Ab1, and SMC APOE \u03b541/Ab2 showing higher CSF Ab1-42 levels than SMC APOE \u03b541/Ab1 (all P , .05). (B) APOE \u03b54 carrier status, but not amyloid positivity or the interaction, was significantly associated with CSF t-tau level in the SMC participants (P 5 .009). SMC APOE \u03b541/Ab1 showed higher t-tau levels than SMC APOE \u03b542/Ab2 on Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc analysis (P 5 .008). (C) Both APOE \u03b54 carrier status and amyloid positivity were independently associated with CSF p-tau level (APOE \u03b54 carrier status, P 5.014; amyloid positivity, P 5.010), but again no interaction was observed. Similar to the t-tau analyses, SMC APOE \u03b541/Ab1 had greater CSF p-tau levels than SMC APOE \u03b542/Ab2 on post-hoc analysis (P ,.001). Abbreviations: Ab, amyloid beta; EMCI, early mild cognitive impairment; SMC, significant memory concern; CN, cognitively normal. pattern of longitudinal MTL atrophy, with initial volume increases followed by decreases [22] . Future studies with longitudinal follow-up and larger samples will be important in determining the significance of this finding. If confirmed, mechanistic studies would also be indicated to determine the processes underlying these increases. In any case, this finding highlights the potential difference of SMC from CN participants and suggests that individuals with significant self-complaints may have a different pattern of pathology and risk than those without.\nMost of the observed results provide further support of the Jack et al. model of AD biomarkers [30] , suggesting that amyloid accumulation is one of the earliest measurable pathophysiological changes associated with AD before cognitive decline and that hypometabolic and atrophic changes primarily occur with early clinical symptoms. This study also supports the hypothesis that APOE \u03b54 genotype alters the hypothesized model by pushing the system in favor of early amyloid accumulation, even in cognitively normal older adults. Extension of the Jack et al. model to include an SMC stage before MCI appears warranted, as these participants represent an at-risk group. However, in contrast to the Jack et al. model, we observed an increased level of p-tau and a trend toward increased glucose metabolism and hippocampal volume in APOE \u03b541 SMC participants. These findings deviate from both the Jack et al. model and previous work in autosomal dominant AD [32] and may suggest a more complicated interaction between CSF and imaging biomarkers of neurodegeneration in the earliest stages of disease. However, given the limited detection power and significance of this finding, additional studies would be needed to fully explore this possibility. The present results also provide support for the importance of genetic variation in determining likelihood and extent of amyloid accumulation, even in preclinical stages such as SMC, which may be an important consideration for enrichment strategies for therapeutic trial enrollment based on very mildly symptomatic and/or asymptomatic patients. The availability of tau imaging using one of the newly developed tau PET ligands [53, 54] could lead to further revisions in this hypothetical sequence of biomarker changes [30] .\nWe also completed a targeted analysis within SMC participants to examine the potential for an interaction between APOE \u03b54 carrier status and cerebral amyloid positivity determined using [ 18 F]Florbetapir PET. SMC participants who were both APOE \u03b54 carriers and amyloid positive had the most abnormal CSF amyloid and tau levels. If SMC participants were either an APOE \u03b54 carrier or amyloid positive on [ 18 F]Florbetapir PET, they appeared to have intermediate levels of CSF Ab1-42, t-tau, and p-tau between those carrying both risk factors and those carrying neither risk factor. These findings suggest that although APOE \u03b54 genotype and amyloid deposition are highly linked, these factors may have independent and/or additive effects on amyloid and tau in SMC. Furthermore, the observed reduction in CSF Ab1-42 in SMC APOE \u03b54 carriers who were amyloid negative on [ 18 F]Florbetapir PET may suggest that changes in amyloid are detectable in CSF before amyloid PET scans or that CSF Ab changes are not fully reflective of amyloid aggregation.\nThis study has a few notable limitations. First, as previously discussed, SMC participants in the present report were recruited based on self-reported complaints of cognitive decline in the absence of informant-perceived decline. Previous studies have shown the importance of informant-based complaints in both cognitively normal and impaired populations [5] . Therefore, the evaluated SMC participants may not be fully representative of the greater population of older adults with SCD/SMC. Future studies of participants with self-based and/or informantbased complaints with longitudinal assessment of AD biomarkers will help to elucidate the impact of self vs. informant complaints on AD pathology and risk. Second, only a single genetic factor (APOE \u03b54 carrier status) was evaluated in this study. Future studies targeting other genetic variants in SMC are warranted. Third, the present study only evaluated cross-sectional data. Studies of longitudinal outcome and rate of AD biomarker change may provide additional information about dynamic changes in SCD/SMC. Finally, a number of additional AD biomarkers were not evaluated in the present report. Future studies investigating additional imaging and CSF biomarkers may elucidate other changes occurring in SMC.\nIn sum, APOE \u03b54 positive older adults with SMC show increased cerebral amyloid, reduced CSF Ab1-42, increased CSF p-tau, and a trend for increased CSF t-tau relative to APOE \u03b54 noncarriers. Other AD biomarkers showed minimal association to APOE in SMC. Targeted analyses suggest that SMC participants who were both APOE \u03b541 and positive for cerebral amyloid showed the most abnormal CSF Ab1-42, t-tau, and p-tau levels. Future longitudinal studies of dynamic processes occurring in this at-risk population will elucidate the disease vulnerability of older adults with SCD/SMC, and the impact of genetic background."}]
