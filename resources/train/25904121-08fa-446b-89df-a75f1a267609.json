After the hippocampal surfaces were extracted from MRI scans automatically with FIRST, we computed their conformal parameterization with holomorphic 1-forms. Then feature images were generated by combining the local conformal factor and mean curvature that were computed from the conformal parameterizations. After the inverse consistent fluid registration was done in the feature image domain, we deformed the surfaces using the obtained displacements. The statistics of multivariate TBM were computed at each point on the resultant matching surface.
