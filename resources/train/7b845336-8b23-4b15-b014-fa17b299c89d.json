[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "IMPORTANCE Although American guidelines recommend use of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, individuals who achieve a pathological complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy are less likely to receive adjuvant treatment than incomplete responders. The association and resection of adjuvant chemotherapy with survival in patients with pCR is unclear.\nOBJECTIVE To determine whether patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who achieve pCR after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and resection benefit from the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy.\nThis retrospective propensity score-matched cohort study identified patients with locally advanced rectal cancer from the National Cancer Database from 2006 through 2012. We selected patients with nonmetastatic invasive rectal cancer who achieved pCR after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and resection.\nEXPOSURES We matched patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy to patients who did not receive adjuvant treatment in a 1:1 ratio. We separately matched subgroups of patients with node-positive disease before treatment and node-negative disease before treatment to investigate for effect modification by pretreatment nodal status.\nMAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES We compared overall survival between groups using Kaplan-Meier survival methods and Cox proportional hazards models.\nWe identified 2455 patients (mean age, 59.5 years; 59.8% men) with rectal cancer with pCR after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and resection. We matched 667 patients with pCR who received adjuvant chemotherapy and at least 8 weeks of follow-up after surgery to patients with pCR who did not receive adjuvant treatment. Over a median follow-up of 3.1 years (interquartile range, 1.94-4.40 years), patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy demonstrated better overall survival than those who did not receive adjuvant treatment (hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.28-0.70). When stratified by pretreatment nodal status, only those patients with pretreatment node-positive disease exhibited improved overall survival with administration of adjuvant chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.10-0.58).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The administration of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with rectal cancer with pCR is associated with improved overall survival, particularly in patients with pretreatment node-positive disease. Although this study suggests a beneficial effect of adjuvant treatment on survival in patients with pCR, these results are limited by the presence of potential unmeasured confounding in this nonrandomized study."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "T he standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer includes neoadjuvant chemoradiation, surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT). The rationale for the routine use of ACT is based on an extrapolation of the survival benefits among patients with colon cancer [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] ; however, the efficacy of ACT in patients with rectal cancer is less clear. 6 Early studies demonstrating benefits of the use of ACT for rectal cancer included patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemoradiation [7] [8] [9] [10] ; trials evaluating ACT for patients with rectal cancer in the setting of neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery have not clearly demonstrated a benefit to its use. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Additionally, the utility of ACT for subgroups of patients known to have good prognoses is unclear.\nDownstaging after neoadjuvant treatment is a known prognosticator of survival in rectal cancer. [16] [17] [18] [19] Between 10% and 25%\nof patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy achieve a pathological complete response (pCR; defined as ypT0N0), 20, 21 and these patients exhibit low rates of local and distant recurrence and better overall and disease-free survival compared with patients without pCR. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] Because of this, the use of ACT in patients who achieve pCR has been questioned. [26] [27] [28] [29] Previous trials evaluating the benefit of ACT for patients with rectal cancer have been underpowered for subgroup analyses of patients with pCR. While in the United States and Canada ACT remains the standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer, 30, 31 in practice, patients who achieve a pCR are less likely to undergo ACT than those with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. 22, 24, 32 Despite excellent survival among patients with pCR, these patients remain at risk for disease recurrence and cancer-related death. Additionally, downstaging exhibited by these patients is suggestive of tumor biology responsive to treatment. As such, patients with pCR may compose a chemosensitive subset of patients with rectal cancer likely to benefit from ACT.

The strength of this association was strongest for patients with pretreatment node-positive disease.\nSeveral randomized clinical trials (RCTs) attempting to establish the role of ACT for rectal cancer have failed to demonstrate a benefit to its use, which may in part be explained by insufficient power and poor adherence to treatment. The EORTC 22921 trial, 47 which used a 2\u00d72 factorial design to evaluate the benefits of both preoperative chemoradiotherapy and ACT in patients with resectable T3-T4 tumors, concluded that there was no benefit to the addition of ACT in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation. However, 36.9% of patients randomized to ACT did not undergo any cycles of treatment. Importantly, although this trial was unable to demonstrate the 10% difference in survival for which it was powered, patients treated with ACT did demonstrate a 4% improvement in 5-year overall survival and 6% improvement in 5-year diseasefree survival. 48 Similarly, although no benefit to ACT was demonstrated in the Italian I-CNR-RT trial, 15 the authors point out that 28% of patients randomized to ACT did not undergo treatment, most commonly because of patient refusal. The choice of chemotherapy agents used in previous RCTs may also explain discrepancies in their results. In EORTC 22921, I-CNR-RT, and the PROCTOR arm of the Dutch PROCTOR-SCRIPT trial, 12 all of which failed to demonstrate benefits to ACT, patients were randomized to adjuvant treatment with fluorouracil plus leucovorin. However, ADORE, an RCT comparing this with a regimen of oxaliplatin and fluorouracil plus leucovorin in patients with pathologic stage II/III rectal cancer, demonstrated a 9.3% absolute improvement in 3-year overall survival among patients treated with a regimen of oxaliplatin and fluorouracil plus leucovorin. 49 Similarly, the German CAO/ARO/AIO-04 trial demonstrated a benefit to the addition of oxaliplatin. 50 Although CHRONICLE, 14 a trial of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin vs no adjuvant treatment found a 7% improvement in disease-free survival but no improvement in overall survival, this study was closed prematurely after randomization of only 113 of the 780 patients required owing to slow accrual attributed to a bias among treating physicians to not offer ACT. Our study demonstrated that the greatest survival benefit to ACT is in patients with the greatest burden of pretreatment disease (pretreatment node-positive patients). One theory for this finding is that tumor downstaging after neoadjuvant treatment may indicate favorable tumor biology and can be correlated with further responsivity to additional chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with proven responsivity to treatment may be beneficial by potentially eradicating residual micrometastatic disease. 13 ,51 However, it should be noted that our subgroup analyses were exploratory and require further investigation for confirmation. Whether ACT is beneficial for patients with tumor downstaging has been difficult to evaluate in previous RCTs, which have been underpowered for subgroup analyses of downstaged patients. However, a recent meta-analysis of 7 RCTs and 10 retrospective studies, including 5457 patients, demonstrated improved 5-year overall survival with ACT among patients who experienced tumor downstaging (odds ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38-0.85)."}, {"section_title": "51", "text": "Studies specifically evaluating the effect of ACT in the population with pCR have also been limited by a lack of statistical power. Several small studies demonstrate absolute improvements in overall survival ranging from 4.5% to 15%; however, these differences were not statistically significant. 24 ,27,52,53 To avoid issues related to small sample sizes, others have attempted to use large registries. A previous propensity score-adjusted NCDB study by Xu et al 54 evaluated adherence with ACT among patients with rectal cancer and similarly compared survival among patients with pCR. In congruence with the results from our study, they also demonstrated improved overall survival in patients with pCR who received ACT. However, this was a subgroup analysis and propensity scores were generated from the larger cohort of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer rather than from the patients with pCR alone; therefore, propensity score adjustment may not have appropriately adjusted for confounding by indication among patients with pCR in this previous study.\nTo our knowledge, this study is the largest to date evaluating the effect of ACT among a contemporary cohort of patients with pCR. With the use of propensity score matching, our groups were balanced on measured confounders that could have influenced receipt of ACT and our results proved to be robust on sensitivity analysis, helping our study avoid many of the methodological limitations of previous studies. Given the low mortality among patients with pCR, the use of propensity score matching rather than adjustment with a multivariable Cox model also allowed us to avoid model overspecification. We explored the role of pretreatment nodal status by separately analyzing subgroups based on clinical nodal status, ensuring balance of covariates in these subgroup analyses. Finally, although we could not determine whether patients underwent a full course of ACT, all patients in our ACT group received at least 2 cycles of treatment."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Our study has limitations. The use of a retrospective database limited our ability to investigate other sources of potential bias. For example, we were unable to determine the chemotherapy agents administered, their dosages, or patient adherence. Because we could only identify patients who had received at least 2 cycles of ACT, patients who received a single cycle may have been misclassified. Although this may have been the case for only a few patients, this misclassification could have led to an overestimation of the effect of ACT. Additionally, we were unable to explore potential benefits of ACT on cancer recurrence or cancer-specific mortality as the NCDB does not provide data on local or distant recurrence or cause of death. Our follow-up was relatively short and few events were observed over this time. Despite this, we were able to detect a significant difference in overall survival in our short follow-up period. Interestingly, patients with pretreatment nodepositive and node-negative disease exhibited similar survival times. Although this may reflect the strength of pCR attainment as a prognosticator, this could also be explained by possible misclassification of nodal status given the poor ability of radiologic methods to accurately determine lymph node positivity. 55, 56 Given the observational nature of this study, significant potential for bias exists; patients who received ACT may have been systematically different from those who did not receive ACT. We attempted to mitigate these effects by propensity score matching; however, significant residual confounding from unmeasured covariates may have resulted in an overestimation of the benefit of ACT in our study. However, our sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the association between ACT and survival would remain significant in the presence of substantial unmeasured confounding. Finally, the generalizability of our study findings needs to be considered. "}]
