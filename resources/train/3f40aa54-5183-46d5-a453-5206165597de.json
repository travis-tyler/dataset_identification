MRI-based measurements of BF atrophy are increasingly being used as in vivo surrogate markers for cholinergic degeneration, but the functional implications of reductions in BF volume are not well understood. We used high-resolution MRI, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET), and neuropsychological test data of 132 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 177 cognitively normal controls to determine associations between BF atrophy, cortical hypometabolism, and cognitive deficits. BF atrophy in MCI correlated with both impaired memory function and attentional control deficits, whereas hippocampus volume was more specifically associated with memory deficits. BF atrophy was also associated with widespread cortical hypometabolism, and path analytic models indicated that hypometabolism in domain-specific cortical networks mediated the association between BF volume and cognitive dysfunction. The presence of cortical amyloid pathology, as assessed using AV45-PET, did not significantly interact with the observed associations. These data underline the potential of multimodal imaging markers to study structure-functioncognition relationships in the living human brain and provide important in vivo evidence for an involvement of the human BF in cortical activity and cognitive function."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain (BF) send their axons to wide parts of the cortical mantle and the hippocampus, where they act upon their cortical target neurons by the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (Mesulam et al. 1983; Mesulam MM 2004; Hasselmo and Sarter 2011) . This cortical cholinergic innervation is particularly dense in limbic and heteromodal association areas, which are also the primary sources for cortical back projections to the cholinergic BF (Mesulam et al. 1992; Ghashghaei and Barbas 2001) . Several lines of evidence indicate that the modulation of cortical activity through the BF cholinergic system subserves cognitive functions, particularly in the domains of memory and attentional processing (Hasselmo and Sarter 2011) . Selective lesions to the cholinergic BF in animal models disrupt cortical cholinergic neurotransmission and induce hypometabolism in the denervated cortical projection sites, which is paralleled behaviorally by impaired performance on spatial learning and target detection tasks (Yamaguchi et al. 1990; Everitt and Robbins 1997; Browne et al. 2001; Gelfo et al. 2013) .\nThe role of the cholinergic BF in human brain function and cognition is less well explored. An important line of evidence emerges from the study of age-and disease-related degeneration of the cholinergic BF and ensuing decline in cholinergic function. Thus, structure and function of the cholinergic BF significantly decrease in the aging brain (Perry et al. 1992; Schliebs and Arendt 2011) and even cognitively intact elderly subjects exhibit an increased susceptibility for cognitive side effects of prescription drugs with anticholinergic properties (Mulsant et al. 2003; Campbell et al. 2009 ). On the other hand, several clinicopathologic correlation studies in neurologic dementing disorders, most notably Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body disorders, including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, indicate that the marked degeneration of cholinergic BF neurons and associated loss of cortical cholinergic activity that occurs in these neurodegenerative conditions contributes to the development of severe cognitive disturbances (Gaspar and Gray 1984; Iraizoz et al. 1999; Pappas et al. 2000; Tiraboschi et al. 2002; Schliebs and Arendt 2006) . Consistent with this \"cholinergic hypothesis,\" enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission by medical treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may reduce cognitive decline in these diseases (Birks 2006; Mori et al. 2012; Rolinski et al. 2012) .\nHowever, postmortem clinicopathologic correlation studies are usually limited by relatively small sample sizes, the number of sampled brain regions, and significant offsets between last cognitive evaluation and neuropathologic examination. In vivo neuroimaging markers may overcome some of these limitations and allow assessment of brain-behavior correlations in living subjects (Salmon et al. 2008; Grothe et al. 2010) . Using MRI to study volumetric changes in the BF as an in vivo surrogate marker of cholinergic degeneration, it could be demonstrated that this region shows an increased vulnerability to age-related structural decline and is severely atrophied in demented patients with AD or Lewy body disease (Hanyu et al. 2002; Whitwell et al. 2007; Hall et al. 2008; George et al. 2011; Choi et al. 2012; Grothe et al. 2012; Gao et al. 2013; Grothe, Schuster, et al. 2014 ). Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered a transitional state between normal cognitive aging and dementia (Gauthier et al. 2006) , and has been associated with increased cholinergic BF degeneration compared with healthy controls, both in terms of neuropathologic changes (Mesulam M 2004; Mufson et al. 2007 ) as well as reduced volume on MRI (Grothe et al. 2010; Muth et al. 2010; Grothe et al. 2013 ). While previous in vivo studies have helped delineating the course of declining BF volume during normal and pathological aging, much less is known on how the decrease in BF volume that accompanies the transition from cognitively normal (CN) aging to dementia relates to cortical dysfunction and the expression of cognitive deficits. In previous studies, we found that reduced BF volumes in MCI correlated with deficits in global cognition and episodic memory function (Grothe et al. 2010; Grothe et al. 2013) , whereas correlations with cognition were less pronounced in normally aging subjects (Wolf et al. 2014) . Here, we expand upon these previous findings by studying the cognitive correlates of reduced BF volumes in a large and independent sample of neuropsychologically well-characterized elderly subjects with age-appropriate cognition and MCI, respectively, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Moreover, for the first time we examined whether reduced BF volume on MRI is associated with cortical synaptic dysfunction as measured by [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET), and whether this association mediates the effect of BF atrophy on cognitive deficits, as would be predicted by functional models of the corticopetal BF cholinergic system derived from preclinical research (Everitt and Robbins 1997; Browne et al. 2001) . We hypothesized that normal age-related decline in BF volume may be functionally silent, whereas increased BF atrophy in MCI would be associated with specific cognitive deficits in the domains of memory and attentional processing, as well as with hypometabolism in cortical target areas that mediate the effect of BF atrophy on cognition. Given that approximately 60% of the MCI subjects in our sample harbor cortical amyloid pathology indicative of prodromal AD, and BF atrophy is exacerbated in these subjects compared with amyloidnegative MCI subjects , we further assessed the impact of amyloid status on associations between BF volume, cognitive deficits, and cortical hypometabolism in MCI. Finally, functional and cognitive correlates of BF atrophy were compared with the effects of hippocampus atrophy, given the wealth of neuroimaging literature on age-and dementia-related changes in the hippocampus-memory network."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Source", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu, Last accessed 23/3/15).

In a first step, we determined how BF-associated cortical hypometabolism relates to memory (DR-30) and attentional control deficits (TMT-B), which were found to be sensitive to reductions in BF volume (see Results). Although several psychometric indices of memory function correlated with BF volume, in this additional analysis only DR performance (DR-30) was examined as a representative and widely used index of episodic memory deficits in MCI (Grundman et al. 2003 (Grundman et al. , 2004 Fjell et al. 2008 ). Thus, DR-30 and TMT-B scores were used as predictor variables in a voxel-wise regression model on FDG-PET maps, where the search region was limited to the areas associated with reduced BF volumes. To detect hypometabolic subnetworks specific for memory and attentional control deficits, the regression analyses were controlled for age, gender, education, MMSE, and TMT-B or DR-30, respectively. Voxel-wise results were assessed at a statistical threshold of P < 0.05, FDR-corrected.\nIn a second step, we used path analyses to test whether the effect of BF volume on cognitive deficits is mediated by hypometabolism in domain-specific cortical networks. Thus, 2 independent mediation models were constructed using BF volume as the causal variable, cognitive test performance as the outcome variable, and mean FDG-PET signal extracted from the respective domain-specific cortical network (normalized to pons uptake) as the mediator variable. Path coefficients were estimated using multiple regressions and the statistical significance of the mediation was assessed using Sobel's test implemented in SPSS (Preacher and Hayes 2004) ."}, {"section_title": "Impact of Amyloid Pathology on the Associations Between BF Volume, Cognitive Deficits, and Cortical Hypometabolism", "text": "To assess whether associations between BF volume, cognitive deficits, and cortical hypometabolism in MCI were mainly driven by subjects that harbor cortical amyloid pathology indicative of prodromal AD (Albert et al. 2011) , we tested the associations for a significant interaction with amyloid status as determined from amyloid-sensitive AV45-PET scans (Fleisher et al. 2011) .\nAmyloid status was derived from cortex-to-whole cerebellum standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) that have been calculated and made available on the ADNI server by one of the ADNI PET core laboratories (Jagust Lab, UC Berkley; Landau et al. 2012 ). This cortex-to-whole cerebellum SUVR was derived for each subject by averaging AV45 uptake within frontal, cingular, lateral parietal, and lateral temporal cortical regions, known to be particularly affected by amyloid pathology even in prodromal stages of AD (Kemppainen et al. 2007) , and dividing this value by averaged uptake within the cerebellar reference region. Cortical and cerebellar ROIs were segmented in each individual's MRI scan using the Freesurfer software (version 4.5.0). More detailed information on AV45-PET processing is provided in Supplementary Material.

Further path analytic analyses supported a directed model, where the effects of BF atrophy on cognitive deficits are mediated by hypometabolism in domain-specific cortical networks."}, {"section_title": "Cognitive Correlates of BF Atrophy", "text": "The role of the BF cholinergic system in cognition has been extensively studied in animal models, where selective lesions to the cholinergic BF were found to alter performance in specific behavioral tests of memory function and attentional processing (Everitt and Robbins 1997) . Although this system is less amenable to direct experimental manipulation in humans, there are several lines of evidence that implicate the cholinergic BF in human memory and higher cognitive processes. For example, functional neuroimaging studies in healthy subjects found activation of the BF in response to salient visual stimuli (Morris et al. 1997) , but also in the context of conditional learning (Morris et al. 1998) , episodic memory retrieval (Fujii et al. 2002) , and proactive interference resolution (De Rosa et al. 2004) . On the other hand, case reports of patients with selective damage to the BF caused by surgical resection of brain tumors ( http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/ or rupture of anterior communicating artery aneurysm (Benke et al. 2005) indicate that discrete BF lesions may be sufficient to cause severe amnestic syndromes or delirium. Although the degree to which cholinergic nuclei within the BF are affected by these lesions may be variable and is typically not known, improvement of symptoms after pharmacological stimulation of cholinergic neurotransmission has been reported in some cases (Chatterjee et al. 1993; Kobayashi et al. 2004; Benke et al. 2005) . Another line of evidence for the importance of an intact BF cholinergic system for the maintenance of higher cognitive functions in humans is derived from the study of age-and disease-related neurodegeneration of the cholinergic BF and ensuing decline in cholinergic function. Thus, moderate neurodegenerative changes in the cholinergic BF are observed in normal physiologic brain aging and are believed to underlie aspects of cognitive aging and an increased susceptibility for cognitive side effects of anticholinergic drugs (Campbell et al. 2009; Schliebs and Arendt 2011) . Moreover, several postmortem autopsy studies have shown that neuropathologic measures of cholinergic BF atrophy (Gaspar and Gray 1984; Lehericy et al. 1993; Samuel et al. 1994; Iraizoz et al. 1999 ; Schliebs and Arendt 2006) and cortical cholinergic depletion (Perry et al. 1985; Bierer et al. 1995; Pappas et al. 2000; Tiraboschi et al. 2002 ) correlate with antemortem dementia severity across a wide range of neurologic dementing diseases, most notably AD and Lewy body-associated dementias. More recently, studies using MRI-based volumetry of BF ROIs as surrogate markers of cholinergic BF degeneration could provide in vivo evidence for correlations between reduced BF volume and dementia severity in AD and Lewy body-associated dementias (Hanyu et al. 2002; George et al. 2011; Choi et al. 2012; Gao et al. 2013; Kim et al. 2013; Grothe, Schuster, et al. 2014 ). However, evidence for the functional role of BF volume reductions that occur in the normal aging process and in MCI is still limited. In 2 previous studies on independent MCI samples (N = 50 and 33, respectively), we found that BF volumes correlated with global cognitive function (Grothe et al. 2013 ) as well as with more specific measures of delayed verbal recall performance (Grothe et al. 2010) . In contrast, in a sample of 43 elderly subjects with age-appropriate cognition, BF volumes were not significantly correlated with specific cognitive domain scores when accounting for the effect of age as the indirect driver of the associations (Wolf et al. 2014 ). Here, we expand upon these previous findings by studying the cognitive correlates of reduced BF volumes in a large sample of CN and MCI subjects using a more detailed neurocognitive test battery, including various tests of learning and episodic memory, attention/executive function, and semantic memory/ verbal fluency. In accordance with our hypothesis, reduced BF volumes in MCI correlated specifically with worse performance on tests of episodic memory and attentional control. In contrast, and consistent with previous studies in MCI (Grundman et al. 2003) , hippocampal volume was only significantly correlated with performance on tests of learning and episodic memory, but not with tests of other cognitive domains. It has to be noted that the significant correlations between these regional brain volumes and cognition are only of mild-to-moderate effect size, suggesting that cognition in MCI is also influenced by other factors. In addition to the characteristic volumetric changes in the BF and hippocampus, atrophic changes in MCI also affect other brain regions, likely contributing to cognitive deficits in at least partially independent ways (Grothe et al. 2010; Nho et al. 2012) . Moreover, associations between volumetric brain changes and cognition are generally expected to be indirect, being mediated by the functional consequences of the neurodegenerative process that is indexed by reduced volume. This possibility has been addressed in the present study by examining the mediational effect of cortical hypometabolism on BF-cognition relationships, which is discussed below.\nWeak correlations between BF volume and select memory scores in the CN group did not remain significant when controlling for age, gender, and education as possible mediator variables. This is largely consistent with our previous finding in an independent cohort (Wolf et al. 2014 ) and indicates that reductions in BF volume that occur in the normal aging process are of minor functional significance, probably because the normal age-related degenerative changes do not result in sufficiently severe functional changes in the cholinergic system to markedly impact upon cognition (Schliebs and Arendt 2006) . However, declining BF volume in normal aging may still be associated with subtle changes in cognition not captured by the psychometric tests in our study (Butler et al. 2012 ). "}, {"section_title": "BF Atrophy and Cortical Hypometabolism", "text": "The cholinergic BF innervates wide parts of the cortical mantle and influences the activity of cortical target circuits through the release of acetylcholine (Metherate et al. 1992; Hasselmo and Sarter 2011) . In accordance with its proposed role in memory and higher cognitive functions, the primary cortical projection sites of the BF cholinergic system correspond to core limbic, paralimbic, and heteromodal association areas of the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal lobes (Mesulam et al. 1992; Ghashghaei and Barbas 2001) . In animal models, cortical cholinergic denervation, induced by selective lesions to the cholinergic BF, leads to a reduction in high-frequency cortical EEG activity (Berntson et al. 2002) and a decrease of metabolic activity in primary cortical projection sites [Yamaguchi et al. 1990; Browne et al. 2001; Gelfo et al. 2013 ; however, see also Le Mestric et al. (1998) for contradicting findings]. In human neuropathologic examinations, degeneration of cholinergic BF nuclei in AD and dementia with Lewy bodies correlates with depletion of cholinergic activity in cortical projection sites (Koshimura et al. 1987; Mesulam and Geula 1988; Lippa et al. 1999) , and lower neuropathologic estimates of frontal cortex cholinergic activity in AD were found to be associated with antemortem slowing of EEG activity (Soininen et al. 1992) . More recently, similar associations between a compromised cholinergic system and alterations in cortical EEG activity could be demonstrated in MCI subjects in vivo, using an MRIbased marker of white matter lesions along cholinergic tracts as a surrogate marker for cholinergic denervation (Babiloni et al. 2009 ). Here, we provide the first in vivo evidence that BF atrophy on MRI is associated with reductions in cortical metabolic activity as measured with FDG-PET in subjects with MCI. Interestingly, the regional pattern of this association corresponds to the differential cholinergic innervation pattern of functional subdivisions of the cortex (Mesulam et al. 1992; Ghashghaei and Barbas 2001) . Thus, BF atrophy correlated with reduced metabolic activity mainly in areas characterized by high cholinergic innervation, such as core limbic structures of the medial temporal lobe, the prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, ventral precuneus, and lateral temporo-parietal association areas. Glucose metabolism in the less innervated primary sensory-motor areas and the cerebellum, on the other hand, did not show significant associations with BF atrophy. The association between BF atrophy and cortical hypometabolism may, in principle, also be driven by a shared underlying factor such as overall severity of age-or disease-related neurodegeneration. However, the observed regional associations were controlled for age and MMSE score, as a measure of disease severity, arguing for a rather specific effect where the regional pattern of the association might be driven by the differential cortical innervation preference of the cholinergic BF. In contrast to the MCI group, variation in BF volume among CN individuals was not associated with cortical hypometabolism. This coincides with the lack of association with cognitive function in this group and reinforces the interpretation that normal age-related decline in BF volume may not result in marked functional changes of the cholinergic system (Schliebs and Arendt 2006) .\nIn vivo associations between local measures of atrophy and neuronal dysfunction in remote but anatomically connected regions have previously been studied within other functional systems of the brain and using a wide range of neuroimaging techniques (Guedj et al. 2009; Villain et al. 2010; Yakushev et al. 2011; Cross et al. 2013) . A particularly well-investigated phenomenon is the association between atrophy of the hippocampal formation and dysfunction of the posterior cingulate cortex in MCI and AD. For example, Yakushev et al. (2011) studied brain-wide metabolic correlates of hippocampal degeneration in a group of very mildly demented AD patients by regressing a diffusion imaging-based index of hippocampal tissue disruption on FDG-PET scans. Interestingly, the results of our control analysis of the effects of hippocampal atrophy on regional metabolism closely resemble the effects reported by Yakushev et al., including associations with hypometabolism in the bilateral medial temporal lobes and the posterior cingulate cortex. The spatial extension of the hypometabolic effects of BF atrophy across several cortical systems is in striking contrast with the spatially more restricted effects of hippocampus atrophy and may likely reflect the particular connectional anatomy of the corticopetal BF cholinergic system. Of course, BF atrophy may not be the only factor influencing cortical function in MCI, and the strength of the correlation between BF volume and cortical hypometabolism, averaged over all significant voxels, was r = 0.43 (see also Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Other factors may include white matter lesions along cholinergic fiber tracts (Behl et al. 2007; Babiloni et al. 2009 ), but also pathologic processes independent of cholinergic denervation. Thus, cortical metabolism can be influenced by both local pathologic processes, such as amyloid or tau-mediated toxicity (Spires-Jones and Hyman 2014), as well as by disconnection from other functionally interacting systems, such as has been demonstrated here and in previous studies for the effect of hippocampus atrophy on posterior cingulate cortex hypometabolism (Chetelat et al. 2009; Villain et al. 2010; Yakushev et al. 2011) .\nUnlike studies on animal models using direct experimental manipulation (Yamaguchi et al. 1990; Browne et al. 2001; Gelfo et al. 2013 ), the present correlational in vivo findings in humans do not allow inferences to be made about the direction of the effects. Hence, the detected associations could also be interpreted to reflect retrograde BF degeneration due to primary cortical lesions, and indeed such mechanisms have also been reported from animal studies (Sofroniew and Pearson 1985) . However, given the use of partial volume correction of the FDG-PET scans in the present study, the measured hypometabolism is unlikely to be confounded by cortical atrophy. Future longitudinal studies may reveal further insights into the sequence of events that couple BF atrophy and cortical hypometabolism in age and disease (Villain et al. 2010) ."}, {"section_title": "Cortical Hypometabolism as the Neuronal Substrate of Cognitive Deficits Associated with BF Atrophy", "text": "Effects of cholinergic degeneration on cognitive functions are believed to be mediated by the resulting disruption of cortical cholinergic neurotransmission and ensuing cortical dysfunction. Given that in the present study BF atrophy was indeed associated with cortical hypometabolism in widespread limbic and heteromodal association areas known to subserve higher cognitive functions (Mesulam 1998; Meehan and Bressler 2012) , we further aimed to investigate whether this cortical hypometabolism may account for the observed correlation between BF atrophy and cognitive dysfunction.\nSearching the cortical hypometabolic areas related to BF atrophy for associations with cognitive test performance, we found that hypometabolism in a circumscribed hippocampus-posterior cingulate subnetwork was associated with episodic memory deficits, whereas attentional control deficits were associated with hypometabolism in a more widespread network including frontal, temporal, and parietal areas. These findings are in good agreement with existing models of the distributed representation of episodic memory and executive control functions across intrinsically connected neurocognitive networks in the human brain (Mesulam 1998; Meehan and Bressler 2012; Ranganath and Ritchey 2012) , and complement findings from several previous imaging studies examining neural correlates of memory and executive function deficits in MCI and other neurodegenerative conditions (Salmon et al. 2008; Habeck et al. 2012; Schroeter et al. 2012; Terada et al. 2013) .\nIn addition, statistical path analyses examining the differential relationships between BF atrophy, cortical hypometabolism, and cognitive dysfunction were consistent with a model where the effect of BF atrophy on memory and attentional functions is mediated by its effect on hypometabolism in domain-specific cortical networks. Such a model of functional and cognitive consequences of BF atrophy is also supported by studies on animal models where experimental lesions to the cholinergic BF led to reduced cortical cholinergic synapse density and decreased metabolic activity in primary cortical projection sites, which in turn predicted behavioral deficits (Yamaguchi et al. 1990; Browne et al. 2001; Gelfo et al. 2013) . In AD patients, it has been shown that pharmacologic treatments aimed at enhancing cholinergic function may stabilize or even increase cortical metabolic activity (Tuszynski et al. 2005; Teipel et al. 2006) . More importantly, beneficial cognitive outcomes of such treatments were found to depend on the treatment-induced modulations of cortical metabolism (Potkin et al. 2001; Stefanova et al. 2006; Kadir et al. 2008) . In the present study, hypometabolism in distinct cortical networks mediated the association between reduced BF volume as a surrogate marker of cholinergic degeneration and domainspecific cognitive deficits in MCI. The regional specificity of these associations is also in good accordance with previous findings from a neuropathologic study, where cholinergic depletion in medial frontal areas selectively predicted antemortem attentional function, whereas decreased cholinergic activity in the hippocampus correlated with performance on memory tests (Pappas et al. 2000) . However, the mediation between BF volume and cognitive performance through hypometabolism in the domain-specific cortical networks was only complete for the TMT-B model, whereas there was only partial mediation in the DR-30 model. While this may suggest that there is a direct link between BF volume and DR-30 performance, a more plausible possibility is that the association is additionally mediated by other factors that have not been considered in the mediation model, such as hypometabolism outside of the closely circumscribed hippocampus-posterior cingulate \"memory network,\" or functional consequences of BF atrophy not captured by FDG-PET imaging."}, {"section_title": "Impact of Amyloid Pathology", "text": "The employed correlational analyses rely on age-and disease-induced variance in BF volume, cognitive function, and cortical metabolism. In this respect, MCI provides a valuable clinical study model given that it is considered a transitional phase between normal cognitive aging and dementia, and has been shown to be associated with marked changes in the studied parameters Mosconi 2005; Gauthier et al. 2006; Grothe et al. 2013 ). However, MCI as a clinical entity is heterogeneous with respect to the underlying pathology. Thus, while most of the MCI subjects harbor significant cerebral amyloid pathology, indicating prodromal AD (Albert et al. 2011) , other etiologies are also common, and a significant proportion of MCI subjects develops other forms of dementia or remains clinically stable (Gauthier et al. 2006; Grimmer et al. 2013) . In a recent study on the same cohort, we have shown that BF atrophy is more severe in amyloid-positive MCI subjects compared with amyloid-negative MCI subjects , and this finding has already been replicated in an independent cohort (Kerbler et al. 2015) . This raises the question whether the observed associations between reduced BF volume, cortical hypometabolism, and cognitive dysfunction may be primarily driven by MCI subjects with prodromal AD. However, interaction analyses assessing the impact of PET-measured amyloid status and APOE4 genotype on the observed associations did not reveal any significant effects, indicating that reductions in BF volume are similarly associated with cognitive deficits and cortical hypometabolism in MCI subjects with and without underlying amyloid pathology. This finding agrees with the notion that lesions of the cholinergic BF have been associated with cognitive impairments not only in AD, but across a wide range of clinical conditions, including Lewy bodyassociated dementias, Korsakow Syndrome, Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, hemorrhagic lesions, traumatic brain injury, and dementia pugilistica (Bartus et al. 1982; Rogers et al. 1985; Arciniegas 2003; Bosboom et al. 2004; Kobayashi et al. 2004; Benke et al. 2005; Schliebs and Arendt 2011) . Here, we can only speculate about the pathologic mechanisms underlying BF volume reductions in the studied MCI sample. The main pathologic correlate of cholinergic degeneration in AD is considered to be tau pathology Mesulam 2012) , and tau pathologic changes are also frequently found in aged individuals in the absence of amyloid pathology, where they are typically associated with mild cognitive deficits (Crary et al. 2014 ). Furthermore, cholinergic BF neurons in the aging brain have been reported to show impaired retrograde transport of cortical nerve growth factor as well as downregulation of its cellular receptors, and this disruption of trophic factor support is more pronounced in subjects with MCI (Strada et al. 1992; Mufson et al. 2007; Schindowski et al. 2008) . Finally, BF volume may also be influenced by other non-AD factors, such as lesions secondary to cerebrovascular disease (Gao et al. 2013) or Lewy body pathology (Lippa et al. 1999; Jellinger 2004) ."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Compared with previous postmortem studies examining correlations between antemortem cognitive deficits and detailed neuropathologic markers of BF cholinergic degeneration or cortical cholinergic depletion, the present in vivo neuroimaging approach is limited by the indirect nature of BF volumetry on MRI as a surrogate marker for cholinergic degeneration. Although great care was taken in defining the BF ROI in correspondence with histologic delineations of cholinergic forebrain nuclei , volumetric GM changes in this region may also reflect tissue changes other than cholinergic cell degeneration. However, given that cholinergic neurons are particularly vulnerable to neurodegenerative processes in normal and pathological aging Geula et al. 2008; Schliebs and Arendt 2011) , it is reasonable to assume that a large portion of the variance in BF volumes across MCI subjects may be accounted for by differences in structural integrity of cholinergic nuclei. By demonstrating significant associations with regionally selective cortical hypometabolism as well as with specific cognitive deficits in the domains of memory and attentional function, the present study further underlines the functional and clinical significance of reduced BF volumes in MCI. To ensure that these findings did not critically depend on the particular BF ROI employed, we repeated all analyses using a previously published cytoarchitectonic Cognitive Correlates of BF Atrophy in MCI Grothe et al. | 11 at Universitaetsbibliothek Rostock on April 7, 2015 http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/ mask of the cholinergic BF based on a different postmortem brain (Teipel et al. 2005) , and results were virtually identical (data not shown). However, cortical cholinergic signaling has not been assessed directly, and thus its role in the observed associations remains unclear. Although there is ample evidence that MCI is associated with neurodegenerative changes and disrupted neurotrophic regulation of the cholinergic BF Mufson et al. 2007; Geula et al. 2008) , these processes may not scale linearly with cortical cholinergic depletion, as maintained or even regionally increased choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity levels have been reported in a neuropathological study on MCI (DeKosky et al. 2002) . However, it has also been commented that ChAT activity levels may not be a good indicator of intact cholinergic transmission, and that cholinergic BF neurons in MCI are most likely rendered dysfunctional by the documented neurodegenerative processes and disruptions in trophic factor regulation (Sarter and Bruno 2002) . Future studies may employ PET-based imaging tracers of cholinergic neurotransmission (Klein et al. 2010; Kendziorra et al. 2011) to study in more detail the role of cortical cholinergic synapse function on the observed associations between BF volume, cortical hypometabolism, and cognitive deficits."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Using a multimodal in vivo neuroimaging approach in a large group of MCI subjects and normally aging controls, we found that reduced BF volume in MCI correlated with specific cognitive deficits in the domains of memory and attentional function, and was also significantly associated with hypometabolism in a widespread cortical network, mainly involving the prefrontal cortex, the medial temporal lobes, and temporo-parietal association areas. Further regression analyses demonstrated that hypometabolism in a hippocampus-posterior cingulate subnetwork mediated the association with decreased memory function, whereas hypometabolism in a largely non-overlapping frontotemporo-parietal network accounted for the association with attentional control deficits. These data based on MCI as a clinical lesion model underline the potential of multimodal imaging markers to study structure-function-cognition relationships in the living human brain and provide important in vivo evidence for an involvement of the human BF in cortical activity and cognitive function."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Material", "text": "Supplementary material can be found at: http://www.cercor. oxfordjournals.org/"}, {"section_title": "Funding", "text": "This work was supported by grants from the Interdisciplinary Faculty, Department \"Individual and Societal Ageing,\" University of Rostock, to S.J.T.
