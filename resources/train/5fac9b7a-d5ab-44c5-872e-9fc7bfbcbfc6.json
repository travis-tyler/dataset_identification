If allowed to go into effect, the reversion to 2001 law would increase the share of farm estates that owe Federal estate tax and total Federal estate tax revenues. As many as 1 of every 10 farm estates would owe estate tax in 2011, with total Federal estate taxes rising to about $2.55 billion, an increase of nearly three times the amount estimated to be owed in 2009.\nEconomic Research Service/USDA\nEconomic Research Service/USDA\nEconomic Research Service/USDA\nEconomic Research Service/USDA\nEconomic Research Service/USDA The estates of small business owners are about twice as likely as the typical estate to owe tax, and farm estates are even more likely to owe tax. The median wealth of farm households is about fi ve times that of all U.S. households. 1 As a result, a larger share of farm estates owes Federal estate tax, largely due to appreciation in land values, increases in the average size of commercial farms, and rising investment in farm machinery and equipment.\nBased on simulations using farm-level survey data (see box, \"Estate Tax Estimating Procedures\"), about 2.9 percent of the 38,234 farm estates projected for 2009 are estimated to have assets in excess of $3.5 million and would be required to fi le an estate tax return (fi g. 2). After deductions, slightly more than half of these farm estates are likely to owe tax. These taxable farm estates have an average net worth of $7.0 million, with about 85 percent of the value attributable to farm business assets, primarily farm real estate. The total amount of Federal estate taxes due from farm estates in 2009 is estimated at $683 million, with the average taxable estate owing about $1.1 million.\nThe impact of the Federal estate tax varies by farm type. A relatively larger share of commercial farms are projected to owe Federal estate taxes in 2009. The average value of farm assets for commercial farms was roughly $2.9 million in 2007, based on the most recent data available from ARMS. Thus, despite estate tax relief targeted to farmland (special-use valuation), an estimated 10 percent of all commercial farm estates are likely to owe Federal estate taxes in 2009 (fi g. 3). Commercial farms are 10 times more likely to owe Federal estate taxes than other farms. While representing only about 6 percent of all farm estates, commercial farms account for nearly 40 percent of all Federal estate taxes paid by farm estates (fi g. 4). In contrast, rural residence farms account for nearly three-fourths of all farm estates but only about one-third of Federal estate taxes.

Since the Federal individual income tax affects a broad group of farmers and the Federal estate tax can affect the ability to transfer the farm business to the next generation, changes in these two taxes are of considerable importance to the Nation's farm community. Modifi cations to tax policies can affect not only the fi nancial well-being of farm households but also the number and size of farms, their organizational structure, and their use of land, labor, and capital inputs.\nFederal tax changes affecting both individual and business income taxes have reduced average tax rates for all farm households. While nearly all farm households have benefi ted from the changes to individual tax rates and other nonbusiness deductions and credits, commercial farm (annual sales greater than $250,000) households are the primary benefi ciaries of many of the business tax provisions, including increased expensing of capital purchases, reduced tax rates on business assets, and a new deduction for manufacturers.\nChanges to Federal estate tax policies have increased the value of property that can be transferred to the next generation free of the estate tax and reduced tax rates. Special tax provisions targeted to farmers and other small business owners have provided additional benefi ts. This has reduced the number of farm estates required to fi le an estate tax return and pay tax and the amount of Federal estate taxes owed.\nWhile Federal tax policies have undergone signifi cant change in the last several years, several factors suggest that additional changes are likely over the next couple of years:\n\u2022 In both the income and estate tax area, a number of the changes enacted since 2000 are scheduled to expire in 2010. As the expiration date approaches, these policies are likely to be reexamined. Decisions regarding expiring tax provisions could affect both the tax burden and the fi nancial well-being of farm households.\n\u2022 The tax code has been increasingly viewed as a suitable vehicle to achieve a variety of social policy objectives. The fi rst-time home buyer's tax credit is a recent example. In farming, the use of tax incentives as an alternative to cash payments for participation in various conservation programs, such as tax benefi ts for conservation easements, has expanded the use of the tax code to achieve conservation policy objectives.\n\u2022 Tax reductions and incentives have been the focus of Federal tax policy over the last several years. However, the Federal budget defi cit continues to increase at a rapid rate. In the near future, this deteriorating budget situation will likely lead to a review of the various Federal tax expenditures as potential revenue-raising options to reduce the Federal budget defi cit.\nAll of these factors, as well as the inclusion of a tax title in the 2008 Farm Act, have raised awareness of the importance of Federal tax policies for the farm sector. Examining losses by size of business receipts provides additional insight into the reporting of farm losses for tax purposes. Based on IRS data, farms with business receipts less than $50,000 reported an aggregate net farm loss of $13.5 billion in 2004 (table 1) . Only those farms with sales in excess of $100,000 reported a small aggregate net farm profi t, for a total of $1.1 billion. While accounting for only about 12 percent of farmers, these farms accounted for about 80 percent of total business receipts.\nMany of those reporting farm losses are individuals whose primary occupation is something other than farming. ERS classifi es farms as rural residence farms (lifestyle, retirement, and limited-resource farms), intermediate farms (annual sales less than $250,000 and primary occupation is farming), and commercial farms (annual sales greater than $250,000). While rural residence farms report relatively high levels of adjusted gross income, three of four typically report a farm loss, and these farms account for over half of all losses reported.\nThe fact that many small rural residence and intermediate farms report losses should not suggest that changes in tax policies affecting farm income and investment are unimportant. In fact, the $20.6 billion in losses reported in 2004 is estimated to have reduced Federal income taxes on the off-farm income earned by farm households by over $3 billion. This return to farming through the tax code may partially explain the continued existence of many small farm operations despite the persistence of farm losses.\nWhile there are limits on the ability to use such losses to offset income from other sources, in most instances, losses from farming are fully used to reduce taxes on other income. The 2008 Farm Act does impose an additional limitation: the amount of farm losses an individual can use to offset nonfarm income is limited to the greater of $300,000 or the total amount of net farm income the individual has reported over the last 5 years. This limitation only applies to those farmers receiving direct, counter-cyclical, or Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) loans. Losses that are beyond the limit can be carried forward to subsequent years. The annual revenue gain from this change is estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation at less than $100 million. This suggests that most farm losses can continue to be used to offset income from other sources.\nSince rural residence and many intermediate farm households derive most of their income from nonfarm sources, these farm households are primarily affected by the changes in individual marginal income tax rates, standard deduction, and other exemption amounts and those policies affecting the tax treatment of income from nonfarm sources. In contrast, commercial farms account for a disproportionate share of total U.S. farm sales and investment and report most of the farm profi t. Thus, these farms are the primary beneficiaries of the tax changes affecting farm business income and investment. The most signifi cant changes over the last decade include reduced capital gains tax rates, increased capital expensing and bonus depreciation, and the new manufacturer's deduction. The increased deduction for self-employed health insurance and the availability of income averaging are also important changes to tax policy that affect farmers."}, {"section_title": "Reduced Capital Gains Taxes Increase Return on Farm Business Assets", "text": "The Federal income tax system has historically taxed gains on the sale of assets held for investment purposes at rates that are lower than tax rates on other sources of income. The current tax rate on capital gains is 15 percent (0 percent for taxpayers in the 15-percent-or-lower income tax brackets). This reduced rate is especially signifi cant for farmers because some assets used in farming are eligible for capital gains treatment and the amount of capital gains is increased by the ability to currently deduct certain costs, especially for livestock. Due to the combination of current expensing and the tax rate differential, as long as the losses can be used to offset other income, a breakeven or losing investment on a before-tax basis can be converted into an after-tax profi t. As a result, capital gains are a key component of income for many farmers.\nAccording to the IRS, 40 percent of all farmers report some capital gains, nearly double the share for all taxpayers. The average amount of capital gain reported by farmers is also about 50 percent higher than the average capital gain reported by other taxpayers. In 2004, the last year for which complete data are available, farmers reported net capital gains of $28.7 billion. This amount represented about 20 percent of total adjusted gross income reported by farm households. The average amount for those reporting gains was $35,900. On average, about one-third of reported gains is attributed to the sale of assets used in farming. Over 60 percent of commercial farmers reported capital gain income, accounting for 25 percent of all capital gains reported by farmers. Farmers with adjusted gross income over $250,000 also report a large amount of capital gain income. In 2004, capital gains accounted for one-third of the total income for this group. These high-income farmers accounted for nearly 70 percent of all capital gains reported by farmers and reported average capital gains of $387,000.\nThe lower tax rates for capital gains are scheduled to expire in 2010. At that time, barring further legislation, they will revert to pre-2003 rates of 10 and 20 percent. This would result in an increase in Federal income taxes owed by farmers. A large share of the increase would fall on commercial farmers and those with adjusted gross income over $250,000."}, {"section_title": "Capital Cost Recovery System Allows Most Investment To Be Expensed in Year of Purchase", "text": "Farming requires large investments in machinery, equipment, and other capital. The tax treatment of these investments is of considerable importance to the farm sector, especially commercial farmers. Prior to the Economic Growth and Taxpayer Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (2001 Act), capital purchases were eligible for an immediate expensing of up to $25,000 per year. Investments above this amount were depreciated over a specifi ed recovery period, generally 7 years (5 years in 2009) for most farm machinery and equipment.\nThe 2001 Act added a temporary 30-percent fi rst-year allowance. The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 increased the bonus fi rstyear depreciation from 30 to 50 percent of eligible investment and, more importantly, raised the annual amount of investment that can be expensed from $25,000 to $100,000 (table 2). The temporary fi rst-year bonus depreciation allowance expired, but the expensing provision was extended through 2007. The 2008 stimulus legislation increased the capital expensing amount to $250,000 per year and restored the 50-percent bonus fi rst-year depreciation allowance for 2008. The 2009 stimulus legislation has extended the $250,000 expensing amount and the 50-percent bonus depreciation through the end of 2009. Less than 1 percent of farmers annually invest more than the $250,000 expensing amount. Since investments above this amount are eligible for the bonus fi rst-year depreciation, nearly all capital investment by farmers can be written off in the current year. This increased capital expensing allowance reduces the effective tax rate on farm capital and simplifi es the recordkeeping burden associated with the depreciation of capital purchases, with commercial farmers the primary benefi ciaries.\nUnless the increased expensing amount and fi rst-year bonus depreciation are extended beyond 2009, the expensing amount will drop to $125,000 in 2010 "}, {"section_title": "Manufacturer's Deduction Provides Substantial Benefi ts for Commercial Farmers", "text": "One of the most important business changes in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was the replacement of the foreign sales corporation/extraterritorial income provisions, which allowed U.S. exporters to exclude a portion of their foreign sales income from taxation, with a new deduction for U.S. manufacturers, which is defi ned to include farmers. The foreign sales corporation provision had been declared a prohibited export subsidy by the World Trade Organization, and its replacement was required to avoid retaliatory tariffs.\nWhile few farm households directly benefi ted from the prior exclusion, about one in fi ve farm households directly benefi t from the new deduction. The deduction is equal to 6 percent of qualifying production income in 2009 and 9 percent in 2010 and later. The deduction is limited to no more than 50 percent of wages paid to hired labor. While this limitation will reduce the deduction for many smaller farms that hire little or no labor, farm households are expected to be eligible to deduct nearly $1.9 billion in 2009 and nearly $2.6 billion in 2010 when the deduction is increased to 9 percent. Commercial farm households are the primary benefi ciaries, with about two-thirds expected to benefi t, compared with about 14 percent for all other farms. While commercial farms account for only about 8 percent of all farms, they will receive about 75 percent of all the farm sector's benefi ts from the manufacturers' deduction. The average deduction for eligible commercial farm households is estimated at $13,300 for 2009."}, {"section_title": "Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction Reduces Cost of Health Insurance", "text": "The self-employed health insurance deduction was created in 1988 to give small business owners, including many farmers, tax benefi ts similar to those of employees who receive employer-deductible health insurance. This deduction is especially important for self-employed individuals who must purchase health insurance on their own.\nSince 2003, farmers and other self-employed taxpayers have been allowed to deduct 100 percent of the cost of providing health insurance for themselves and their families as long as they are not eligible for any employer-sponsored plan. The self-employed health insurance deduction is limited to the amount of the taxpayer's income from self-employment. This limitation eliminates the deduction for farmers with net farm losses.\nAbout one of eight farmers use the self-employed health insurance deduction in any given year. In 2004, these farmers deducted an average of $4,600 for a total of $1.24 billion in health insurance premiums. Over 50 percent of farm households obtain their insurance through off-farm employment of the operator or spouse, which helps account for the low number of farmers claiming the deduction. Many other farmers are over age 65 and are covered by Medicare or other government programs.\nIntermediate and commercial farmers are more likely than rural residence farmers to use the deduction. Only about 8 percent of rural residence farmers claim the deduction, primarily because these households are more likely to receive health insurance from a nonfarm job or may not qualify for the deduction given the likelihood of reporting a farm loss. The self-employed health insurance deduction allows farmers to save a portion of their premiums equal to their marginal tax rate, helping make health insurance more affordable and making the tax treatment more comparable to employersponsored plans."}, {"section_title": "Income Averaging Provides Reduced Tax Rates for Farmers With Variable Income", "text": "Under a progressive tax rate system, taxpayers whose annual income fl uctuates widely may pay higher total taxes over a multiyear period than other taxpayers with similar yet more stable income. Farm income is more variable than many other sources of income, such as wages and salaries. Variability of farm household income far exceeds that of all U.S. households, mostly due to variability in income from farming. Variability in farm income across time is attributed to fl uctuations in farm output, commodity prices, and business cycles. Farmers are allowed to use various income tax provisions to manage their tax liabilities. Cash accounting, which recognizes income and expenses when received or paid, can reduce taxable income through prepaid business expenses or deferred farm income, and well-timed capital purchases can reduce taxable income through depreciation deductions or capital expensing. While these provisions are useful in reducing income variability, they are limited by the ability of a farmer to defer sales or accelerate expenditures.\nIncome averaging can reduce the effect of a progressive tax rate system on taxpayers with variable income by allowing them to smooth their tax burdens over time through tax accounting methods that consider multiyear income. Since 1998, farmers have been eligible for income averaging. Under the current income averaging provision, a farmer can elect to shift a specifi ed amount of farm income, including gain on the sale of farm assets other than land, to the preceding 3 years and pay tax at the rate applicable to each year. The current income shifted back is spread equally among the 3 years. If the marginal tax rate was lower during 1 or more of the preceding years, a farmer may pay less tax than he or she would without the option of income averaging. The provision, however, does not allow income from previous years to be brought forward. Furthermore, although the provision is designed to reduce the effect of farm income variability, as long as some farm income is available to be shifted, the source of income variability does not need to be farm income for income averaging to be benefi cial. In 2004, an estimated 50,800 farmers saved an average of $4,434 with income averaging. The tax savings totaled $225.3 million and amounted to a 23-percent reduction in Federal income taxes for those taking advantage of the provision, compared with the amount that they would have owed without income averaging. A large share of the total tax reduction was realized by farmers with adjusted gross income over $1 million. These farmers saved an average of $264,000, for a total savings of $82.6 million, or about 37 percent of total tax savings from the income averaging provision."}, {"section_title": "Estate Taxes Reduced, But a Relatively Larger Share of Farmers Still Owe Taxes", "text": "The Federal estate tax has applied to the transfer of property at death since 1916. While the tax has been amended many times, the estate tax and the companion gift tax imposed upon transfers prior to a property owner's death have never directly affected a large percentage of taxpayers. Under the current Federal estate tax system, individuals can transfer up to a specifi ed amount in money and other property without incurring Federal estate tax liability. The estate of a decedent who, at death, owns assets in excess of the estate tax exemption amount ($3.5 million in 2009) must fi le a Federal estate tax return. However, only those returns that have a taxable estate above the exempt amount after deductions for expenses, debts, and bequests to a surviving spouse or charity are subject to tax at a graduated rate, up to a current maximum of 45 percent.\nIn 2009, total Federal estate and gift tax revenues are estimated at about $26 billion, accounting for about 1 percent of total Federal tax revenue. While the aggregate importance of the Federal estate tax is small relative to other Federal Government revenue sources, the potential effect of the tax on farmers and other small business owners has been a major concern. Over the years, a number of targeted provisions have been enacted to reduce the burden of the estate tax on these groups. These include a special provision that allows farm real estate to be valued at its farm use value rather than at its fair market value, an installment payment provision, and a special deduction for family-owned business interests. A provision aimed at encouraging farmers and other landowners to donate an easement or other restriction on development has provided additional estate tax savings. These provisions have reduced the potential impact of estate taxes on the transfer of a farm or other small business to the next generation.\nProviding tax relief to farmers and other small business owners was a primary impetus for the 2001 Act. The Act reduced Federal estate tax rates and substantially increased the amount of property that can be transferred to the next generation free of Federal estate tax, culminating in the tax's complete repeal in 2010. However, like many other provisions in the 2001 Act, the estate tax changes will sunset (expire) at the end of 2010.\nSince passage of the legislation, the amount exempted from the estate tax has gradually increased from $675,000 in 2001 to $3.5 million in 2009 (table  3) . As a result, both the number of estates required to fi le a tax return and the number of taxable returns have dropped dramatically. Only about 9,600 estates (0.4 percent of all estates) are expected to owe Federal estate tax in 2009, down from 51,766 in 2001. During this same period, Federal estate tax revenues have declined, but only by about 25 percent. This illustrates the fact that most of the Federal estate tax is paid by the largest estates, which continue to be taxable even at the higher exemption levels. In 2005, estates with a gross value over $5 million represented only about 14 percent of all the estates required to fi le a return, but they accounted for over 60 percent of Federal estate tax revenue."}, {"section_title": "Estate Tax Estimating Procedures", "text": "Estate "}, {"section_title": "Special Provisions Benefi t Farmers", "text": "Concerns that Federal estate taxes might cause the breakup of some familyowned farms and small businesses led to the enactment of two special provisions in the Tax Reform Act of 1976. At that time, the exemption amount was only $120,000 and the top tax rate was 70 percent. These targeted provisions-the special-use valuation and the installment payment of estate taxes-reduce the impact of Federal estate taxes on farms with estates valued above the basic exemption amount.\nSpecial-Use Valuation. The value of property for Federal estate tax purposes is generally the fair market value on the date of the property owner's death. However, if certain conditions are satisfi ed, the estate's real property that is used solely for farming or other closely held business may be valued at the property's value as a farm or business rather than at its fair market value. For the property to qualify for the special-use valuation, farmland must be transferred to a qualifi ed heir, the land must have been used as a farm for 5 years during the 8-year period ending with the decedent's death, and the decedent or a member of the decedent's family must have participated in the farm business. In addition, the value of the qualifi ed real property must equal at least 25 percent of the estate and the combined value of the real and other business property must be at least 50 percent of the total gross value of the estate.\nFor qualifying farms, special-use valuation can reduce the value of the real property portion of estates by 40 to 70 percent, with the largest reductions occurring for farmland having residential or commercial development potential. Based on information published by the IRS, the average reduction in value for qualifying estates in 2001 was 50 percent. The maximum reduction in value for estates of those dying in 2009 is $1 million. At current Federal estate tax rates, the potential estate tax savings available under special-use value could be as much as $450,000. However, all or a portion of the estate tax benefi ts obtained under the special-use valuation provision must be repaid if the property is sold to a nonfamily member or if the property ceases to be used for farming within 10 years of the decedent's death."}, {"section_title": "Installment Payment of Estate Taxes.", "text": "Federal estate taxes generally must be paid within 9 months of the date of the property owner's death. The installment payment provision was enacted out of concern that the heirs of family farmers and small business owners might have diffi culty paying taxes on land and other relatively illiquid business assets. Under the provision, if at least 35 percent of an estate's value is a farm or closely held business, estate taxes may be paid over 14 years and 9 months, with interest due only for the fi rst 5 years. In 2009, the interest rate on the fi rst $1.33 million in taxable value (above the basic exemption and other exclusions) of farm or other closely held business assets is 2 percent, with slightly higher rates owed on amounts above $1.33 million. This installment payment provision, combined with the increase in the amount of property that can be transferred tax free, greatly reduces the liquidity problem that some farm heirs might otherwise experience as a result of Federal estate taxes. share of their estate in real estate or farm or other closely held business interests.\nThe Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 provided two additional provisions that have helped to reduce the impact of the estate tax on farmers. These include an estate tax exclusion for land subject to a conservation easement and a deduction for family-owned businesses.\nExclusion for Land Subject to Conservation Easement. Under this provision, farmers and other landowners can exclude up to 40 percent of the value of land subject to a qualifi ed conservation easement for estate tax purposes.\nTo qualify for the exclusion, the decedent or a member of his or her family must have owned the land for at least 3 years prior to the decedent's date of death. They also must have made a qualifi ed conservation contribution, such as a perpetual restriction or easement on the use of real property for conservation purposes, to a charity or other qualifying organization. A conservation purpose is defi ned as the preservation of (1) land for the general public's outdoor recreation or education; (2) a natural habitat; or (3) open space for the scenic enjoyment of the general public or in furtherance of a governmental conservation policy.\nThe maximum estate tax exclusion for qualifi ed landowners under this provision is $500,000. This is in addition to the reduction in the land's value resulting from the easement itself. Thus, if the value of the easement represents a large share of the land's market value, the total reduction in value for estate tax purposes can be signifi cantly higher than $500,000. Donating a conservation easement may be an especially attractive option for farmers near urban areas who want to keep their land in farming. In 2005, landowners made 2,307 charitable donations of conservation easements. While the estate tax benefi ts from these contributions is unclear, their total value was $1.8 billion.\nDeduction for Qualifi ed Family-Owned Businesses. The 1997 Act also included a special deduction for farmers and other small business owners. This provision allowed a deduction for the fi rst $675,000 of value for qualifi ed family-owned business interests. The deduction is in addition to the basic exemption and any benefi ts from special-use valuation. However, the total amount excludable under this provision and the basic exemption is limited to $1.3 million. Since the basic exemption was raised to $1.5 million in 2004, the special deduction was repealed that year. If the estate tax provisions are allowed to expire and revert to pre-2001 law, the family business deduction will once again apply. However, since the basic exempt amount would be $1 million, the maximum benefi t of the family business deduction would be $300,000."}, {"section_title": "Current Law Provides for Repeal and Uncertainty", "text": "Under the 2001 Act, the Federal estate tax is repealed completely in 2010. However, since the 2001 estate tax changes are scheduled to expire at the end of 2010, this repeal is only temporary. The resurrected tax in 2011 reverts to the law in place prior to the 2001 changes. As a result, the exempt amount would return to $1 million and the top tax rate would revert to 55 percent. This situation not only creates uncertainty, but it also raises equity concerns regarding the fairness of providing such disparate treatment for similar estates depending upon the date of death, especially when they may be only days apart.\nIf it occurs, the reversion to pre-2001 law will increase the share of estates that owe Federal estate tax and will result in signifi cantly higher Federal estate tax revenues. The share of estates that would owe tax under a reversion to pre-2001 law is estimated to increase to about 2.5 percent of all estates, with total tax liability more than doubling to over $50 billion.\nThe impact on farm estates is expected to be even larger. Since 2000, farm equity has more than doubled, primarily due to the increased value of farm real estate. Farmland values have increased by an average of 14 percent annually since 2004. As a result, under current law, it is estimated that as many as 1 of every 10 farm estates would owe estate tax in 2011 (fi g. 5). Total estate taxes that year could increase to about $2.55 billion-nearly 300 percent more than the estimated amount owed by farm estates in 2009.\nIn addition to repealing the estate tax, the 2001 Act changed the treatment of unrealized gains at death, effective with estate tax repeal. Under current law, the basis (which is the value used to determine gain or loss) of assets acquired from a decedent is stepped up to the fair market value at the Federal Tax Policies and Farm Households / EIB-54\nEconomic Research Service/USDA date of death. This \"step-up in basis rule\" essentially eliminates the recognition of income on the appreciation of the property that occurred prior to the property owner's death. This change can be especially important for assets, such as farmland, that are typically held for long periods and have appreciated considerably.\nUpon repeal of the estate tax in 2010, the step-up in basis rule is replaced with a carryover of the decedent's basis with an added amount of up to $1.3 million (plus an additional $3 million for transfers to a surviving spouse). This change will add to compliance burdens because it will be necessary to determine the cost or other basis of inherited assets. In farming, these assets may have been held for several decades with limited documentation on their original cost or the method in which they were acquired. The heirs of some farm estates that would owe no Federal estate tax or capital gains tax under current law would be faced with this compliance burden and could owe taxes upon the sale of the inherited assets. The number of estates with unrealized gain above the step-up amount is estimated to exceed the number of estates that currently owe estate taxes. While most of these gains would be taxed at capital gains rates that are substantially lower than estate tax rates, the tax would be triggered only upon the sale of the inherited assets, so some heirs would be discouraged from selling inherited assets, creating a lock-in effect.\nWith repeal and resurrection of the estate tax approaching, support is growing for a substantial permanent increase in the exempt amount combined with the retention of the stepped-up basis at death treatment for inherited assets. The 2010 President's Budget would make the current $3.5 million exemption amount and tax rates permanent and retain the stepped-up basis treatment for inherited assets. This would limit the share of estates subject to tax to less than one-half of 1 percent of all estates and to between 1 and 2 percent for the estates of farmers. It would also reduce some of the uncertainty and inequity created by the temporary repeal and sunset provisions applicable under current law."}]
