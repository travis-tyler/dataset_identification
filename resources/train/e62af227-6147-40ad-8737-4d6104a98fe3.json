[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The objectives of this study were to estimate the risk of illness for raw milk consumers due to Listeria monocytogenes in raw milk sold by permitted dealers, and the risk for people on farms who consume raw milk. Three scenarios were evaluated for raw milk sold by dealers: raw milk purchased directly from bulk tanks, from on-farm stores, and from retail. To assess the effect of mandatory testing of raw milk by regulatory agencies, the number of listeriosis cases per year was compared where no raw milk testing was done, only a screening test to issue a permit was conducted, and routine testing was conducted and milk was recalled if it was L. monocytogenes positive. The median number of listeriosis cases associated with consumption of raw milk from bulk tanks, farm stores, and retail for an intermediate-age population was 6.6 | 10 27 , 3.8 | 10\n, and 5.1 | 10 25 cases per year, respectively. In populations with high susceptibility, the estimated median number of cases per year was 2.7 | 10 27 (perinatal, i.e., pregnant women and their fetuses or newborns) and 1.4 | 10 26 (elderly) for milk purchased from bulk tanks, 1.5 | 10 25"}, {"section_title": "", "text": ", and 5.1 | 10 25 cases per year, respectively.

For raw milk consumed on farms, the median number of listeriosis cases was 1.4 | 10 27 cases per year. A greater risk of listeriosis was associated with consumption of raw milk obtained from retail and farm stores as compared with milk obtained from bulk tanks. This was likely due to additional time-temperature combination steps in the retail and farm store models, which increased the chances for growth of L. monocytogenes in raw milk. A close relationship between prevalence of L. monocytogenes in raw milk and the values of disease incidence was observed. Hence, a reduction in the number of cases per year in all populations was observed when a raw milk-testing program was in place, especially when routine testing and recalling of milk was conducted.\nListeriosis is an uncommon but severe human disease caused by the foodborne bacterial pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes. Healthy adults are not at high risk for listeriosis and generally do not show serious symptoms of the disease. Listeriosis typically occurs in susceptible individuals such as pregnant women (and their unborn children), the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems (36) (37) (38) . Milk and dairy products have been implicated in several foodborne listeriosis outbreaks in the United States (6, 11, 15, 19, 36, 38) . Although none of the reported listeriosis outbreaks has been linked to consumption of raw milk, it is apparent that healthy adults may only exhibit flu-like or gastrointestinal symptoms (45, 48 ) that generally do not require medical attention. Furthermore, as most listeriosis cases are sporadic and have a long incubation period, it may be difficult to quickly attribute illnesses to consumption of raw milk. All these factors could lead to an underreporting or underestimation of the actual number of listeriosis cases due to consumption of raw milk.\nOther foodborne illnesses outbreaks, such as those caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter, and Salmonella, have been linked to consumption of raw milk (7-9, 16, 29) or dairy products manufactured with raw milk (5, 10) . Indeed, the majority of foodborne disease outbreaks attributed to raw milk consumption have occurred in states where raw milk sale is allowed (23, 41) . Despite the frequent reports of foodborne illnesses linked to consumption of raw milk, the sale of raw milk is currently legal in 29 states in the United States (41) .\nAlthough raw milk sales are prohibited in several states, raw milk advocates can still obtain this product through cow-share or cow-leasing programs (7, 16, 41) , as milk purchased ''to feed animals'' (3, 41) , or by traveling to neighboring states where raw milk sales are legal. In addition, raw milk or other dairy products provided during farm tours (1, 4) and raw milk used for cheese preparation, which was illegally sold by a dairy (38) , have also been linked to foodborne outbreaks. Furthermore, a large number of dairy producers have reported consuming raw milk (26) (27) (28) , which puts them at increased risk of acquiring listeriosis or other milkborne illnesses.\nA risk assessment (RA) conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), which was published in 2003 (55) , estimated the relative risk of illness or death per serving and per annum due to consumption of 23 different ready-to-eat food categories (e.g., unpasteurized and pasteurized fluid milk, deli meats, and smoked seafood) contaminated with L. monocytogenes. Based on the relative risk ranking of these ready-to-eat food categories, this RA classified unpasteurized fluid milk in the ''high-risk'' group per-serving basis and in the ''moderate-risk'' group per-annum basis (which reflects the low number of servings per annum in the total U.S. population for unpasteurized fluid milk).\nAlthough a few RA studies of listeriosis due to consumption of dairy products (i.e., soft cheese) (2, 47) have been conducted, reports for quantitative RA of listeriosis due to consumption of raw milk are currently not available except for the FDA-FSIS RA (55) . Although the FDA-FSIS RA (55) quantified relative risk of different categories of ready-to-eat foods (including unpasteurized fluid milk), it did not include assessment of risk of listeriosis attributed to consumption of raw milk purchased from different markets (i.e., directly from farm, farm stores, or retail stores) or estimation of the risk of listeriosis due to consumption of raw milk by dairy producers and farm personnel. The objectives of this study were (i) to estimate the risk of listeriosis for raw milk consumers due to the presence of L. monocytogenes in raw milk sold by permitted raw milk dealers and for people who consume raw milk on farms, (ii) to assess the effect of mandatory testing of raw milk by regulatory agencies, and (iii) to evaluate the risk of listeriosis associated with the consumption of raw milk from farms with a known high prevalence of L. monocytogenes in bulk tank milk."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "Overview of raw milk commercialization pathways and risk assessment model. Consumers can obtain raw milk from several different sources. For example, in some states, raw milk sale by licensed dealers is allowed only on the farm premises. In New York State, raw milk can be purchased at licensed farms, where consumers either bring their own containers and have them filled directly from the bulk tank in their presence, or purchase bottled raw milk from on-farm stores. In other states such as California, Maine, and Pennsylvania, raw milk can also be purchased from retail stores (18) . To estimate the risk of listeriosis attributable to consumption of raw milk that may be obtained from different licensed raw milk commercialization pathways, we investigated and modeled the following three scenarios: (i) raw milk purchased directly from farm bulk tanks, (ii) raw milk purchased from a farm store, and (iii) raw milk purchased from a retail store (detailed in Fig. 1 ). Additionally, we also modeled and estimated the risk of listeriosis due to consumption of raw milk on farms by dairy producers and farm personnel.\nScenarios of raw milk purchased directly from the farm bulk tank (DP), purchased from farm stores (FS), retail stores (R), and raw milk consumed on farms (FC). In the first scenario (DP), it was assumed that customers brought their own containers to the farm and raw milk was purchased by filling their containers directly from the bulk tank. The growth and concentration of L. monocytogenes in milk at each of the time intervals between purchase and consumption were calculated as shown in Figure 1 . For FS, an additional growth step during storage and display at the farm stores (G1 [FS] ) was modeled as compared with DP (Fig. 1) .\nFor quantification of the growth of L. monocytogenes in the R scenario, it was assumed that the raw milk farms were in charge of handling the bottling, shipping, and distribution of their own products to retail stores. Growth of L. monocytogenes in this scenario was calculated during holding of bottled milk before shipping to retail stores (G1 [R]), during transportation of milk to retail stores (G2 [R]), and during storage at retail stores (G3 [R]). Growth occurring during additional steps was calculated as described for DP and FS (Fig. 1) .\nFor raw milk consumed on farms by farm personnel (FC), it was assumed that milk was transported from the bulk tank to the house, and it was assumed that dairy producers or farm personnel lived on the farm premises. Hence, no transportation time or temperature was accounted for, and it was assumed that no delay occurred in relocation of milk from the tank to the home refrigerator (Fig. 1) . Concentrations of L. monocytogenes in the milk for all scenarios were calculated after each growth step, as shown in Figure 1 .\nInitial concentration and growth of L. monocytogenes in raw milk. Initial concentration of L. monocytogenes in bulk tank milk (IC) was characterized as a cumulative distribution (Table 1) by using reported data of L. monocytogenes contamination in raw bovine milk (39, 55) . For this cumulative distribution, it was assumed that the concentration of L. monocytogenes in contaminated bulk tank milk had a minimum of 21.4 log CFU/ml (0.04 CFU/ml) and a maximum of 2.18 log CFU/ml (150 CFU/ml). Concentrations of L. monocytogenes in bulk tank milk of 21.4, 1, and 2 log CFU/ml had cumulative probabilities of 0.926, 0.972, and 0.999, respectively. No further growth of L. monocytogenes was calculated, because the initial concentration was obtained from data where bulk tank milk was sampled at dairy plants before pasteurization (55) or during pickup (39) . Hence, any growth that might have occurred while milk was stored in the tank was assumed accounted for.\nFor all four of the above-mentioned scenarios, growth of L. monocytogenes in raw milk was calculated based on the equation described by Koutsomanis et al. (31) for L. monocytogenes growth in pasteurized milk, with modifications.\nAfter milk was collected from milk tank (Fig. 1, C1 ):\nIf log(N t ) wMPD, then log(N t )~MPD \u00f01\u00de\nFor the following steps ( Fig. 1 , C2 through C5):\nIf log(C prev ) wMPD, then log(N t )~log(C prev )\nElse, log(N t )~m max ln(10) Because L. monocytogenes is a psychrotolerant bacterial pathogen, it can be assumed that if it were present in the bulk tank milk, L. monocytogenes would have already adapted to the holding temperature (,4uC) and would not be expected to go through a lag phase prior to exponential growth. Hence, lag phase was not considered in the calculation of L. monocytogenes growth (20, 59), and growth of L. monocytogenes was considered exponential in each of the subsequent steps of the model. This approach represented a conservative choice from a public health standpoint, because underestimation of growth might have occurred if lag phase was included in the growth calculation, without accounting for holding time of milk on farm tanks. a Personal communication with vice-president of manufacturing of a retail chain that collects, pasteurizes, and sells milk from dairy producers. b Personal communication with dairy plant manager of a farm that sells raw milk from a farm store. The minimum storage time of raw milk in this farm store before sale corresponded to the 24-h holding time while waiting for results of milk laboratory tests and the maximum corresponded to the ''sell-by'' date of raw milk. c Distance and time of transportation were estimated using the address of a raw milk farm and the address of each of the retail stores that sell their raw milk provided in the farm's Web site (13) . d Based on the approximate ''purchase-by'' date reported by a raw milk farm that distributes raw milk to retail stores (14) .\nTime and temperature distributions. Time and temperature data used to describe the distributions of these parameters in our model were obtained from the literature, from on-line sources, and through personal communication with a raw milk producer, a raw milk plant manager, and from a retail chain that sells their own dairy (pasteurized) products (to protect confidentiality, names of individuals and retail chain were not disclosed). Compiled data were fitted with BestFit software (Palisade Corp., Ithaca, NY) to characterize time and temperature distributions. Triangular distribution frequently provided the best fit to our data (chi-square test); therefore, this distribution was used to define time and temperature distributions. In addition, at some steps where not enough data were available for fitting procedure to characterize these distributions, uniform distributions were used. Distributions for time and temperature, parameters, and their values are detailed in Table 1 .\nInsufficient data were available on storage temperature of milk at farm stores. Hence, the temperature of raw milk prior to sales in farm stores was assumed to be equal to the temperatures reported in the ''U.S. Cold-Temperature Evaluation'' conducted by EcoSure (17) for semisolid dairy products (yogurt) sold at the retail level (17) . For scenario R, information regarding holding time and temperature of milk at the farm before shipping to retail stores was provided by the vice president of manufacturing of a retail chain that sells pasteurized milk ( Table 1 ). The temperature of the milk during transportation from farms to retail stores was modeled with data for milk transportation from a distribution center to retail stores reported by Koutsomanis et al. (31) ( Table 1) .\nTime of transportation from farm to retail stores was calculated by using a licensed raw milk farm from California that distributes milk to retail stores as an example. By means of a Webbased map system (22), the distance and time of transportation was estimated by using the location of the farm and the location of each of the retail stores that sell their raw milk, the latter of which was provided on the farm's Web site (13) . To model this distribution (Table 1) , direct transportation of raw milk from farm to the destination store was assumed (i.e., stops during transportation, and delivery of milk to more than one store were not considered because of unavailability of data), and the fastest route was used when more than one route was available.\nThe minimum time of display in retail stores was set at 24 h to account for the time it took to unload the trucks, back room storage, and display before purchase. The maximum time of raw milk display in retail stores was defined based on the approximate ''purchase-by'' date reported by a raw milk farm in California ( Table 1) .\nCalculation of L. monocytogenes dose per serving. For all scenarios, the L. monocytogenes dose per serving was calculated by multiplying the final concentration of L. monocytogenes in raw milk (in CFU per milliliter) after storage in home refrigerators by the serving size. The raw milk serving size was modeled as a cumulative distribution by using the data of unpasteurized milk consumption reported by the FDA-FSIS RA model (same as a serving size of pasteurized milk) (55) . The FDA-FSIS model reported consumption of milk in grams instead of milliliters; therefore, the serving size in our model was converted to milliliters by using a milk density value of 1.025 g/ml (25) .\nTo estimate the probability of illnesses due to consumption of raw milk from licensed raw milk dealers, an exponential doseresponse model was used (46, 57) , and the probability of illness per serving was calculated by combining the dose estimate and contamination prevalence (46):\nwhere P is the probability of illnesses (severe listeriosis), D is the dose per serving (CFU per serving), and r is the parameter describing the probability that one L. monocytogenes cell causes illness: r~8. 215 for the elderly population (57). P serv is the probability of illness per serving, and prev corresponds to the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in raw milk (percentage of positive samples).\nFor raw milk sold by licensed dealers, P serv was calculated for each of the three scenarios by using the overall prevalence of L. monocytogenes in raw milk (2.1%), based on the results of laboratory testing of milk samples collected between 2003 and 2009 from all licensed raw milk farms in New York State. These data were provided by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, and corresponded to the results of monthly tests that are conducted on every licensed raw milk farm in New York State (49) .\nP serv for dairy producers and farm personnel on U.S. dairy farms was calculated assuming a prevalence of L. monocytogenes in bulk tank milk of 6.5%, based on the overall prevalence of the pathogen in bulk tank milk from dairy farms in 21 U.S. states (56) .\nAdditionally, the number of listeriosis cases per year due to consumption of licensed raw milk were calculated by multiplying P serv in each scenario by the number of servings per year for every target population (intermediate-age, perinatal, and elderly populations) (46) . The numbers of annual raw milk servings used in our model were 3.60 | 10 8 , 2.5 | 10 6 , and 7.5 | 10 7 for the intermediate, perinatal, and elderly populations, respectively (55) .\nThe number of listeriosis cases per year due to raw milk consumption on farms was calculated with the number of servings per year among dairy producers and farm workers. For this calculation, it was estimated that this population had 0.91 raw milk serving per person per day, based on the annual number of pasteurized milk servings in the U.S. population reported in the FDA-FSIS RA model (8.7 | 10 10 servings in the United States per year) (55) . In addition, the number of pasteurized milk servings per year instead of raw milk servings was used to calculate the number of listeriosis cases per year for farm consumers to better reflect the regular raw milk consumption behavior by this specific population.\nThe number of raw milk consumers on U.S. dairy farms was estimated to be 8.2 | 10 4 , based on the estimate by Jayarao and Henning (28) and Hoe and Ruegg (26) that 60% of dairy producers drink raw milk, and that 24.2% of producers allowed their employees to consume raw milk on the farm (27) . The total population of U.S. dairy producers in our model was assumed to be 69,890 (1 producer per farm), based on the number of dairy farms reported in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Census of Agriculture (53) . The number of farm personnel was assumed to be 165,688: total number of milk cows (9, 894, 291) Prevalence of L. monocytogenes in raw milk and effect of testing by regulatory agencies on the number of listeriosis cases per year. New York State raw milk regulations were used as an example to assess the effect of testing and monitoring for the presence of L. monocytogenes on licensed raw milk farms. A dairy producer must submit a milk sample to be tested for the presence of pathogens, including L. monocytogenes, to the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets before being permitted to sell raw milk (49) . If a raw milk permit is granted, the permit holders must then submit a monthly sample to the Food Laboratory Division to be tested for the presence of L. monocytogenes and other zoonotic pathogens. If a milk sample from a particular farm is positive for L. monocytogenes, then the milk from that farm is recalled. Once a positive test is obtained, milk sales are prohibited until a subsequent milk sample is negative, or until four consecutive samples are negative if the pathogen was found in two consecutive samples. After milk sales are resumed, weekly samples are collected from the farm for a 4-week period. A key assumption in our model was that if a bulk tank milk sample is L. monocytogenes positive, the levels of contamination would be at least 0.04 CFU/ml of milk, which is the detection limit for culturing a 25-ml sample of milk.\nTo assess the effect of raw milk testing on the number of listeriosis cases associated with raw milk consumption, the probability of a listeriosis case per raw milk serving and the annual cases of listeriosis were compared when (i) no raw milk testing was done, (ii) only an initial screening test for the purpose of issuing a permit was conducted, and (iii) routine testing was conducted and milk was recalled if found positive for L. monocytogenes. For this comparison, P serv (equation 3) was calculated with the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in raw milk in each of the testing conditions.\nThe effect of not testing the raw milk prior to sales was calculated with the overall prevalence of L. monocytogenes in bulk tank milk of U.S. farms (6.5%), based on the results of the National Animal Health Monitoring System survey conducted on U.S. dairy farms in 2002 (56). To account for the effect of a screening test, P serv was calculated with a 2.1% prevalence of L. monocytogenes in raw milk (overall prevalence in licensed raw milk in New York State). Finally, P serv was calculated with a 1.3% prevalence of L. monocytogenes in raw milk, which corresponded to the prevalence from milk that was actually commercialized (i.e., samples collected from raw milk farms during recall periods were not accounted for), based on the New York State guidelines described earlier for raw milk samples that test positive for L. monocytogenes.\nThe annual number of listeriosis cases due to raw milk consumption under different raw milk testing conditions was calculated with the number of raw milk servings per year, as described earlier.\nRisk assessment model of listeriosis due to consumption of raw milk from farms with high prevalence of L. monocytogenes in bulk tank milk. Two ''what-if'' scenarios of the risk of listeriosis associated with consumption of raw milk from farms with a known high prevalence of L. monocytogenes in bulk tank milk were analyzed.\nThe first scenario described the risk of listeriosis due to raw milk consumption from a licensed raw milk farm, including the effect of L. monocytogenes prevalence on each of the commercialization pathways (direct purchase, farm stores, retail purchase). For this scenario, a prevalence of 35.3% was assumed, which corresponded to the highest prevalence of L. monocytogenes found among the licensed farms in New York State (50) . Milk samples were collected monthly from this high-prevalence raw milk farm between November 2006 and October 2008.\nThe second scenario described the risk of listeriosis among dairy producers, farm personnel, and their families if the milk consumed is from a dairy farm (whose milk is not intended to be sold as raw milk) in which L. monocytogenes is frequently found in milk samples (33, 34, 44) Model simulations and analyses. The RA models for all scenarios (as detailed in Table 2 ) were simulated with the Monte Carlo simulation technique by using the risk analysis software @Risk 5.5 (Palisade Corp.). All models were simulated for 100,000 iterations. Previously published reports (25, 43, 47) relevant to our study used the same number of iterations. Latin Hypercube sampling method was utilized to sample different values for input parameters from their corresponding distributions. Sensitivity analyses were performed to identify important parameters affecting the risk of listeriosis by running @Risk sensitivity analysis. For sensitivity analysis, Spearman's correlation coefficients were used to determine the effect of model parameters (i.e., magnitudes of the inputs) on the probability of listeriosis per raw milk serving and the number of illnesses in the U.S. population per year. For a model parameter, the same distribution used in the model simulation was also used in the sensitivity analysis. Different values for the parameters (input values) were sampled from the corresponding distributions, and the effect of the inputs were evaluated on the risk of listeriosis."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Estimated number of listeriosis cases due to consumption of raw milk sold by permitted raw milk dealers and due to consumption of raw milk on farms by farm personnel. The probability of illnesses per raw milk serving from each commercialization pathway as well as the number of cases per year is shown in (perinatal), and 1.0 | 10 24 (elderly) for R. Both the probability of illnesses per serving and the number of listeriosis cases per year were greater for raw milk purchased from retail stores than was the probability of illnesses and the number of cases per year for milk purchased from farm stores. The lowest probabilities of listeriosis per serving and the number of annual cases were observed when raw milk was purchased directly from farm tanks (Table 3) . For all scenarios modeled, the probability of illness per serving was greater for perinatal populations than it was for elderly or intermediate populations, while the number of listeriosis cases per year was greater in elderly populations (Table 3) .\nA reduction in the number of cases per year for all populations was observed when a raw milk testing program was in place, especially when routine testing (i.e., monthly testing of one sample of milk, after obtaining a raw milk permit) and recall of milk was conducted (Fig. 2) .

When requiring only an initial milk screening test prior to issuing a raw milk sales permit, a 3.1-fold reduction in the median number of listeriosis cases per year was observed, compared with raw milk in which no initial testing was performed. Adding routine testing, monitoring, and recall (if positive) of milk after a raw milk permit was issued in addition of the initial screening of milk resulted in an additional 1.6-fold reduction of the annual listeriosis cases (Fig. 2) . The probability of listeriosis per raw milk serving and the annual number of listeriosis cases associated with consumption of raw milk on dairy farms are shown in Table 4 . The median number of listeriosis cases per year associated with raw milk consumed by dairy producers and farm personnel on farms corresponded to 1.4 | 10 27 .\nEstimated number of listeriosis cases due to consumption of raw milk from farms with high prevalence of L. monocytogenes in bulk tank milk. The probability of listeriosis per raw milk serving associated with consumption of licensed raw milk from a high prevalence farm for each of the commercialization pathways is shown in Table 5 . For all scenarios and in all target populations, the probability of listeriosis per raw milk serving if milk came from this high prevalence farm was approximately 17 times greater than was the probability of listeriosis associated with milk from all raw milk farms (Table 3) .\nProbabilities of listeriosis per serving and the number of listeriosis cases among dairy producers and farm personnel who consume raw milk from a farm with high prevalence of L. monocytogenes in raw milk are shown in Table 4 . A similar trend as that observed in licensed raw milk was observed in raw milk consumed on a high-prevalence farm. The probability of listeriosis and the number of cases were approximately four times greater than those numbers observed in all dairy farms. This increase is a direct function of the increase in the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in milk from 6.5 to 25.4% (Table 4 ).\nEffect of model parameters affecting the risk of listeriosis cases. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the parameter with the greatest effect on the probability of listeriosis and the annual number of listeriosis cases for all scenarios (licensed raw milk and raw milk that was consumed on farms by dairy producers and farm personnel) was the temperature of the home refrigerator (Fig. 3) . The order of importance of the parameters after home refrigerator temperature was time of storage in the home refrigerator and serving size for raw milk purchased directly from milk tanks and milk consumed on farms (Figs. 3 and  4) . For raw milk that was commercialized in stores (farm stores and retail), the temperature and time of storage and display at the store were the second and third most important parameters affecting the risk of listeriosis, respectively (Fig. 3) ."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this RA model of listeriosis associated with consumption of raw milk, the probability of illnesses per raw milk serving was low, based on the classification criterion of 2003 FDA-FSIS risk assessment for L. monocytogenes in ready-to-eat foods (55) , where ,1 predicted case of listeriosis per billion servings was considered low. However, the risk of listeriosis increased when more potential growth steps were included in the model. For example, the probability of illness and the median number of cases was greater for raw milk that was purchased from retail stores than it was for milk purchased directly from farm tanks. Given the overall prevalence of L. monocytogenes in raw milk and the number of servings per year used in this model, the expected risk of listeriosis (95th percentile) for the intermediate-age population is approximately 1 case in the population every 58 years if raw milk is purchased directly from milk tanks. The risk of listeriosis for the perinatal and elderly populations was estimated as 1 case every 142 and 28 years, respectively, if raw milk is obtained from this source. Conversely, if raw milk is purchased from a retail store, the estimated risks of listeriosis for the intermediate, perinatal, and elderly populations correspond to 14, 5.8, and 29 cases per year, respectively.\nThis increased risk could be explained by the ability of L. monocytogenes to grow at refrigeration temperatures a DP, milk purchased directly from farm bulk tanks; FS, milk purchased from farm stores; R, milk purchased from retail stores. b Values are the median, 5th percentile, and 95th percentile obtained after 100,000 iterations by using @Risk 5.5.\n(52). In our model, sensitivity analysis showed that the home refrigerator temperature was the most important parameter affecting the number of cases associated with raw milk consumption. For example, increasing the temperature of the home refrigerator from 4 to 8uC resulted in an approximately sevenfold increase in the number of cases (data not shown). In our model, temperature and time of milk storage were treated as independent parameters. However, in reality there might be some correlation between these two parameters. Hence, raw milk stored at high temperatures for extended periods might be spoiled and not consumed. Another important consideration is that in our model, raw milk purchased directly from farms was more likely to be consumed sooner than was milk purchased from a retail store because of additional storage time during display in the latter. As more time-temperature combination steps are included in the model, the chances of growth of L. monocytogenes in the raw milk increases as well, with a subsequent increase in probability of illness per serving. Although outbreaks of milkborne listeriosis are infrequent, when they occur, a large number of cases are usually involved (15, 19) . The annual number of cases in our model reflects what has actually happened in past listeriosis outbreaks that were linked to milk consumption (11, 15, 19) . Due to the skewness of the probability distributions (right skewed), most of the time the probability of having listeriosis cases due to raw milk consumption is very low, but the risk of sporadic outbreaks with a large number of cases exists, as reflected in the upper quartile of distributions.\nOverall, the annual number of listeriosis cases due to raw milk consumption is predicted to be low by this model. It is difficult to validate this finding, as there is a lack of data about the actual number of raw milk consumers. In our study, the number of annual servings for raw milk corresponded to 0.5% of the total milk consumption in the United States (55) . This estimated number of servings was based on studies conducted over a decade ago, which may not reflect the current trends in raw milk consumption. For example, in New York State, the number of licensed raw milk farms increased from 3 farms in 2003 to 25 in 2009 (50) , probably as a result of a growing number of raw milk consumers. Hence, owing to this underestimation in the consumption of raw milk, the predicted number of listeriosis cases per year might be underrepresented in our model.\nThe number of listeriosis cases associated with raw milk consumption on farms might also be underestimated because of insufficient data about raw milk intake in farm worker populations. In our model, only dairy producers and farms personnel are considered as raw milk consumers, as no data are available regarding raw milk consumption by their families. In a study conducted by Hoe and Ruegg (26), 40% of producers declared that people associated with surveyed farms consumed raw milk or raw milk products on a regular basis. Information regarding the number of people related to dairy farms, or number of family members of producers or farm personnel, however, is not available.\nBecause there are no field data to anchor the number of cases in our model, it was not possible to estimate precisely the absolute risk of severe listeriosis. It is therefore also not possible to conclude whether our model predictions or the FDA-FSIS model predictions are closer to the observed listeriosis cases in the United States. As expected, a close relationship between prevalence of L. monocytogenes in raw milk and the values of disease incidence was observed. As the prevalence in raw milk increased, the risk of severe listeriosis due to raw milk consumption increased as well. In our model, we assumed an L. monocytogenes detection limit of 0.04 CFU/ml when culturing 25 ml of milk. A negative test implies either the absence or the presence of L. FIGURE 2. Effect of raw milk testing on the number of listeriosis cases (median value) per year associated with raw milk consumption obtained by direct purchase from the farms, farm stores, and retail stores. N/T, no testing; R/T, testing as a screening to issue a raw milk permit; C, routine testing and recall of raw milk. N/T, R/T, and C were calculated based on the prevalence of Listeria monocytogenes in bulk tank milk on U.S. farms (6.5%), the overall prevalence of L. monocytogenes in raw milk from New York State (2.1%), and the prevalence of the pathogen in raw milk from New York State that was commercialized between 2003 and 2009 (1.3%) (milk under recall not included).\nmonocytogenes at concentrations below the detection level of the test. In addition, the effectiveness of raw milk testing might be overestimated in our model, as a positive sample at or over the detection limit might not be detected 100% of the time. This likely results in an underestimation of the actual risk of listeriosis, even though the test has a reasonable probability of having a positive sample when the average is less than the nominal detection levelPoisson-binomial probability is.\nRaw milk testing performed by regulatory agencies dramatically decreased both the probability of illness per serving and the number of annual cases of listeriosis. In addition, routine testing identifies farms with a high prevalence of L. monocytogenes in the milk. For example, the probability of listeriosis per serving if raw milk came from the farm with the highest prevalence in New York State (35.3%) was 17 times greater than was the probability observed in all raw milk farms (all milk samples collected from all farms, between 2003 and 2009). Routine testing allowed the recall of milk from this farm, which reduced the risk for the consumers. As farms that tested positive had a higher risk of testing positive again, routine testing with prohibition of raw milk sales on identification of a positive sample effectively lowered the prevalence of L. monocytogenes contamination in the raw milk supply. Because of the testing policy, one high-prevalence farm stopped selling raw milk to customers in 2008.\nScreening tests before issuing raw milk permits also proved to be a useful tool for reduction of the risk of listeriosis associated with raw milk consumption, although not as effective as a continuous raw milk surveillance program (i.e., monthly testing of raw milk). Other studies conducted by our group (33, 34) have also shown the importance of herd monitoring programs. For example, repeated bulk tank milk testing monitored the presence or absence of pathogens over time, and identified potential sources and reservoirs of L. monocytogenes on dairy farms and in bulk tank milk.\nOn the other hand, milk that it is not intended to be sold as licensed raw milk is transported to dairy processors for pasteurization. Hence, this milk is not routinely tested for L. monocytogenes and other major foodborne pathogens such as E. coli 0157:H7, Campylobacter, or Salmonella. The results of the effect of testing in our model also suggest that an increased risk of listeriosis (and other milkborne zoonotic diseases) could be expected for people who consume raw milk on farms or for raw milk consumers who obtain their milk through cow-leasing programs, as raw milk is not usually tested in this situation.\nOur RA model characterized the risk of listeriosis associated with licensed raw milk consumption for three TABLE 4 . Probability of illnesses per serving and number of listeriosis cases per year associated with consumption of raw milk on farms by dairy producers and farm personnel based on the overall prevalence of Listeria monocytogenes in bulk tank milk from U.S. dairy farms, and raw milk from a farm with a high prevalence of L. monocytogenes a DP, milk purchased directly from farm bulk tanks; FS, milk purchased from farm stores; R, milk purchased from retail stores.\ndifferent markets. Our model also allowed the comparison of the effect of each of the different commercialization pathways on the risk of listeriosis for consumers. In addition, to our knowledge, this is the first study designed to assess the risk of listeriosis among people who consume raw milk on farms, behavior that has been reported common (26) (27) (28) .\nPrevalence of L. monocytogenes in licensed raw milk in our model was based on laboratory results of raw milk samples from all licensed farms in New York State over a 7-year period, providing good insight into the actual prevalence of the pathogen in raw milk. Furthermore, all components of the path that raw milk normally follows between when it is collected from the cows and when it reaches the consumer's table were included, as an attempt to reproduce real life scenarios. An effort was made to include as much data and information specific for the raw milk industry as possible.\nAn important shortcoming in our model, however, was the lack of data available regarding the proportion of raw milk that is sold directly to consumers, sold in on-farm stores, and sold in retail stores in the United States. For example, in states in which retail sales of raw milk are allowed, raw milk may also be acquired directly from farms or other sources, as reported in the study conducted by Headrick et al. (24) in California. Although a greater percentage of raw milk is probably sold in retail stores in such states, no data about the contribution of each of the markets to the total percentage of raw milk sales are currently available. Hence, in our model, the probability and cases of listeriosis due to raw milk consumption can only be analyzed as if raw milk were sold in one of the markets (i.e., farms, farm stores, or retail) or another.\nAnother limitation of our model was the limited information available reporting quantitative data (39, 55) regarding L. monocytogenes in raw milk. Furthermore, there is no information available on the number of highly susceptible people that work on dairy farms, or susceptible family members of farm personnel and/or producers who might drink raw milk on farms. Due to the lack of data, it was assumed that all producers and/or farm personnel in our model belong to the intermediate-age population, which might not accurately reflect the composition of farm populations.\nBoth the probability of listeriosis and number of annual cases in our study differ from those reported in the FDA-FSIS RA (55) for the same food category. For example, the median numbers of listeriosis cases per raw milk serving in the FDA-FSIS model were 2.9 | 10 29 , 9.9 | 10 27 , and 2.2 | 10 28 for intermediate, perinatal, and elderly populations, respectively. In our study (Table 3) , the median probability of illness per raw milk serving in all scenarios (DP, FS, and R) was lower than those obtained in the FDA-FSIS RA (55) . Differences in the risk model and in the data used in each model, for example temperature distributions, time distributions, as well as the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in raw milk (55), might explain this disparity.\nPasteurization of milk effectively eliminates L. monocytogenes and other pathogenic organisms that could cause disease, without causing significant change to the nutritional properties of the milk (35, 42) . In a study conducted in 2000 (21) , only 0.018% of pasteurized milk samples obtained from retail stores in the United States were positive for L. monocytogenes, which is considerably lower than is the prevalence of the pathogen observed in raw milk in our study (2.1% overall prevalence) or other bulk tank milk studies conducted in different states of the United States (ranging from 2.8 to 4.6%) (27, 28) and nationwide (6.5%) (56) . Based on our study, keeping all parameters the same (except contamination prevalence) for both raw and pasteurized milk, an increase of the prevalence of L. monocytogenes from 0.018% (prevalence in pasteurized milk) (21) to 2.1% (overall prevalence in raw milk in our study) would increase the risk of listeriosis ,117 times (on a per-serving basis). However, to obtain a comparison more precise of the risk of listeriosis due to consumption of raw milk versus pasteurized milk, data regarding different parameters in pasteurized milk production-consumption chain are critically needed. Both the significantly low prevalence of L. monocytogenes as well as the low concentrations of the pathogen in pasteurized milk (if found) (21), however, could explain the low risk of listeriosis associated with consumption of pasteurized milk.\nRaw milk has been associated with many outbreaks involving pathogens such as Campylobacter, Salmonella, and E. coli O157:H7 (7, 8, 16, 29) . In addition, the presence of pathogenic bacteria in raw milk, including L. monocytogenes, has been reported frequently (51) . Hence, consumption of raw milk from any source is not recommended. However, 29 states allow raw milk sales, and many people believe raw milk consumption to be a healthier alternative to pasteurized milk consumption. Despite the low probability of acquiring listeriosis from a single raw milk serving, the serious consequences of the disease such as miscarriages, stillbirths, meningitis, or even death (19, 36) , and the high hospitalization rates attributed to listeriosis (12) should not be disregarded by raw milk consumers.\nOur study quantified the risk of listeriosis among raw milk consumers. Quantification of the risks associated with consumption of raw milk is necessary from a public health perspective, as it helps to increase the awareness of potential dangers for the health of consumers, which might contribute to reduce the risk of milkborne illnesses. For example, in a study conducted by Jayarao et al (27) , raw milk was more frequently consumed among dairy producers who did not have knowledge about the presence of pathogenic bacteria in milk.\nEven though the consumption of raw milk is not recommended (40) , a growing number of people choose and prefer to drink raw milk. Raw milk sales regulations and surveillance by regulatory agencies contribute to the improvement of raw milk production standards, which help protect consumers' health by reducing the risks associated with raw milk consumption. In addition to the contribution of monitoring programs, our study showed that measures taken by consumers and sellers to maintain raw milk at proper refrigeration temperatures and to consume milk as soon as possible after purchase would also help in reducing the risk of listeriosis associated with consumption of this product."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "Financial support for this work was provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (agreement nos. 58-1265-3-155, 58-1265-3-156, 58-1265-3-158, 58-1265-4-020, and 58-1265-8-064) for the Regional Dairy Quality Management Alliance.
