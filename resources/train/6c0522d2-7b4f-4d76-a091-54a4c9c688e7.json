In 1992, 84.8 million people were employed in service industries, compared to 47.3 million people in 1970. As proportions of the labor force, though, these figums meant that one-third of all employed adults worked in goods-producing industries in 1970; by 1992; only 22 percent worked in that sector. Concern about job security was not limited to those in manufacturing; it also affected workers in both white and bluecollar positions across sectors as companies tried to \"downsize\" to remain competitive. A notable trend during this period has been the growth of female participation in the labor force. In 1970, 43 percent of women 16 and over were employed; in 1991, over 57 percent of women were employed.6 Women now constitute 45 percent of the labor force. During this time, women have pushed for increased equality in the workplace with some success.

Reflecting the concern of all Americans, the National Commission on Excellence in Education issued A Nation at Risk in 1983.

This regional shift is reflected in the distribution of high school seniors in 1972, 1980, and 1992 displayed in Table 1.3. The figures presented in this table, as well as all other figures presented in this report, are based on survey data that have been weighted to represent the total population of high school seniors. The increasing diversity of the U.S. population is also reflected in Figure 1.1.'5 The p,reentac, of minority high school seniors has increased substantially. In 1972, 86 percent of high school seniors were white; in 1992, only about 73 percent were white. The proportion of black, Asian, and Hispanic seniors all grew over the same time span, in part due to immigration and in part due to differential birth rates. National Cana for Education Statistics.

Trends Among High School Seniors 1972 Race and Social Class Perhaps one of the most important changes that occurred between 1972 and 1992 is the increased prosperity of at least a segment of the minority population. Table 1.4 presents data on the proportion of black, white, Asian and Hispanic High School Seniors who are in the highest quartile of socioeconomic status (SES), the middle quartiles, and the lowest quartile. Naturally, as the largest group, the percentage of whites in each quartile group remains relatively constant. However, the distribution of other social classes within other racial and ethnic groups has changed significantly. The proportion of black seniors in the lowest SES group has decreased from 63 percent in 1972 to 42 percent in 1992. The percentage of black seniors in the highest SES group has doubled from 5 percent in 1972 to 10 percent in 1992. Despite these gains however, blacks are still far more likely than whites to be in the lowest SES group, and far less likely than whites to be in the highest SES group. The percentage of Hispanic seniors from low SES families has decreased from 61 percent in 1972 to 49 percent in 1992, while the percentage from high SES families has more than doubled from 7 percent in 1972 to 15 percent in 1992. Trends Among High School Seniors 1972 Statistics, National Longitudinal Study of 1972;High School and Beyond, 1980 Senior Cohort;National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, Second Follow-up, 1992. Trends Among High School Seniors 1972 Values Values are basic beliefs people hold about what is important in their lives. Although relatively constant, values can and do change over time, reflecting the cultural values of the period. Figure 1.2 presents information on the values considered to be important by each cohort of seniors. The values emphasized by high school seniors have changed since 1972. The 1992 cohort of seniors more frequently emphasized work and money than did their peers of the preceding generation. Compared to 1972, more seniors in 1992 stated that \"success in work,\" \"having lots of money,\" \"being able to fmd steady work,\" \"giving children a better opportunity,\" and \"living close to parents\" were very important. The importance of \"having friends\" remained unchanged, while the importance of \"having a good marriage\" and \"working to correct social and economic inequalities\" declined. This shift toward a greater concern with work and money has not occurred evenly among all subgroups, as is evident in Tab lc 1.5a and 1.5b. Noticeable differences exist between men and women. In 1972, a lower percentage of women than men reported that the ability to find steady work was very important. By 1992, approximately equal percentages of women and men reported that the ability to find steady work was very important. Money has increased in importance for both men and women. Between 1972 and 1992, the percentage of males who believe that money is very important increased from 26 percent to 45 percent. During the same period, the percentage of women who believe money is very important increased from under 10 percent in 1972 to over 29 percent in"}, {"section_title": "1992.", "text": "The trends among racial and ethnic subgroups are similar, with only two exceptions: The percentage of black and of white seniors who said that marriage was \"very important\" declined. Among blacks, the percentage decreased from 80 percent in 1972 to 74 percent in 1992, and among whites, the percentage decreased from 82 percent to 80 percent. In all years, a greater percentage of blacks than whites said that it was very important to work to correct social and economic inequalities (See table 1.5b). However, there was a decline in the proportion of blacks and whites who reported that working to correct sockd and economic inequalities was very important. The proportion of Hispanic and Asian seniors who believe that worldng to correct inequalities was very important remained constant. -Trends Among High School Seniors 19/2-1992 Despite the parallel trend, important differences in values between racial and ethnic groups persist. In 1992, black, Asian, and Hispanic seniors were more likely than white seniors to report that having a lot of money and giving children a better chance were very important. In addition, blacks in 1992 were more likely than whites to feel that success in work and having steady work were very important. Blacks and Hispanics were less likely than whites to say that friends were important. Compared to blacks and whites, Asians and Hispanics more typically believed living close to parents was very important.

High School Program, Tested Achievement, and Course-Taking\nSeniors' preparation in high school for further academic work is somewhat related to their aspirations. Forty-seven percent of seniors in academic high school programs in 1992 expected to attain a graduate degree, an increase from 21 percent in 1972. Expectations for graduate school have increased among those in general and vocational high school programs, even though they have not taken a college preparatory program in high school. In 1992, nearly a quarter (23 percent) of seniors in general education programs expected to attain a graduate degree, compared to 5 percent in 1972. And 15 percent of those in vocational programs expected to attain a graduate degree, compared to only 3 percent twenty years earlier."}, {"section_title": "High School Program", "text": "In the United States and most modem societies, secondary schooling systems are expected to meet two at least partially competing objectives: providing a common education to all students, while at the same time preparing students for very different postsecondary educational and work experiences. While technological development has led to an increasingly specialized division of labor, many have argued that schools should not necessarily follow suit. Some see common educational experiences as an important way to build a shared civic identity among individuals working in fields that are often incomprehensible to outsiders. Other critics of specialization point to the rapid pace of technological and occupational change, arguing that a common general education is a better preparation for the future than a possibly soon-to-be-obsolete specialization. Still others stress the risk that earlier specialization will result in even stronger ties than now exist between family background advantages and access to the more advantageous specializations. Proponents of increased or earlier specialization argue that participation in a specialized program gives students not only marketable skills, but also an identity and a sense of belonging that will lead to greater engagement in school. The ways in which states, local educational authorities, and individual schools have tried to balance these objectives has changed over the years, and their efforts have often been subject to controversy. Differentiation of programs occurs between as well as within high schools. The comprehensive high school has been the most popular fonn of school organization from the early part of this century until the present. It typically differentiates students into three main types of curriculum program: college preparatory or academic, vocational preparatory, and a hybrid of the two, most commonly known as the general studies program. The main alternative to the comprehensive form is the specialized high school, which may offer either a vocational or an academic program of studies. Historically, most specialized public schools were vocational high schools. In recent years, specialized academic \"magnet schools\" within urban districts have become widespread. Private and parochial high schools also usually specialize, normally in the college-preparatory function. Cutting across the different types of schools are the main types of curriculum programs. Seniors in each of the three cohorts were asked to characterize their programs as general, academic, or vocational. The specific sequences of courses that constitute these programs of study vary from school to school, and even from student to student within the same school. After examining enrollment trends in the main programs, we turn to the types of courses seniors had completed during their high school careers. Detailed information on their sequences are available from the high school transcripts of the 1982 and 1992 cohorts. Program placements and amounts of course work are associated with different levels of academic achievement,17 and one would anticipate that trends in course taking will match up with trends in tested achievement. The three cohorts of seniors were tested in reading comprehension and mathematics, and, while the tests used different questions, we can still compare the sizes of group differences within cohorts. During the 20 year period from 1972 to 1992, several noticeable shifts occurred in program placement, as demonstrated in Figure 2.1 Between 1972 and, there was a decline in the participation in academic programs and an increase in the percentage of seniors in general education programs; the proportion enrolled in vocational education programs increased only slightly. During the following ten Trends Among High School Seniors 1972 years, participation in academic programs returned to its previous level, while the percentage of seniors enrolled in vocational programs decreased. The percentage of seniors in vocational programs has declined significantly from 22 percent in 1972 (and 24 percent in 1980) to 12 percent in 1992. The proportion of seniors in general high school programs increased from 32 percent in 1972 to 40 percent in 1992. Enrollment in academic programs declined between 1972 and 1980, falling from 46 percent to 39 percent. However, by 1992, enrollment had returned to its 1972 level-48 percent of seniors were in academic programs. It is important to point out that, while the percentage of students enrolled in academic programs has increased, fewer than half of all seniors are in college preparatory courses. In 1992, the majority of seniors were not engaged in a program of coursework designed to prepare them for college. The recovery in academic program enrollment is fueled primarily by the higher enrollment rates among females and minorities. Table 2.1 presents detailed information on high school program enrollment for subgroups of the population. While the percentage of males enrolled in academic programs declined from 48 percent in 1972 to 39 percent in 1980, by 1992 the percentage had returned to approximately the same level (47 percent). Thc percentage of females enrolled in academic programs has increased, from 43 percent in 1972 to 49 percent in 1992. There has been no increase in the percentage of white students enrolled in academic programs. However, the percentage of blacks increased from 33 percent in 1972 to 43 percent in 1992, and the percentage of Hispanics increased from 27 percent in 1972 to 35 percent in 1992. The percentage of Asians enrolled in college preparatory programs has remained relatively stable."}, {"section_title": "60%", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "50%", "text": "40% 30% 20% 10% 0% National Center for Education Statistics, National Longitudinal Study of 1972;High School and Beyond, 1980 Senior Cohort;National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, Second Po liow-up, 1992. Trends Among High School Seniors 1972 The decline in the proportion of seniors enrolled in vocational programs has occurred among all subgroups of the population. The sex inequity in vocational program placement that was apparent in 1972 has now disappeared. The proportion of males in these programs dropped from 19 percent in 1972 to 12 percent in 1992. For females, the change is even larger. In 1972 over one-quarter (26 percent) of women were enrolled in vocational programs; in 1992 that proportion had been cut in half to only 12 percent. In 1972, one-third of blacks and 30 percent of Hispanics were in vocational programs. In 1992, only 17 percent of blacks and 14 percent of Hispanics were enrolled in vocational programs. Enrollment in general education programs was about equal for men and women in 1992. However, some disparity existed between racial and ethnic groups. Compared to whites, Hispanics in 1972 and 1992 were more frequently enrolled in general education programs. In 1972, 31 percent of white seniors and 42 percent of Hispanic seniors were in general education programs. This disparity was still evident in 1992 when 39 percent of whites and 51 percent of Hispanics were enrolled in general education programs. Regional differences in program placement are becoming less pronounced. In 1972, 61 percent of seniors in the Northeast were in academic programs compared to 37 percent of seniors in the West, a 24 point difference. In 1992, only a 10 point difference between the two regions existed; 56 percent of seniors in the Northeast were in academic programs, compared to 44 percent in the West. The tendency of seniors from high socioeconomic status families to be enrolled in college preparatory programs in significantly greater proportions than those for low socioeconomic backgrounds in 1972 and 1980 remained strong in 1992. Only 28 percent of seniors from families in the lowest SES quartile were in college preparatory programs compared to 63 percent of seniors from the highest SES quartile. As expected, a positive relationship between tested achievement and program placement was also evident in all three cohorts.

Trends Among High School Seniors 1972 Trends in Course-taking from 1982Course-taking from to 1992 In the 1970s, many educators focused their attention on issues of equity and relevance of the curriculum. In the 1980s, the school reform movement promoted a return to basics, that emphasized increased course work in math and science, as well as taking a full sequence of English and history courses. Transcripts were not collected to: NLS 1972 seniors or the 1980 High School and Beyond seniors. However, transcripts were collected for the 1982 High School and Beyond seniors and for the 1992 NELS:88 seniors.

In A Nation at Risk, the Commission on Excellence in Education recommended that all students complete at least four years of English, three years of social studies, three years of mathematics, and three years of science, as well as a half year of computer science. Table 2.2 presents information on the percentage of high school graduates who took the recommended sequence of courses in 1982 and 1992, though these data do not include the computer science requirements. These data indicate that there has been a marked increase in the percentage of students who have completed the recommended number of units in these core areas. The proportion of high school graduates who met the minimum recommended standard increased from 13 percent in 1982 to 47 percent in 1992, a 34 point change. Change occurred in all groups; however, some disparities across racial and ethnic groups persist. While there is no difference between blacks and whites or Asians and whites, a smaller proportion of Hispanics than whites (36 percent compared to 48 percent) completed the recommended courses in 1992. A gap between graduates of urban and rural schools emerged in 1992emerged in . In 1982 approximately the same percentage of graduates of urban, suburban, and rural schools met the minimum recommended standard. Ten years later, 51 percent of the graduates from urban schools completed the recommended coursework compared to only 42 percent of graduates from rural schools. In 1982, 10 percent of high school graduates whose parents had not finished high school completed the recommended courses compared to 20 percent of graduates whose parents had completed college. In 1992, the groups were nearly equal. *The panel's recommendation of 0.5 units in computer science was not included in the table.

Trends Among High School Seniors 1972 Mathematics and science course-taking. Figure 2.2 presents information on the mathematics courses taken by students who graduated from high school in 1982 and 1992. Graduates from the Class . of 1992 were more likely than graduates from the Class of 1982 to ha, taken advanced mathematics courses. The percentage of graduates who took both advanced algebra and geometry increased from 29 percent in 1982 to 50 percent in 1992. The proportion of high school graduates who completed calculus doubled from 4 percent in 1982 to 10 percent in 1992. Enrollment in remedial math courses declined during this period from 32 percent in 1982 to 17 percent in 1992. Information on science courses completed by high school graduates is presented in Figure 2 .3. Again, sharp differences between the two cohorts of high school graduates are evident. Over half, 54 percent, of 1992 graduates completed both biology and chemistry, compared to only 29 percent of 1982 graduates. In 1982, only 10 percent of high school graduates had completed biology, chemistry, and physics; by 1992, this proportion had doubled--22 percent of graduates that year had taken the three science courses. Tables presenting subgroup differences in mathematics and science course-taking are included in the Appendix.   Tested Achievement in Mathematics and Reading Differences in the content and scaling of the tests administered as part of the National Longitudinal Study, High School and Beyond, and the National Education Longitudinal Study limit our ability to measure change in tested achievement over time.\u00b0 For example, it is not possible to quantify how much certain groups have gained or lost over time. However, it is possible to examine whether the gaps between subgroups that were evident in 1972 still existed in 1992. To answer this question, the \"effect size,\" can be calculated, which measures the magnitude of the difference between groups.\u00b0 For example, the difference in tested achievement between blacks and whites or between males and females can be expressed as an effect size. The effect size between groups in 1972 can then be compared to the effect size between those same groups in 1992. The significance of the change between 1972 and 1992 can then be tested. Tables 2.3 and 2.4\" present data on tested achievement in reading and mathematics among seniors in 1972, 1980, and 1992. Note that mean scores can be compared only within years, not across years. Cross-year comparisons must be based on effect sizes. Before discussing these tables, it is important to note that one of the major changes between the 1972 and 1992 tests was that the 1992 test measured a broader range of achievement; the ceiling of the test was raised substantially and the floor was lowered somewhat. Thus, if a gap between groups appeared in 1992 that was not observed in 1972, this might be an artifact of the change in the test itself, rather than achievement. However, if a gap between groups narrowed between 1972 and 1992, we can be reasonably confident that this reflects real change. Readers may wish to compare 1972-92 seniors' results with data over the same period from the NAEP trend sample of 17-year olds.2' Reading. Differences in reading achievement between seniors from white and minority groups decreased between 1972 and 1992. The effect size of the difference between blacks and whites decreased from .97 in 1972 to .74 in 1992. The disparity in reading achievement between Hispanic seniors and \" See Appendix D for a more detailed description of differences in the achievement tests in the three studies. 19 The effect size = (M, -M2)/SDp.1,, where M, and M, are the means of the scores from the two groups being compared and SDp.1., is the pooled standard deviation. See Appendix D for additionol information. 20 The 1972 and 1980 portions of these tables wcre reproduced from Rock, D.A., Ekstrom, R.B., Goertz, M.E., Hilton, T.L., Pollack, J.M., & Fetters, W.B. (1985). Factors Associated with Decline of Test Scores of High School Seniors, 1972. This report breaks the Hispanic category into three subgroups. The 1992 data for these tables were analyzed using these subgroups for purposes of comparison to these previously published data. 21 For NAEP trends in tested achievement from 1969-1992, see]. Mullis et al., 1994, NAEP 1992 Trends in Academic Progress, which summarizes findings for mathematics and reading, as well as science and writing. NAEP data show that reading achievement at age 17 was higher in 1992 than in 1971, and that mathematics achievement for this age group declined from 1973 levels through 1982, with performance returning to 1973 levels by 1992. The NAEP trend sample also shows that differences in average proficiency between seventeen year old white and black students narrowed between 1973 and 1992 in mathematics and between 1971 and 1992 in reading. By 1992, age 17 differences in average proficiency between white and Hispanic students also had narrowed both in mathematics and reading (see Mullis et al. 1994, Figure 3). Although the longitudinal data sets, particularly NELS:88, are rich sources of data on both family and school processes, this report is descriptive in its focus, and does not attempt to investigate the school or family factors that may account for changes in achievement over time. However, for a recent discussion of the relationship between changes in the family and changes in student achievement (and, implicitly, of school versus family effects on achievement trends) see D.W. Grissmer et al., 1994, Student Achievement and the Changing American Family (Santa Monica, CA: RAND). Grissmer et al. employ NAEP test data in conjunction with family context data from NLSY79 and NELS:88.    in 1972NLS 1972HS&B 1980 Statistics, National Longitudinal Study of 1972;High School and 13eyond, 1980 Senior Cohort;National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, Second Follow-up, 1992 white seniors also decreased. The effect size among Mexicans decreased from .89 to .61; among Puerto Ricans it decreased from .93 to .45; among other Hispanics it declined from .81 to .43."}, {"section_title": "Trends Among High School Seniors", "text": "In 1972, a gap existed between seniors attending urban high schools and those attending suburban high schools. In 1992, this gap had narrowed. The effect size declined from .21 in 1972 to .02 in 1992, a significant decrease. Because of the change in the test between 1972 and 1992, no conclusions can be drawn concerning some of the apparent increased gaps shown in Table 2.3. While there appears to be an increased gap in tested achievement between seniors from the highest and lowest SES quartiles, this may be a function of the increased ceiling of the 1992 test. Mathematics. In mathematics achievement, the gap between males and females has decreased. In 1972, the effect size of the difference in mathematics achievement between males and females was .23. In 1992, the comparable effect size was .08. In other words, there is now essentially no difference between males and females in tested math proficiency. Differences in mathematics achievement across racial groups also decreased. Black-white differences in 1972 were estimated with an effect size of 1.09; in 1992 the effect size was .87. The gap between Hispanics and whites also decreased. The effect size between whites and Mexicans decreased from .86 to .70; between whites and Puerto Ricans it decreased from 1.1 to .58; between whites and other Hispanics it e ined from .86 to .38. Again, these data indicate that there may be higher SES disparity between high and low SES. The reader is cautioned that this may also result from the fact that the raised ceiling of the 1992 test may have allowed more advantaged students to demonstrate a higher level of knowledge than was possible on the earlier test. High and low-achieving students. Another angle on the chievement trends is afforded by comparing the characteristics of students at the high and low extremes of the achievement distribution. This allows us to determine whether there have been changes in the relative representation of different subpopulations in the upper and lower ranks of academic achievement. Our target was to analyze the composition of the upper and lower 15 percentage points of the distributions. However, the relatively small number of test items used in the 1972 test produced percentile breaks that were somewhat higher or lower than 15 percent. Table 2.5 shows that in reading the composition of the lowest 14 percent of the achievement score distribution included a higher proportion of males in 1992 than in 1972. While black and Hispanic youth were overrepresented in the lowest 14 percent in 1972 and 1992, they were less so in 1992. The composition of the highest 18 percent included more Hispanics in 1992 than in 1972. Similar patterns are found in mathematics. The lower end of the distribution had a higher proportion of male and lower proportion of Hispanic. The representation of Hispanics increased in the higher end of the distribution. In contrast to the lessening of racial and ethnic achievement differences, the socioeconomic composition of the high ends of both the reading and mathematics distributions became more skewed in favor of middle-and high-SES students. Note that there was a significantly diminished representation of low-SES quartile students in the top group.   Subgroups in 1972Mathematics Test NLS 1972HS&B 1980 1980 Senior Cohort;National Education Lcngitudinal Study of 1988, Second Follow-up, 1992.\nBlack and white seniors planned to attend four-year colleges in similar proportions in both 1972 and 1992. In 1972, 32 percent of blacks and 35 percent of whites planned to attend a four-year college. In 1992, 52 percent of black seniors and 55 percent of white seniors planned to attend a four-year college. Hispanic seniors were less likely than white seniors to plan to attend a four year college in both 1972 and 1992 (24 percent of Hispanics compared to 35 percent of whites in 1972 and 46 percent of Hispanics compared to 55 percent of whites in 1992). In 1992, Asian seniors were more likely than white seniors to plan to attend a four-year college immediately after high school graduation (65 percent of Asians compared to 55 percent of whites). A larger proportion of blacks and Hispanics planned to attend an academic program in a two-year college in 1992 than in 1972: the proportion of blacks increased from 5 percent to 11 percent, while the proportion of Hispanics increased from 12 percent to 20 percent. No change occurred among white seniors. In comparison to 1972, lower percentages of black, of white, and of Hispanic seniors planned to continue their education at a trade or technical school in 1992. The difference for Asian seniors was not significant. There has been marked growth in the proportion of seniors in all high school programs (general education, academic, and vocational) planning to attend a four-year college after high school graduation. It is interesting to note the number of seniors planning to attend four-year colleges who have not completed college preparatory programs. In 1972, 18 percent of seniors enrolled in general education programs planned to go on to a four-year college immediately. By 1992, that number had more than doubled: nearly 40 percent of seniors in g teral education programs planned to continue on to a four-year college. The percentage of vocational students planning to continue thcir education at a four-year or two-year college increased between 1972 and 1992, while the percentage planning to attend trade or technical school decreased. The proportion of seniors planning to attend a four-year college has increased in all socioeconomic groups and among seniors at all achievement levels.    College Selection Students consider many factors when selecting a college, including financial considerations, such as the cost of attendance and the availability of financial aid; and scholastic considerations, such as the availability of desired courses and the institution's academic reputation. During the past 20 years, attention has shifted away from a concern with tuition and expenses, toward a concern with the amount of aid available to finance the cost of education. Figure 3.3 presents information on the percentage of seniors who consider financial aid, expenses, academic reputation, and course offerings to be \"very important\" in choosing a college. The proportion of college-bound seniors who reported that expenses were \"very important\" in selecting a college declined between 1972 and 1992. During the same period, concern with the availability of financial aid increased. In 1972, 40 percent of college-bound seniors said that tuition and expenses were \"very important\" considerations in selecting a college; in 1992, that number had fallen to 30 percent. In 1972, 29 percent of college-bound seniors reported that the availability of financial aid was a \"very important\" consideration in choosing a college; in 1992, 46 percent said that fmancial aid was \"very important.\" Concerns about college expenses and financial aid varied among subgroups of the population, and groups have changed somewhat differently over time, as shown in Tables 3.3a & b. The percentage of black, white, and Hispanic seniors who reported that tuition and expensa were very important factors in selecting a college declined between 1972 and 1992. No significant difference was found for Asian seniors. In both 1972 and 1992, college-bound males were less likely than college-bound females to say that college expenses and financial aid were \"very important.\" In 1972, less than one-quarter (24 percent) of white seniors reported that the availability of financial aid was a very important consideration in choosing a college; by 1992 that number had increased to 40 percent. While the percentage of black seniors who reported that financial aid was very important did not change significantly between 1972 and 1992, black and Hispanic seniors were more likely than white seniors in either year to say financial aid was a very important consideration in selecting a college. Concern about the availability of financial aid to meet college expenses increased among seniors from all socioeconomic groups, including those from families in the highest socioeconomic quartile.   The percentage of seniors who report that course availability is a very important consideration when selecting a college increased slightly between 1972 and 1992. The academic reputation of postsecondary institutions was considered to be \"very important\" by 43 percent of seniors in 1972 and 54 percent of seniors in 1992. An increased concern about academic reputation was evident among almost all subgroups examined.   College-bound seniors' expectations concerning college majors changed somewhat during the period being studied, as presented in Table 3.4. However, readers should interpret this table with caution, because in 1980 and 1992, a new response option, \"a pre-professional field, (for example, prelaw, predentistry, and premedicine),\" was given to seniors. Thus, while figures from 1972 are presented in Table 3.4, the results discussed here are based on comparisons between 1980 and 1992. The proportion of college-bound seniors intending to major in a number of fields increased between 1980 and 1992. The percentage of seniors expecting to major in education increased from 6 percent in 1980 to 10 percent in 1992. A larger percentage of college-bound seniors planned to major in pre-professional areas in 1992 than in 1980, 11 percent compared to 7 percent. Expected majors in social sciences increased from 8 percent in 1980 to 11 percent in 1992. The percentages of college-bound seniors anticipating majors in a number of fields declined between 1980 and 1992. In 1992, 20 percent of college-bound seniors planned to major in business, compared to 25 percent in 1980. The proportion of college-bound seniors planning to major in computer and information science fell from 5 percent to 3 percent. Information on the distribution of majors by sex, race, and socioeconomic status is presented in Appendix A. Students' long-term expectations for education are as important to examine as their short-term plans. While not all seniors plan to attend postsecondary school immediately, nearly all high school seniors now expect to continue their education eventually. Figure 4.1 presents information on the percentage of all seniors who expect to end their education with high school, attend college, complete a four-year college, or continue their education in graduate school. In 1972, 19 percent of seniors expected to end their schooling with high school. By 1992, only 5 percent of seniors reported that they would not continue their education past high school. The proportion of seniors who expected to pursue some further education, but did not think they would finish college, also declined from 31 percent in 1972 to 25 percent in 1992. While the proportion of seniors who expected to end their education with their bachelors degree was about the same in 1972 (38 percent) as in 1992 (36 percent), the proportion of seniors expecting to complete college and continue on to graduate school increased substantially. In 1972, 13 percent of seniors thought they would go on to earn a graduate degree; in 1992, one-third of all seniors expected to earn some type of graduate degree. As demonstrated in Table 4.1, sex differences in educational expectations were marked in both 1972 and 1992. In the earlier year, males were more likely than females to expect to complete the highest levels of education; in the most recent year, females were more likely than males to expect to complete graduate school. In 1972, 22 percent of females compared to 16 percent of males did not expect to continue their education past high school. In 1992, a lower percentage of females than males expected to limit their education to high school, 4 percent of females compared to 7 percent of males. Males were more likely than females to expect to complete college or graduate school in 1972. In that year, 39 percent of males thought they would complete college, and another 16 percent expect to pursue graduate education. Among females, 36 percent thought they would complete college and another 9 percent expected to pursue graduate education. In 1992, females and males were equally likely to expect to end their education with a bachelors degree. Furthermore, females were more likely than males to expect to earn a graduate degree. Thirty-six percent of both sexes intended to end their education with a bachelors degree. However, a larger proportion of females than males intended to attain a graduate degree, 35 percent compared to 31 percent.   Heightened expectations were apparent among all racial and ethnic groups, as well as socioeconomic groups. Thirty-eight percent of black seniors in 1992 expected to obtain a graduate degree compared to only 14 percent in 1972. Among whites, the proportion expecting to pursue a graduate degree increased from 13 percent in 1972 to 32 percent in 1992. Aspirations also increased among Asian seniors; in 1992, 42 percent expected to attain a graduate degree, compared to 16 percent in 1972. In 1992, 31 percent of Hispanic seniors expected to earn a graduate degree, compared to 9 percent 20 years earlier. Among seniors from families in the lowest socioeconomic quartile, the proportion of those who expected to earn graduate degrees increased from 6 percent in 1972 to 21.percent in\n2) Fixed time comparisons are also possible in which groups within each study are compared to each other at different ages though at the same point in time. Thus NLS-72, HS&B senior cohon, and HS&B sophomore cohort sample members could all be compared in 1986, some 14, 6, and 4 years after each respective cohort completed high school. (For example, employment rates in 1986 of 22, 24, and 32-year old high school graduates can be contrasted.) The only available fixed time comparison using NELS:88 data, however, involves contrasting HS&B fourth follow-up and NELS:88 second follow-up 1992 results. One might, for example, compare the 1992 educational expectations of the two cohorts to explore how 17-18 year olds differ from 27-28 year olds in this respect. Or one might utilize the 1992 life values responses (questions concerning the importance to the respondent of being successful in work, having a lot of money, having strong friendships, and so on) to compare HS&B Fourth Follow-Up sophomore cohort members with NELS:88 Second Follow-Up survey participants. 3) Finally, longitudinal comparative analysis of the cohorts can be performed by modeling the history of the age/grade cohorts. NELS:88 trend comparisons need not, however, be strictly limited to NLS-72 and HS&B. Comparisons are also possible using transcripts data collected for high school seniors, not only for HS&B 1982graduates and NELS:88 1992graduates, but also for 1987 graduates in NAEP schools. 24 Other national probability samples as well may provide comparison points.25 24 Care has been exercised in designing and implementing the academic transcript study in NELS:88 to maximize the comparability of NELS:88 transcript data with the high school transcript data for 1987 and 1990 graduating seniors. While an independent high school transcript study was not conducted in NLS-72, course-taking summary information was collected from school records for the 1972 seniors. For a detailed account of cross-cohort transcript comparison issues, see Ingels and Taylor, 1995. 25 For example, major national studies of high school seniors, employing test and survey measures, were conducted in 1960 (Project Talent) and 1965 (the Equality of Educational Opportunity Survey) (see Schrader and Hilton in Hilton fed.) 1992 for a discussion of comparability issues); also, the high school graduating classes of 1975-94 have been surveyed (and followed up as young adults) by Monitoring the Future; A Continuing Study of the Lifestyles and Values of Youth, a key source of trend data on. in particular, drug use and associated factors. (The study added 8th-and 10th-grade cohorts in 1991). Items that arc strictly comparable across such data sets are, however, uncommon. Beginning in 1987, the Longitudinal Study of American Youth (LSA Y) collected student, parent, and teacher data for cohorts of seventh and tenth graders (see Miller et al., 1992 \nUse of appropriate subgroup membership flags permits the analyst to define dropouts in the same way in both HS&B and NELS:88; however, for respondents such as GED holders, some items that otherwise would be available cannot be compared because the dropout questionnaire was not administered to this group in NELS:88. On the other hand, NELS:88 GED recipients should be excluded from comparison with HS&B early graduates. It is also possible to manipulate HS&B data so that a non-HS&B dropout definition is used in which individuals in nondiploma alternative arrangements are not regarded as dropouts. (For details, see Inge Is and Dowd, 1995.) Overall differences in cluster size are summarized in Table 4. For NLS-72, the target sample size was 18 students per school; for the HS&B base year, the target was 36 students per school; and for NELS:88, the target sample size was 24 eighth graders (or 26.2, counting the Asian-Hispanic oversample). Numbers selected and participating for the baseline and senior surveys of the three studies are summarized in Table 4. NLS-72, HS&B, NELS:88 Content Overlap. Content (and format) overlap across the three studies should be viewed in terms of questionnaire, cognitive test, and transcripts data. Questionnaire Overlap. There are many topics that are covered in one study but not the others, or that are covered by questions that are substantially (or subtly) different. Nonetheless, a core of items is comparable across all three, and a larger number of items comparable acmss HS&B and NELS:88.39 Some items are repeated in identical form across the studies. Others appear to be essentially similar despite small differences in wording or response categories; analysts must exercise their own cautious judgments about such cases. For a number of items with like question wording, dissimilar response categories were employed. In many such cases, comparability can be achieved by recoding the response categories so that they are compatible. The crosswalk provided in Appendix E of the Second Follow-Up: Student Component Data File User' s Manual identifies items that are plausibly similar across studies (or waves or components). Again, researchers must exercise their own cautious judgment before choosing comparison items. While most items listed in the crosswalk are transparently comparable (for example, the 10 life values items in NLS-72 were repeated almost without change' in stem or response categories in HS&B in 1980 andNELS:88 in 1992), other items are more problematic for comparisons. It may be useful to illustrate this issue by providing a few examples of potentially problematic comparisons. The homework questions in NLS-72, HS&B, and NELS:88 provide one example of problematic comparability. NLS-72 asked \"Approximately what is the average amount of time you spend on homework a week?\" and provided response categories of \"No homework is ever assigned, I have homework but don't do it, less than 5 hours a week, between 5 and 10 hours a week, more than 10 hours a week.\" In HS&B the question stem was retained, and while additional response categories were 39 For detailed discussions of item comparability issues for the 1980 and 1990 sophomore data, see and Inge's. Scott, Lindmark. Frankel, and Myers, 1992, Appendix D. provided, they can be mapped into the broader categories of the NLS-72. In the NELS:88 first and second follow-ups, homework was inquired about using a two-column response format that distinguished in-school and out-of-school, and cut points were used for the response options that do not readily map into the NLS-72 and HS&B scheme. It is possible to devise various schemes for trying to compare the NELS:88 homework results with the earlier studies. Nevertheless, there is no objective criterion against which to evaluate the success of any such mapping. Future occupational expectations provide a second example of problematic comparability. There are items that ask about future occupational expectations in all three studies. Unlike the HS&B and NELS:88 items, the NLS-72 item is not keyed to a specific age and uses \"like\" instead of \"plan or expect.\" Can the NLS-72 item he compared to NELS:88 nonetheless? Again, researchers must make their own judgments about comparability, and these judgnients may depend in part on specific analytic objectives. For example, the NLS-72 questions would seem to license loftier or more wishful ambitions (the NLS-72 wording is \"circle the one number that goes with the best description of the kind of work you would like to do\"; the NELS:88 wording is \"which of the categories below comes closest to describing the job or occupation that you expect or plan to have...when you are 30 years old\"). In comparing NLS-72 and NELS:88 seniors, one finds that females have higher future occupational expectations in 1992 than in 1972. Since the wording of the NLS-72 item might be thought to minimize the large observed difference between women in the two cohorts, one might feel additional confidence that the trend toward higher female occupational expectations was real. Nonetheless, it remains possible to entertain at least some skepticism that these items are fully comparable, given that one instances aspirations and the other expectations, and that one is indefinite as to point in time and the other refers to age 30. Many more examples could be cited, but the larger point would remain the same--data users should assess carefully the comparison items listed in the crosswalk to ensure that they meet their analytic requirements. Cognitive Test Comparability. IRT methods have been used to put mathematics, vocabulary, and reading scores on the same scale for 1972, 1980, and 1982 seniors.41 Additionally, there are common items in the HS&B and NELS:88 mathematics tests that provide a basis for equating 1980-1990 and 1982-1992 mathematics results. In general, however, the tests used in the three studies differ in many ways. Though group differences by standard deviation units may profitably be examined, caution should be exercised in drawing time-lag comparisons for cognitive test data. One particular caveat that should be entered concerns the NELS:88 mathematics and reading tests. NELS:S8 used multiple, adaptive forms of these two tests, so that a brorder range of ability could be measured. Due to such differences in methodology and item pool characteristics, subgroup differences (for example) that are detected by the NELS:88 math and reading tests may have a somewhat different meaning than differences registered in the earlier tests, and interpretation should be qualified accordingly. The HS&B sophomore cohort and NELS:88 provide a strong basis for explaining changes in high school achievement over time. Both studies measure how much was learned over the last two years of high school, and provide a wealth of individual-level explanatory variables. However, in comparing HS&B and NELS:88 test results, differences between the two cohorts may not always be typical of longer term trends. Hence, one might consider using the NAEP trend line (the NAEP trend sample is based on multiple age cohorts, and provides data from as early as 1969) to locate the HS&B and NELS:88 cohorts. (For further information about NAEP trend data in mathematics, science, and reading, see Mullis et al. 1991 and. Note also that for NELS:88 and NAEP 1992 mathematics achievement, NELS:88 Trends Among High School Seniors 1972 provides a NAEP-equated score. (For an analysis of NAEP trends, using NELS:88 and NLSY79 to examine family [and implicitly school] effects on achievement trends, see Grissmer er al. 1994). Transcript Comparability. The HS&B, NAEP (1987 and NELS:88 high school transcript studies were designed to support comparisons. Despite the large similarities between the four transcript studies, there are some differences in design and content that must be taken into account when planning comparative analyses. (For a detailed account, see Inge ls and Taylor, 1995.) Certain generalizations may also be made about course enrollment trends based on data collected for 1969 public school graduates in the Study of Academic Growth and Prediction (Hilton, 1971;Tuma et al. 1989), and based on transcripts of 1975-82 high school graduates in the Department of Labor's NLSY (CHRR, 1993). Weights, Flags, and Unweighted (Sample) Ns for Sophomore and Senior Cohort Comparisons. Table 6 sketches the weights, flags, and sample Ns associated with sophomore and senior intercohort comparisons. Need for caution in comparing data across cohorts. Accurate trend measurement faces several challenges. Sampling error tends to be more of a problem for, intercohort comparisons than for intracohort, because there is sampling error each time an independent sample is drawn. Differences in two sample means estimated from independent samples will be a function not only of the real differences in means, but also the sampling errors associated with both measurements. Hence, small (but not therefore necessarily unimportant) differences may be harder to detect. In estimating trends based on results from two or more sample surveys, a number of nonsampling errors also may arise. Differences in instrument format and wording, data collection mode, or methodology are potential sources of' nonsampling error. While the requirements of change measurement dictate that the same measures be repeated in the same way, there are also strong disincentives to holding measures and methodologies constant. The goals, the subject, and the technology of education measurement do not remain static. The educational policy agenda changes over time; the manner and matter of education changes as curriculum content and instructional methods are revised; improvements arise--in survey methodologies, data capture technologies, and in measurement techniques--that promise large benefits if implemented. Finally, the instrument design process for NLS-72, HS&B,and NELS:88, which has proceeded through broad consensus of the user community at different points in time, militates against a strongly conservative approach to content, format, and methodology, and there is no correct or simple way to resolve all tensions between improved measurement and comparable measurement. Hence, though the studies were designed to be as comparable as possible, caution must nonetheless be exercised in comparing NLS-72, HS&B, and NELS:88 data. Student response rates differed and the characteristics of the nonrespondents may also differ across the studies. While nonresponse adjustments in the weights serve to compensate for nonresponse, no Austment procedure can do so perfectly. Item response rates for questions that appear in both surveys differ as well, and, in general, missing data have not been imputed. The accuracy of intercohort comparisons may also be influenced by differences in context and question order for trend items in the various student questionnaires; differences in test format, content, and context; and other factors such as differences in data collection methodology. More specifically, there were differences in mode and time of survey administration across the four cohorts. For example, NELS:88 seniors were generally surveyed earlier in the school year than were Trends Among High School Seniors  NLS-72 seniors (many NELS:88 seniors were surveyed in January and February of 1992, though survey work continued into May); NLS-72 Base Year seniors were surveyed quite late in the school year.42 NLS-72 survey forms were administered by school personnel; HS&B and NELS:88 survey forms were administered primarily by contractor (NORC) staff. In NI,S-72, seniors marked answers on an answer sheet (separate from the test booklet) while in 1980 and 1982 (HS&B) and NELS:88, answers were marked in the test booklet. The inclusion of answers as an integral part of the test booklet is thought to have given a modest advantage to HS&B test takers (see  for further details). Other differences between the NLS-72 and the HS&B/NELS:88 tests include improved mapping in the latter tests and the procedure of blackening an oval versus blackening a box (Hilton, 1992, cites a study by Ear les, Guiliano, Ree & Valentine, that indicates such format differences are significant for timed tests, accounting for about one half a standard deviation in difference of result).43 There are differences in questionnaire construction across the three studies. NLS-72 and NELS:88 senior questionnaires used skip patterns more extensively than did the HS&B senior instrument; the NELS:88 and HS&B questionnaires were longer than the NLS-72 questionnaire. NLS-72 and HS&B senior cohort sample members were subjected to their first measurement as seniors; HS&B sophomores were administered their second measurement as seniors, and NELS:88 eighth graders their third. We do not believe that problems associated with iepeated measurements (such as remembering past responses to individual items) are likely to be a difficulty, both because of the sheer number of test and questionnaire items asked, and the two year intervals between data collections. However, participation in a longitudinal study in theory may influence the survey member's subsequent behavior or attitudes. Because most NELS:88 1992 sample members had also been surveyed as eighth and tenth graders, such \"panel effects's\"' are in principle possible with this group (as ,with HS&B sophomores two years later, in 1982). In contrast, 1972In contrast, and 1980In contrast, seniors (and 1980 were new to NLS-72 or HS&B. Any of these differences may, to some unknown extent, affect the comparability of the NELS data sets and make the task of accurate trend measurement more difficult to accomplish. 42 Indeed, while in the spring 1972 base year 16,683 seniors in 1,061 schools completed an NLS-72 student questionnaire, 257 schools that could not (because, for example, their school year ended earlier in the spring) take part in the base year were added, in accordance with the original designthese seniors had now left their schools but they were asked some retrospective (senior year) questions. Such individualswho redress the school frame undercoverage bias in the NLS-72 base year--do not appear on the NLS-72 base year files that would typically be employed for comparisons of high school seniors, although the presence of some retrospective data for these individuals permits refmement of comparisons grounded in 1972 data. 43 The implications of context and format differences for trend comparisons have been well described in the NAEP literature-see especially A.E. Beaton and R. Zwick, 1990, The Effect of Changes in the National Assessment: Disentangling the NAEP 1985-86 Reading Anomaly (Princeton, NJ.: ETS, NAEP Report 17-TR-21), which discusses the effects of changes in item context, assessment booklets, and procedures. For some NAEP reading tests, the impact of such changes was apparently larger than the trend effects that were being measured."}, {"section_title": "4 u", "text": "Trends Among High School Seniors 1972-1992 The proportion of seniors taldng part Ln subject matter clubs remained steady as did involvement in work on the school newspaper or yearbook. Most of these changes were broadly based. An examination of the trends in participation for the various subgroups indicates that changes were relatively consistent across groups. One exception to this is participation in subject matter clubs, which appears to be attracting larger numbers of high SES, highachieving seniors in academic track programs. Participation in subject matter clubs declined among low SES seniors, from 24 to 19 percent, while the participation rate of high SES seniors increased from 28 to 32 percent. Similar trends are visible among low-and high-achieving students. Similarly, the, participation in subject clubs decreased among vocational students, from 24 to 15 percent, while participation of academic track students increased from 30 to 34 percent. Although as noted above, overall participation in subject matter clubs did not change, the proportion of males increased from 20 to 23 percent, while the proportion of females decreased from 31 to 27 percent. Participation among black seniors declined from 33 to 21 percent. Trends Among High School Seniors 1972   The declines in vocational program enrollments seen in the last chapter suggest that fewer seniors are planning to enter t. labor force directly after high school. Presumably they would then be oriented toward some fonn of postsecondary education, but it is not clear which of several institutional options is absorbing them. This chapter focuses on seniors' educational and work plans for their first year after high school, and some of the factors that influenced their decisions. Just as some patterns of change in program and course enrollments differed by sex, race, and socioeconomic status, patterns of postsecondary plans might also differ. Figure 3.1 provides information on the percent of seniors who intend to engage in full-time work, postsecondary education, or some other activity (for example, full-time homemaking or travel) during the year immediately following high school graduation. The proportion of seniors planning to work has fallen from 32 percent in 1972 to 14 percent in 1992. In 1972, 59 percent of seniors reported that they would continue on to school immediately after high school graduation compared to 78 percent in 1992. Compared to 1972, the proportion of seniors planning to engage in \"other\" activities such as travel, part-time work, or full-time homemaking declined slightly from 9 percent to 8 percent in 1992."}, {"section_title": "100%", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "80%", "text": "60% 40% 20% 0%    Plans to Work Full-time in the Year Following Graduation The proration of seniors who planned to work full-time in the year following graduation has fallen dramatically as shown in Table 3.1. In 1972, 32 percent of seniors planned to work full-time during the year after high school graduation; in 1992, only 14 percent of seniors planned to work full-time during the year following high school graduation. This change was evident across all regions. In both 1972 and 1992, males were more likely than females to plan on working immediately after high school. However, during this 20 year period, the percentage of both groups who planned to work immediately after high school graduation declined. The percentage of females who planned to ,,ork fulltime after high school decieased by half from 29 percent to 13 percent, while the percentage of males declined from 35 percent to 16 percent. Differences between whites and other groups in postsecondary plans that were apparent in 1972 had disappeared by 1992. In 1972, blacks and Hispanics were more likely than whites to plan on working after high school graduation: 37 percent of blacks and 38 percent of Hispanics planned to work compared to only 31 percent of whites. A smaller percentage of Asian seniors, 18 percent, planned to work full-time after high school graduation. By 1992, whites were no more or less likely to work after graduation than blacks, Asians, or Hispanics. The relationship between socioeconomic status and plans to work after graduation that was evident in 1972 persisted into 1992. In both years, seniors from families in the lowest SES quartile were more likely to plan to work than seniors from the highest SES quartile. In 1972, 47 percent of seniors from families in the lowest socioeconomic status planned to work after high school graduation compared to 14 percent of those from the highest SES quartile. In 1992. 25 percent of seniors in the lowest SES (7; .ctile planned to work, compared to only 5 percent of those in the highest SES quartile. The decrease in the percentage of seniors planning to work after graduation can be seen in all three typcs of high school programs. In 1972, over half (56 percent) of seniors in vocational programs planned to work full-time following high school graduation, compared to only 32 percent in 1992. In 1972, 42 percent of seniors in general education programs planned to work following high school graduation, compared to 19 percent in 1992. Only a small proportion (13 percent) of 1972 seniors in academic programs planned to work after graduation; in 1992 this had decreased to 5 percent. Seniors who tested in the lowest quartile were far more likely to plan to work after high school than those who tested in the highest quartile in all three years.    Type of Postsecondary Institution Seniors Plan to Attend in the Year Following Graduation The percentage of high school seniors who planned to attend four-year colleges or academic programs at two year colleges immediately after high school increased between 1972 and 1992, as can be seen in Figure 3.2. Overall, 59 percent of high school seniors in 1972 planned to continue their education immediately after graduation. In 1992, 76 percent reported having such plans. Blacks showed a significant increase in postsecondary plans over this period (20 percent) as did Hispanics (23 percent). The proportion of seniors planning to enroll in vocational programs at two year colleges remained constant, while the percentage of seniors planning to attend trade or technical schools declined. In 1972, about one-third (34 percent) of all seniors planned to attend a four-year college in the year following high school graduation; while in 1992, over half of all seniors planned to attend a four-year college. The percentage of seniors planning to enroll in an academic program in a two-year college increased slightly from 11 percent in ;.972 to 13 percent in 1992. Approximately the same proportion of seniors in 1972 (5 percent) and 1992 (6 percent) planned to enroll in a vocational program at a two-year college. About 9 percent of 1972 seniors planned to enroll in a trade or technical school after high school. By 1992, only half that percentage (4 percent) planned to continue their education at a trade or technical school. These changes have not occurred uniformly across all subgroups. Very different patterns of change have occurred among males and females (see Table 3.2). In 1972, a slightly higher percentage of males (35 percent) than females (32 percent) planned to go on to a four-year college immediately after high school. By 1992, this was reverseda significantly greater percentage of females (58 percent) than males (50 percent) planned to attend a four-year college in the year after high school graduation. In 1972, approximately the same proportion (11 percent) of males and females planned to enroll in academic programs in two-year colleges in the year after high school graduation. By 1992, a larger proportion of females (15 percent) than males (11 percent) planned to attend a two-year academic program. In 1972, females were more likely than males to plan to attend a trade or technical school (10 percent of females compared to 7 percent of males). In 1992, a slightly higher proportion of males than females planned to enroll in a trade or technical school during the year after high school graduation.

There has been a noticeable shift away from occupations requiring less education toward those requiring college or graduate education. Major increases occurred in the proportion of seniors who expected occupations as managers (from 3 percent in 1972 to 6 percent in 1992) or professionals (from 45 to 59 percent), as shown in Table 4. 2.At the same time, the proportion of seniors who planned to hold some blue-collar occupations declined during this 20 year period. Relatively fewer seniors in 1992 than in 1972 expected to have occupations that can be classified as clerical, craftsmen, farmers, homemakers, laborers, operatives, sales, or service. Major declines occurred in the proportion of seniors who expected clerical occupations, decreasing from 14 percent to 4 percent, and crafts occupations, decreasing from 8 percent to 3 percent. Decreases also occurred in farm occupations (from 2 percent to 1 percent), homemaking (from 3 percent to 1 percent), unskilled labor (from 2 percent to 1 percent), operatives (from 2 to 1 percent), sales (from 3 to 2 percent), and service occupations (from 4 to 3 percent). The proportion of seniors expecting other occupations that can require a range of educational experience increased. Increases occurred in the proportion of seniors who expected jobs in the military (2 percent to 3 percent), as proprietors (from 2 percent to 7 percent), and as protective service workers (from 2 to 4 percent). Complete crosstabulations examining occupational aspirations by sex and race/ethnicity can be found in Table 4 1972 1980 1992 Clerical 114 .    Technical 146   Chapter 5. Conclusion Terms like \"equity\" and \"excellence\" often sound like cliches in education rather than measurable goals; while they are discussed often, progress towards either goal is sometimes difficult to discern. Educational policies in the 1960s and 1970s advocated increased educational opportunities for women and minorities. In the 1980s, reformers shifted attention towards the pursuit of excellence, calling for higher standards and curricular reform. Because these goals are so lofty, progress toward them often seems slow, and the efforts toward reaching them difficult to measure in the short term. The three datasets explored here offer the opportunity to look at these issues anew, and examine the course of change over a twenty-year period. From these data, we can see that progress has been made on both fronts. It is clear that in terms of their academic aspirations, seniors in 1992 were far ahead of their peers in earlier cohorts. A larger percentage of seniors than ever before intend to continue their education in college and graduate school. Furthermore, these seniors are preparing for their future by taking more rigorous sequences of high school coursework, including mathematics and science courses. Inequities between the sexes were evident in almost all areas of high school life in 1972, including L.zademic achievement and postsecondary goals. In 1972, females lagged behind males in enrollment in college preparatoly programs, plans for college, and tested achievement in mathematics, to name just a few. In 1992, these differences disappeared and in some cases, women seniors appeared to hold higher aspirations than men particularly with regard to postsecondary and graduate educational aspirations. The extent to which this move towards equality in the school will translate into equal opportunity and equal pay in the work place can be traced in upcoming rounds of NELS:88. Some disproportionalities in course completion among racial and ethnic subgroups have been reduced during the past twenty years. In particular, the enrollment of blacks and.Hispanic in college preparatory programs has increased significantly since 1972, and the percentage of black, Hispanic, and Asian seniors aspiring to graduate degrees has increased dramatically. Furthermore, gaps between white seniors and seniors of other raciaVethnic groups in 1972 have decreased significantly. However, despite these improvements, some inequalities persist. In particular, a significantly smaller proportion of Hispanics complete the basic coursework sequence in English, Social Studies, Math, and Science recommended by the Commission on Excellence in Education. Also of concern is the fact that, even though achievement differences among racial and ethnics as a whole have been declining, differences between socio-economic subgroups have widened during the last 20 years. A signfficantly smaller proportion of seniors from low SES can be found in the upper 15% of the achievement in reading or mathematics. These findings along with the others reported above, point to goals yet to be 'net. However, the significant advances which have been made in the past 20 years provide a considerable source of hope for the attainability of these objectives in the future of education in America.

The four NELS program cohorts (NLS-72 seniors, the HS&B sophomores and seniors, and NELS:88 eighth graders) are displayed in Figure 1-2 according to their initial and subsequent survey years and their modal age at the time of each survey. As illustrated, NLS-72 seniors were first surveyed in 1972 at age 18 and have been resurveyed five times since, with the last survey occurring in 1986, when these respondents were about 32 years of age. The HS&B cohorts have been surveyed at points in time that would permit as much comparison as possible with the time points selected for NLS-72. The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988. The base year of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) represented the first stage of a major longitudinal effort designed to provide trend data about critical transitions experienced by students as they leave elementary school and progress through high school and into postsecondary institutions or the work force. The base year study, conducted in the spring term of the 1987-88 school year, selected 26,432 potential eighth grade participants, of whom 24,599 were successfully surveyed in 1,052 public and private schools. Additional data were gathered from eighth graders' parents, teachers, and principals. The first follow-up in 1990 provided the first opportunity for longitudinal measurement of the 1988 baseline sample. It also provided a comparison point to high school sophomores ten years before, as studied in HS&B. The study captured the population of early dropouts (those who leave school between the end of eighth grade and the end of tenth grade), while monitoring the transition of the swdent population into secondary schooling. The second follow-up took place in 1992, when most sample members entered the second term of their senior year. The second follow-up provides a culminating measurement of learning in the course of secondary school, and also collects information that will facilitate investigation of the transition into the labor force and postsecondary education after high school. Fresheningn the NELS:88 sample to represent the 12th grade class of 1992 makes trend comparisons with the senior cohorts that were studied in NLS-72 and HS&B possible. The NELS:88 second follow-up resurveyed students who were identified as dropouts in 1990, and identified and surveyed those additional students who left school after the first follow-up. The NELS:88 third follow-up took place in 1994, at a time when most sample members were in postsecondary education or in the labor force. A major goal of the 1994 round was to provide data for trend comparisons with NLS-72 and HS&B, and to continue cross-wave comparisons with previous NELS:88 rounds. Additionally, the third follow-up will permit researchers to assess the effect of eighth grade and high school curricular experiences on postsecondary education choice. The 1994 follow-up will provide the means to examine access of individuals with different backgrounds to different kinds of educational institutions. It will also facilitate study of the influences of high school education experiences on postsecondary education and employment opportunities and choices. Labor force participation, postsecondary persistence, curricular progress, and family formation are fitrther research topics which will be explored by the third follow-up. Additionally, the 1994 survey will provide a basis for assessing how   Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis. NELS:88 is a longitudinal study. In such a study, a probability sample of a population is drawn at one time (for NELS:88. 1988 eighth graders) and the same individuals are measured at later times (for NELS:88, 1990(for NELS:88, , 1992(for NELS:88, , 1994(for NELS:88, , and 1998. In a crosssectional survey a probability sample is drawn from the population and measured at one point in time, and data are collected for only that one point in time. NELS:88 data can be analyzed longitudinallyone can examine what happens to the eighth grade cohort over time (for example, one can measure gains in mathematics achievement between 1988 and 1992, or who drops out of school between 1988 and 1990). The capacity to measure change in individuals over time is a distinctive strength of the NELS:88 design. Following individual educational histories generally provides the best basis for making causal inference about educational processes and their effects. The base year of a longitudinal survey is also, by definition, a cross-sectional survey. Hence NELS:88 base year data can also be analyzed cross-sectionallyresearchers can look at the situation of a nationally representative sample of eighth graders in 1987-88. NELS:88 has a special samplefreshening feature which effectively supplies two additional nationally representative cross-sections: the nation's spring 1990 sophomores and spring 1992 seniors. Thus, the first and second follow-up data can also be analyzed either cross-sectionally or longitudinally. Cross-sectional data provide a snapshot at a single point in time. The capacity for longitudinal analysis--the measurement of individual-level change--is the paramount strength of NELS:88. However, group-level cross-sectional data, as well, can be employed to measure stability and change over time, when cross-sections are repeated to form a time series. NELS:88 provides two examples, through the reader should note that the first approach is not optimal: (1) Across waves within NELS:88, one can measure group-level change across successive cross-sectionseighth graders in 1988, sophomores in 1990, and seniors in 1992. An instance of this would be examining eighth, tenth, and twelfth grade math scores of Hispanics relative to whites to see if disparities became larger, smaller, or remained the same as grade level increased.23 (2) At the intercohort level, one can use a single round of NELS:88 in conjunction with a corresponding population taken from comparable studies (e.g., NLS-72 and HS&B) as repeated cross-sections (e.g., of seniors in 1972, 1980182, and 1992) to measure trends. Such cross-cohort analysis is the subject of this appendix. The three NELS study series--NLS-72, HS&B, and NELS:88--offcr a number of possible time points for comparison. The possible comparison points, and the considerations of content and design which may affect the comparability of data across the cohorts, are discussed in detail in the remainder of this appendi x.  Conducting Trend Analyses of NLS-72, HS&B, and NELS:88 Seniors: Analytical Implications of Design Differences Between the Studies This section discusses the kinds of comparisons that can be made between NELS:88, HS&B, and NLS-72, and the time points at which these comparisons can be made. This appendix also points to issues of similarity and difference in sample design and test and questionnaire content. NELS:88 has been specifically designed to facilitate comparisons with NLS-72 and HS&B. At the \"student\" level, three kinds of comparative analysis are possible (described below and summarized in Table 1). 1) Cohorts can be compared on an intergenerational or cross-cohort time-lag basis. Both crosssectional and longitudinal time-lag comparisons are possible. For example, (1-A) cross-sectionally, NELS:88 1992 results (when restricted to sample members whu are seniors) can be regarded as the third in a series of repeated cross-sections of 12th graders. That is to say, the status of NELS:88 second followup seniors in 1992 can be compared to HS&B base year seniors in 1980, and to NLS-72 seniors in 1972. Longitudinally (1-B), change for NELS:88 1990 sophomores two years later (that is, in 1992, when the cohort included both students and dropouts) can be compared to changes measured in 1982 from a 1980 HS&B sophomore baseline."}, {"section_title": "Cross-Sectional Comparisons", "text": "A.

The Prospects staidy, a nationally-representative multicohort longitudinal evaluation of Chapter 1 (now Title 1) with its first data collection in 1991, utilized many items from the NELS:88 questionnaires and thus provides a number of comparable data elements at several comparison points (e.g., eighth graders in 1992 versus eighth graders in 1988). Prospects supplies a rich perspective on student populations receiving compensatory education services from the Federal government or through programs sponsored by the school district.

In Table 3, natural comparison points are highlighted. However, with technical adjustments, comparability can oftentimes be achieved even when age/grade/stage parallelism has not been strictly maintained.\" In addition, survey rounds that coincide with a graderepresentative sample are noted by an asterisk. Thus, HS&B (sophomore cohort) in 1980 and NELS:88 in 1990 are nationally-representative samples of sophomores; NLS-72 in 1972, HS&B (senior cohort) in 1980, and NELS:88 in 1992 comprise nationally representative samples of seniors. The NELS:88 sample was freshened to make it representative of the nation's sophomores (1990) and seniors (1992). Sample freshening was not conducted in HS&B and the sophomore cohort does not constitute a valid probability sample of the nation's 1982 seniors. Nevertheless, 1982 HS&B sophomore cohort and 1992 NELS:88 can be compared, because both examine a nationally representative sample of sophomores two years later-consisting of students (most, but not all of them, seniors), early graduates, and dropouts.34 HS&B .1982 seniors can also be compared to 1972 NLS-72 and 1992 NELS:88 seniors, though not without some sample and statistical adjustments.35 There are two major kinds of differences between NLS-72, HS&B, and NELS:88 that must be taken into account. One difference pertains to the sample and research designs, and the other to differences in questionnaire or cognitive test content that may affect the possibility of drawing valid comparisons. Data users who are familiar with NLS-72 and HS&B will find that despite the considerable similarity between these studies and NELS:88, there are also significant sampie definition and statistical design differences, which analysts who intend to compare these cohorts should note. Similarly, while some effort has been made to maintain trend items over time, strict test and questionnaire overlap across the three studies is not considerable. Differences in sample design. The overall sample design for NELS:88 is essentially similar to the design employed in HS&B and NLS-72. In the base year, students were selected through a two stage stratified probability sample, with schools as the first units and students within schools as the second stage units. In NLS-72, all base year sample members were spring term 1972 high school seniors. In HS&B, all members of the student sample were spring term 1980 sophomores or seniors. Because NELS:88 began at eighth grade, its follow-ups encompass (like the HS&B sophomore cohort two years later [19821) students (both in the modal grade progression sequence, and out of sequence) and dropouts. HS&B was designed to provide two separate cohorts--a representative sample of 1980 sophomores and a representative sample of 1980 seniors. NELS:88 is designed to provide a representative sample of 1988 eighth graders, a further representative sample of 1990 sophomores, and finally a representative sample of 1992 seniors. In the HS&B first follow-up, students were not added to the original sample (that is, the 1980 sophomore 33 See, for example, the account by T.L. Hilton and J.M. Pollack on estimating postsecondary enrollment change over time using NLS-72 fourth follow-up (conducted over seven years after graduation) and HS&B third follow-up (conducted just less than six years after high school graduation) data, in Hilton (ed.) 1992. 34 There are a number of special definitional issues in comparing NELS:88 and HS&B dropouts. For a detailed discussion of these issues, see Conducting Trend Analyses: IIS&B and NELS:88 Dropouts, (Ingels and Dowd, National Center for Education S ta tis tics , 1995). 3S Specifically, out-of-sequence students (nonseniors) and nonstudents (such as dropouts and early graduates) must be removed from the HS&B analysis sample, and an adjustment made for the exclusion of students who were seniors in 1982 but were not part of the liS&B base year sampling frame, that is, 1982 seniors who were not 1980 sophomores in the U.S. A simplifying assumption here would be that in results and characteristics, these out-of-sequence 1982 seniors are essentially similar to the HS&I3 1980 sophomores who failed to progress in the modal grade sequence.  cohort sample was nct freshened in 1982 with seniors who had not been sophomores two years before and who therefore had no chance of selection into the HS&B Base Year sample). However, in NELS:88, owing to the desire to provide sample representativeness at three distinct points in time, new students can enter the study at tenth grade through two routes: sample freshening (addition of 1990 tenth graders who were not 1988 eighth graders or who were not in the United States in 1988) and change of eligibility statu s.36"}, {"section_title": "I Trends Among High School Seniors", "text": "Thus, while the base year designs of the three studies were essentially similar, because an eighthgrade baseline was chosen for NELS:88 and a high school baseline for NLS-72 and HS&B, two further differences arise when one compares the NELS:88 follow-up rounds with the other studies 1)the more variable, typically smaller and unrepresentative within-school samples in NELS:88 first and second follow-up as contrasted to the more uniform, larger, and representative within-school student samples of HS&B37 and NLS-72 (see Table 4). 2) the fact that, unlike HS&B in 1980, NLS-72 in 1972, or NELS:88 in 1988, NELS:88 1990 and 1992 high schools do not constitute a probability sample of schools; In addition, despite the fundamental similarity of the base year designs, there were some differences in school and subgroup sampling and oversampling strategies across NLS-72, HS&B, and NELS:88.38 Such differences are documented in detail in the various sampling, technical, and comparative analysis reports (listed in the reference section of this appendix) associated with each study, and such differences have implications for intercohort analysis. For example, the NELS:88 sample of high schools lacks national generalizability; school-level contrasts should therefore not be drawn between 1972 and 1980 high schools in NLS-72 and HS&B, on the one hand, and NELS:88, on the other. Likewise, subtle differences in stratification schemes limit comparisons that can be made. NELS:88 contains an Asian oversample, but HS&B and NLS-72 do not. NELS:88 contains a substantial oversample of non-Catholic private schools, a school type much more thinly represented in the other two studies. There are special considerations in comparing the NELS:88 and HS&B dropout and early graduate populations. In the NELS:88 second follow-up, dropouts who had obtained alternative credentials such as a GED were administered the student rather than the dropout questionnaire, along with the early graduate supplement--though classified as completers and appearing on the student data set in NELS:88, GED completers were not part of the student sampling frame for HS&B in 1980 or NLS-72, and therefore must be excluded from trend comparisons of seniors. (In HS&B's first follow-up [1982] such sophomore 36 For further information on sample freshening, see chapter 3 of the NELS:88 First Follow-up or Second Follow-up Student Component User's Manuals. 37 The HS&B 1980 sophomore and senior samples are fully in-school representative, but the HS&B sophomore 1982 (first follow-up) sample is not, because transfers into the school had no chance of selection into the sample. 38 An important additional difference, that may carry some consequences for comparability but will little affect analytic strategies, involves student sample replacement strategies. NI.S-72, unlike IIS&B and NELS:88, permitted replacement of noncooperating students under certain circumstances. While HS&B and NELS:88 made no attempt to replace students who refused to be part of the survey, HS&B did permit, but NELS:88 did not permit replacement of selected students who subsequently died, were discovered to have been listed in error, or who dropped out of school after selection but prior to the survey session. HS&B and NELS:88 also conducted a sample update to accommodate transfers into the Base Year schools between the sample selection and data collection phases of the studies.  cohort alternative completers were administered the dropout questionnaire.)

The study will be repeated with the same cohort at 2-year intervals. Study variables cover attitudes, school performance, and activities of the eighth-grade students. In addition to direct student data, the study design incorporates data from students' school principals, parents, and teachers to identify additional factors that affect student achievement. In addition to a general statistical profile of the target population, statistics and accompanying analyses cover mathematics and reading performance, at-risk issues, school safety and climate, and high school and college plans. Focus is on circumstances under which children flourish and succeed. The study included a clustered, stratified national probability sample of about 800 public and 200 private schools. Almost 25,000 students participated in the base-year study. The sample represents the nation's eighth-grade population, totalling about 3 million eighth-graders in over 38,000 school in the spring of 1988. Results reveal that the American eighth-grade population is very diverse. One out of every five students is unable to perform basic arithmetic tasks, and 14% of the students are unable to perform basic reading comprehension tasks.  Eighth Graders in 1988, 1991NCES 91-129. As part of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), this study examined the schools attended by eighth-graders in 1988, the year during which the more than 25,000 eighth-graders of the cohort were first studied. NELS:88 provides information on 802 public schools, 105 Catholic schools, 68 other religious schools, and 60 private, non-religious schools. Throughout the report, the unit of analysis is the school rather than students or teachers. Most of the school data were provided by school administrators. The data are used to develop a profile of the schools attended by eighth-graders, with information about various aspects of the learning environment, school policies and programs, and administrators' assessments of school climate. In 1988, 87.9% of eighth-graders attended public schools, 7.6% attended Catholic schools, 2.9% attended other religious schools, and 1.5% attended private non-religious schools. The study shows that eighth-graders learned under a wide range of different conditions in both public and private schools. Fifty-six data tables and five graphs are included.

The quality of the data was assessed several ways. The correspondence between parent and student responses to similar items on the similar items on the survey instruments was examined. When data wcre available, the study examined consistency among responses to related items. Finally, the reliability of several scales created from NELS:88 data was assessed.

The report explains the parameters of the study, the survey methodology, and the data reliability. The data are presented in the following bar graphs: (1) 8th to 10th grade cohort dropout rates by race/ethnicity and sex; (2) 8th to 10th grade cohort dropout rates by region and metropolitan status; and (3) 8th to 10th grade cohort dropout rates by eighthgrade school (public, Catholic, religious private, and non-religious private). (7 p.). 7. Owings, J.A., andPeng, S. Transitions Experienced by 1988 Eighth Graders, 1992. NCES 92-023. This brief report presents findings regarding two types of transitions experienced by students as they move between the eighth and 10th grades: continuing or dropping out of school and transferring between sectors. While 98% of public school students remained in public schools, over one-third of Catholic school eighth graders and over 25% of National Association of Independent Schools students transferred to public or other private schools. About 6% of all eighth graders were classified as dropouts by spring of their scheduled 10th-grade year. For most students, the move between eighth and 10th grades involves a change of schools and exposure to new educational settings. These transitions may have an impact on student learning and personal development. Consequently, differences in transition patterns and possible outcomes are of major interest. Data were obtained from the base year and first follow-up surveys of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), which began in 1988 with a sample of 1,052 schools and 24,599 eighth graders. In the spring of 1990, 17,424 students were studied in the first follow-up to determine their education status and progress, and school, community, and work experiences. Four tables present study data, and five graphs illustrate trends from 1988 to 1990. (13 p.). 8. Kaufman, P., and Bradby, D. Characteristics of At-Risk Students in NELS:88, 1992; NCES 92-042. The study described in this report examined the characteristics of eighth-grade students who were at risk of school failure. The study used data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, which is a large-scale, national longitudinal study begun in the spring of 1988 when 25,000 eighth graders attending public and private schools across the nation were surveyed along with the students' parents, teachers, and school principals. The students werz re-surveyed in 1990, and the base year and follow-up data of NELS:88 taken together provide a wealth of information about eighth graders' as they move in and out of the U.S. school system and into the varied activities of early adolescence. This study, focused on at-risk students within the eighth-grade cohort, examined the following sets of variables: (1) basic demographic characteristics; (2) family find personal background characteristics; (3) the amount of parental involvement in the student's Trends Among High School Seniors 1972 education; (4) the students' academic history; (5) student behavioral factors; (6) teacher perceptions of the students; and (7) characteristics of the students' schools. Black, Hispanic American, and Native American students and students from low-socioeconomic backgrounds were more likely to be at-risk. Male eighth graders were more likely to have low basic skills, but were no more likely to drop out. After controlling for sex and socioeconomic status, Black and Hispanic American dropout rates were found to be the same as that for Whites. However, even when controlling for and economic status, Black and Hispanic American students were more likely than White students to perform below basic proficiency levels.

Language Characteristics and Academic Achievement: A Look at Asian and Hispanic", "text": "Eighth Graders in NELS:88, 1992;NCES 92-479. This report examines the demographic and language characteristics and educational aspirations of Asian American and Hispanic American eighth graders and relates that information to their mathematical ability and reading comprehension as measured by an achievement test. Special attention is paid to students who come from homes in which a non-English language is spoken. Of the 1,505 Asian American students evaluated, 73 percent were reported as language minorities (LMs), while 77 percent of the 3,129 Hispanic American students evaluated were LW. Of the LM students, 66 percent of the Asian Americans had high English proficiency as compared to 64 percent of the LM Hispanic Americans. Both Asian American and Hispanic American groups had 4 percent of LM students showing low English proficiency. Overall, the study found many similarities between the two groups. However, differences are apparent when data are divided along language proficiency, mathematics achievement, aspiration, and other measures. This report profiles the mathematics and science instruction received by eighth graders (11,414 eighth graders had teacher reports in mathematics and 10,686 in science) in public and private schools in 1988. A preface lists highlighted findings, tables, and figures included in the document. The body of the report consists of five chapters. Chapter I discusses the purpose and format of the report and limitations of the study. Chapters II and III examine the relationship of various aspects of mathematics and science instruction to students' socioeconomic status and race-ethnicity and type of school attended. Among the aspects examined were the major topics taught, average class size, hours per week attended, allocation of class time, assigned homework, availability of instructional materials, student attitudes toward mathematics and science, and teacher characteristics and qualifications. Chapter IV examincs mathematics and science achievement test scores in relation to the various components of instniction measured in the study.

Rasinski, K.A., Ingcls, S.J., Rock, D.A., and Pollack, J. America' s High School Sophomores: A Ten Year Comparison, 1980NCES 93-087. This study of high school sophomores in 1980 and 1990 compares the experiences of students in the two cohorts, identifying changes in in-school and out-of-school activities, academic achievement, self-concept, values, plans, and aspirations. Similarities and differences between the two groups are documented using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) and High School and Beyond (HS&B, 1980). HS&B and NELS:88 sophomores are marked by basic demographic differences, including the smaller size of the NELS:88 1990 cohort, reflecting the baby bust of the 1970s, and a higher proportion of racial minority and poverty status sophomores in 1990. NELS:88 sophomores also reflect the influence of various waves of school reform since the late 1970s and early 1980s. Overall, the comparison paints a pictures that is in most respects encouraging in its portrayal of the high school academic orientation and postsecondary expectations of the 1990 sophomore class. Positive changes, however, are typically small or moderate in magnitude. Among the findings are: (1) general and college preparatory program placement has increased, at the expense of vocational program placement; (2) patterns of extracurricular participation changed especially in musical activities (31% in 1980 to 22% in 1990) and in hobby clubs (21% in 1980 to 7% in 1990); (3) changes in sophomores giving high importance to particular life values (e.g., marriage and family 83% rating this as very important in 1980, 72% in 1990); (4) small but statistically significant increase in the number of females aspiring to traditionally male-dominated non-professional occupations (15.6% in 1980 versus 18.% tn 1990).

This publication illustrates use of the NELS:88 dichotomous proficiency scores for conducting achievement gain analysis (see Scott,Rock,Pollack and Ingels [entry 21] for an illustration of an alternative gain analysis strategy, the use of mathematics probability of proficiency scores). The fmdings presented in this report suggest that course-taking patterns in mathematics between eighth grade and the sophomore year of high school represent an important factor in explaining growth in math proficiency. For example, even after controlling for eighth-grade math proficiency, higher math gains were associated with course-taking patterns that reflected advanced level math courses. The report also suggests that eighth-grade students who have higher aspirations for postsecondary education are also more likely to show positive math gains. (20 p.)

Myers, D., and Heiser, N. Students' School Transition Patterns between Eighth and Tenth Grades Based on NEL S:88, 1994; NCES 94-137. Analysis of NELS:88 data makes it possible to explore the relationships between student and family characteristics and the likelihood of shifting among public and private schools as students progress from eighth to tenth grade. This study examines the characteristics of students who switch between sectors (public to private, or private to public) as they move from eighth to tenth grade. Five sets of variables were examined to estimate the association between variations in the students' transition patterns and student and family characteristics: (1) basic student and family background characteristics; (2) the amount of parental involvement in the student's education; 3the student's academic achievement and educational expectations; (4) the characteristics of the student's school; and (5) parental satisfaction with the student's school. Examination of these characteristics permits four research questions to be addressed: (1) How many students shift between the public and private school sectors? How many students shift from one private school to another?; (2) Who shifts between sectors? Are family background factors, parental involvement, or students' academic achievement or educational expectations associated with variations in transition pattems?; 3Are school characteristics associated with students' propensity to move between school sectors?; (4) Do parents who are dissatisfied with their children's school shift their children to another type of school? 20. Green, P.J., Dugoni, B.L., Inge Is, S.J., and Cambum, E. A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992, NCES, 1995;NCES 94-384. This report examines the background of 1992 high school seniors, the school environment which shaped their senior year experiences, the curriculum in which they were enrolled, their academic achievement, their plans and expectations for the future, and their non-academic experiences during this important period of development. Chapter I provides a demographic profile of high school seniors. Chapter 2 depicts their school and peer environment by recording seniors' perceptions of school, of the safety of their school, and of the values of their peers. Chapter 3 describes their course and program enrollments. Chapter 4 examines the tested achievement of 1992 seniors. Chapter 5 describes their short-term plans--their postsecondary plans, steps they have taken to gain entrance to college, and factors they considered in choosing a postsecondary institution. Chapter 6 reports on seniors' plans and expectations for the future. Finally, chapter 7 describes the senior cohort's experiences outside of school--use of illicit dregs and alcohol, television viewing, jobs, participation in school government, and community volunteer work. Taken together, these seven chapters provide a statistical profile of the American high school senior in 1992. Appendices provide unweighted (sample) Ns and standard errors.

Two Years Later: Cognitive Gains and School Transitions of NEI_ S:88 Eighth Graders, 1994, NCES 94-436. This report describes the growth in cognitive skills and achievement, and the continuities and discontinuities experienced in school and at home by the NELS:88 eighth grade-cohort during the two years between the study's base year (1988) and first follow-up (1990) surveys. Four distinct topics are addresscd, involving both school dropouts and persisters. 1By 1990, some 1988 eighth graders were dropouts; this report describes their characteristics and the reasons they gave for dropping out of school. 2This report presents findings on patterns of school transition-changing from a public eighth-grade school to a private high school or vice versa--and the changes in perception of safety and overall learning environment cohort members experienced after moving from a typically more homogeneous middle school environment to a more heterogeneous high school environment. 3Additionally, this report summarizes major changes in home life and family, such as the divorce or remarriage of a parent, that also occurred during cohort members' transition to and/or early years of high school. 4Finally, this report examines the 1988-90 achievement gain of the eighth-grade cohort, thus addressing several basic questions: How much did students gain in achievement in the two years following eighth grade?; Who gained, in what subjects, and (for mathematics) in what way (that is, at what skill or proficiency level)? The analysis of growth in achievement illustrates use of the NELS:88 continuous measure of probability of mathematics proficiency (see Rock, Owings and Lee [1994, entry 151 for an illustration of mathematics achievement gain analysis using NELS:88 dichotomous proficiency scores). 22.

It supplies a sociodemographic descrintion of the three senior cohorts. The report compares the cohorts' high school program placement, course-taking and achievement, as well as participation in extracurricular activities. It also compares 1972, 1980 and 1992 seniors' plans for the next year, noting the proportions who planned to work full-time in the year following graduation, the type of postsecondary institution seniors planned to attend, college selection, and major field of study. Finally, the report compares the future educational and occupational aspirations of the three senior cohorts. 23. Hoffer, T.B. and Moore, W. High School Seniors' Instructional Experiences in Science and Mathematics, 1995. This study examines the instructional experiences of a national sample of 1992 high school seniors in the subjects of science and mathematics. The data analyzed are from the second follow-up survey of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). The information on instruction comes from the NELS:88 1992 survey of teachers, which collected questionnaires from the science and mathematics teachers of 9,853 sampled seniors enrolled in public and private high schools across the United States. Two general questions are addressed: Why do students' instructional experiences differ? and What consequences do the differences have for student academic achievement? Descriptive statistics on the relationships of students' family backgrounds, Trends Among fligh School Seniors 1972 curriculum track level, and high school characteristics with instructional variables are presented. Regression analysis is used to estimate the effects of different instructional experiences on achievement score gains from 1990 to 1992. 24. Green, P.J., and Scott, L.A. \"At-Risk\" Eighth Graders Four Years Later, NCES, 1995;NCES 95-736. This publication in the NCES Statistics in Brief series extends to the 1992 second follow-up the analysis of \"at risk\" factors begun by Hairier, Inge ls, Schneider, and Stevenson (1990) with the base year data and continued by Scott, Rock, Pollack and Inge Is (1995) with the first follow-up data. Approximately 26 percent of eighth grade students had an \"at risk\" characteristic and 20 percent had two or more of these risk factors. Examining the outcomes of at-risk eighth graders four years later (1992), Green and Scott examine both achievement outcomes and social and behavioral outcomes. With respect to achievement, Green and Scott report that (1) approximately one in six adolescents with multiple risk factors were unable to comprehend basic, written information, testing below the basic level in reading in 1992. In comparison, only about one in twenty of those with no risk factors were unable to demonstrate basic reading skills. 2At-risk students were more likely than others in 1992 to test poorly in mathematics. Over half of those with multiple risk factors tested at the basic level, or below, In contrast, only about a fifth of those with no observed risk factors tested at that level. 3Nearly one-third of students with multiple risk factors could not demonstrate even a \"common knowledge\" of science. Only 12.2 of students with no risk factors failed to demonstrate competence at this basic level. In respect of 1992 social and behavioral outcomes, and 1992 graduation status, Green and Scott report 1Students who had multiple risk factors in 1992 were no more likely than others to report using illicit drugs (marijuana or alcohol), or to report abusing alcohol than those with no risk factors. (2) Eighth graders who had multiple risk factors in 1988 were more likely than others to have a child in 1992--18.9 percent compared to 5.4 percent. '(3) Students with multiple risk factors were more likely than others to report being suspended, and being sent to a juvenile home or detention center. (4) Among 1988 eighth graders with no risk factors, ninety percent had earned a high school diploma by 1992. Among 1988 eighth graders with multiple risk factors, sixty percent had earned their high school diploma by 1992, while the other forty percent had not. 25. Rock, D.A., and Pollack, J.M. Mathematics Course Taking and Gains in Mathematics Achievement. NCES, 1995;NCES 95-714. This publication in the NCES Statistics in Brief series extends to the 1992 second follow-up the analysis of 1988-1990 test score gains reported in Scott, Rock, Pollack and Inge ls (1995). However, instead of self-report data on courses completed, Rock and Pollack utilize the results of the NELS:88 high school transcript study. Rock and Pollack found that when student gains in tested mathematics achievement were cross-classified by grade in school and highest level of mathematics course taken: Slightly over 60 percent of high school students do not go beyond the algebra 2/geometry level of coursework. Approximately 1 out of 9 students take a calculus course while in high school; about 1 out of 4 students, in contrast, never go past algebra in their high school career. Trends Among High School Seniors 1972 Growth in arithmetic, algebra, and geometry achievement appears to be greater in the first two years of high school than in the last two years for almost all course-taking categories. Students who take the more advanced mathematics courses show greater gains, both between 8th and lOrn grade, and between 10th and 12th grade. Students who do not take advanced courses make greater gains on test items dealing with computational skills, while students in the advanced courses make larger gains on test items requiring conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills. In fact, for these students, significant growth does not occur until they move into the pre-calculus level of coursework. 26. Hoffer, T.B., Rasinski, K.A., and Moore, W. Sockil Background Differences in High School Mathematics and Science Coursetaking and Achievemeni. NCE.S, 1995;NCES 95-206. This publication in the NCES Statistics in Brief series uses NELS:88 test and transcript data to address two questions: (a) To what extent do students from different social backgrounds differ in the numbers of courses they complete during high school and in their final levels of academic achievement? And (b) Does additional coursework have comparable relationships to measured achievement gains during the high school years for students from different backgrounds. Hoffer, Rasinski and Moore report the following findings: (1) Gender differences in the numbers of science and mathematics courses students complete are not significant. Students from higher socioeconc mic families, however, complete more courses in these subjects. 2The numbers of math and science courses students complete in high school are strongly related to how much their test scores increase from the end of eighth grade to the end of senior year. 3Additional coursework pays off about equally for all students in terms of increasing achievement gain, regardless of gender, race-ethnicity, and social class."}]
