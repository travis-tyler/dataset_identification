[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) was developed in the 1980s to assess the level of cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. Advancements in the research field have shifted focus toward pre-dementia populations, and use of the ADAS-Cog has extended into these pre-dementia studies despite concerns about its ability to detect important changes at these milder stages of disease progression. If the ADAS-Cog cannot detect important changes, our understanding of pre-dementia disease progression may be compromised and trials may incorrectly conclude that a novel treatment approach is not beneficial. The purpose of this review was to assess the performance of the ADAS-Cog in pre-dementia populations, and to review all modifications that have been made to the ADAS-Cog to improve its measurement performance in dementia or pre-dementia populations. The contents of this review are based on bibliographic searches of electronic databases to locate all studies using the ADAS-Cog in pre-dementia samples or subsamples, and to locate all modified versions. Citations from relevant articles were also consulted. Overall, our results suggest the original ADAS-Cog is not an optimal outcome measure for pre-dementia studies; however, given the prominence of the ADAS-Cog, care must be taken when considering the use of alternative outcome measures. Thirty-one modified versions of the ADAS-Cog were found. Modification approaches that appear most beneficial include altering scoring methodology or adding tests of memory, executive function, and/or daily functioning. Although modifications improve the performance of the ADAS-Cog, this is at the cost of introducing heterogeneity that may limit between-study comparison."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Assessment ScaleCognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) is considered the gold standard for assessing the efficacy of antidementia treatments.

Kueper et al. / Review of the ADAS-Cog", "text": "1980s, theoretical and clinical developments have shifted research interest earlier in the natural history to include pre-dementia syndromes, especially mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . It is now thought that intervening to slow or stop the progression of disease will be more effective than waiting until severe neuropathology and dysfunction have developed [1, 4, [7] [8] [9] . Thus, many research studies, both observational and experimental, are being conducted in pre-dementia populations, whereby cognitive ability may range from normal cognition (NC) to MCI [5, 8, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . The ADAS-Cog is often employed in these pre-dementia studies; however, the ADAS-Cog was developed for use in studies of dementia where cognitive impairments are more severe. Concerns have been raised about whether the ADAS-Cog is able to detect important changes at earlier stages of disease progression [2, 7, 15, 16] . If not, studies may miss disease progression or regression, or miss potential treatment benefits. Using an outcome measure in a population or context where it does not perform well threatens both internal and external study validity.\nThis narrative review has two main objectives: first, to review the performance of the ADAS-Cog in subjects with pre-dementia status such as MCI, and second, to assess responsiveness of modified ADAS-Cog versions in dementia and pre-dementia populations."}, {"section_title": "DEVELOPMENT OF THE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE ASSESSMENT SCALE", "text": "The ADAS was originally designed as a rating scale to assess the severity of cognitive and noncognitive dysfunction from mild to severe AD [17] . Twenty-one tasks were selected from a pool of forty candidate tasks based on reliability and validity comparisons between 27 subjects with AD and 28 subjects with NC [17] . The full ADAS takes about 45 minutes to administer, and is scored from 0 to 150 by summing the number of errors made on each task so that higher scores indicate worse performance [17] .\nThe ADAS comprises two subscales. The noncognitive subscale (ADAS-Noncog) includes 10 tasks, scored from 0 to 50, which consider mood and behavioral changes [17] . The ADAS-Noncog is not widely used and will not be reviewed further.\nThe cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) includes 11 tasks that include both subject-completed tests and observer-based assessments [17] . Together these tasks assess the cognitive domains of memory, language, and praxis [17] . Specific tasks (Table 1) include Word Recall, Naming Objects and Fingers, Commands, Constructional Praxis, Ideational Praxis, Orientation, Word Recognition, and Language [17] .\nInitially the two memory tasks (Word Recall and Word Recognition) were viewed as a separate memory subscale [17] , but this distinction is not commonly seen in research studies. Usually studies administer all 11 tasks and score them as a single scale from 0 to 70; we use \"ADAS-Cog-11\" to refer to this 11-task version.\nIn the original development sample, concurrent criterion validation was suggested by statistically significant correlations with well-established outcome measures, including the Sandoz Clinical AssessmentGeriatric, the Memory-Information Test, and the Dementia Rating Scale [17] . Point-biserial correlations further demonstrated that subjects with AD had significantly higher scores on the ADAS-Cog-11 (r = 0.754, p < 0.0001) as well as on all individual ADAS-Cog-11 tasks (all p < 0.0001) than subjects with NC [17] .

In samples with NC, the ADAS-Cog-11 showed measurement invariance with respect to gender and education, but not age [3, 18, 22] . In these NC samples, age was significantly correlated with total ADAS-Cog-11 scores as well as with the Word Recall task [3, 18, 22] .

All 11 tasks have shown statistically significant differences between NC and MCI subgroups, and all but three tasks (Commands, Ideational Praxis, Language) have demonstrated significantly higher scores in AD than MCI subgroups [18] . Furthermore, statistically significant differences in the scores for three tasks have been found between subjects with MCI and none versus one versus two APOE 4 alleles, a genetic risk factor for AD [32] . Rosen et al. (1984) found a statistically significant worsening on ADAS (p = 0.02) and ADAS-Cog-11 (p = 0.01) scores over a 12-month period for ten subjects with AD but not for ten subjects with NC (all p > 0.05) in their original development sample [17] .

Statistically significant differences have been found between the magnitude of change scores for subjects with NC, MCI, and AD [26, 31, 33] . In general, subjects with AD have the largest change scores, followed by those with MCI, and then those with NC. Importantly, the magnitude of change scores detected in NC and MCI samples is very small [2, 26, 33] . At the item level, all individual ADAS-Cog-11 tasks have been found to have smaller Standardized Response Means (SRM = mean difference score/SD of difference scores) than the ADAS-Cog-11 total score [15] . The three tasks demonstrating the largest SRM were Word Recall, Orientation, and Word Recognition [15] . The magnitude of 12-month and 24-month change scores for six ADAS-Cog-11 tasks produced smaller change scores in MCI than AD groups [15] .

Furthermore, the ADAS-Cog-11 failed to produce statistically significant treatment effects in several situations where one was hypothesized to be present based on other indicators of disease progression [42] .\nSummary of ADAS-Cog-11 performance in pre-dementia studies ADAS-Cog-11 scores in pre-dementia populations are driven primarily by the Word Recall and Word Recognition tasks, and age may influence scores for older adults with NC. Despite this, ADAS-Cog-11 scores generally appear able to detect differences in cognitive ability in groups defined by an exposure that is expected to be associated with cognitive ability (for example, brain glucose metabolism), although the magnitude of the differences detected tends to be small. Responsiveness of the ADAS-Cog-11 to treatment effects appears low compared to other global outcome measures and compared to outcome measures designed to assess subdomains of cognition or other aspects of dementia and pre-dementia syndromes. Nonetheless, caution must be maintained when interpreting these findings because an in-depth exploration of whether there truly should be an association between cognition or disease severity and any given exposure or treatment, and the potential magnitude and direction of these associations, was not explored.

Specifically, they found ADAS-Cog-11 tasks do not have equal measurement precision, several subtask item response categories are disordered in terms of difficulty, and a difference of X points at the low end of the scoring range does not equal the same amount of difference in cognitive ability as a difference of X points at the higher end of the scoring range [86] . Wouters et al. (2008) used Rasch analysis to develop a scoring method that overcomes the first two limitations. In brief, response categories with the same level of difficulty for each task on the ADASCog-11 were collapsed so that the ADAS-Rasch has hierarchically ordered categories, and each task is weighted by its measurement precision [86] . The total possible score for each task of the ADAS-Rasch is the product of the number of different categories of difficulty present for the items of that task and the weight assigned to the task: Word Recall (total possible points for ADAS-Cog-11 = 10 versus total possible points for ADAS-Rasch = 12), Naming Objects and The ADAS-Rasch was developed from baseline data of the placebo arms of three clinical trials that included 706 subjects with mild to moderate dementia [86] .

The ADAS-Rasch appears to demonstrate baseline discrimination, although statistical tests of scores between groups have not been performed [25, 35] .

(2012) used subsetting analysis to develop subsets of ADAS-Cog-11 tasks based on the ability of individual tasks to detect a treatment effect in three 24 week randomized controlled trials of 855 subjects with mild to moderate AD [87] . First, they calculated pre-post difference scores for all ADAS-Cog-11 tasks [87] . A binary (0,1) response variable was created and coded 1 if the pre-post difference on the task score was less than or equal to 0 (treatment responder; did not get worse) and coded 0 if the pre-post difference was greater than 0 (treatment non-responder; subject got worse) [87] . Importantly, \"responders\" were defined as those who showed no worsening on any task of a given subset of tasks over the course of the study; responders could be in the placebo or treatment group [87] . Second, an algorithm was used to identify subsets of ADAS-Cog-11 tasks that could identify groups of responders, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to find subsets with statistically significant differences in the proportion of responders between treatment and placebo groups [87] . The subset with the lowest p-value was selected as the collection of ADAS-Cog-11 tasks with the most potential for detecting a treatment response [87] .\nThe primary result of this analysis was the ADAS-Cog-5-Subset: Ideational Praxis, Remembering Test Instructions, Language, Comprehension, and Word Finding Difficulty [87] .

Although their primary focus was identifying limitations to traditional ADAS-Cog-11 scoring methodology, Balsis et al. (2012) also showed how using IRT to model a subject's score along with the difficulty of individual items can increase precision for estimating cognitive ability [88] . Verma et al. (2015) found, using multidimensional IRT on data from a large sample of older adults with NC to AD, that the ADAS-Cog-11 is most appropriately modelled using three latent factors corresponding to the cognitive domains of memory (Word Recall, Orientation, and Word Recognition tasks), language (Naming Objects and Fingers, Language, Comprehension of Spoken Language, Word Finding Difficulty, and Remembering Test Instructions tasks), and praxis (Commands, Constructional Praxis, and Ideational Praxis tasks) [89] . The finding that the ADAS-Cog-11 was best modelled using multiple latent cognitive domains suggests that the unidimensional assumption used in Classical Test Theory may not be appropriate for assessing the ADAS-Cog-11.\nVerma et al. (2015) evaluated their multidimensional IRT scoring methodology for the ADAS-Cog-11 using data from the treatment arms of 11 clinical trials that enrolled older adults with AD [89] . Their ADAS-Cog-IRT uses ICCs from patient responses on the ADAS-Cog-11 to provide an assessment of cognitive impairment based on maximum likelihood estimation [89] . Differential Item Functioning analyses were used to adjust item slopes and intercepts so that patient characteristics other than cognitive ability do not cause large variations in scores [89] . To maintain non-negative final scores, summary scores for the memory, language, and praxis domains were linearly scaled [89] . This ADAS-Cog-IRT scoring methodology demonstrated good accuracy as assessed by root mean squared error of observed compared to predicted ADAS-Cog-11 scores (6.05 points) [89] . Precision was assessed using item information functions. Memory tasks showed good precision across the entire range of memory impairment, however precision for measuring language and praxis impairment was suboptimal at lower levels of cognitive ability [89] .\nThe application of IRT scoring methodology to the ADAS-Cog-11 provided the same score to all subjects with the same cognitive ability in contrast to traditional scoring whereby two subjects with equal cognitive ability can score differently, and two subjects with different scores on the ADAS-Cog-11 can have equal underlying cognitive ability [89] .

An updated version added items to access frontal lobe function: all tasks from the ADAS-Cog-11 with a delayed recall portion added to the Word Recall task (memory), two number cancellation tasks (attention), a maze (executive function), symbol digit modalities (attention/concentration), backwards digit span (working memory), and animal category retrieval (verbal fluency) [92] .\nPerformance summary.

(2015) used IRT methods with 788 subjects with diagnoses ranging from Subjective Cognitive Impairment (SCI) to severe stages of AD to determine where along the continuum of disease progression the Delayed Word Recall task provides the most information about cognitive ability, and to determine if it alters the measurement precision of the ADAS-Cog-11 [93] . Item Characteristic Curves (ICC)s showed that in general, memory tasks of the ADAS-Cog-12 are the most sensitive to earlier stages of disease progression, and the Delayed Word Recall task provides the most information in the mildest range of cognitive impairment with its ICC being significantly different from that of the other memory tasks [93] . The Delayed Word Recall task does not however have much sensitivity for more severe cognitive dysfunction such as that seen with AD [93] . Floor effects (10 errors) on the Delayed Word Recall task were seen for 9% of the MCI group and 52% of the AD group at baseline [93] .

A second purpose of the ADAS-Tree, pertinent to our review, was to discriminate between subjects with different levels of disease severity at the start of a clinical trial [1] .\nTo develop the ADAS-Tree, the Random Forests (RF) tree-based algorithm was used to derive weights for each task of the ADAS-Cog-13 based on their ability to discriminate between subjects with NC, MCI, and AD. Briefly, ten thousand bootstrap datasets were taken from baseline data of 229 subjects with NC, 397 subjects with MCI, and 193 subjects with AD [1] .

These excluded samples were used to obtain an estimate of predictive accuracy by comparing diagnoses predicted by the majority of classification trees (RF model) with original diagnoses [1] . Weights for each task of the ADAS-Cog-13 were derived by comparing the predictive accuracy of the RF model fit using the full ADAS-Cog-13 to the predictive accuracy of a RF model fit when one ADAS-Cog-13 task was replaced by noise, repeated for all tasks [1] .

(2014) used IRT and pharmacometric modelling to analyze ADAS-Cog-13 scores [7] . First, an IRT model to estimate baseline cognitive ability was created using data from 2,744 subjects with NC, MCI, or mild AD [7] . The IRT baseline model models cognitive ability as a subject-specific random effect following a standard normal distribution (Zscore), with no limits on the upper or lower extremes of cognitive ability [7] . The probability of a subject responding a certain way on an ADAS-Cog-13 task (or sub-item), given their underlying cognitive ability, was described using four different test item specific models. First, tasks that are scored as correct or incorrect (e.g., Orientation: correctly state the month) were modeled with a three-parameter binary model that accounts for item discrimination, item difficulty, and the probability that a subject with no cognitive disability would get the item incorrect [7] . Second, tasks involving words were modeled with a binomial model, with slightly different failure probabilities depending on the task (Word Recall failure probability: three-parameter binary model described above; Word Recognition failure probability: same as for Word Recall plus a fourth parameter to account for the maximal probability that a subject with severe cognitive dysfunction would correctly categorize words as seen or not) [7] . All words were assumed to hold the same amount of information about underlying cognition [7] . Third, the Number Cancellation task was modelled using a generalized Poisson model, which included the same three test item parameters as the three-parameter binary model plus a fourth parameter for dispersion, and a factor to ensure predicted scores are in the range of 0 to 40 [7] . Fourth, tasks on the ADAS-Cog-13 that are rated by the examiner (e.g., Comprehension of Spoken Language) were modeled using a proportional odds, ordered categorical model with five ordinal categories (none to severe impairment) and parameters for item difficulty and discrimination [7] .\nNext, three different methods of measuring cognitive change over time were assessed. The latter two are extensions of the baseline IRT model: i) A Least-Square Mean Analysis Model used change in ADAS-Cog-13 score as the outcome variable, treatment as the exposure variable, visit as a repeated factor, baseline ADAS-Cog-13 score as a covariate, a treatment-by-visit interaction term, and a grouping factor of subjects nested within treatment [7] . This represents a more \"traditional\" ADAS-Cog scoring methodology. ii) The baseline IRT model was extended a Longitudinal IRT Model by adding a hidden variable to account for disease progression over time [7] . Disease progression was assumed to be linear, subject-specific, and modelled through random-effects [7] . A hazard function for the probability that a subject will drop out of a longitudinal study was also included [7] . To assess the performance of the longitudinal IRT model, Z-score estimates of underlying cognitive ability for an 18-month long clinical trial were translated back to the original ADAS-Cog-13 scale and compared with observed ADASCog-13 scores from 322 real subjects in the 18-month clinical trial [7] . Specifically, twohundred Monte-Carlo simulations from the IRT model and the original clinical trial data were used to compare the proportion of subjects from the original data whose task-level scores would fall in the 95% prediction interval from the score produced by IRT models [7] . Total ADAS-Cog-13 score comparisons were done in a similar manner [7] . ADAS-Cog-13 scores for the clinical trial were plotted with the median, 2.5th, and 97.5th percentile of the real scores observed in the clinical trial. When plotted on top, the median value of the real scores fell within the 95% CI predicted by the IRT model for all but the final 18-month follow-up assessment [7] . iii) The Pharmacometric Total ADAS-Cog Score\nModel was based on a previously published disease progression model, modified according to the results of goodness of fit plots, residual plots, and visual prediction checks [7] . This model was further refined and tested using a simulated data set from the longitudinal IRT model [7] . Similar to the longitudinal IRT model analyses whereby estimated ADAS-Cog-11 total scores were compared to observed scores in a real clinical trial, the performance of the pharmacometric total ADAS-Cog-13 score model was assessed with visual predictive checks of whether the 95% CI for the ADAS-Cog-13 scores estimated from the pharmacometric model included the 2.5th, 97.5th, and median ADAS-Cog-13 scores from the ADAS-Cog Longitudinal IRT model based simulated data set [7] . The final pharmacometric total ADAS-Cog-13 score model assumes a linear progression of cognitive dysfunction (increasing scores), and models individual subject baseline scores with a Box-Cox distribution and normally distributed individual slope parameters correlated with baseline random effect [7] .\nPerformance summary.

(2016) developed the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS) from outcome measures previously shown to be sensitive to ADspecific clinical decline and treatment effects using pooled data from the placebo arm of four aMCI clinical trials (n = 1,160) [101] . A partial least squares procedure was used to fit a linear model characterizing disease progression and variable importance projections (VIP) for candidate items [101] . The ADCOMS was derived by combining the twelve items with a VIP value of 0.8 or greater, weighted by their partial least squares coefficients [101] . Specific items included four ADAS-Cog-12 tasks (Delayed Word Recall, Orientation, Word Recognition, Word Finding Difficulty), two MMSE items (Orientation time, Drawing), and six CDR-SB items (Personal Care, Community Affairs, Home and Hobbies, Judgement and Problem Solving, Memory, Orientation) [101] .\nPerformance summary. The ADCOMS demonstrated better responsiveness to disease progression and treatment effects in MCI than the ADASCog-12 [101] ."}, {"section_title": "Overview of combined scoring method and task content modifications", "text": "The ADAS-3b removed all tasks with suggested ceiling effects in pre-dementia populations, while the CC1 and CC2 add back on to the ADAS-3b assessments of additional cognitive domains that were left out of the reduced measure. Other modifications that remove some items with ceiling effects from the ADAS-Cog-11 but also include additional cognitive tasks are the ADAS-5 and TE4D. One modification approach, ADNI-Mem, focused solely on combining tests of memory; this measure may be beneficial for certain research questions, but not those that include some indication of overall cognitive ability.\nFour modification approaches highlighted that certain tasks are more informative than others and incorporated these differences into the scores. The ADAS-Tree and ADAS-RW provide easier weighting schemes than the ADAS-IRT/Pharmacometric and Common Item Pooling methods, but these weighting schemes may be optimized for the development study sample, potentially limiting generalizability.\nComputerization modifications, including the TDAS and CAMCOG-Plus, may trade off reduced variability in test administration for increased research costs and less accessibility for some subjects.\nAdding functionality assessments to ADAS-Cog-11 tasks (possibly with other cognitive measures) aligns with the present understanding of dementia and pre-dementia syndromes as including both cognitive and functional deficits. These may have better content validity of overall disease severity than purely cognitive measures. However, these composite measures will be of less interest when research questions focus on cognition or functionality as separate constructs; hence, while the SSS, CFC1, CFC2, and ADCOMS may have the advantage of being shorter assessments or incorporating a variety of cognitive tasks (e.g., not all from ADAS-Cog-11) in addition to functionality tasks, the Pooled Index, iADRS, and ADAS-Plus-EF&FA have the advantage of administering all tasks of the ADAS-Cog-11 so that those scores could be isolated, if needed."}, {"section_title": "Summary of modifications made to the ADAS-Cog-11", "text": "Of the 31 modifications of the ADAS-Cog-11, 5 altered the original scoring methodology, 4 maintained the scoring methodology and added additional tasks, and 22 both altered scoring methodology and added tasks.\nIn general, adding memory items to the ADASCog-11, occasionally accompanied by the removal of other tasks, improved responsiveness to disease progression and to treatment effects [2, 15, 28, 35] . Adding assessments of EF to the ADAS-Cog-11, with or without modifying scoring methodology, and with or without additional measures of memory, was found to improve responsiveness to disease progression and to treatment effects in MCI populations in all but one instance [2, 15, 25, 98, 99] . The results of our review also support recent statements that ideal measures for MCI and early AD should include both cognitive and functional assessments [98, 99] . Modifications that added items to assess functionality, alone or in combination with other cognitive tests or alternative scoring methods, demonstrated superior responsiveness to disease progression and to treatment effects in MCI populations than ADAS-Cog-11 modification approaches that only modified cognitive content alone or in combination with scoring modification techniques [15, 25, 98, 101] . The only exception was that the ADAS-Tree outperformed the ADAS-Plus-EF&FA for responsiveness to disease progression, although the ADAS-Plus EF&FA demonstrated superior responsiveness over the ADAS-Tree to treatment effects [25] ; this point also serves to demonstrate the context specificity of responsiveness. The CDR-SB alone, which includes assessments of cognition and functionality, was also found to be more responsive to measured decline over two years in MCI and NC samples than several ADAS-Cog-11 modifications that re-weighted scores and/or added cognitive tests but did not include any assessment of functionality [35] ."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The ADAS-Cog-11 was developed to assess cognitive function in subjects with moderate to severe AD. Subsequent developments in dementia research have shifted attention toward pre-dementia syndromes, especially MCI. The ADAS-Cog-11 continues to be used in these studies in spite of ceiling effects, suboptimal scoring methodology, and limited content validity across domains affected in pre-dementia syndromes. The ADAS-Cog-11 has been improved through modifications, notably scoring methodol-ogy and added assessments of executive function, delayed recall, and/or daily functioning to detect early cognitive changes seen in the continuum from MCI to Dementia; these findings align with previous studies that shown these domains are relevant clinical features that begin deteriorating in advance of dementia. While modification approaches may improve within-study quality, important limitations need to be outlined. The large variety of modified versions limits between-study comparisons. Modified versions that are backwards compatible to the ADAS-Cog-11 allow comparison of results to the original ADAS-Cog-11 scale, but it is not clear how to deal with incompatible findings between the original and modified versions. Modified versions may also lack standardized administration procedures laid out for the ADAS-Cog-11, which may add to total measurement error. Although this review demonstrates that the ADAS-Cog-11 is not optimally responsive in pre-dementia populations, abandoning it may lead to a proliferation of outcome measures particularly in the absence of a consensus-based new standard. Results from decades of research do however suggest that there is little more to be gained from exploring additional modifications of the ADAS-Cog-11."}, {"section_title": "Practical suggestions", "text": "When selecting an outcome measure for a given study, there is a trade-off between measurement performance and the length or challenge of administering the measure. Furthermore, the performance of an outcome measure depends on the stage of natural history of a study sample, the desired form of responsiveness, and the study purpose. For these reasons and because not all ADAS-Cog-11 modifications have been compared with each other, it is difficult to recommend a single 'best' ADAS-Cog-11 modification based on our review. In general, removing tasks from the ADAS-Cog-11 that demonstrate ceiling effects in pre-dementia populations is expected to improve performance for pre-dementia syndromes and be simpler to administer, but probably with poorer measurement properties for dementia syndromes. Therefore, for studies across the spectrum of cognitive abilities, the appropriate outcome measure may be one that assesses cognitive domains that deteriorate later in the natural history (e.g., language), without including too many tasks that will lower responsiveness in pre-dementia studies due to ceiling effects. In addition, since the ability to perform activities of daily living relies upon intact executive function along with other cognitive abilities, and is now considered an important component of disease severity, it is expected that including assessments of these cognitive domains and functionality would improve responsiveness in pre-dementia syndromes while also capturing important deficits at later stages of the natural history. By expanding the ADAS-Cog-11 with cognitive and functional outcomes, better responsiveness should be possible."}, {"section_title": "Future directions", "text": "An area of growing interest is including motor function assessments, like gait speed, with cognitive outcome measures, because motor biomarkers have been associated with progression to dementia [102, 103] . Another emerging assessment method that appears responsive to changes in pre-dementia populations includes proactive semantic influence [104] [105] [106] . Future research should build on the findings of our review and consider the potential value of the aforementioned domains that have demonstrated responsiveness in pre-dementia populations but have not been included in a published modification of the ADAS-Cog-11, with the ultimate goal of creating a comprehensive outcome measure for studies of dementia or pre-dementia populations."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "The Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging is supported by a grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Research with funding from several partners.\nAuthors' disclosures available online (https:// www.j-alz.com/manuscript-disclosures/17-0991r1)."}, {"section_title": "SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL", "text": "The supplementary material is available in the electronic version of this article: http://dx.doi.org/ 10.3233/JAD-170991."}]
