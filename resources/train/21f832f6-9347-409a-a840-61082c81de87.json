[{"section_title": "Description", "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has brought much of the world to a virtual lockdown. As the virus continues to spread rapidly and the pandemic intensifies, the need for an effective vaccine is becoming increasingly apparent. A critical part of vaccine design is to identify targets, or epitopes, that can induce an effective immune response against SARS-CoV-2. This problem is challenged by our limited understanding of this novel coronavirus and of its interplay with the human immune system.\nIn response to this challenge, we have developed COVIDep (https://COVIDep.ust.hk), a first-of-its-kind webbased platform that pools genetic data for SARS-CoV-2 and immunological data for the 2003 SARS virus, SARS-CoV, to identify B cell and T cell epitopes to serve as vaccine target recommendations for SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 1 ). For T cell epitopes, it provides estimates of population coverage, globally and for specific regions. The COVIDep platform is updated periodically as data is deposited into public databases. This is important since SARS-CoV-2 sequences are being made available at an increasing rate through international data sharing efforts, and the identification of vaccine targets is influenced by newly observed genetic variation. COVIDep is flexible and user-friendly, comprising an intuitive graphical interface and interactive visualizations.\nThe vaccine targets recommended by COVIDep exploit the genetic similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, along with known immune targets for SARS-CoV that have been determined experimentally. The system implements a protocol that identifies from among the SARS epitopes that can induce a human immune response, those that are genetically similar in SARS-CoV-2. This idea, put forward in our preliminary study 1 based on limited early data, identified known SARS-CoV epitopes that had an identical genetic match in SARS-CoV-2. These epitopes presented initial vaccine target recommendations for potentially eliciting a protective, cross-reactive immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Similar ideas and results were reported subsequently in an independent study 2 .\nThe use of SARS-CoV immunological data to inform vaccine targets for SARS-CoV-2 is being supported by experimental results. There is evidence of SARS-CoV-derived antibodies binding to genetically similar regions of SARS-CoV-2's spike protein 3 , and also of cross-neutralization [4] [5] [6] . Conversely, studies have demonstrated that specific SARS-CoV-derived antibodies binding to the spike's receptor binding domain, which has significant genetic differences in SARS-CoV-2, have limited cross-reactivity 7 . Antibody and T cell responses against spike protein epitopes that are genetically similar in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have also been reported in COVID-19 infected patients [8] [9] [10] , and in preclinical vaccine trials 11, 12 . Epitopes recommended by COVIDep have notable overlap with the findings in these experimental studies (Figures 2  and 3 ).\nThe recommendations provided by COVIDep may be used to guide vaccine designs and associated experimental studies, and may help to expedite the discovery of an effective vaccine for COVID-19."}, {"section_title": "Data availability", "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequence data is periodically downloaded from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID; www.gisaid.org). The SARS-CoV epitope sequence data was downloaded from the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR; www.viprbrc.org). The population coverage statistics of HLA alleles were obtained from the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB; www.iedb.org)."}, {"section_title": "Code availability", "text": "The source code for the developed platform is available at the COVIDep GitHub repository (https://github.com/COVIDep)."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1.

B cell linear epitopes in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 identified by COVIDep (as of 21 May 2020)", "text": "and their overlap with emerging experimental results. The majority of the identified epitopes (24/29; shown in a shaded box) are located in the S2 functional subunit of the spike protein, reported to be a main region targeted by crossreactive 3 and cross-neutralizing 4 antibodies. The epitopes with IEDB IDs 70719 and 15972 overlap with regions in the S1 functional subunit of the spike protein reported to be targeted by cross-neutralizing antibodies 5,6 . The specific overlapping residues are underlined. The epitopes with IEDB IDs 9094, 12426, and 558417 overlap with an epitope (located at positions 1178-1189) reported to be targeted by neutralizing antibodies in a preclinical trial of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate 11 . Interestingly, the partial overlaps of the (consecutive) epitopes 9094 and 12426/558417 cover the experimentally-reported epitope 11 completely. Note that epitopes 12426 and 558417 share the same sequence; they have different IDs due to differences in the associated experimental procedures. The epitopes with IEDB IDs 52020 and 16183 overlap with the regions reported to be recognized by neutralizing antibodies in the sera of recovered COVID-19 patients 8 . 9, 10 . In a preclinical vaccine trial 12 , T cell responses have also been recorded against a protein region comprising the identified epitope with IEDB ID 71663. The specific overlapping residues are underlined, with double-underline reflecting that a response was observed in two studies. A more prominent underline is used to distinguish the epitope with IEDB ID 54725, since a response against this epitope was observed in ten COVID-19 patients (of fourteen studied) 10 . Therefore, this epitope appears to be particularly immunogenic. The epitopes with IEDB IDs 36724, 69657, 71663, 2801, 54680, and 16156 were originally reported based on positive T cell assays for SARS-CoV, while those with IEDB IDs 54507, 54725, and 37289 were reported based on positive MHC binding assays."}]
