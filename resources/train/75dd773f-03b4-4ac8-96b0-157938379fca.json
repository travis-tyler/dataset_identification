At issue is whether amyloid-PET alone may be predictive of dementia in DS.\nIn DS, [ 11 C] PiB binding in individuals with DS appears first in the striatum around 40 years of age and is strongly associated with dementia and cognitive decline [19, 20] . [ 18 F]-Florbetapir binding in DS reflects fibrillar A\u03b2, the protein associated with many amyloidoses including AD [21] . Brain amyloid binding as measured by [ 18 F]-Florbetapir (Amyvid) PET increases with age in both demented and nondemented participants with DS [22] . The two best predictors of PiB binding in DS are age and a clinical diagnosis of AD [23] . Since A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain of individuals across the lifespan in DS, it may be possible to ascertain a signal in A\u03b2 binding patterns or spatial distribution that predicts a conversion to dementia. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the relationship between baseline [ 18 F]-Florbetapir uptake patterns and subsequent transition to dementia in DS. We hypothesized greater amyloid burden in individuals with DS who transition to AD compared to those who do not transition to AD (dementia)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participant Characteristics", "text": "Nineteen non-demented adult participants with DS were clinically evaluated at baseline, 9, 18, 27, and 48 months.

To evaluate this question, we modeled the logit of the probability of transition as a linear function of average amyloid burden for each ROI.\nThe top most accurate results in terms of area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity (Sense) in predicting true positives, specificity (Spec) in predicting true negatives, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) in predicting transition status are shown in Table 3 . Positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) are the proportions of true positive and true negative predictions from each classifier, relative to the total number of positive and negative predictions respectively. The results are averaged across test cases from all ten folds of cross-validation. To compute results from the trained LR classifiers, the classifiers are evaluated on the test cases from their respective fold using a cutoff probability greater than 0.5 to label a case as transitioned. To compute AUC, the cutoff probability is varied from 0 to 1 and the area under the resulting ROC curve is computed. None of the regions identified differed significantly in anatomical volume between the transitioned and non-transitioned groups, suggesting that these results are unlikely to be confounded by group differences in anatomical structure sizes. The AUC and PPV results suggest that ROI average PET SUVR measurements in regions related to dementia progression may be good predictors of future transition to dementia. For comparison, using the whole-brain average SUVR counts, instead of regionally-specific SUVR averages, resulted in poor classification performance (AUC 0.64\u00b10.20).

Transition status was determined by two independent neurologists, blinded to both the baseline PET and neuropsychological assessments. The transitioned cases thus presented a unique opportunity for comparison with those that did not.\nA primary goal of the study was to compare the regional distribution of amyloid aggregation on baseline PET images between individuals with DS who did and did not transition to dementia.\nThese analyses described a retrospective case-control study in which mean differences in amyloid burden were quantified across brain regions of interest and related to the clinical diagnosis of dementia. A measure of global amyloid binding was not sensitive to differences between transitioned and non-transitioned participants, as opposed to regional differences which were sensitive and reported in terms of the Cohen's effect-size d-statistic. Further, exploiting an advantage of logistic regression with retrospective study designs [52] , these analyses described the predictive potential for classifying cases based on regional amyloid distribution in baseline scans.\nOur results suggest that regional amyloid load is informative in evaluating the risk for dementia in DS and, pending replication, is likely a useful quantitative measure to include in a composite risk score.\nA second goal of the study was to assess overall decline in support of the clinical evaluations by independent neurologists. Cognitive evaluations were made for all participants at baseline and followed-up prospectively at 9, 18, 27, 36, and 48 months. The rate of change of standard neuropsychological scores was determined from baseline to the month of last follow-up. The results showed that transition status independently tracked trends in RADD, SIB, FULD, and DMR SCS and SOS. Overall, transitioned participants declined faster than non-transitioned participants.\nThese results quantified the rapidity of decline to be expected prospectively of transitioned cases on standard neuropsychological assessments.\nThe diagnosis of dementia in DS must take into account the variability in baseline intellectual functioning intrinsically associated with trisomy 21. Over time, the clinician's diagnosis of dementia in DS has been found to be more accurate than the formal criteria put forth in ICD 10\nand DSM IV-TR classifications [24, 53] . In this report, clinical evaluation by examiners, blinded to the neuropsychological and imaging data, contributed most to the consensus diagnosis of transition status. The data from the neuropsychological battery supported the clinicians' observations of transition status. In prior studies, the neuropsychological battery used was found to be correlated with clinical dementia status [54, 55] . In this study, the slope of the neuropsychological measures correlated with clinical transition status.\nTaken together, these results further suggest a role for regional amyloid and neuropsychological assessment-together with tau, and other biomarkers-in developing a risk score for predicting the progression to dementia in Down syndrome. The neuropsychological data are consistent with observations from independent clinical judgement. Clinical judgement plays an important role in the diagnosis of dementia in DS as reinforced by the clinical vignettes on each of the transitioned cases (supplement S2). The rate of \u03b2-amyloid accumulation in brains from individuals with DS has been found to differ according to the pre-existing amyloid burden [21, 22, 58] . Age-related brain atrophy is associated with the rate of PiB-binding and the level of cognitive impairment in DS [59] .\nYet amyloid binding after a certain level of retention may not increase with aging in DS [20] . The presence of cortical PiB-binding as a function of age has also been confirmed in post-mortem studies [20, 60] . In a study examining global PiB binding as a continuous variable, many adults with DS appeared to tolerate amyloid-\u03b2-deposition without deleterious effect on cognitive functioning [53] . While global PiB binding may not predict transition to dementia, our study suggests that there are regional differences in amyloid that may predict cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This study suggests that [ 18 F]-Florbetapir PET scans may be predictive of future clinical transition to dementia in individuals with DS.
