[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The world's rivers deliver 19 billion tonnes of sediment to the coastal zone annually 1 , with a considerable fraction being sequestered in large deltas, home to over 500 million people. Most (more than 70 per cent) large deltas are under threat from a combination of rising sea levels, ground surface subsidence and anthropogenic sediment trapping 2,3 , and a sustainable supply of fluvial sediment is therefore critical to prevent deltas being 'drowned' by rising relative sea levels 2-4 . Here we combine suspended sediment load data from the Mekong River with hydrological model simulations to isolate the role of tropical cyclones in transmitting suspended sediment to one of the world's great deltas. We demonstrate that spatial variations in the Mekong's suspended sediment load are correlated (r = 0.765, P < 0.1) with observed variations in tropicalcyclone climatology, and that a substantial portion (32 per cent) of the suspended sediment load reaching the delta is delivered by runoff generated by rainfall associated with tropical cyclones. Furthermore, we estimate that the suspended load to the delta has declined by 52.6 \u00b1 10.2 megatonnes over recent years , of which 33.0 \u00b1 7.1 megatonnes is due to a shift in tropical-cyclone climatology. Consequently, tropical cyclones have a key role in controlling the magnitude of, and variability in, transmission of suspended sediment to the coast. It is likely that anthropogenic sediment trapping in upstream reservoirs is a dominant factor in explaining past [5][6][7] , and anticipating future 8,9 , declines in suspended sediment loads reaching the world's major deltas. However, our study shows that changes in tropical-cyclone climatology affect trends in fluvial suspended sediment loads and thus are also key to fully assessing the risk posed to vulnerable coastal systems.\nThe world's largest rivers contribute a disproportionately large fraction (Extended Data Table 1 ) of the terrestrial sediment flux, which has both created, and is critical in sustaining, their great deltas. Moreover, river-borne sediments are a key vector for carbon and nutrients, thereby playing a vital part in global biogeochemical cycles 10,11 . However, a majority (> 70%) of large deltas are now recognized as being under severe threat from rising relative sea levels 2,3 , in part owing to reported anthropogenically driven reductions in sediment loads [5][6][7] . Many large rivers are located in tropical regions (Extended Data Fig. 1 ) that exhibit highly seasonal flow regimes affected by tropical cyclones (TCs). The potential destructive or constructive impacts of TCs that directly strike deltas are well established 12,13 . However, when they strike further upstream, TCs deliver much higher than normal levels of rainfall, effectively triggering landslides and mobilizing sediments into the river network, thereby generating very high instantaneous sediment loads [14][15][16] . Such high-sediment loads could compensate for the potential destructive effects of TCs striking deltas proper, but, notwithstanding some previous studies in smaller drainage basins 17,18 , the role of TCs in driving sediment delivery to the lowlands and coast remains unclear. As noted, this is particularly the case for large rivers that carry much of the terrestrial sediment flux because these rivers are, in their mid to lower reaches, typically bound by massive floodplains that can sequester considerable volumes of suspended sediment into storage during floods 19 . Here we address this uncertainty by quantifying the role of TCs in driving suspended sediment loads through an exemplar mega-river, the Mekong.\nDraining the Tibetan Plateau and the Annamite Mountains bordering Laos and Vietnam (Fig. 1) , and with the monsoonal climate generating intense rainfall, the Mekong basin (795,000 km , but see later)\n21 that rank tenth and ninth, respectively, among the world's great rivers 1 . The Mekong is therefore similar to other major rivers (for example, Ganges-Brahmaputra, Yangtze and Mississippi) that transmit globally important sediment loads and that are influenced in their mid to lower courses by TCs. Similar to these other rivers, the sediments of the Mekong River have resulted in the formation of a large delta, with much contemporary debate on the extent to which declining sediment loads may in the future increase the vulnerability of the Mekong Delta to rising sea levels 8,9,22 . To quantify the influence of TCs on the suspended sediment transport regime, we determined temporal (25 years) and spatial (1,400 km study reach) variations in suspended solids loads throughout the Lower Mekong River (see Methods). Specifically, we first used a distributed hydrological model, forced with two climate scenarios, one with and the other without observed TCs, to simulate water discharges at five river gauging stations (see Methods for model details and Fig. 1 for gauging station locations): Luang Prabang in Laos, Mukdahan in Thailand, Pakse in Laos, and Stung Treng and Kratie, both in Cambodia. Importantly, these five river gauging stations are situated on an environmental gradient that spans regions that are weakly (Luang Prabang) to moderately (Mukdahan and Pakse) to strongly (Stung Treng and Kratie) affected by TCs (Fig. 1b, c) . We then analysed archival measurements of suspended solids concentration, collected by the respective national hydrological agencies, to construct new suspended sediment rating curves-statistical functions linking the rate of suspended sediment transport to water discharge-for the five stations (see Methods and Extended Data Fig. 2 ). These rating curves were then used with the model-simulated water discharges to compute suspended solids loads and to apportion these loads into TC-driven components (Q s_TC ) using:\nwhere Q s is the total suspended solids load as computed using the sediment rating curves with the total simulated flow discharge, Q sim (that is, the flow discharge for the baseline scenario with the observed climatology including TCs), and Q sim_TC is the simulated flow discharge attributable to TCs. The quantity Q sim_TC in equation (1) is determined by differencing the flow discharges computed in the two scenarios with (Q sim ) and without (Q no_TC ) TCs, such that Q sim_TC = Q sim \u2212 Q no_TC . \u00a9 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Notable peaks and troughs in the total simulated flow discharge (Q sim ) and the flow discharge attributable to TCs (Q sim_TC ) are evident. These variable flows force marked fluctuations in simulated instantaneous suspended sediment loads, but notably there are multiple TC-forced suspended sediment transport events in most years (as indicated by the peaks in Fig. 2b) . Integrating over the 25-year study period then yields estimates of mean annual suspended sediment load (Extended Data Table 2 ). Our estimate for Kratie (87.4 \u00b1 28.7 Mt yr ) of recent estimates 23,24 , although it is substantially less than the ~ 150-170 Mt yr \u22121 cited by older studies 1,20,25 based on less reliable data sets. Importantly, our results illustrate the extent to which the modest (at annual timescales) rainfall totals associated with TCs nevertheless effectively generate runoff and suspended sediment transport. During 1981During -2005, TCs delivered only between 1.8% (above Luang Prabang) and 4.7% (above Kratie) of annual rainfall, but generated between 13.7% (Luang Prabang) and 28.8% (Kratie) of annual runoff. The proportion of the mean annual suspended sediment load forced by TC-associated runoff is greater still, varying between 15.2% (Luang Prabang) and 31.7% (Kratie) (Extended Data Table 2 ). There are two reasons for this amplification effect. First, TC-derived rainfall is strongly seasonal, falling largely during, or just after, the monsoon months, when catchments are pre-wetted; consequently TC-associated rainfall is very effective in generating runoff 26 . Second, the sediment rating functions linking suspended sediment flux and water discharge possess exponents with values exceeding unity (Extended Data Fig. 2) , meaning that the peak flows generated by TCs promote very high instantaneous suspended sediment fluxes. Therefore, suspended sediment transport associated with TCs contributes substantially to mean annual loads, with the former correlating well (r = 0.765, P = 0.099) with the time-averaged TC climatology as represented by the 1981-2005 accumulated cyclone energy (ACE; Extended Data Table 2 ).\nTemporal trends in annual suspended sediment load (Q s ), and the component of that load associated with TCs (Q s_TC ), during 1981-2005 are shown for Kratie in Fig. 3 (results for all the other stations are shown in Extended Data Fig. 4) . Nonparametric MannKendall tests (see Methods) reveal that there have been declines in both Q s and Q s_TC at three (Mukdahan, Stung Treng and Kratie) of the four stations that are either moderately or strongly influenced by TCs (the exception is Pakse, as discussed later). As expected, the station that is only weakly affected by TCs (Luang Prabang, Extended Data Fig. 4a ) does not exhibit any significant trends in Q s or Q s_TC that are not artefacts of the response of this station to upstream damming. Importantly, recent historical declines in Q s at Mukdahan, Stung Treng and Kratie (Extended Data Fig. 4 and Fig. 3 ) are driven to a large extent by declines in the suspended sediment load attributable to TCs (Q s_TC ). Specifically, at Mukdahan, 62% of the 21.4 Mt decline in Q s between 1981 and 2005 is attributable to reducing Q s_TC (Extended Data  Fig. 4b ). At the Cambodian stations, 44% (Stung Treng; Extended Data Fig. 4d ) and 61% (Kratie; Fig. 3 ) of the declines in Q s are attributable to reducing Q s_TC . Thus, the response of Q s over time is intimately tied to the extent to which upstream catchments receive TC-derived rainfall (Extended Data Fig. 5) .\nAs noted earlier, Pakse is exceptional in that it is moderately influenced by TCs (4.1% of annual rainfall is associated with TCs), but TC-driven runoff (8.4%) and suspended sediment loads (9.3%) are both anomalously low compared to Mukdahan, Stung Treng and Kratie (Extended Data Table 2 ). However, TC-associated rainfall is less hydrologically effective at Pakse because flows there are also strongly influenced by inflows from a major west bank tributary system, the Mun/ Chi, that joins immediately upstream of the gauge and which drains a region that is only mildly influenced by TCs (Fig. 1) . Additionally, the exponent in the suspended sediment rating curve at Pakse is much less than those at Stung Treng and Kratie (Extended Data Fig. 2) , meaning the higher flows associated with TCs generate comparatively lower instantaneous suspended sediment transport rates.\nOur results demonstrate that TCs are effective in transmitting suspended sediment load through the lowlands of large rivers, a finding that has profound implications. A substantial portion (~ 40%-50%) (ref. 27) of the suspended sediment load of the Mekong River is deposited in its delta, home to 20 million people and the rice basket of Southeast Asia 22,28 . Major concerns have been raised regarding the scale of recent and projected future reductions in the sediment load reaching the delta, as a result of sand mining 22,29 and upstream damming 8,9,22,23 . However, our study reveals that during the period 1981-2005, the Mekong at Kratie is estimated to have experienced a cumulative loss of 33.0 \u00b1 7.1 Mt of its suspended sediment load (Fig. 3) as a result of changes in precipitation delivered by TCs crossing the Mekong basin (Extended Data Fig. 5) .\nLimitations in the observational data make it challenging to contextualize fully the 1981-2005 trends in TC climatology that are the focus of this paper within the longer-term historical record (Extended Data Fig. 6 ). Nevertheless, our key finding, namely that changes in TC climatology represent an important, but previously neglected, driver of suspended sediment transmission through the Mekong River, remains robust. Furthermore, high-resolution climate models indicate that although the number and intensity of TCs tracking across the South China Sea will probably increase under future anthropogenic climate change, their track locations will shift eastwards and away from the Indochina peninsula, leading to net reductions in ACE over the Mekong basin 30 . If these projected reductions in ACE are correct, TC-driven suspended sediment delivery to the Mekong Delta will decline still further, exacerbating projected declines in sediment loads due to damming 8,9 and sand mining 29 and placing the delta at even greater risk. Although our data focus on the suspended sediment load, the delivery of bedload sediment, which is important in the construction, or restoration, of deltas 31 , would also be lessened by a reduction in TC-associated sedimentation. Furthermore, other large rivers that transport a considerable proportion of the global sediment flux are also affected by TCs (Extended Data Table 1 ). Our study indicates that their deltas may also be much more affected by, and vulnerable to, changes in TC climatology than assumed in current assessments (which tend to focus on the direct effects of cyclone strikes within deltas, rather than the upstream impacts that we have focused on) of the impacts of future environmental change.\nOnline Content Methods, along with any additional Extended Data display items and Source Data, are available in the online version of the paper; references unique to these sections appear only in the online paper.

VMod simulations were forced using daily rainfall and temperature data estimated from a network of 151 meteorological stations (Fig. 1a) . Specifically, the precipitation data employed here are from the Mekong River Commission (MRC) hydrometeorological database 38 , supplemented with Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) data 39 for the Chinese part of the basin. These data have been carefully quality controlled 33 , and the MRC data therefore represent the highestquality available data, with the best density of precipitation stations.\n, respectively. Estimates of daily rainfall totals and temperatures within each VMod grid cell were obtained by interpolating from the three nearest observations using inverse distance squared weighting. For daily rainfall totals, a multiplicative elevation correction (with coefficient 0.0002 mm m \u22121 ) was employed to account for differences of elevation between each observation point and the location of the grid cell, whereas the temperature data were corrected for elevation using a lapse rate of \u2212 0.006 K m \u22121\n. VMod simulates snowmelt using a degree-day model, in which the amount of snowmelt is obtained from daily average temperature exceeding a given threshold multiplied by a snowmelt coefficient K melt . The model also computes snow evaporation, snowpack water storage, and refreezing. The snowmelt parameters employed here were calibrated in a previous study 33 using flow measurements at the Chiang Saeng gauging station. Glacier melt is computed similarly to snowmelt, albeit using a different set of parameters and the assumption of infinite storage.\nIn VMod the flow discharge is routed along a river network that is generated using DEM and map data. Each model grid cell has a river, either starting at that grid cell or flowing through it, to which the runoff from the cell is added. Flow within the river network is computed using a one-dimensional river model with a kinematic wave approximation. In this way simulated runoff at any point in the network reflects both the local and upstream contributions of precipitation, with the precipitation being deconstructed into cyclone and non-cyclone components as described later. In this approach the flow discharge (and hence sediment transport) that is attributable to cyclone and non-cyclone rainfall components at a given location in the river network is not explicitly parsed out as being attributable to a specific rainfall event. Instead, the simulated runoff components reflect the integrated effects of series of rainfall events that are delivered over longer time periods. Note that in the flow routing process, river cross-sections are represented using two superimposed trapezoids, with the lower one representing the main channel and the upper the floodplain, allowing for a representation of the effects of overbank storage on downstream attenuation of the flood wave. (1) the mean discrepancy ratio for daily flows (Me), which is the average of all the ratios (computed at each daily time step) of simulated to observed daily water flows, with Me = 1 indicating perfect agreement between simulated and observed data; (2) the mean discrepancy ratio for annual peak flows (Me p ); (3) the root mean square error (r.m.s.e.); and (4) the Nash-Sutcliffe Index (NSI) 40 . On the basis of these metrics (Extended Data  Fig. 3) , VMod, on average, under-predicts daily water flows throughout the study reach, while under-predicting the annual flood maxima in the lower parts (Stung Treng and Kratie) and over-predicting annual flood maxima in the upper parts (Luang Prabang, Mukdahan and Pakse) of the reach (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Rainfall scenarios and TC climatology. The hydrological model as described earlier was run with two rainfall scenarios. The first 'baseline' scenario replicated actual conditions in the 1981-2005 study period and employed observed rainfall totals. In the second scenario, these baseline totals were revised downwards by removing the rainfall estimated to have been delivered by tropical cyclones. The simulated runoff associated with tropical cyclones (Q sim_TC ) was then computed by differencing the daily flows simulated under the two scenarios.\nTo estimate rainfall totals associated with TCs, we first employed the IBTrACS (version v03r02) storm tracks database 42 to locate the paths, at daily time steps, of all recorded TCs intersecting or passing near the Mekong Basin during 1981-2005. Rainfall anomalies associated with these storm paths were then defined by first interpolating, using the nearest neighbour, daily rainfall values observed at the network of 151 stations used in the baseline rainfall scenario onto a 0.1\u00b0 (~ 11 km 2 ) resolution grid. Next, all rainfall stations located within a 500 km Haversine search radius 43, 44 from the centroid of the storm on that date were identified. These identified stations were then temporarily (for the specific time step) removed from the analysis and an updated rainfall surface (minus the identified stations) was re-interpolated onto the same 0.1\u00b0 grid. A rainfall anomaly surface, representing estimated rainfall associated with the identified storm and time step, was obtained by differencing the original and updated surfaces. This process was repeated for each daily time step, allowing the observed rainfall series at each meteorological station to be adjusted by subtracting rainfall anomalies within the grid square specific to each gauge from the observed daily rainfall totals. Note that since the hydrometeorological database we used in this analysis does not discriminate between precipitation associated or not associated with TCs, it is not possible to validate our estimates of cyclone-derived precipitation. For this reason, our estimates of rainfall associated with TCs are deliberately based on a method (nearest neighbour interpolation) that is more conservative than previous studies 44 , which simply assume that all rainfall within the assigned search radius is related to tropical cyclones. By the same token, while acknowledging that there is uncertainty regarding the typical radii of tropical cyclones, our decision to employ a 500 km search radius is again conservative in that it is at the lower end of the range of values typically used in previous studies 45 . The IBTrACS data on which the above analyses are founded comprise six hourly best-track positions and intensity estimates. Only storms designated as in a tropical phase with one-minute maximum sustained surface wind speeds exceeding 34 knots (17.5 m s \u22121 ) are included in our analysis. The IBTrACS data were also used to compute the accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) metric 46 that we employ to characterize the TC climatology over the Mekong River basin for the period 1981-2005. The ACE parameter is analogous to the power dissipation index (PDI) 47 in that it convolves intensity and duration information for each individual TC observed in a defined area (here the sub-basins for the five gauging stations that are the focus of this study), offering considerable advantages over definitions based on the more familiar categorizations on the basis of wind speed 48 . In this context, our estimates of ACE are obtained by squaring the 6-hourly intensity estimates reported in the best-track database and integrating over the 1981-2005 study period. Sediment rating curves. Sediment rating curves of the form:\nwere constructed for each hydrological station on the Mekong River mainstem below the China-Laos border and upstream of the Mekong Delta by fitting observed suspended solids concentration (SSC; C) and observed water discharge (Q) data (Extended Data Table 3 ) using nonlinear estimation techniques constructed using the Curve Fitting Toolbox in Matlab version R2014a. Specifically, a nonlinear least-squares power-law solver with one term was applied to the raw data, using the Trust-Region algorithm. The use of the power-law solver follows previous work [49] [50] [51] in optimizing the fit at the higher values of discharge and concentration that dominate overall transport. This procedure results in a poor fit for low discharges at Pakse (Extended Data Fig. 2 ) but using an alternative solver, designed to improve the low fit, is not justified. This is because doing so makes only a very minor (< 2%) difference in the mean annual sediment load at Pakse while introducing substantial errors into the more important high-flow fits at the other stations. Note that our focus on suspended, rather than total, sediment load is not problematic since bed load is less than 20% of the total load (on the basis of comparisons of rivers from the data compilation of Turowski et al. 52 with suspended sediment concentrations similar to those of the Mekong River).\nIn terms of the data sources feeding into the sediment rating curves (Extended Data Table 3) , at Luang Prabang, Mukdahan and Pakse the SSC and water discharge data were obtained from hydrological records archived by the MRC (available to download from http://portal.mrcmekong.org/index). However, the MRC SSC measurements are available only sporadically and have been acquired using a range of methodologies (reflecting the different approaches taken by differing hydrological agencies in this trans-national river) at the different gauging stations (Extended Data Table 3 ). All of the MRC's SSC measurements letter reSeArCH at Mukdahan were collected using United States Geological Survey (USGS)-designed isokinetic depth-integrated samplers (USGS D49 samplers) deployed at three verticals over the cross-section. The three samples are composited to provide a single sample from which the SSC is determined 50 . For the stations in Laos (that is, Luang Prabang and Pakse), the MRC SSC data were initially (1961) collected for a brief period using the same procedures as at Mukdahan, but subsequently the depth-integrated samplers were replaced with USGS P61 point-integrating samplers. To avoid potential problems with mixed sampling protocols in the data sets, and because depth-integrated sampling relies heavily on the even ascent of the sampler through the water column, to avoid biasing the SSC we excluded the relatively few data obtained using depth-integrated samplers from further consideration. The point-integrated samplers were deployed at three verticals over the cross-section, at heights of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 of the flow depth in the case of the point-sample (producing nine individual samples, from which the mean SSC for the cross-section is obtained by simple averaging). However, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 7 , because the concentration of suspended sediment varies, both through the water column and laterally over the cross-section, simple averaging of point-based samples systematically biases the resulting estimate of the cross-section averaged SSC (relative to that obtained from alternative quasi-synoptic sampling techniques). We corrected for this effect by reducing the SSC values recorded within the MRC database by 26% for all the Laos and Thai stations (Extended Data Fig. 7) . We derived this correction factor by comparing the averaged cross-section SSC computed from acoustic Doppler current profiler (aDcp) surveys in Cambodia, these aDcp surveys being undertaken as part of an aDcp field calibration exercise designed to retrieve SSC data from aDcp records archived by the Cambodian hydrological agency.\nFor the stations at Stung Treng and Kratie, sediment rating curves were constructed using flow discharge and SSC data (Extended Data Table 3 ) retrieved from the archives of the Cambodian Department of Hydrology and Water Resources (DHRW). These DHRW data were acquired via deployments of a four-beam 600 kHz aDcp (RD Instruments) during routine surveys undertaken in the period 2009 to 2014 by DHRW personnel. These aDcp surveys do not directly record suspended solids concentrations, but rather the archived DHRW data files contain acoustic backscatter (ABS) information recorded during the original surveys. We retrieved SSCs from these ABS data by means of a calibration function (Extended Data Fig. 7 ) that we derived on the basis of 54-point measurements of SSC deployed contemporaneously with the DHRW aDcp to record coeval ABS values in the same parcel of water following past guidelines [53] [54] [55] . In this field calibration procedure, the SSC data were obtained by filtering (Whatman GF/C glass microfibre grade 47 mm diameter 1.2 \u03bc m filter paper) and weighing the mass of solids retained from water samples collected at a wide range of flow depths and channel locations using a 3 l Van Dorn sampler 56 during fieldwork that was spread over a wide range of flow conditions during 2013 and 2014. Consequently, the calibration function encompasses a wide range of SSC and ABS data. Analysis of ABS values and the suspended sediment grain size collected from the point samples reveals there is no relationship between the two, probably owing to the narrow range of grain sizes within the LMR 57 . Since the aDcp data provide a quasi-synoptic (less a blanking zone of 0.5 m at the top of the water column and a side-lobe interference zone of 10% of the flow depth at the bottom of the water column) image of ABS over the channel cross-section, the calibration function can be used to transform the ABS data to an accurate estimate of section-averaged SSC (Extended Data Fig. 7) , as also noted earlier.\nHaving derived the rating curves for each gauging station (Extended Data Fig. 2 ), we then explicitly investigated whether the rating curves exhibit hysteresis effects associated with sediment exhaustion, which might be expected to lead to lower SSC values for a given discharge on the falling versus rising stages of the annual flood wave. However, no such evidence of hysteresis was identified (see Extended Data Fig. 2 ), presumably as a result of fluctuations in SSC being subdued owing to the large catchment areas and consequent effects of channel and floodplain storage in attenuating the peaks 25 . We also considered whether there is a shift in sediment transport during flows affected by TCs, for example as a result of increased sediment supply from catchment erosion during storms. Specifically, we evaluated whether there are differences in sediment rating curves for flows that are (using the VMod model outputs to identify TC-affected flows and then cross-matching to identify SSC measurements that are TC affected) or are not affected by TCs. As indicated in Extended Data Table 3 , this enabled us to identify 34 SSC samples during TC affected flows at Luang Prabang (14% of all observations at that station), while 30 samples were identified during TC affected flows at Mukdahan (3% of observations). We found that there were no significant (analysis of variance (ANOVA), P > 0.05) differences between sediment ratings developed using the TC-affected versus the non-TC affected SSC data at either station. This indicates that we can with confidence apply single rating curves for these stations, for both TC-affected and TC-unaffected flows. Since we are only able to discriminate TC-affected flows from VMod outputs during the 1981-2005 study period, and because there are no SSC data from this period at Stung Treng and Kratie, and there are too few SSC data at Pakse to identify any TC-affected measurements, there are no data to complete a similar formal analysis at these other three stations (Extended Data Table 3 ). Nevertheless, the very tight fit of these three stations' ratings (Extended Data  Fig. 2) , alongside the point that these stations are TC-affected during the period of SSC data collection, indicates that any shift in sediment transport processes during TCs is unlikely to have any material effects on the estimation of suspended solids loads at these locations.\nBearing in mind the relatively long periods over which the SSC data used to construct the sediment ratings at Luang Prabang, Mukdahan and Pakse were collected (Extended Data Table 3 ), we also tested for the possibility that varying ENSO phase, a known cause of hydroclimatological variability in the Mekong River, may lead to non-stationarity in the SSC values at these stations 58, 59 , using dummy-variable regression analysis. Letting Z = 1 if ENSO phase is positive (that is, El Ni\u00f1o) and 0 otherwise, then for the slope of the regression: Then, for the intercept of the regression: We found no significant difference at the 0.05 significance level (ANOVA on dummyvariable regression coefficients for each site) in the SSCs, for a given Q, as a function of ENSO phase, demonstrating that there is therefore no evident bias in the SSCs introduced as a function of climate variability associated with ENSO. With the completion of the first major main-stem cascade of dams on the Chinese portion of the Mekong River in 1993, we also considered whether the SSC data differ pre-and post-1993. Accordingly, a similar analysis (equations (3) to (8)) was conducted for those sites (Luang Prabang and Mukdahan) at which SSC samples span the pre-and post-dam periods. We found that at Mukdahan no significant difference exists at the 0.05 significance level (ANOVA on dummy-variable regression coefficients), implying that there is no reason to split the data based on the pre-and post-dam periods. However, a significant difference (P < 0.05) between the pre-and post-dam periods does exist at Luang Prabang (ANOVA test statistic = 9.7377, n = 236, degrees of freedom (df) = 1,232). Consequently, at Luang Prabang, we calculate suspended solids loads (see later) using the pre-and post-dam rating curves (Extended Data Fig. 2 ) for the periods 1981-1992 and 1993-2005, respectively. Finally, we emphasize that our analysis does not account for anthropogenic factors, such as flow regulation through reservoirs, land-use or land cover change, or increasing sediment mining, which could potentially introduce a trend into the relationships between flow discharge and SSC at each gauging station. Our suspended sediment rating curves therefore assume stationarity of these factors over the 1981-2005 study period. Sediment load estimation. The lack of hysteresis and apparent stationarity of the SSC data means that we were able to employ a single (two at Luang Prabang, one for the pre-and one for the post-dam periods) sediment rating curve specific to each station (Extended Data Fig. 2) , together with the continuous water discharge records obtained from our hydrological modelling, to estimate daily suspended solids loads (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 3) for the 1981-2005 study period. These daily loads were in turn used to compute, by summation, the annual sediment loads for each station (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 4 60 tests, used to evaluate whether there are significant (at 95% confidence) temporal trends (the magnitude of the trend being equated to Sen's slope, with uncertainty equated to the 95% confidence bounds on the Sen slope estimates) in the computed annual sediment loads, were computed in Matlab R2014a using the ktaub.m file written by J. Burkey (2006) , which is available from the Matlab Exchange (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11190-mannkendall-tau-b-with-sen-s-method-enhanced-/content/ktaub.m). Data. The precipitation and temperature data used in the hydrological model simulations are taken from the MRC hydrometeorological database 38 (not available online) supplemented with GSOD data 39 for the Chinese part of the basin (ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/gsod/; years 1981-2005). The IBTrACS (version v03r02) storm tracks database 42 that we used to estimate the track locations and hence precipitation anomalies associated with TCs was downloaded from the IBTrACS website (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/index.php?name= ibtracs-data; IBTrACS-All data v03r02 all storms line shapefile). Note that we are not able to make the input data files used in the hydrological model simulations available as the precipitation and temperature data are from the MRC (as described earlier) under a licence that precludes redistribution of products or derived products. Water discharge data used in the validation of the hydrological model are from the hydrological records archived in the MRC data portal (http://portal. mrcmekong.org/index as discharge records from Luang Prabang (station identifier 011201; unique data set accession 21301), Mukdahan (station identifier 013402; unique data set accession 3301), Pakse (station identifier 013901; unique data set accession 3141), Stung Treng (station identifier 014501; unique data set accession 2809), and Kratie (station identifier 014901; unique data set accession 2811)), as are the suspended sediment concentration data (available from http://portal.mrcme kong.org/index as sediment concentration records from: station identifier 011201, unique data set accession 4746; station identifier 013402, unique data set accession 4849; and station identifier 013901, unique data set accession 4773, respectively) used to derive the sediment rating curves at Luang Prabang, Mukdahan and Pakse.

The latter are defined herein as runoff events for which at least 25% of the runoff was associated with TC-induced runoff. Consequently, it is only possible to identify TC-affected SSC measurements in the 1981-2005 model simulation period. Note that no TC-induced runoff events were associated with the 60 SSC measurements made at Pakse during 1998-2002 and that the available data from Stung Treng and Kratie post-date the 1981-2005 study period."}]
