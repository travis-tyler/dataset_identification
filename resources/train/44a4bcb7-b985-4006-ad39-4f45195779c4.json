Across data sets most participants were white, and for many participants, racial/ethnic information was either not collected or not known. Men (OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 2.79-3.42) and women (OR, 3.31; CI,) with the APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 genotype from ages 55 to 85 years did not show a difference in AD risk; however, women had an increased risk compared with men between the ages of 65 and 75 years (women, OR, 4.37; 95% CI, 3.82-5.00; men, OR, 3.14; 95% CI, 2.68-3.67; P=.002). Men with APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 had an increased risk of AD compared with men with APOE \u03b53/\u03b53. The APOE \u03b52/\u03b53 genotype conferred a protective effect on women (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.43-0.61) decreasing their risk of AD more (P value = .01) than men (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60-0.85). There was no difference between men with APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.36-1.76) and women (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.43-1.81) in their risk of developing MCI between the ages of 55 and 85 years, but women had an increased risk between 55 and 70 years (women, OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.19-1.73; men, OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.87-1.30; P=.05). There were no significant differences between men and women in their risks for converting from MCI to AD between the ages of 55 and 85 years. Individuals with APOE \u03b54/\u03b54 showed increased risks vs individuals with \u03b53/\u03b54, but no significant differences between men and women with \u03b54/\u03b54 were seen.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Contrary to long-standing views, men and women with the APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 genotype have nearly the same odds of developing AD from age 55 to 85 years, but women have an increased risk at younger ages."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "F or nearly 20 years, the prevalent view has been that women who carry copies of the \u03b54 allele of the apolipoprotein E(APOE) gene have a greater risk of developing Alzheimer disease (AD) than men with the same number of copies. 1 The \u03b54 allele is the main genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD), 2 and sex-based differences in AD risk have important implications for treatment trials, diagnostics, and therapeutics. 3 Additionally, the sex-dependent relationship between APOE and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is often a transitional phase from cognitively normal (NL) aging to dementia, 4 is unclear. Studies are in general agreement that the APOE \u03b54 allele is a risk factor for developing MCI, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] but there is controversy as to whether it increases 10,12-14 or does not increase 9, 11, 15, 16 the risks of transitioning from MCI to AD or dementia. The 3 most common alleles of the APOE gene are \u03b52, \u03b53, and \u03b54; whereas carrying the \u03b54 allele increases one's risk of developing AD, the \u03b52 allele conversely has a putative protective effect that is associated with longevity and a lower AD risk."}, {"section_title": "17", "text": "Studies of participants with a family history of late-onset AD have reported that women with 1 copy of \u03b54 have a greater risk than male heterozygote \u03b54 carriers, who in turn have about the same risk as male \u03b53 homozygotes. 18, 19 This sex dependence was also found in first-degree (parents and siblings) relatives of individuals with AD, 20, 21 and in the meta-analysis of Farrer et al, 1 which aggregated data from 40 independent research studies. Among studies of residents in city suburbs and communities, there is general agreement that elderly female \u03b54 carriers have an increased risk of AD, dementia, and cognitive decline vs male \u03b54 carriers.

The Global Alzheimer's Association Interactive Network receives coded information and does not distribute data."}, {"section_title": "Global Alzheimer's Association Interactive Network Data Sets", "text": "Prospective participants for this meta-analysis were identified using resources 31 from the Global Alzheimer's Association Interactive Network. 32, 33 As shown in Table 1 , 34-58 we used multiple data sets from 12 research institutions in the Global Alzheimer's Association Interactive Network, with 2 institutions (National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site and Coalition Against Major Diseases) managing data from several independent studies. Details of the data sets obtained through the Global Alzheimer's Association Interactive Network are given in the eAppendix in the Supplement.\nWe did not receive information about clinical diagnoses for all participants, and in some cases the ages of elderly participants were truncated downward to 90 years to protect their identities. We excluded patients with missing information and/or 90-year truncated ages from all data sets. In many data sets, birth dates were rounded to the nearest year as an extra measure to protect patient confidentiality. We excluded data from participants in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) data set who were also known to have participated in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Study; however, the full extent of the participant overlap between NACC and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative has not currently been established but is estimated to be at most 3%. Across data sets, most participants were white, and for many participants, racial/ethnic information was either not collected or not known. Owing to insufficient numbers of other races/ethnicities, we only included white participants (along with participants from the Fundaci\u00f3 ACE and Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing data sets) with non-Hispanic or unknown ethnicities. Through our correspondences with data set providers, we estimate that Hispanic participants make up no more than 5% of all white participants with unknown ethnicities. After applying exclusion criteria, these data sets were representative of non-Hispanic white individuals in North America and Europe.\nThe descriptions of the clinical diagnoses we received were unstandardized 33 and the levels of detail varied across different data sets according to how each disease was defined (eg, mild or moderate AD) and how it was recorded (eg, AD associated with cerebrovascular disease). We worked directly with each data set provider to translate each set of diagnoses into our 3 general preplanned diagnoses: NL, MCI, and AD. In addition, we excluded all patients with a clinical history of stroke, cerebrovascular disease, Lewy bodies, amyloid precursor protein or presenilin gene mutations, or comorbidity with any other known neurological disease. All subtypes of MCI (eg, amnestic and nonamnestic) were combined into a single MCI diagnosis. "}, {"section_title": "1181", "text": "For longitudinal data sets (eg, NACC and Framingham Heart Study) that had multiple diagnoses per participant, we assigned each participant a single diagnosis. Each participant without a history of MCI or AD was assigned an NL diagnosis, each participant with a history of MCI and no history of AD was assigned an MCI diagnosis, and each participant with a history of AD and no history of MCI was assigned an AD diagnosis. Participants with a history of both MCI and AD were randomly assigned either an MCI or AD diagnosis. We used the latest examination age for the diagnosis age of participants with NL and the earliest recorded age of MCI or AD for participants with MCI and AD, respectively. With the exception of the FHS data set, no participants were followed up more than 10 years; therefore, our NL diagnosis ages were not significantly skewed toward very old ages. We used these diagnosis assignments to form 3 case-control study groups containing 22 AD-NL, 10 MCI-NL, and 7 AD-MCI data sets."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "Meta-analyses of the case-control study groups were conducted using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effects method to calculate odds ratios for each sex and APOE genotype, using the APOE \u03b53/\u03b53 genotype as the referent. We imputed missing NL data in the ACE, Coalition Against Major Diseases, Translational Genomics Research Institute series 2, and Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project data sets using available NL participant data as follows. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the age distributions of participants with normal cognition from each research study, and dissimilar NL participant data was excluded. In particular, we excluded the Alzheimer's Disease Repository Without Borders and Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention data sets because the median age of their participants with NL was relatively young (mid-50s to mid-60s) and that of the Adult Changes in Thought data set was comparatively older (lower 80s). Variations in the total numbers of \u03b52, \u03b53, and \u03b54 alleles of participants with NL were then compared using the \u03c7 2 test of homogeneity to exclude correspondingly heterogeneous data sets. Data from each ascertainment-adjusted case-control study group were then pooled together, and logistic regression was used to calculate ORs for each sex and APOE genotype ( Table 2) . For each sex, a continuous age variable and 5 indicator variables (values of 1 or zero) representing the 5 APOE genotypes (\u03b52/\u03b52, \u03b52/\u03b53, \u03b52/\u03b54, \u03b53/\u03b54, and \u03b54/\u03b54) were used, with the APOE \u03b53/\u03b53 genotype as the referent. We also conducted another pooled analysis where we added a sex indicator variable and 5 additional covariates that were products of the sex variable with each APOE genotype variable to test for sex interactions. The age-dependent curves shown in Figure 1 were derived by adding several quadratic covariate products to the logistic regression that were created by combining APOE genotype, sex, and age. Because the NACC data set was predominantly larger (48% to 85%) than other data sets in the pooled analysis, we separated it from the pooled data and repeated the analyses without it and exclusively with it. Results of all these analyses are listed in the eMethods and eTables 1-3 in the Supplement for the APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 genotype.\nStatistical analyses were performed in R, version 3.3.1, using the metafor meta-analysis package, version 1.9-9, along with the glm generalized linear model function (R Programming).\n60 Mathematica, 61 version 10.0, was used for curve fitting and plotting.

After excluding ascertainment-biased studies, the data in each analysis were pooled, and ORs for each sex and APOE genotype (Table 2) were calculated. In all casecontrol analyses, between-study heterogeneity was reduced after the removal of ascertainment-biased study data. However, P values from the Tarone 62 test of heterogeneity (Table 2) still detected significant study heterogeneity in the female APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 data (OR, 3.31; 95% CI, 3.03-3.61; P=.03) and in the APOE \u03b54/\u03b54 data (men, OR, 11.7; 95% CI, 9.24-14.7; P = .02; women, OR, 9.67; 95% CI, 8.07-11.6; P < .001) of the AD-NL analysis. On further investigation (eTable 1 in the Supplement), we found that the heterogeneity in the female APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 data was localized to ages 75 to 85 years (OR, 3.28; 95% CI, 2.92-3.68; P = .003). This determination was supported after comparing the ORs in that age range from analyses without the NACC data set (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 2.23-3.21) and with the NACC data set exclusively (OR, 4.12; 95% CI, 3.41-4.98). Otherwise, between the ages of 55 and 85 years, the 95% confidence intervals of the ORs calculated from pooled data without the NACC data set overlapped the confidence intervals of the ORs calculated using the NACC data set alone. As shown in Table 2 , men and women with the APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 genotype had the same risks of developing AD (men, OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 2.79-3.42; women, OR, 3.31; 95% CI, 3.03-3.61; P = .47) between the ages of 55 and 85 years. Men with APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 had an increased risk of AD compared with men with \u03b53/\u03b53 (P < .001). The APOE \u03b52/\u03b53 genotype decreased the risk of AD more for women than for men (women, OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.43-0.61; men, OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60-0.85; P = .01). Men and women with the APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 genotype had the same risks of developing MCI between ages 55 and 85 years (men, OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.36-1.76; women, OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.43-1.81; P value = .82). Alzheimer disease and MCI risk factors were calculated for men and women between ages 55 and 85 years for each APOE genotype. Age-adjusted odds ratios are listed in Table 2 and shown in Figure 1 as a function of age for the APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 genotype. All male odds ratios were calculated relative to men with \u03b53/\u03b53, and all female odds ratios relative to women with \u03b53/\u03b53. Three conversion cases were considered: (1) developing AD from a cognitively normal (NL) status, (2) developing MCI from an NL status, and (3) transitioning from MCI to AD. Each conversion is labeled AD-NL, MCI-NL, and AD-MCI, respectively, in Table 2 and Figure 1 .\nOdds ratio curves for men and women with the APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 genotype are shown in Figure 1 between age 55 and 85 years. The ORs calculated from the pooled data analyses in 3 age ranges (55-65 years, 65-75 years, and 75-85 years) are plotted for each sex, with error bars indicating their 95% confidence intervals. As shown in Figure 1A between ages 65 and 75 years, women with APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 had an increased risk of AD compared with men with \u03b53/\u03b54 (women, OR, 4.37; 95% CI, 3.82-5.00; men, OR, 3.14; 95% CI, 2.68-3.67; P = .002). In Figure 1B , the OR curves suggested that women with APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 were at higher risk for developing MCI than men between ages 55 and 70 years, which was confirmed in a separate analysis in that age range (women, OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.19-1.73; men, OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.87-1.30; P = .05). No significant risk differences between men and women for MCI to AD transitions were found in Figure 1C , but the OR curves parallel a previous study that found that APOE \u03b54 increased the risk of transitioning from MCI to AD between the ages of 70 to 85 years, but not between the ages of 55 to 69 years."}, {"section_title": "16", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "When examining the entire age span from 55 to 85 years, men and women with the APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 genotype had nearly the same odds of developing MCI and AD, both in comparisons between data sets and in data set aggregation. Notably, women had an increased risk of MCI between ages 55 and 70 years and an increased risk of AD between ages 65 and 75 years. These results are consistent with a previous study that found a significant association between APOE \u03b54 and cognitive decline between ages 70 and 80 years in women only 24 and with another study that found that episodic memory was more impaired in women with APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 than in men with \u03b53/\u03b54 between ages 70 and 74 years. 25 Mechanisms that underlie these sex differences may be linked to physiologic changes associated with menopause and estrogen loss that begins at a mean age of 51 years 63 just prior to our risk groups. Studies in animals and humans have reported an interaction between APOE \u03b54, menopause, and cognitive decline (for a review, see Riedel et al 64 ). Furthermore, other evidence suggests that carrying 1 copy of APOE \u03b54 shifts the age at onset in women, but not in men.\n18 Collectively, our findings, along with previous work, warrant further investigation into a likely complex set of risk factors with consideration of sex-specific treatments for cognitive decline and AD. For example, if women are at increased risk for AD at younger ages, it is plausible that treatments for women may need to be initiated earlier, especially in those who carry an APOE \u03b54 allele. Both men and women with APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 had an increased risk of AD compared with men and women with \u03b53/\u03b53, respectively. The APOE \u03b52/\u03b53 genotype conferred more of a protective effect on women, decreasing their risk of AD more than men. No significant sexdependent differences were found for transitioning between MCI and AD. Our ORs for developing MCI are consistent with other studies."}, {"section_title": "6,65", "text": "After adjusting for NL participant differences between AD studies by replacing participants with NL with the data set we used for imputation, there was significant variation of AD risk between data sets; the male and female \u03b53/\u03b54 ORs were near 1 for the ACE data set and nearly 7 for the National Institute on Aging Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study data set. In retrospect, high ORs were not remarkable for the National Institute on Aging Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study, which recruited families with 2 or more affected siblings with AD because family history of AD is an AD risk factor and the probability of carrying a genetic mutation in a recognized AD gene increases with the number of first-degree relatives affected with AD. 66 The lowest ORs tended to be associated with community-based studies (eg, ACE, ARWIBO, and FHS) that ascertained participants from geographically specific cities and suburbs. As shown in eFigure 4 in the Supplement, most data points clustered around the NACC data point; these studies primarily recruited random participants who were unrelated to each other. These results are notably different from those of Farrer et al, 1 who found that the relative odds of women with \u03b53/\u03b54 compared with men with \u03b53/\u03b54 for developing AD were about 1.5, and that men with \u03b53/\u03b53 and \u03b53/\u03b54 had the same AD risks when participants were ascertained from clinics/ hospitals and autopsies/brain banks (n = 6305). Many of the participants in their meta-analysis had family histories of AD, they noted differences with population-based studies, and they aggregated participants with early-onset AD. Inclusion of the latter participants could help explain why their AD ORs curves for individuals with \u03b53/\u03b54 reached their maxima around ages 60 to 65 years, as opposed to ours, which reached their maxima around ages 73 to 80 years. These results are in closer agreement with studies that have found \u03b53/\u03b54 carriers to have a mean age at clinical onset of 76 years, and the risk for developing late-onset AD to occur primarily between ages 60 and 79 years. 26 We note that betw eentheag esof6 5t o75y ears,theORsofw omenand men with APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 differed by a factor of about 1.5, which is consistent with the results of Farrer et al 1 across all ages.\nOur result that the APOE \u03b52/\u03b53 genotype decreased the risk of AD more for women than for men is the opposite of what they found; this is likely owing to the fact that our analysis (n = 1482) used more than 3 times the number of participants than they used (n = 447).\nIn agreement with previous studies, 1, 67 we found that individuals with 2 copies of the APOE \u03b54 allele were at greater risk for developing AD than individuals with only 1 copy. No significant differences between men and women with \u03b54/\u03b54 were seen in their risks for developing AD, which is consistent with the results reported by Farrer et al. 1 Apolipoprotein \u03b54 homozygotes also had increased risks compared with \u03b54 heterozygotes for MCI and for transitioning from MCI to AD. Ascertainment biases are known to modify the true effects of APOE on the risks of developing AD, and they may have played a role in the variations we found between data sets. Men have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and stroke than women, so men who live to old age may be healthier than women of the same age and therefore have lesser risks of developing AD.\n68,69 On average, women live longer than men, which makes it difficult to locate older men with AD in sufficient numbers to study.
