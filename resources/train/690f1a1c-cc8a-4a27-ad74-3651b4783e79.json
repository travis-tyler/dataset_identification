There are a set of national-or population-representative longitudinal studies following the same individuals over time or repeated cross sections, some of which use self-reported height and weight (e.g., National Longitudinal Survey of Youth [5] , Health Information National Trends Survey [6] , California Health Interview Survey [7] , Medical Expenditure Panel SurveyHousehold Component [8] , Panel Study of Income Dynamics [9] , Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System [10] , and National Health Interview Survey [11] ) while others capture specific subpopulations or portions of the life cycle (e.g., Early Childhood Longitudinal Study [12] , National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) [13] , National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey [14] ). For global studies, the predominant data sources include the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study [2\u2022, 3, 15] and the Non-communicable Disease Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) [16, 17\u2022] , both of which include approximately 200 countries, allowing comparisons over time, across age groups, and among populations [2\u2022, 15, 16, 17\u2022] .\nWe conducted a systematic review to examine trends in obesity in the USA for studies providing nationally or subnationally representative estimates of body mass index (BMI), obesity, or abdominal obesity using measured anthropometry and published from 2012 to 2018.

All the US studies used information collected in the NHANES and one also used information collected in the National Health Examination Survey (predecessor to the NHANES) [21] . Periods of time covered in each study differed; Hales et al. [38] provided the most updated information covering the period between 2013 and 2016 while Ljungvall et al. [21] presented data across the longest time span (i.e., 1959-2008) among the studies extracted in our search. Three studies examined abdominal obesity, one of which used different cutoff points as their study participants were confined to non-Hispanic Asian Americans [36] . In relation to the global obesity trends, the GBD study used information obtained from 1514 sources [2\u2022] while the NCD RisC studies used information collected in 1698 population-based studies [16] (Table 2 ). Hales et al. [38] , including the most recent cycle of the NHANES, reported that obesity prevalence in 2013-2016 to be 36.5% for men and 40.8% for women.\nLjungvall et al. [21] reported an obesity prevalence of 10% for men and 16% for women in 1959-1962, which increased to 18% for men and 23% for women in 1988-91, 27% for men and 34% for women in 1999-2000, and again to 32% for men and 36% for women in NHANES 2007-2008. The increasing trend in obesity prevalence was featured in the other studies in our search as well [22-24, 33, 35] .\nSeveral studies that used BMI cutoffs higher than 30 suggest a shift in population distribution for BMI towards the upper end of the BMI distribution [21, 27, 30\u2022\u2022, 32] . For example, Ljungvall et al. [21] reported that prevalence of BMI \u2265 35, which was 1 and 5% for men and women, respectively, in 1959, increased to 5 and 9% in 1988-1991 and finally to 11 and 19% in 2007-2008 . Kranjac [28] . Robinson et al. [26] reported that in 1986-1990 abdominal obesity prevalence was 36.0% (27.5% for men and 44.3% for women) increasing to 52.5% (43.1% for men and 61.5% for women) in 2006-2010. Liu et al. [36] reported that central obesity among US non-Hispanic Asian adults in 2011-2014 was 55.3 and 60.9% for men and women, respectively. "}, {"section_title": "Sociodemographic Disparities", "text": "Several of the US studies examined differences in obesity prevalence by race/ethnicity, educational attainment, income, and urbanization level. For example, Ljungvall et al. [21] reported that probability of obesity in 1960 was higher in nonHispanic black women than non-Hispanic white women by 10 percentage points and that total increase during the study period was also larger in non-Hispanic black women than non-Hispanic white women (by 5-10 percentage points). Romero et al. [22] studied a shorter period of time (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) and showed that a baseline difference observed between non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black did not change over time, while a difference between non-Hispanic black and Hispanic increased over time.\nYu et al. [33] concluded that educational inequalities in relation to obesity prevalence from 1971 to 2012 were generally larger in women than men and larger in non-Hispanic white than non-Hispanic black and that obesity prevalence did not differ by educational attainment among nonHispanic black men. In addition, individuals with some college education (i.e., 13-15 years of school or associate's degree) experienced the most rapid increase in obesity prevalence among the four educational attainment categories in non-Hispanic white men, non-Hispanic white women, and non-Hispanic black women. Ogden et al. [37] , which also examined the trends by educational attainment (high school graduates or less, some college, and college graduates) between 1999-2002 and 2011-2014, showed that obesity prevalence among men with some college tended to increase at a faster pace than other two groups. On the other hand, such difference was not observed among women.\nLjungvall et al. [21] found an initial disparity by income, with higher prevalence observed among women in the lower (vs. higher) income groups in 1959; this difference did not diverge over the full period captured . The initial income disparity for men in 1960 disappeared by the 1970s. When Ogden et al. [37] examined trends in obesity prevalence by three categories of household income from 1999-2002 to 2011-2014, obesity prevalence increased among women in the bottom two income groups, but it did not among women in the highest income group. Among men, obesity prevalence in the three income groups increased during the same period.\nHales et al. [38\u2022] examined if obesity prevalence differed by urbanization level (large metropolitan statistical areas [MSAs] , medium or small MSAs, and non-MSAs), showing that in 2013-2016, participants living in medium or small MSAs had a higher obesity prevalence compared to those living in large MSAs in both sexes. In addition, women living in non-MSAs also had a higher prevalence compared to women living in large MSAs. Given less change in obesity prevalence in the first decade of the 2000s compared to previous years, several authors suggested that the increase in obesity prevalence among US adults may be leveling off [39, 40] . Robinson et al. examined differences in obesity prevalence [25] and abdominal obesity prevalence [26] by birth cohort using an age-period-cohort analysis. Robinson et al. [25] found that cohorts born in the 1980s had increased propensity to obesity compared to previous generations, suggesting that obesity prevalence may continue to increase as this younger generation reaches the ages of peak prevalence of obesity. Robinson et al. [26] reported that the baby boomers (those born in 1946-1964) seemed to have low cohort effects on abdominal obesity. \u2022 To analyze how obesity prevalence and the adjusted distribution of BMI have changed over time while paying attention to differences among population subgroups (i.e., race/ethnicity, education attainment and income).\n\u2022 Probability linear models using obesity and BMI \u2265 35 as the outcomes.\n\u2022 Quantile regression models using BMI as the outcome.\n\u2022 Models were stratified by gender.\n\u2022 Increases in obesity, BMI \u2265 35, and BMI were similar across the different population subgroups while the additional increases among blacks merit further investigation.\n\u2022 The obesity epidemic is not limited to low socioeconomic and minority groups.

The GBD study showed that between 1980 and 2015 obesity prevalence doubled in 73 countries and the NCD-RisC [16, 17\u2022] found that age-standardized prevalence of obesity increased from 3.2 to 10.8% in men and from 6.4 to 14.9% in women across 200 countries between 1975 and 2014 [16] ."}, {"section_title": "Differences in Surveillance", "text": "The NHANES is a repeated cross-sectional survey, in which different participants were randomly sampled from population at several time points. Thus, unlike in longitudinal studies, it is not possible to track within-person changes in weight over time. While there are several representative longitudinal cohort studies in the USA that collect measured height and weight (e.g., Add Health [13] ; the Longitudinal Health and Retirement Study [48] ; the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project [49] ; and the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study [50] ), none had data published in the date range that fit our inclusion criteria.\nThe GBD study and the NCD-RisC study based their estimates on many population-based studies; some of which were cross-sectional and the others were longitudinal follow-up. Rather than looking at the longitudinal association, the GBD and NCD-RisC studies estimated obesity prevalence for each country and year using data collected in each given country and the year of data collection, but allowed for inclusion of data from other years in the same country or from data in other countries across similar time periods within regions."}, {"section_title": "Analytical Issues", "text": "Several aspects of the analysis of obesity prevalence trends can impact the magnitude and direction of estimated effects, potentially resulting in inconsistent conclusions across studies. Conclusions in relation to the trends in obesity prevalence differed by time periods covered by each study. Studies that covered a longer period (e.g., 1959-2008 [21] , 1988-2008 [28] ) documented increases in obesity prevalence, while Flegal et al. [43] suggested that obesity prevalence from 1999 to 2008 did not continue to increase at the same rate as that observed in the prior 10 years. Another example is a difference between Ljungvall et al. [21] that covered the period between 1959 and 2008 and Romero et al. [22] that used information collected in 1988-2004. While the former described that the increases in obesity prevalence during the study periods were similar across the racial/ethnic subgroups (or, at least, smaller than the increase experienced by the whole population), the latter emphasized that non-Hispanic black were at higher risk of obesity compared to nonHispanic white.\nThe time point used as baseline for evaluating obesity prevalence trends can also have an important impact on findings [47] . A notable example comes from studies of recent childhood obesity trends; evaluations using 2003-2004 as the baseline time point reported decreases in the prevalence of obesity among 2-5-year-old children through 2011-2014 [47, 51] , while studies using 1999-2000 as baseline reported no evidence of a decline in obesity prevalence in this or any age group through 2011-2014 [52] [53] [54] . Because prevalence estimates can fluctuate substantially between study waves, inclusion of data from several prior years and subsequent years can aid in determining whether prevalence changes at any given time point reflect a transient anomalous dip or a true downward trend [53] . The need to place data in context and see the bigger picture underscores the need for ongoing, consistent monitoring of obesity prevalence and trends in the USA and worldwide.\nOne must consider exclusion criteria for each specific study, even when based on the same study source. For example, in the 18 studies we reviewed, three studies explicitly excluded BMI < 18.5 [23, 27, 34] . Studies also varied greatly in the exclusion of older adults, with some studies excluding adults in their late 60s or 70s while others making no exclusions of older adults, and also varied in exclusion of younger adults aged 18-24 years old. Because obesity prevalence varies across the life span and some evidence suggests that obesity trends differ by age [30\u2022\u2022, 47] , the age range of included participants could potentially impact estimated trends or limit comparability across studies. The analytical approaches used to evaluate obesity trends also varied, with methods including pairwise difference testing, linear trend tests, regression modeling to evaluate linear and quadratic trends, and ageperiod-cohort analysis. Studies using multivariable regression modeling to evaluate changes over time also differed in the selection of covariates used for adjustment in regression models. However, regardless of these differences, studies of US trends included in our review consistently found significant long-term increases in the prevalence of obesity.\nThere are also analytical issues related to future obesity projections. Flegal et al. [30\u2022\u2022] cautioned that several previous attempts to use past data to extrapolate to future trends in obesity prevalence may not have provided valid estimates [55] [56] [57] . Mehta et al. [31\u2022] conducted simulations using NHANES I to simulate mortality for NHANES III participants to test whether a decline in association between BMI and mortality related to statistical nuisance issues, finding that these nuisance contributors, such as the usage of categorical BMI variable (vs. continuous variable) and changes in population distribution, altered findings."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "There are several limitations that should be addressed. First, only studies based on the NHANES data were captured with our inclusion criteria. While the NHANES is nationally representative sample and designed to estimate obesity prevalence in the USA, it is a repeated cross section, which precludes withinindividual change in BMI/obesity. Second, although NHANES is nationally representative, the subpopulation groups can get quite small by sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic groups. Third, we only included systematic reviews and meta analyses for our global search. Thus, some smaller within-country studies that were not a part of GBD and NCD RisC might have been missed. Fourth, the GBD study and the NCD-RisC studies estimated obesity prevalence in each country as a whole, thus ignoring within-country heterogeneity by region, SES, or other subpopulations."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Future Directions", "text": "It would be ideal to use longitudinal studies that allow intraindividual changes between study waves for surveillance. Surveillance that can fully address age-period-cohort differences are needed to identify whether obesity trajectories by age are different by cohort. For example, the Global Burden of Disease Study [3] presented obesity prevalence by age across birth cohorts, suggesting that obesity prevalence tended to increase at a faster pace among those who were born in later cohorts than in earlier cohorts (e.g., those born in 1985 vs. those born in 1960). Age-period-cohort analyses might be particularly relevant in countries undergoing dramatic changes in social and economic environment. There remains a need for studies that allow within-country differences in obesity prevalence.\nAlthough significant increases in the prevalence of obesity since the 1980s are well documented, relatively little is known about the causes for these population-level trends [30\u2022\u2022] . Future studies are needed to identify the factors contributing to the continued increases in obesity. Moreover, there is a need for evaluation of the effectiveness of programs and policies to prevent obesity, as well as to understand the reasons for limited progress in reversing obesity trends [58] [59] [60] [61] . Because of the large inter-individual heterogeneity in the efficacy of obesity intervention and treatment approaches, further studies are warranted to identify individual factors that predict response and to evaluate personalized precision approaches based on genetic and phenotypic characterization [62] . In addition, given the established relations between central obesity and cardiometabolic risk, a close monitoring of trends in central obesity prevalence may be necessary."}]
