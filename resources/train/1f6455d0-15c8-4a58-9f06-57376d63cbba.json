[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "We evaluated longitudinal treatment of PF and observed no depletion in stem cell populations while maintaining an enhanced level of neurogenesis. We examined PF in an \u03b1-synuclein mouse model of Parkinson's disease, where treatment significantly reversed functional, inflammatory, and neuronal deficits. To further our understanding of interplay between multiple mechanisms inducing neurogenesis, we examined the effect of exercise on PF treated mice and observed a synergistic increase in neurogenesis. Proteomic analysis of mouse plasma following PF treatment demonstrates differential protein levels compared to running or the combination of running and PF, suggesting that PF is mechanistically different from the effect of running. In summary, we demonstrate that PF is a multifactorial and multimodal, clinically-relevant, intervention for the treatment of global changes induced by aging. We recently identified pathogenic soluble aggregated tau (tau oligomers) in the cerebral microvasculature of human patients with tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The functional consequences of cerebrovascular tau accumulation are not yet understood. The aim of the present study was to determine whether pathogenic tau accumulation leads to cerebrovascular dysfunction. To this end, we measured neurovascular coupling (NVC), a highly regulated process that synchronizes cerebral blood flow to neuronal activation, using the PS19(P301S) mouse model of tauopathy. The change in cerebral blood flow evoked by whisker stimulation was measured using Laser Doppler flowmetry in PS19 and wildtype control mice and the functional contribution of neuronal and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (nNOS and eNOS, respectively) was calculated. Vascular reactivity was assessed using topical acetylcholine to evoke endothelium-dependent vasodilation. To assess the direct impact of pathogenic tau on cell-specific NOS function, we treated N2a neuroblastoma cells or mouse brain vascular endothelial cells with soluble tau aggregates and measured activity of nNOS and eNOS. Our data indicate isolated overexpression of mutant tau impairs NVC responses, and this deficit is mediated by a reduction in nNOS activity in vivo. Further, our studies suggest tauopathy also impairs endothelium-dependent vasoreactivity in the cortex. Additionally, soluble tau aggregates inhibit the phosphorylation of NOS in primary cultured cells. Therefore, inhibition of NOS phosphorylation by pathogenic soluble tau aggregates may underlie cerebrovascular dysfunction in tauopathies. Thus, therapeutic modulation of pathogenic tau may mitigate brain microvascular deficits, which occur prior to clinical onset in Alzheimer's disease and potentially other tauopathies. Brain age prediction may serve as a promising, individualized biomarker of brain health and may help us understand the heterogeneous biological changes that occur in aging. Brain age prediction is a machine learning method that estimates an individual's chronological age from their neuroimaging scans. If predicted brain age is greater than chronological age, that individual may have an \"older\" brain than expected, suggesting that they may have experienced a higher cumulative exposure to brain insults or were more impacted by those pathological insults. However, contemporary brain age models include older participants with amyloid pathology in their training sets and thus may be confounded when studying Alzheimer's disease (AD). We showed that amyloid status is a critical feature for brain age prediction models by training a model on 808 individuals without significant amyloid pathology from the ADNI, OASIS-3, and IXI cohorts. Our model accurately predicted brain age in the training and independent test sets, comparable to previous published models: [r(807) = 0.94, R2 = 0.88, p=0.001, MAE = 4.9 years, p=0.001], [r(39) = 0.67, R2 = 0.45, and MAE = 4.6 years]. We demonstrated significant differences between AD diagnostic groups [F(3,431)=30.7, p<0.001], and our model was the first to delineate significant differences in brain age relative to chronological age between cognitively normal individuals with and without amyloid [mean difference, 95% CI; CN-A\u03b2(-) (-3.4, -4.9:-1.8), CN-A\u03b2(+) (-0.7, -1.9:0.5)]. Ultimately, incorporation of amyloid status in brain age prediction models improves the utility of brain age as a biomarker for aging and AD. Chronic sterile inflammation is a pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. The mechanisms that drive neuroinflammation and its impact on AD progression are still incompletely understood. The accumulation of molecular damage in somatic cells can trigger cellular senescence, an irreversible state of cell cycle arrest accompanied by the expression of proinflammatory mediators known collectively as the \"senescence-associated secretory phenotype\" (SASP).
