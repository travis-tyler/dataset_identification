Overview\nThe Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) is conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education in order to collect extensive data on American public and private elementary and secondary schools. SASS provides data on the characteristics and qualifications of teachers and principals, teacher hiring practices, professional development, class size, and other conditions in schools across the nation.\nSASS is the largest, most extensive survey of K\u201312 school districts, schools, teachers, and administrators in the United States today. It includes data from public, public charter, private, and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funded school sectors. Therefore, SASS provides a multitude of opportunities for analysis and reporting on elementary and secondary educational issues.\nBackground\nIn the early 1980s, education policymakers became increasingly aware of the need for studies that would provide national data on public and private schools, their programs, teachers, and staffing levels. Such data would inform policymakers about the status of teaching and education, identify the areas that most need improvement, and clarify conflicting reports on issues related to policy initiatives, such as teacher shortages.\nThe first attempt to address these concerns was a series of surveys that began in 1983 and included five surveys:\n\u2022 The Survey of Teacher Demand and Shortage was conducted in 1983\u201384 among public and private schools and included questions on teacher demand and incentive plans for teachers.\n\u2022 The Public School Survey\u2014School Questionnaire was conducted in 1984\u201385 to provide descriptive information about public schools (e.g., enrollment and number of teachers), as well as data on use of teacher incentive plans, volunteers, and computers.\n\u2022 The National Survey of Private Schools\u2014School Questionnaire was conducted in 1985\u201386 to provide parallel information about private schools.\n\u2022 The Public School Survey\u2014Teacher Questionnaire was conducted in 1984\u201385 to provide information about teacher characteristics, qualifications, incentives, and opinions concerning policy issues.\n\u2022 The National Survey of Private Schools\u2014Teacher Questionnaire was conducted in 1985\u201386 to provide parallel information about private school teachers.\nDue to methodology and substance problems within these surveys and the increasing demands for more and better education data, NCES initiated a redesign of its elementary/secondary education surveys in 1985. This redesign began with an evaluation of the then-current data system; opinions and advice were solicited from the education policy and research community on matters of context, methodology, and analytic utility. In late 1985, NCES reported the findings of this evaluation under the heading of Excellence in Schools Surveys and Analysis Study, which has become a continuing series and was renamed the Schools and Staffing Survey.\nIn response to concern expressed in the evaluation about the scarcity of information on schooling, NCES expanded the purposes of its earlier surveys. These expansions were also responses to conflicting reports of teacher shortages and to increasing public concern about the status of teaching and schools in general.\n\n\f2\n\nDocumentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nUnder a contract with NCES, the Rand Corporation redesigned the elementary/secondary education surveys to collect information relevant to their expanded purposes and to correct the methodological difficulties affecting the surveys. The outcome of that effort was a set of concurrent and integrated surveys called the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), which was designed to provide a national snapshot of America\u2019s public and private schools. The first administration of these surveys was in the 1987\u201388 school year. Also, in order to achieve high response rates and to maintain consistency in procedures across types of SASS questionnaires, NCES selected the U.S. Census Bureau to collect and process the data for all parts of the survey.\nAfter the 1987\u201388 administration of SASS, the survey was conducted again in 1990\u201391, 1993\u201394, and 1999\u20132000. During the 6-year hiatus between the 1993\u201394 and 1999\u20132000 administrations, NCES examined the purpose, direction, and use of the survey. Toward this purpose NCES commissioned 12 papers from experts to recommend how to improve and expand the scope and utility of SASS. These papers are compiled in The Schools and Staffing Survey: Recommendations for the Future (NCES 97596) by John E. Mullens and Daniel Kasprzyk. Many of the recommendations in this report were considered for inclusion in SASS, but only some of them were implemented. Factors\u2014such as the burden on the respondent, the need to test new items, how well the recommendations fit into the overall vision for SASS, and cost constraints\u2014had to be balanced in the SASS survey redesign.\nAs a result of this redesign, the 1999\u20132000 SASS implemented a new set of questionnaires. The questionnaires for public charter schools were designed to collect some of the same data as the 4-year longitudinal design survey titled \u201cNational Study of Charter Schools,\u201d funded by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (renamed the Institute of Education Sciences in 2002). By including public charter schools in SASS, public charter school data could be directly compared to \u201ctraditional\u201d public school data for the first time. The availability of a complete universe, or sampling frame, for public charter schools made this development feasible in 1999\u20132000. The redesign also led to the discontinuation of the student records questionnaire. Although the experimental inclusion of this questionnaire in the 1993\u201394 SASS provided interesting data, both the sampling methods and the ability to gain the respondent\u2019s cooperation in obtaining administrative records on student dropout and behavior proved to be too difficult for continuation in 1999\u20132000 and beyond.\nThe 2003\u201304 SASS provides valuable data for educators, researchers, and policymakers on public school districts (Local Education Agencies); public (including public charter), private, and BIA-funded schools, principals, and teachers; and public and BIA-funded school library media centers. Public charter school data are included with traditional public school data, rather than in separate data files, in the 2003\u201304 SASS. A sample of public charter schools was implemented because the public charter school frame used for the 1999\u20132000 SASS was out-of-date and the 2001\u201302 Common Core of Data (CCD) frame for charter schools was considered to be incomplete. Moreover, funding to continue administering a separate questionnaire for public charter schools was not available. Additionally, the 2003\u201304 SASS collected data from public charter and BIA-funded schools in the School or Unified School Questionnaires as well as in the School Principal and School Teacher Questionnaires. Chapter 2 includes details on the changes to questionnaires since the 1999\u20132000 SASS.\nPurpose and Content of the Survey\nThe overall objective of SASS is to collect the information necessary for a comprehensive picture of elementary and secondary education in the United States. The abundance of data collected permits detailed analyses of the characteristics of schools, principals, teachers, school libraries, and public school district policies. The linkage of the SASS questionnaires enables researchers to examine the relationships among these elements of education.\n\n\fChapter 1. Overview\n\n3\n\nThe 2003\u201304 SASS consisted of five types of questionnaires: a school district questionnaire, principal questionnaires, school questionnaires, teacher questionnaires, and a school library media center questionnaire. The principal, school, and teacher questionnaires were modified slightly between the public versions (Principal Questionnaire, School Questionnaire, Teacher Questionnaire) and private school versions (Private School Principal Questionnaire, Private School Questionnaire, and Private School Teacher Questionnaire) to refer to either the public or private sector correctly. The Private School Questionnaire also incorporated the Private School Universe Survey (PSS) items that were collected at the same time as SASS in 2003\u201304.1 The School Library Media Center Questionnaire was administered to public (including public charter) and BIA-funded schools in 2003\u201304.\nSchool District Questionnaire (Form SASS-1A)\nThe purpose of the 2003\u201304 School District Questionnaire was to obtain information about school districts, such as student enrollment, number of full-time equivalent teachers, teacher recruitment and hiring practices, teacher dismissals, existence of a teacher union, length of the contract year, teacher salary schedules, school choice, magnet programs, graduation requirements, and professional development for teachers and principals. The applicable sections (e.g., comparable sections on hiring, etc.) for private schools were added to the Private School Questionnaire. Independent public charter schools, BIA-funded schools, and schools that are the only school in the district were given the Unified School Questionnaire and not the School District Questionnaire. The Unified School Questionnaire includes all of the items included on the School Questionnaire in addition to selected items from the School District Questionnaire.\nThe 2003\u201304 School District Questionnaire had these nine sections:\n\u2022 Section I\u2014Enrollment Information obtained grades offered, counts of students by race, the number of days in the school year, participation in the National School Lunch Program, full-time equivalent (FTE) counts of all teachers employed by the school district and counts of teachers by race/ethnicity.\n\u2022 Section II\u2014Recruitment and Hiring of Staff collected information on teacher certification, recruitment incentives, newly hired teachers and principals, dismissal of teachers from the previous school year, and teacher union contractual information.\n\u2022 Section III\u2014Teacher Compensation collected data on salary schedules and benefits. \u2022 Section IV\u2014School and Student Performance obtained data on performance reports, assessment\nprograms, and rewards or sanctions to district schools for student achievement. \u2022 Section V\u2014School Organization obtained information about the existence of public charter\nschools and the availability of choice and magnet programs in the district. \u2022 Section VI\u2014Homeschooling obtained information about the existence of homeschooled students\nand the criteria for evaluating their performance. \u2022 Section VII\u2014Graduation Requirements collected data on high school graduation requirements,\ncommunity service requirements, and other assessments necessary for graduation. \u2022 Section VIII\u2014Professional Development obtained information on professional development\nprograms, funding, and incentives for participation, along with incentives used to recruit or retain teachers to teach in fields of shortage.\n\n1 The 2003\u201304 school year was a survey year for both SASS and the Private School Universe Survey (PSS). PSS is administered by NCES every 2 years to all private K\u201312 schools in the United States. The SASS Private School Questionnaire was modified to include all the PSS questions so that private schools selected for SASS would not be asked to complete two separate questionnaires.\n\n\f4\n\nDocumentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\n\u2022 Section IX\u2014Migrant Education obtained information about the enrollment of migrant students and the services provided for them.\nPrincipal and Private School Principal Questionnaires (Forms SASS-2A and -2B)\nThe purpose of the 2003\u201304 principal questionnaires was to obtain information about principal/school head demographic characteristics, training, experience, salary, and judgments about the seriousness of school problems.

This information was necessary for the Teacher Follow-Up Survey that was administered the following year.\nSchool Library Media Center Questionnaire (Form LS-1A)\nThe purpose of the 2003\u201304 School Library Media Center Questionnaire was to obtain information about public school and BIA-funded library media centers and librarians, such as amount and experience of library staff, and the organization, expenditures, and collections of the library media center.\nThe 2003\u201304 School Library Media Center Questionnaire had these six sections:\n\u2022 Section I\u2014Facilities obtained data about the organization, content, and capacity of the library media center.\n\u2022 Section II\u2014Staffing collected data about the number of professional, clerical, and volunteer staff in the library, and the highest degrees held by the professional staff members.\n\u2022 Section III\u2014Technology obtained data about the different technology resources in the school, such as computers, television, DVD, etc.\n\u2022 Section IV\u20142002\u201303 Collections and Expenditures collected data about the size, expenditures, and currency of the library media collection.\n\u2022 Section V\u2014Scheduling, Transactions, and Policies obtained data about scheduling, frequency of use, and borrowing policies.\n\u2022 Section VI\u2014Information Literacy and Collaboration collected data about frequency of library media staff collaboration with classroom teachers, and formal information literacy programs.\nTarget Populations and Estimates\nTarget Populations\nThe target populations for the 2003\u201304 SASS are described below. For more information on sampling see chapter 4.\n\u2022 School districts. The target population included school districts that operated one or more schools, employed elementary and/or secondary level teachers, and were themselves in operation in the 2003\u201304 school year; for example, public school districts, state agencies that operated schools for special student populations (such as inmates of juvenile correctional facilities), domestic schools under the Department of Defense (DoD), and cooperative agencies that\n\n\f8\n\nDocumentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nprovided special services to more than one school district. Entities that authorized public charter schools were not included, unless they were also public school districts or operated the charter schools they authorized. Independently operated public charter schools or single school districts received the Unified School Questionnaire, since the school and district respondents were likely to be the same person. \u2022 Schools. The target population included public, public charter, private, and BIA-funded schools with students in any of grades 1\u201312 or in comparable ungraded levels and in operation in school year 2003\u201304. \u2022 Principals. The target population included principals of the targeted school populations. \u2022 Teachers. The target population included teachers in the targeted school populations who taught students in any of grades K\u201312 or in comparable ungraded levels in the 2003\u201304 school year. \u2022 School library media centers. The target population included school library media centers, libraries, or resource centers in public, public charter, and BIA-funded schools that have such a facility. A school library was defined as an organized collection of printed, audiovisual, or computer resources that is administered as a unit, is located in a designated place, and makes resources available to students, teachers, and administrators.\nThe sampling frame for public schools was an adjusted version of the 2001\u201302 CCD. The sample of public schools was drawn from the sampling frame for the 2001\u201302 school year. CCD includes regular public schools, charter schools, DoD-operated domestic military base schools, and special purpose schools, such as special education, vocational, and alternative schools. NCES collects CCD data annually from all state education agencies. Schools outside of the United States and schools that teach only prekindergarten, kindergarten, or postsecondary students were deleted from the CCD frame prior to sampling for SASS. Public schools that closed in the school year 2001\u201302 or were not yet opened were not included. School districts operating a sampled school were also selected. Prior to stratification and sampling, CCD schools were collapsed to a more inclusive grade range. The purpose and operations of this collapsing activity are discussed in chapter 2.\nThe sampling frame for private schools is based on a dual frame approach, as described further in chapter 4, since the list frame does not provide complete coverage. The list frame was based on the 2001\u201302 PSS, updated with private school organizations and state lists collected by the Census Bureau in the autumn of 2002 for updating the 2003\u201304 PSS list frame. An area frame was used to find schools missing from the list frame, thereby compensating for the incomplete coverage of the list frame.\nThe BIA frame consisted of a list of elementary, secondary, and combined K\u201312 schools that BIA operated or funded during the 2001\u201302 school year. The list was obtained from CCD. All BIA-funded school records that met the SASS definition of a school were included in the SASS sample.\nAll library media centers in public, public charter, and BIA-funded schools in the SASS sample were asked to complete the School Library Media Center Questionnaire.\nThe sampling frame for the teacher questionnaires consisted of lists of teachers provided by schools in the SASS sample. Teachers were defined as any long-term staff who taught a regularly scheduled class to students in grades K\u201312. The Teacher Listing Form was collected by Census Bureau field representatives as early as possible in the 2003\u201304 school year at all public, private, BIA-funded, and public charter schools in the SASS sample to obtain a complete list of all the teachers employed at each school. The form included space for schools to indicate the following: race/ethnicity of each teacher, whether the teacher was \u201cnew,\u201d the teacher\u2019s assignment (subject matter and/or grade level), and whether the teacher was full- or part-time. The sample of teachers was selected from all of the schools that provided teacher lists.\n\n\fChapter 1. Overview\n\n9\n\nEstimates\nSASS was designed to produce national, regional, and state estimates for public elementary and secondary schools and related components (e.g., schools, teachers, principals, school districts, and school library media centers); national estimates for BIA-funded and public charter schools and related components (i.e., schools, teachers, principals, and school library media centers); and national, regional, and affiliation group estimates for the private school sector (i.e., schools, teachers, and principals). The affiliation groups for private schools were\n\u2022 Catholic\u2014parochial; \u2022 Catholic\u2014diocesan; \u2022 Catholic\u2014private; \u2022 Amish; \u2022 Assembly of God; \u2022 Baptist; \u2022 Episcopal; \u2022 Jewish; \u2022 Lutheran Church\u2014Missouri Synod; \u2022 Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod; \u2022 Mennonite; \u2022 Pentecostal; \u2022 Seventh-Day Adventist; \u2022 other religious; \u2022 nonsectarian\u2014regular; \u2022 nonsectarian\u2014special emphasis; and \u2022 nonsectarian\u2014special education.\nComparisons between public and private schools are possible only at the regional and national levels, because private schools were selected for sampling by affiliation group and region rather than by state.\nThe teacher survey was designed to support comparisons between new and experienced teachers (3 years or less of experience vs. more than 3 years of experience) at the state level. Comparisons between teachers by race and by full-time or part-time status are possible at the national level. The school library media center survey was designed to produce estimates at the state level for public schools.\nPeriodicity of the Survey\nPeriodicity is based on the balance between the need for more up-to-date data with the realities of mounting data collection and completing a data collection and processing cycle. A 3-year cycle was maintained for the first three data collections but proved to be too frequent to allow for the analysis of the previous SASS to be incorporated in the next one. Six years separated the 1999\u20132000 SASS from the previous one, due to a major redesign of the survey. Following this SASS redesign, it was determined that 4 years provided the best balance between data needs and operational needs. The 2003\u201304 SASS was conducted on a 4-year interval, and this cycle length will be repeated for the upcoming SASS administrations.\n\n\f10 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nContents\nThis report contains chapters on changes in SASS design, content, and methodology from 1999\u20132000, preparation for the 2003\u201304 SASS, sample design and implementation, data collection, response rates, data processing, imputation procedures, weighting and variance estimation, a review of the quality of SASS data, SASS data files and merging information, and user notes and cautions.\nInformation in the chapters is supported by material in the following appendixes:\n\u2022 A.

Changes in SASS Design, Content, and Methodology From 1999\u20132000 to 2003\u201304\nSeveral changes in survey sample design, questionnaire content, procedures, and methodology were made for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS).\nDesign Changes\nChanges to the Sample Design for 2003\u201304 SASS\nA number of changes were made in the sample design from the 1999\u20132000 SASS to the 2003\u201304 SASS. Changes were made to the stratification, sample sizes, sample sort, and school definition. Further details describing why these changes were made are presented in chapter 3. Details on the sampling design used for the 2003\u201304 SASS are discussed in chapter 4.\nSchools\n\u2022 Rather than surveying all public charter schools, as was done in the 1999\u20132000 SASS, 303 public charter schools were sampled for the 2003\u201304 SASS. Since there were over 2,000 public charter schools on the sampling frame, it was decided that sampling was an appropriate method for achieving the overall goals of the survey estimation.\n\u2022 Affiliation for private schools was redefined and stratified into 17 groups rather than the previous 20 groups. Catholic schools were split into three groups based on typology. Other religious schools were divided into 11 groups corresponding to the 10 largest non-Catholic religious organizations (by school count) and a catch-all \u201cother.\u201d Nonsectarian schools were divided into three groups by typology.\n\u2022 Grade-level stratification in public and private schools was defined purely on the basis of grade level of the school. Schools classified as a type other than \u201cregular school\u201d were no longer placed in the combined school category, which includes schools with some elementary and some secondary grades. Many nonregular schools (i.e., special education, alternative, and vocational schools) cover a specific grade range. To the extent this grade range is known, this seemed a more appropriate method of stratification than placing them all in the combined school strata. Nonregular schools with a grade range that is ungraded or unknown remained in the combined school strata.\n\u2022 Public schools from the Common Core of Data (CCD) were collapsed into what was perceived to be a better fit with the SASS definition of a school prior to the stratification. See chapter 4 and \u201cAppendix K. Details of SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures\u201d for further discussion of how this was done. The sample allocation was correspondingly revised to avoid undersampling schools now classified as the \u201ccombined\u201d grade level. In other words, the revision of the sample allocation ensured that the newly combined schools were sampled at the same approximate rate as they would have been prior to the collapsing procedure. In general, the combined school sample size was increased to the point at which the combined school sampling rate equaled the overall state-level sampling rate. For example, if one in five schools were sampled in a particular state, then one in five of the combined schools were sampled rather than using the default sample size of 10 combined schools.\n\n\f12 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\u2022 The sort order for the public and private school sampling was altered to sort on enrollment in a serpentine fashion within higher-level sort variables instead of always sorting in descending order. Serpentine sorting involves sorting in ascending order with respect to higher-level sort variables one time, then sorting in descending order the next time, then ascending, and then descending throughout the file. This reduced the variation in enrollment between adjacent sampled schools and thus reduced the overall sampling error.\nSchool Districts\n\u2022 Florida and Maryland were added to the list of states where at least one school is selected in each school district. This was done to decrease the standard error of the state-level school district estimates.\nTeachers\n\u2022 Oversampling of bilingual/English as a second language (ESL) teachers was discontinued since a sufficient number of bilingual teachers to produce the desired reliability would be selected in the sample without oversampling.\n\u2022 Teacher sampling was automated to speed up the distribution of the teacher questionnaires. This, however, reduced the level of control over the sample sizes for the remaining oversampled teacher strata (Asian/Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaska Native). The automation no longer allowed the sampling rate for these teachers to be periodically revised during the sampling process. If the number of these teachers listed differed from the expected, the sample size goal would no longer be met. See chapter 4 for further discussion of the goals of the teacher sampling.\nOther Design Changes\n\u2022 The School Library Media Center Questionnaire was not administered to private schools for budget reasons.\n\u2022 There was no separate questionnaire for public charter schools. The reduction in the public charter school sample size from 1,100 in the 1999\u20132000 SASS to 303 in the 2003\u201304 SASS meant it was no longer feasible to produce a separate questionnaire since public charter school data could not be published with as much detail (for this SASS, only at the national and regional level). Public charter school data are included with traditional public school data.\n\u2022 The Unified School Questionnaire is a new questionnaire that contains the public school questions and many of the school district questions. It was administered to most public charter, state-operated (e.g., often schools for the blind or schools located in juvenile detention facilities), and BIA-funded schools, as well as public schools in one-school districts. This change was made to ease the respondent burden in cases where the respondent for the school and school district questionnaires was expected to be the same.\nContent Changes\nPrior to the 2003\u201304 administration, extensive pretesting was undertaken. (For a detailed explanation of this testing, please refer to chapter 3.) As a result of this pretesting and changes in priorities for SASS, the following alterations and deletions were made to the SASS questionnaires between 1999\u20132000 and 2003\u2013 04. The specific question numbers from the 1999\u20132000 and 2003\u201304 questionnaires, respectively, are\n\n\fChapter 2.

(38)\nMethodological and Procedural Changes\nField-Based Data Collection\nThe data collection procedures for all questionnaires administered at the schools changed substantially for the 2003\u201304 SASS. In previous administrations of SASS, self-administered questionnaires were mailed to the selected schools. Nonrespondents were contacted by telephone, using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) instrument. Finally, remaining nonrespondents were assigned to field representatives who contacted them by telephone and/or by personal visits. Under that methodology, most respondents completed self-administered questionnaires, while some were interviewed by telephone (12 to 23 percent, depending on the questionnaire type).\nDuring the 2003\u201304 SASS, field representatives were responsible for all of the SASS data collection for each of the sampled schools, and nearly all questionnaires were completed directly by respondents (fewer than 900 cases were attempted as telephone interviews). The field activities included\n\u2022 mailing an advance postcard to the schools; \u2022 telephoning the school and using a computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) instrument\n(the SASS Teacher Listing instrument) to verify school information and set up appointments; \u2022 visiting the school to meet the school principal, school head(s), and/or other school contact\nperson(s) to explain the 2003\u201304 SASS, to pick up the teacher roster (or make arrangements to obtain it), and to drop off questionnaires for the principal, school, and school library media center; \u2022 entering the teacher roster information into the SASS Teacher Listing instrument, which selected a sample of teachers; \u2022 passing out questionnaires to the selected teachers; and \u2022 following up on all questionnaires via telephone calls and return personal visits, if needed.\nChapter 5 on data collection provides details on the fieldwork. A brief evaluation of the field-based methodology is included at the end of chapter 5.\nAdvance Work with School Districts\nIn prior administrations of SASS, school districts were contacted before data collection began to obtain the name of the person to whom the School District Questionnaire should be mailed. Additional efforts to contact school districts were made for the 2003\u201304 SASS, because of concerns that the district\u2019s participation impacts not only the response rate on the School District Questionnaire but also the participation of schools within the district. School district participation in SASS is critical because a refusal from the school district can lower response rates for multiple school, principal, teacher, and school\n\n\f40 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nlibrary media center questionnaires as well as lower the school district response rate. The new field-based methodology had the potential to impact the participation of the school districts in two ways:\n\u2022 Decrease school-level response. A field representative contacted schools in each school district individually. If a school requested approval by the school district as a condition for participation, and the school district refused, all of the schools in the district could become nonrespondents. In the past, many schools completed their questionnaire before the school district had a chance to refuse.\n\u2022 Increase school participation. By sending people with extensive knowledge of the area and good communication skills to the schools and districts, the participation rate within schools could increase.\nSince the impact of the new methodology was unknown, two approaches to deal with school districts were implemented. First, school districts that were in the sample in the past and had special procedures for allowing participation, or were known to have research applications with deadlines before the field period would begin, were identified. These were referred to as \u201cspecial districts\u201d and efforts were made to contact them for approval prior to the field period. These efforts are documented in \u201cAppendix L. Report on Results of Special Contact Districts.\u201d\nSecond, to better understand how districts would respond to precontact and what implications it would have on the cost and timing of SASS, a small experiment was embedded in this implementation of SASS. Three of the 12 Census Bureau Regional Offices were selected to participate in this experiment. All of the school districts in these areas, except the \u201cspecial districts,\u201d were assigned either to the test group or the control group. Those in the test group were called prior to the field period to determine if they had any research requirements or paperwork that must be completed before a field representative could visit their schools. If they did have requirements, efforts were made to meet them and gain approval prior to the field period. During the survey, field representatives kept detailed logs of their efforts in completing data collection at the schools in each of these districts, in order to provide data to ascertain the impact of the precontacts. The results of the experiment are covered in \u201cAppendix M. School District Experiment Findings.\u201d\nEarly Detection of Out-of-Scope Schools\nIn previous administrations of SASS, schools\u2019 self-reported grade ranges, addresses, and/or number of teachers differed from the variables recorded on the Common Core of Data (CCD). These differences impact whether a school was in-scope or out-of-scope for SASS (i.e., eligible for SASS). In previous SASS administrations, these discrepancies were identified during post-data collection processing. Identifying these discrepancies during processing delayed the final completion of previous administrations of SASS. To reduce processing time and burden on out-of-scope schools, the Census Bureau reengineered the process to start with the use of the SASS Teacher Listing instrument that determined if a school was in-scope or out-of-scope. Details on the SASS Teacher Listing instrument are covered in chapter 5.\nEarly Start to the Teacher Survey\nIn previous administrations of SASS, the Teacher Listing Form was mailed to schools in order to obtain a list of teachers\u2019 names and additional information on the teachers\u2019 subject matter and grades taught, fulltime/part-time status, race/ethnicity, experience level (whether in first 3 years of teaching or not), and whether they taught students with limited-English proficiency. Once enough Teacher Listing Forms were received and keyed, the information was used to sample teachers and mail the appropriate teacher questionnaires. Mailout of teacher questionnaires occurred in waves, with the first wave occurring several\n\n\fChapter 2. Changes in SASS Design, Content, and Methodology From 1999\u20132000 to 2003\u201304 41\nweeks after the other survey forms were mailed. Follow-up of the teacher questionnaires continued through the end of the school year. The Census Bureau reengineered the process by having the field representative obtain Teacher Listing Form information as early as possible, and key the teacher names and information into CAPI, which then selected the teachers for each school, enabling the teacher questionnaires to be distributed much earlier than in previous administrations of SASS. The data collection was substantially completed by February 2004.\nPromotional Materials\nTo encourage response, the 2003\u201304 SASS used several promotional materials, including brochures, pens, and CD-ROMs. The brochures, which contained summaries of the results from the 1999\u20132000 SASS, were provided to the school\u2019s principal during the first meeting at the school. The purpose of the brochures was to emphasize to educators the importance of their participation in SASS. Public schools were given A Brief Profile of America\u2019s Public Schools (NCES 2003-418) and private schools were given A Brief Profile of America\u2019s Private Schools (NCES 2003-417). All schools also were given an informational brochure, Schools and Staffing Survey: 2003\u201304 (NCES 2003-409), and a CD-ROM containing the Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2002.\nIndividual respondents (i.e., principals, teachers, and library media center specialists) were provided pens inscribed with the \u201cSchools and Staffing Survey\u201d and the SASS website.\nInternet Reporting Option\nThere was no internet reporting option for the 2003\u201304 SASS. The 1999\u20132000 SASS offered an internet reporting option for the School Library Media Center Questionnaire.\n\n\fThis page is intentionally left blank.\n\n\f43\n\nChapter 3. Preparation for the 2003\u201304 SASS\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the U.S. Census Bureau continually work to improve questionnaires and procedures for the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). Prior to the administration of the 2003\u201304 SASS, the survey and methodology were tested iteratively and improved. Methodology changes were based on experience conducting previous SASS studies and on debriefings conducted with Census Bureau field staff (field representatives). Decisions on revisions to items were informed by a number of sources, including qualitative research, item response rates from previous surveys, results of reinterview studies, and review of data issues from previous studies. A summary of the research conducted is presented in exhibit 1, and the full reports are included as appendixes C through J.\n\nExhibit 1.

Nonrespondents were contacted first by telephone (using computer-assisted telephone interviewing [CATI] instruments for most questionnaires) and ultimately by field representatives. In an attempt to shorten the data collection period\n\n\f44 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nfor SASS and increase response rates, a new methodology was proposed for the 2003\u201304 SASS. The new methodology was essentially a shift to an in-person field-based methodology that would begin with a personal visit to each school by a field representative, with all subsequent follow-up conducted by the field representative. The purpose of the pretest was to see if this new approach was advantageous in terms of timing, response, data quality, and cost. The field test was conducted between October 2001 and March 2002. A complete description of the methodology and detailed findings can be found in \u201cAppendix C. Report on 2001\u201302 SASS Pretest and Recommendations for 2003\u201304 SASS.\u201d\n\nMethods\n\nThree Census Bureau Regional Offices\u2014Seattle, Atlanta, and Denver\u2014were selected to participate in the pretest. A total of 29 field representatives across the three Regional Offices were trained on the procedures to conduct the SASS interviews. Over 300 schools were selected to participate in this test. An advance letter was sent to the schools that were selected to participate informing them that a field representative would contact them. Field representatives attempted to contact schools via telephone and gain the school\u2019s participation in SASS. Field representatives also returned to schools to pick up completed questionnaires. A debriefing was held at the end of the field pretest. The response rates are presented in table 1.\n\nTable 1.

The lower school-level rates occurred because several schools that may have participated in a full-scale SASS refused to participate in the pretest. \u2022 There was no clear improvement in data quality. However, there were indications that the data from the Teacher Listing Form were less problematic and that a few questions on the other SASS questionnaires may have had better item response rates.\n\nTest of SASS Teacher Listing Instrument\n\nIn previous administrations of SASS, screening of schools to determine if they were in-scope or out-ofscope was embedded in the Teacher Listing Form and school questionnaires. The screening process sometimes yielded inaccurate or inconsistent information about the school\u2019s status. For example, a private school might report that it is public, because it receives tuition money from a public school district on behalf of some students. The methodology itself added significant time to the data collection. Although the SASS operation typically started in October, the last teacher questionnaires were mailed out in the spring, leaving little time in the school year for nonresponse follow-up. In an attempt to improve the screening process and reduce the time required to conduct SASS, a computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) instrument, called the SASS Teacher Listing instrument, was developed that could\n\n\fChapter 3. Preparation for the 2003\u201304 SASS 45\nscreen schools and select a sample of teachers from eligible schools. The instrument was designed to screen schools by phone for in-scope and out-of-scope status. Next, the field representative was instructed to set up an appointment with the school to collect the Teacher Listing Form data. The field representative could then key these data into the instrument and a sample of teachers was selected. This allowed the field representative to sample teachers and hand questionnaires to the selected teachers all in one visit to the school. In order to verify that the SASS Teacher Listing instrument and procedures would work in a field setting, a two-part test was conducted prior to the full-scale SASS administration.\nThe instrument and procedures were modified based on findings from the test. The test was conducted in early January 2003. Detailed information on the study can be found in \u201cAppendix D. Report of Findings From a Test on the SASS Teacher Listing Instrument.\u201d\nMethods\nOne hundred and eighty schools in states likely to be problematic9 (Oklahoma, Montana, and South Dakota) and the Washington, DC metropolitan area (Virginia, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, and Maryland) were selected to participate in this test. For details on sampling, please refer to \u201cChapter 4. SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures.\u201d In order to ensure that a variety of scenarios were encountered (e.g., merged or split schools), some of the schools selected had their sampling frame information altered (grade ranges or enrollment counts were modified to create discrepancies). Following normal SASS procedures, an advance letter was sent to schools prior to interviewing. Five field representatives and members of Census Bureau telephone interviewing staff were trained to administer the SASS Teacher Listing instrument and conduct a debriefing with respondents about their experience. A standardized debriefing form was used to structure the feedback. Twenty cases in the DC area were selected for in-person visits. All other interviews were conducted by telephone. Daily debriefing sessions were held at the Census Bureau to identify issues and solutions during the test period.\nKey Findings\n\u2022 The instrument was not able to handle breaks in grade range. For example, a high school that had a kindergarten would have needed to be reported as 9\u201312. It was recommended that grade range handling be improved to allow this flexibility.\n\u2022 The instrument moved slowly during the keying operation. It was recommended that improvements be made to the performance of the Teacher Listing Form portion of the instrument.\n\u2022 The instrument was successful at identifying in-scope and out-of-scope schools and collecting teacher lists from schools. It was recommended that a modified instrument be used in the fullscale SASS.\n\u2022 The test indicated that Regional Offices should conduct a prefield clean-up operation of the listing file before field interviewing begins.\n\u2022 The test identified many procedural recommendations: o Training for field representatives should be modified to improve their understanding of how to use the instrument and contact schools. o Field representatives should review every Teacher Listing Form with a knowledgeable person at the school before keying the form into the instrument. During the pretest, field representatives did not check the quality of the Teacher Listing Form before leaving the school, which led to the inclusion of nonteachers in the sample.\n9 In previous SASS administrations, it was more common to find a discrepancy between grade ranges on the Common Core of Data (CCD) and actual grade ranges identified in SASS for schools in Oklahoma, Montana, and South Dakota than it was for schools in other states.\n\n\f46 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\no Greater flexibility should be built into the instrument so that field representatives could change demographic fields such as name and address during the interview.\nResearch on the Teacher Questionnaire\nIn an effort to develop questionnaire items that would accurately capture teachers\u2019 responses to the key questionnaire items, Census Bureau analysts conducted a series of cognitive interviews (such as \u201cthinkaloud\u201d sessions) to identify problems that could be corrected prior to the survey\u2019s official release. The results from this first study were used to make revisions, and a second, small-scale study was conducted to test some of these key revisions.\nStudy One\nAn initial round of cognitive interviews was conducted on key items from the teacher questionnaire from December 2002 through February 2003. The study evaluated some items from the 1999\u20132000 administration of SASS that were deemed problematic, as well as new items that were being considered for addition to the 2003\u201304 administration. Details on methodology and findings can be found in \u201cAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels.\u201d\nThe test included items on\n\u2022 background and work status; \u2022 class organization; \u2022 degrees obtained and their source (education program); \u2022 certification and preparation for teaching; \u2022 working conditions; \u2022 professional development; \u2022 resources and assessment of students; and \u2022 school climate.\nIn addition, the study tested a different approach to the certification section that was included in the 1999\u2013 2000 teacher questionnaire. The series was revised to ask first about the teacher\u2019s certification and content area rather than asking for the teacher\u2019s main assignment first followed by items on certification status in the assignment area. All other items were tested as written in the 1999\u20132000 teacher questionnaire.\nMethods\nDue to the number of questions and subquestions in these sections, the test was conducted in two panels. Both panels included sections on background, work status, and working conditions. Panel A contained items on class organization, educational background, certification, and preparation for teaching. Panel B contained additional items on professional development, school climate, resources, and assessment of students. There were 16 participants in panel A and 14 participants in panel B for a total of 30 participants.\nInterviewers followed a protocol but were free to vary from the protocol as necessary. The protocol utilized a variety of cognitive techniques, including think-aloud, probing, and retrospective probes. Respondents received a cash incentive for their participation in the study.\n\n\fChapter 3. Preparation for the 2003\u201304 SASS 47\nKey Findings\n\u2022 Confusion about certification items should be resolved by asking respondent to first identify their school level (e.g., elementary or secondary) and then identify the area of specialization or endorsement.\n\u2022 The items concerning hours worked at the school should be revised to better capture how teachers spend their time at their school each week. This includes adding additional instructions that clarify which specific activities to include in the hours reported for each of these items.\n\u2022 The items on standardized testing should be revised for content and worded more clearly so that respondents can accurately reflect testing in schools.\nStudy Two\nThe teacher questionnaire was revised based on recommendations from the previous study. As a result, a small-scale test was conducted on some of the key revisions. Complete findings and methodology can be found in \u201cAppendix F. Report on a Follow-up Cognitive Testing to the 2003\u201304 SASS Teacher Questionnaire.\u201d\nMethods\nThis research was conducted through telephone interviewing during March 2003. Schools were contacted by phone and asked to nominate a teacher to participate in the study. A questionnaire was then faxed to the school and an appointment was set for the researcher to call the teacher directly. A concurrent interview was conducted by phone following a structured protocol. The interviewer was free to deviate from the protocol as required. The form contained revised items on certification, preparation for teaching, and source of degree. The initial proposed certification questions were administered to three respondents. The form was revised based on these interviews and an additional six interviews were conducted with this second form. Interviews lasted 15 to 25 minutes. Teachers were offered a copy of the Schools and Staffing Survey, 1999\u20132000: Overview of the Data for Public, Private, Public Charter, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Elementary and Secondary Schools (NCES 2002-313) as an incentive for participation.\nKey Findings\n\u2022 Certification items should be revised to focus on certification areas instead of endorsements, which caused confusion.\n\u2022 The research indicated that teachers have a difficult time recalling their specific certification. \u2022 Certification requirements varied by state and changed from year to year within states. \u2022 Items on the types of assessments taken by teachers and the results of those tests suffered from\nrecall issues and order effects.\nResearch on the School and Principal Questionnaires\nNew items on principal\u2019s time use, paraprofessionals, hiring and dismissal of teachers, and testing were proposed for the 2003\u201304 administration of SASS. Additionally, items on overcrowding and attendance were found to be unreliable in a reinterview study conducted on the previous SASS administration. (For more details see \u201cAppendix H. Response Variance in the 1999\u20132000 Schools and Staffing Survey,\u201d in the 1999\u20132000 Schools and Staffing Survey Data File User\u2019s Manual, NCES 2004-303.) A two-pronged approach was used to study these issues. First, a series of exploratory focus groups was conducted to look at the constructs of interest. The focus groups were followed by small-scale, questionnaire specific, cognitive research.\n\n\f48 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nFocus Groups\nTraditionally, SASS has used techniques such as cognitive interviewing and behavior coding to validate and revise existing questions. The weakness of these methods is that they start from the researcher\u2019s initial question wording. For this test, focus groups were conducted with the target population to learn how they think about and verbalize the constructs before the SASS questions were presented to them. The research focused on the proposed new series of items as well as existing questions on overcrowding, the free- and reduced-price school lunch program, staffing, average daily attendance, Title I programs, and participation in SASS. For details on methodology and complete findings, see \u201cAppendix G. Report on SASS Focus Groups.\u201d\nMethods\nFour focus groups were conducted in March 2003 to understand respondents\u2019 perspectives on these issues. Two groups contained principals and two other groups were comprised of what SASS defines as \u201cother knowledgeable persons\u201d (usually school secretaries). A trained facilitator moderated the focus groups. Participants were recruited from multiple school systems in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. Participants were provided an incentive for participating in the research.\nKey Findings\n\u2022 Gaining support from the district and providing an incentive are likely to increase participation. \u2022 The term \u201cparaprofessional\u201d was not interpreted universally. \u2022 As indicators of overcrowding in a school, participants recommended asking whether\nnoninstructional areas are used for instruction or portable facilities are used for classroom space and how many teachers are without a classroom. \u2022 Some aspects of teacher hiring and firing are handled at the district level and should be moved to that questionnaire. \u2022 Participants were not able to answer questions on the number of students eligible for the free- or reduced-price lunch program. However, participants could easily provide the number of students receiving free- or reduced-price lunch. \u2022 Principals are more accurately able to provide information on Title I than other knowledgeable respondents, suggesting that these items should be moved to the principal questionnaire.\nSchool Questionnaire\nQuestions for the school questionnaire were revised based on focus group findings. An additional study was conducted to evaluate the revisions. The test used a modified version of the school questionnaire that omitted items on student and staffing counts by race. Interviews focused on the revised items related to average daily attendance, limited-English-proficiency students, and measures of school overcrowding as well as the pre-existing school questionnaire items. For complete methods and findings, please see \u201cAppendix H. Results of the Cognitive Pretest on SASS Public School Questions.\u201d\nMethods\nDuring March and April 2003, 12 cognitive style interviews with public school principals were conducted. A trained interviewer followed a protocol and utilized concurrent think-aloud and retrospective probing techniques for this study. Respondents received an incentive for participating in this study.\n\n\fChapter 3. Preparation for the 2003\u201304 SASS 49\n\nKey Findings\n\n\u2022 Respondents were better able to report the school\u2019s average daily attendance as a percentage than as the number of students present.\n\u2022 Emphasis on transitional grades led respondents to underreport the presence of kindergarten. \u2022 Guidelines for determining school capacity change over time, so the question should probe for\nspecific measures, such as current capacity of the building, presence of temporary buildings, and number of classrooms. \u2022 Some items, such as drug and violence prevention programs, would be more appropriate on the principal questionnaire. \u2022 The series on academic intersessions should be revised to improve the reference period and clarify eligible populations.\n\nPrincipal Questionnaire\n\nFollowing the focus groups, items on state and district performance standards, time use, and professional development were revised. A small-scale test was conducted to ensure that respondents could accurately respond to the revised items. For complete details and findings, see \u201cAppendix I. Report on a Follow-up Cognitive Testing to Select 2003\u201304 SASS Principal Items.\u201d\n\nMethods\n\nIn order to test proposed revisions to the principal questionnaire, a small-scale qualitative study was conducted during March 2003. Low and high performing schools were identified through state and district internet sites. Principals were contacted by phone and asked if they would be willing to participate in a brief telephone interview. A total of four principals agreed to participate in this study and set an appointment to talk with an interviewer (table 2). The study questions were faxed to principals in advance of the interview. At the scheduled times, the interviewer contacted the principals and asked them to read aloud and think-aloud as they answered each question. The interviewer probed following a protocol. Principals were sent a copy of the Schools and Staffing Survey, 1999\u20132000: Overview of the Data for Public, Private, Public Charter, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Elementary and Secondary Schools (NCES 2002-313) as an incentive for participation. This was a small-scale qualitative study, and caution should be used in interpreting the findings.\n\nTable 2.

Complete details on the research can be found in \u201cAppendix J. Results of the Cognitive Pretest on SASS School Library Media Center Questions.\u201d\nMethods\nSchools were contacted by phone and asked if their librarian would participate in the study. When contact was established with the school librarian, he or she was asked the following questions:\n\u2022 Are you familiar with the term information literacy? \u2022 What does information literacy mean to you?\nA questionnaire was then faxed to the school and an appointment was set for the researcher to call the librarian directly. A concurrent interview was conducted by phone following a structured protocol. The interviewer was free to deviate from the protocol as required. Interviews lasted 25 to 98 minutes. Librarians were offered a copy of the Schools and Staffing Survey, 1999\u20132000: Overview of the data for Public, Private, Public Charter, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Elementary and Secondary Schools (NCES 2002-313) as an incentive for participation.\nKey Findings\n\u2022 Respondents did not interpret the term \u201cinformation literacy\u201d in a uniform manner. \u2022 All respondents had trouble answering budget questions for computer hardware and audiovisual\nequipment. \u2022 Most respondents confused specific questions about information literacy in standardized testing\nwith general standardized testing. \u2022 Some items in the scheduling table were either not applicable to respondents or needed\nclarification.\n\n\f51\nChapter 4. SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures\nThis chapter discusses how the sampling frame was created and how cases were sampled for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). The first major section discusses the creation of the frame for public and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funded schools, including schools deleted, added, and otherwise edited. Next, the public and BIA-funded school sampling procedure is described. This is followed by the district sampling, which is simply a by-product of the school sampling. The next major section covers the private school frame creation and sampling. The final major section discusses teacher sampling.\nPublic and BIA-Funded School Sampling Frame and Sample Selection\nPublic and BIA Frame Creation\nThe foundation for the 2003\u201304 SASS public and BIA-funded school frame was the 2001\u201302 Common Core of Data (CCD) file. CCD is based on survey data collected annually by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) from each state education agency. For the 2001\u201302 school year, state education agencies used their administrative record data to report information for 97,623 schools. NCES and the state education agencies worked cooperatively to ensure comparability between the elements reported. CCD is believed to be the most complete public school listing available. The frame includes regular and nonregular schools (special education, alternative, vocational, or technical), public charter schools, and BIA-funded schools.\nDue to an accelerated survey schedule, the preliminary 2001\u201302 CCD file was used as the basis for the SASS sampling frame rather than the final version. When the final CCD file became available, the two files were compared and any major updates were added to the frame. The updates that were added consisted of school locale codes and public charter school flags.\nIn SASS, a school was defined as an institution or part of an institution that provides classroom instruction to students; has one or more teachers to provide instruction; serves students in one or more grades (1\u201312) or the ungraded equivalent and is located in one or more buildings. It was possible for two or more schools to share the same building; in this case they were treated as different schools if they had different administrations (i.e., principals).\nThe SASS definition of a school was generally similar to CCD with some exceptions. CCD included some schools that did not offer teacher-provided classroom instruction that included academic subjects in grades 1\u201312 or the equivalent ungraded. In some instances, schools in CCD were essentially administrative units that may have overseen entities that provided classroom instruction, or the school on CCD may have provided funding and oversight only. SASS collapsed CCD schools where the location, address, and phone number were the same on the assumption that the respondent would consider this to be all one school. (Further discussion of this issue is provided later in this Public and BIA Frame Creation section\u2014see the \u201cSchool Collapsing\u201d subsection.) CCD required only that schools have an assigned administrator, but since SASS allowed schools to define themselves, Census Bureau staff observed that schools generally reported as one entity in situations where the administration of two or more schools on CCD was the same. SASS was confined to the 50 states plus the District of Columbia and excluded territories and overseas schools.\n\n\f52 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nTo illustrate, some examples of the differences between SASS and CCD are presented below:\n\u2022 In California, CCD listed the special education program at each county office of education as a school, whereas SASS tried to determine which special education programs were operated by each office.\n\u2022 Homebound school programs that are publicly-supported were included in CCD but not SASS. \u2022 Schools overseas that are operated by the Department of Defense (DoD) were included in CCD\nbut not in SASS. \u2022 Multiple CCD schools at the same address and with the same phone number were considered one\nschool in SASS. \u2022 Multiple CCD schools each with a unique administrator who reports to the high school principal\nwere considered one school in SASS if the respondent said the school covered multiple CCD grade ranges.\nFrame Deletions\nSince CCD and SASS differ in scope and their definition of a school, some records were deleted, added, or modified in order to provide better coverage and a more efficient sample design for SASS. The following types of school records were deleted from the CCD during the creation of the SASS sampling frame:\n\u2022 There were 1,413 schools that were closed as of the 2001\u201302 school year and deleted from the frame. These schools were identified by the status code found on the CCD file. They are carried on the CCD for one additional year for completeness but are clearly designated as not operating.\n\u2022 There were 1,851 schools located outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia that were deleted. These schools were identified as having a Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) state code of 58 (overseas DoD), 60 (American Samoa), 66 (Guam), 69 (Northern Marianas), 72 (Puerto Rico), or 78 (U.S. Virgin Islands).\n\u2022 There were 250 Home School or Homebound school programs that were deleted. These schools and programs were clerically identified from a list of schools from CCD that had \u201cHOME SCHOOL\u201d or \u201cHOMEBOUND\u201d in the name. Since they did not provide classroom instruction, they were not eligible for SASS.\n\u2022 Twelve BIA-funded dormitories that were listed on CCD as schools were deleted. These schools were identified by comparing the 1999\u20132000 SASS BIA-funded schools to the current CCD list of BIA-funded schools. These dormitories exist in support of BIA-funded schools but do not actually provide instruction.\n\u2022 Ten regular public schools that were also listed as BIA-funded schools were deleted. These schools were identified during the above BIA comparison. Since they were duplicated between the BIA-funded list and the state-funded list, the public school record was deleted to ensure each case would have only one chance of selection.\n\u2022 Twenty-four schools reported as closed or not providing classroom instruction were deleted when contacted for other reasons, such as to obtain grade range where it was missing.\n\u2022 There were 124 school records that were actually administrative units in California and Pennsylvania that were deleted. Schools operated by these administrative units were subsequently added as described in the upcoming subsection on frame additions. These records were clerically identified based on previous experience. Pennsylvania records that had the term \u201cPenn Department of Data Services\u201d in the school name were deleted. California records were deleted if they had \u201cCounty Office of Education\u201d as part of the district name or \u201cSpecial Education,\u201d \u201cJuvenile,\u201d \u201cCommunity,\u201d \u201cAlternative,\u201d or \u201cOpportunity\u201d as part of the school name and were associated with a county office of education on the district file.\n\n\fChapter 4. SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures 53\no These records were deleted from the school file because they were not schools but were offices that oversaw certain types of education within the county. This type of education is often provided at a number of locations within a particular county, but not necessarily at schools listed on CCD. To avoid confusion, these records were taken off the school file, contacted by phone, and requested to provide a list of the schools they oversaw. These lists were subsequently matched to CCD. If any of the schools from these lists were not already on CCD, they were added at that time.\n\u2022 There were 1,361 schools that offered kindergarten or less as the highest grade that were deleted. These schools were identified using the school\u2019s highest grade offered as provided on CCD.\nSchool Collapsing\nThere were 2,872 school records that were \u201ccollapsed\u201d into other school records at the building level and deleted. Past data collections have shown that there are sampled schools that report survey data for the entire building when there is one head principal instead of reporting only for the part of the school that has been sampled. This issue occurs most often in certain states, in rural areas, or in schools that offer grades K\u201312 in the same building with one head principal. The problem lies in the conflicting definition of a school as held by the schools themselves and as reported by states to CCD. The schools often consider themselves one cohesive unit while the state does not. For accounting or other administrative purposes, the states artificially split these schools by grade level and report them as two or three separate schools.\nIf a CCD school within the associated school districts is selected for SASS, then the school often reports for all of grades K\u201312. This has caused substantial overreporting in SASS reports of state aggregates, such as enrollment and teacher counts, because these schools were sampled based on the particular grade range as reported on CCD but these schools then responded based on a much broader grade range (matching how they perceived themselves). In other words, these schools had unrecognized multiple chances of selection for sampling. The unrecognized chances of selection refer to the fact that regardless of which CCD record in the building was selected, the school was likely to report for the whole. Thus, the entity that reports could be selected via multiple CCD records. In the past, SASS data were edited after the field data collection to conform to the CCD grade range. This method was costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, many school respondents have reported they do not keep records at the school level as reported on CCD, making it difficult for them to respond to SASS in this manner. For this reason, it was decided for 2003\u201304 SASS to collapse the CCD records whenever it was believed that this problem was likely to occur.\nThe Census Bureau and NCES jointly determined a set of rules for school collapsing to apply during frame creation. In order to make the sampling frame more consistent with the school\u2019s actual grade range, these potential problem schools were identified and collapsed to the appropriate building level. When the school records were collapsed together, the student and teacher counts, grade range, and name as reported to CCD were all modified to reflect the change. The complete set of collapsing rules and the results of the procedure are presented in \u201cAppendix K. Details of SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures.\u201d\nFrame Additions\nThe following types of school records were added to the original CCD while creating the SASS sampling frame:\n\n\f54 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\n\u2022 Thirteen records that were listed on CCD as districts with no associated school records were determined to be newly-opened schools, based on the name, teacher, and enrollment counts, and were added.\n\u2022 A total of 520 school records, primarily alternative, special education, and juvenile justice facilities, identified by contacting the deleted county or regional administrative units in California (415 schools) and Pennsylvania (105 schools), were also added.\n\nAfter the addition, deletion, and collapsing of school records, the SASS school sampling frame consisted of 87,764 traditional public, 2,309 public charter, and 166 BIA-funded schools. From this point on, this is considered the 2003\u201304 SASS public school sampling frame. Table 3 shows the totals by state during each step in the frame creation process.\n\nTable 3.

Using this file required the correction of variables necessary for sampling or conducting the survey, such as grade range, enrollment, teacher count, enrollment by race, school county code, school name, address information, and phone number. The following section outlines the steps taken to correct those variables.\n\n\f56 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nIf the school\u2019s grade range was missing from the CCD file, three methods were applied, in the following hierarchical order, to resolve the issue:\n\u2022 taking data from earlier CCD files or SASS data; \u2022 assigning a generic grade range based on the school\u2019s name; or \u2022 calling the school for clarification. NOTE: During this calling process a few schools were\ndiscovered to be closed or otherwise out-of-scope and were deleted from the sampling frame, as described in the prior \u201cFrame Deletions\u201d subsection.\nThe student and teacher counts were imputed for those schools missing this information by applying one of the methods listed below, in the following hierarchical order:\n\u2022 pulling information from previous CCD data for that school; \u2022 extrapolating from current CCD student-teacher ratios and averages for the state; or \u2022 using data that were collected in the 1999\u20132000 SASS for that particular school.\nNOTE: BIA-funded schools as well as the state education agencies in Massachusetts and Tennessee did not report teacher counts to CCD for any schools in 2001\u201302.\nThe enrollment by race information was used to identify the schools in which American Indian or Alaska Native students composed at least 19.5 percent of the enrollment. These schools were sampled at a different rate than other public schools, so they needed to be identified during the SASS frame creation. These schools were identified using one of the following methods:\n\u2022 examining the current CCD enrollment by race information, if present; \u2022 examining previous CCD enrollment by race information; or \u2022 reviewing the characteristics of the surrounding schools. If most of the surrounding schools in the\ncounty were flagged as having a high American Indian or Alaska Native enrollment, the school in question was also flagged.\nAnother important component used in conducting SASS was the school\u2019s physical location. The sampled schools were grouped by location and then broken into smaller segments (workloads) and assigned to an individual field representative to contact. The county information was not available on the school file, but was on the school district file. The county information was copied onto the record of the appropriate schools and then compared to the school\u2019s location ZIP code. This comparison was done because it is possible for the school and its associated district to be in different counties. If the county information was not valid for that particular ZIP code, it was corrected to reflect the school\u2019s physical location.\nIn instances where the school name implied considerably fewer grades than it actually offered, the name was modified to eliminate inappropriate descriptions. These schools were identified by comparing the school\u2019s name to the grades currently offered. If the name differed considerably from the grade range (e.g., the name contained \u201cHigh School,\u201d but the grades offered were K\u201312), then the name was modified accordingly.\nDue to time constraints, missing address information and phone numbers were filled in after the school sample was selected. These fields were not crucial to the selection of the school sample.\n\n\fChapter 4. SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures 57\n\nDistrict Frame Creation\n\nThe public school district frame consisted of those districts that were operating within the United States and that oversaw at least one school on the 2003\u201304 SASS school universe file. The 2001\u201302 CCD included 17,276 district records, of which 16,042 were presumed to be eligible for SASS according to these rules. The following types of records were deleted from the 2001\u201302 CCD district file:\n\n\u2022 the 18 districts listed on the CCD file that operated outside of the United States; \u2022 the 24 BIA regional offices that did not meet the SASS definition of a school district\u2014while they\ndo provide funding to the schools, they often are not involved in hiring, firing, or setting policies; and \u2022 districts on the CCD file that were presumed not to operate schools. Comparing the district file to the school file identified these records. There were 1,192 districts without at least one corresponding school that were deleted from the file.\n\nTable 4 shows the state totals for all districts by state during the frame creation.\n\nTable 4.

SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures 59\n\u2022 Use the 2001\u201302 CCD school file as the sample frame with exceptions noted in the previous \u201cPublic and BIA Frame Creation\u201d section.\n\u2022 Produce state estimates of public school characteristics. \u2022 Produce state/elementary and state/secondary estimates of the number of public schools and\nassociated public school characteristics. \u2022 Produce national estimates of combined-grade public schools, meaning schools that offer grades\nthat span both elementary and secondary levels. \u2022 Produce national estimates by various geographic (e.g., region and locale) and school\ncharacteristics for public schools. \u2022 Minimize the overlap between the 2003\u201304 SASS and the 2004 follow-up of the Education\nLongitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) in order to reduce respondent burden. \u2022 Oversample schools with 19.5 percent or greater American Indian or Alaska Native enrollment,\nin order to be able to produce national estimates of these schools and selected school characteristics. \u2022 Produce national and regional estimates of public charter schools and selected school characteristics. \u2022 Select all BIA-funded schools.\nMethodology\nThe SASS sample is not a simple random sample, but rather is a stratified probability proportionate to size sample. The first level of stratification for public and BIA-funded schools was school type: (A) BIAfunded schools were selected with certainty (automatically in sample); (B) schools with high American Indian or Alaska Native student enrollment (schools with 19.5 percent or more American Indian or Alaska Native students); (C) schools in Delaware, Maryland, Florida, Nevada, and West Virginia, where at least one school from each district in the state was selected as described in the following \u201cSample Selection\u201d section; (D) public charter schools; and (E) all other schools. Schools falling into more than one category were assigned to types A, B, D, C, and E in that order.\nThe second level of stratification varied within school type. All of the type A schools were selected for the sample so no additional stratification was needed. Type B schools were stratified by state (Arizona, California, Montana, New Mexico, Washington, the remaining Western states, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, the remaining Midwestern states, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and the remaining states except Alaska10). Type C schools were stratified first by state and then school district. Type D schools were stratified by state (Arizona, California, Colorado, the remaining Western states, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, the remaining Midwestern states, Florida, North Carolina, Texas, the remaining Southern states, Pennsylvania, and the remaining Northeastern states). The type E schools were stratified by state (all remaining states including the District of Columbia).\nEach of school types B through E was then stratified by grade level (elementary, secondary, and combined) as defined below:\nElementary = lowest grade \u2264 6 and highest grade \u2264 8; Secondary = lowest grade \u2265 7 and highest grade \u2264 12; and Combined = lowest grade \u2264 6 and highest grade > 8, or school is ungraded.\n10 Alaska was excluded because most schools have a high Alaska Native enrollment and because the sampling rate applied to Alaska schools was higher than the sampling rate applied to other schools with high American Indian or Alaska Native student enrollment.\n\n\f60 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nThe 2003\u201304 SASS sample was allocated so that state-level elementary and secondary public school estimates and national estimates of combined public schools could be made. The sample was allocated to each state by grade range and school type (traditional public, public charter, and schools with high American Indian enrollment). A full description of the allocation procedure is located in \u201cAppendix K. Details of SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures.\u201d\nSample Sort\nTo facilitate the calculation of school district weights, it was important that within a stratum all schools belonging to the same school district were listed together. This could have been achieved by sorting first by the school district\u2019s identification variable (LEA ID). However, to increase the efficiency of the school sample design, it was better to sort by other variables before LEA ID. To achieve both these goals, the ZIP code variables were recoded to make them the same for every school within a stratum/school district. After the ZIP code was recoded, the non-BIA-funded schools were sorted by the following variables:\n1. School Stratum code as defined in the \u201cMethodology\u201d subsection above 2. State 3. Locale code\n1 = large central city 2 = midsize central city 3 = urban fringe of large central city 4 = urban fringe of mid-size central city 5 = large town 6 = small town 7 = rural, outside Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) 8 = rural, inside MSA 4. Recoded ZIP code (all schools in stratum/district have the same value for this variable) 5. District ID as defined on CCD 6. School\u2019s highest grade offered (in descending order) 7. Recoded percent minority enrollment (in descending order) and defined as: 1 = less than 5.5 percent minority enrollment or unknown 2 = at least 5.5 percent but less than 20.5 percent minority enrollment 3 = at least 20.5 percent but less than 50.5 percent minority enrollment 4 = at least 50.5 percent minority enrollment 8. Total enrollment (in serpentine sort order, which was defined as enrollment being sorted first in ascending then descending order within the other sort variables) 9. CCD school ID\nThis sort order differed slightly from the sort used in previous SASS administrations. A discussion of the steps taken to determine the sort order for the non-BIA-funded schools is listed in \u201cAppendix K. Details of SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures.\u201d The first four variables allowed a geographic balance to be achieved within locale for each state. The fifth variable guaranteed that schools within a district and school stratum stayed together. The sixth variable (school\u2019s highest grade) allowed the sample size requirements for middle schools to be met. Since middle schools were not stratified explicitly into one grade level stratum, some of them were classified as elementary and some as secondary. To better control the actual number of middle schools selected, this sort achieved that aim by placing middle schools at the end of the secondary stratum and at the beginning of the elementary school stratum. The seventh variable (recoded minority) allowed a balance with respect to ethnicity. The eighth variable (school enrollment) also encouraged a balance with respect to school size.\n\n\fChapter 4. SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures 61\n\nSample Selection\n\nSchools\n\nWithin each stratum, all non-BIA-funded schools were systematically selected using a probability proportionate to size algorithm. The measure of size used for the schools was the square root of the number of full-time-equivalent teachers reported for each school or imputed during sampling frame creation. Any school with a measure of size greater than the sampling interval (the inverse of the rate at which the sample is selected) was included in the sample with certainty and automatically excluded from the probability sampling operation. The BIA-funded schools were also selected for the sample with certainty. This produced a non-BIA-funded school sample of 10,202 (455 high American Indian enrollment schools, 303 public charter schools, and 9,444 other traditional public schools) and a BIAfunded school sample of 166 schools for a total of 10,368 sampled public and BIA-funded schools in 2003\u201304 SASS.11\n\nTable 5 shows both the allocated and selected sample sizes for traditional public schools (excludes public charter, high American Indian or Alaska Native enrollment, and BIA-funded schools). The public charter and high American Indian or Alaska Native enrollment schools are listed in subsequent tables (tables 6 and 7). The difference in these two sample sizes is attributable to the use of conditional probabilities of selection to achieve the minimization of overlap with ELS as described in \u201cAppendix K.

Districts in five states were selected differently than those in the remaining states, so the sampling procedure for most states is described first followed by the sampling procedure for the exceptional states.\n1. Districts outside Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and West Virginia. During the initial design development of SASS, consideration was given to selecting the school districts first and then selecting schools within these districts. It was hypothesized that doing this would reduce the reliability of both school and teacher estimates but might be offset by the improvement in reliability of school district estimates. Simulations done on the reliability of school district estimates when the districts were selected first confirmed the loss of reliability in school and teacher estimates. The simulations also showed that selecting schools first would produce only slightly less accurate district estimates. For these reasons the SASS sample design selects the schools first.\nTherefore, the school district sample consists of the set of districts that were associated with the SASS public school sample. This provides the linkage between the district and the school. Table 8 provides the number of school districts selected by state. This can be compared with the number of districts on the frame in each state as presented earlier in table 4. Note that district totals for some states appear higher than expected due to the inclusion of public charter school districts. In parts of Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire, some of the districts were dropped and the sampled schools were instead associated with their Supervisory Unions. This was done because evidence indicated that the Supervisory Union handled the day-to-day administration of the schools rather than the school districts. There were not any districts without schools selected for the 2003\u201304 sample as had been done in some previous SASS cycles since most of these districts did not have associated teachers, and thus were ineligible for the survey.\n2. Districts inside Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and West Virginia. In 2003, a simulation study was done for each state to assess the reliability of SASS school district estimates. The complete results of this study are presented in \u201cAppendix K. Details of SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures.\u201d The study showed that standard errors from Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and West Virginia were high relative to the sampling rate. To reduce the standard error, all districts in these states were defined as school sampling strata. This placed all districts in each of these five states in the school district sample thus reducing the standard error to zero, if all districts respond.\n\n\fChapter 4.

The SASS private school sample size was 3,622 of which 3,443 schools were from the list frame and 179 were from the area frame. The area frame serves as coverage improvement since the list frame omits about 8 percent of eligible private schools.\n\nList Frame\n\nMost of the SASS private school sample comes from a list frame, which is a frame constructed from matching lists of private schools. The base list for the 2003\u201304 SASS list frame was the 2001\u201302 Private School Universe Survey (PSS). In order to provide coverage of private schools founded since 2001 and to\n\n\f66 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nimprove coverage of private schools existing in 2001, membership lists were collected from private school associations and religious denominations. The associations were asked to include schools that met the PSS school definition when they provided lists. The 50 states and the District of Columbia were also asked to provide lists of private schools meeting the PSS definition of a school. Schools on private school association membership lists and the state lists were compared to the base list. Any school that did not match a school on the base list was added to the existing list frame as a list frame birth. This is the usual method that is followed to create a revised PSS list frame every 2 years.\nThis updating process was conducted specifically for the 2003\u201304 PSS, but was used as the starting point for the sampling frame for SASS private schools. To create the SASS sampling frame, schools with a highest grade of kindergarten, which are schools by the PSS definition but not the SASS definition, were deleted.\nArea Frame\nThe source for the 2003\u201304 SASS area frame schools was the 2001\u201302 PSS area frame, excluding schools with a highest grade of kindergarten. To create the 2001\u201302 PSS area frame, the United States was divided into 2,054 primary sampling units (PSUs). Each PSU consisted of a single county, independent city, or cluster of geographically contiguous areas with a minimum population of 20,000 according to population projections for 1988, which was when the PSUs were first formed. To avoid having PSUs covering too large a land area, the minimum population standard was relaxed in sparselypopulated areas.\nDue to time constraints, the Census Bureau did not have time to wait for the 2003\u201304 PSS area frame schools to be identified. The PSS area frame operation was conducted several weeks after data collection began for SASS. The 2003\u201304 SASS area frame consists only of those schools in noncertainty PSUs in the 2001\u201302 PSS area frame that had not already been added to the 2003\u201304 PSS list frame as part of the 2003\u201304 PSS list frame updating operation (described in the \u201cList Frame\u201d section above). Noncertainty PSUs are those counties not guaranteed to be included in the PSS area frame and thus subject to a random sampling process. Schools from the noncertainty PSUs in the 2001\u201302 PSS area frame that were also 2003\u201304 PSS list frame births were identified and dropped from the area frame. Schools that could be defined as only teaching kindergarten as the highest grade, or only teaching adult education or postsecondary, were also removed from the frame.\nUsing these PSUs, the 2001\u201302 PSS area frame was designed to produce approximately 50 percent overlap with the previous PSS. By maintaining a 50 percent overlap of PSUs, the reliability of estimates of change was maintained at a reasonable level. Consequently, the area frame consisted of two sets of sample PSUs: 1) a subsample of the 1999\u20132000 PSS area frame sample PSUs (overlap); and 2) a sample of PSUs selected independently from the 1999\u20132000 PSS sample (nonoverlap).\nA total of 124 distinct PSUs were in the 2001\u201302 PSS area sample. The eight PSUs (certainty PSUs) that are included in every PSS area sample remained in the 2001\u201302 PSS area frame with certainty. All 58 PSUs that had been in the 1999\u20132000 PSS area frame for the first time and not previously included in the overlap sample were selected again for the 2001\u201302 PSS, resulting in a total overlap sample of 66 PSUs. An additional 58 PSUs were selected independently.\nThe strata for selecting the nonoverlap PSUs were defined the same as the 1999\u20132000 PSS area frame design. Initially, 16 strata were created as had been done for prior cycles of PSS. The strata include region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West), metro/nonmetro status, and high/low percent private enrollment within metro/nonmetro status (i.e., above or below the median within each metro/nonmetro status). The high/low cutoffs were then adjusted so as to more nearly equalize the expected variance between the two\n\n\fChapter 4. SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures 67\nstrata. The purpose of this was to try to lower the PSS or SASS standard errors resulting from the PSU sampling.\nSample sizes were determined for each metro/nonmetro status within each region, proportional to the sum of the square root of the PSU-estimated PSS private school enrollment. Some adjustments were made so that each sample size was an even number and that sample size was evenly distributed between the high and low percent private enrollment groups. This was done in order to have an even number of cases in each stratum (with a minimum of two) for pairing purposes for the PSS or SASS variance estimation.\nWithin each of the 124 PSUs, the Census Bureau attempted to find all private schools eligible for PSS. A block-by-block listing of all private schools in a sample of PSUs was not attempted. Rather, Regional Office field staff created the frame by using yellow pages, local Catholic dioceses, religious institutions, local education agencies, and local government offices. Once the area search lists of schools were constructed, they were matched with the PSS list frame school universe. Schools not found on the list frame were considered part of the area frame.\nComplete Private School Frame Creation\nThe list and area frames were combined to create the complete frame. At this point, the frame still contained ineligible school records and records that were missing vital information.\nFrame Deletions\nThe following types of records were deleted from the PSS list and area frames to create the SASS sample frames:\n\u2022 schools not previously appearing on the 2003\u201304 list frame (births) that were identified from the early childhood center frame (a PSS operation whereby states are specifically asked for schools with kindergarten as the highest grade);\n\u2022 schools from noncertainty PSUs of the 2001\u201302 PSS area frame that were added to the 2003\u201304 PSS list frame;\n\u2022 schools with kindergarten as the highest grade level; and \u2022 schools that were determined to be out-of-scope for the 2001\u201302 PSS (i.e., closed,\nprekindergarten only, not providing classroom instruction).\nFrame Corrections\nThere were several school records that were missing information needed during the school sample selection. The school grade range and affiliation variables were used in stratifying schools during the private school sampling process. The number of teachers was used to form the measure of size in the private school sampling process. Finally, the number of students was used in sorting private school records during sampling. Values were assigned for any of these fields if the data were missing in the manner discussed below.\nThe school\u2019s grade range was assigned in one of four ways:\n\u2022 taking information from earlier PSS data; \u2022 using the school\u2019s name to assign a generic grade range; \u2022 calling the school to assign a specific grade range; or \u2022 assigning a grade level of combined (both elementary and secondary levels), as a last resort.\n\n\f68 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nThe school\u2019s affiliation stratum was assigned by\n\u2022 using information from earlier PSS data; \u2022 using the school\u2019s name to assign an affiliation stratum; and \u2022 assigning the rest to the \u201cAll Other\u201d category.\nThe school\u2019s student and teacher counts were imputed in the following ways:\n\u2022 using previous PSS data for that school; and \u2022 using current SASS frame student-teacher ratios and averages by grade level and affiliation strata.\nSample Allocation\nThe goals for the 2003\u201304 SASS private school sample size allocation for the most part remained the same as the 1999\u20132000 goals:\n\u2022 Produce detailed private school affiliation strata estimates for each of the 17 affiliations. (NOTE: Some new affiliations were added to the list since 1999\u20132000 and some others were deleted, changing the total number of affiliations from 20 to 17.)\n\u2022 Produce national private sector estimates. \u2022 Produce national private sector school level estimates. \u2022 Produce estimates for national public versus private sector comparisons.\nThe affiliation strata were redefined so as to create larger groups that would more readily lend themselves to publication. Catholic schools were split by parochial, diocesan, and private. Other religious schools were reorganized into 11 groups corresponding to the 11 largest religious affiliations. Nonsectarian schools were split by regular, special emphasis, and special education.\nList Frame Methodology\nThe list frame was partitioned into an initial set of cells using affiliation stratum (17 groups), grade level (three groups), and Census region (four groups). These cells were defined using the 2001\u201302 PSS data. For any variables with missing values for variables used in the assignment, the data were imputed.\nThe first level of stratification was school affiliation stratum (17 groups):\n\u2022 Catholic\u2014parochial; \u2022 Catholic\u2014diocesan; \u2022 Catholic\u2014private; \u2022 Amish; \u2022 Assembly of God; \u2022 Baptist; \u2022 Episcopal; \u2022 Jewish; \u2022 Lutheran Church\u2014Missouri Synod; \u2022 Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod; \u2022 Mennonite; \u2022 Pentecostal; \u2022 Seventh-Day Adventist;\n\n\fChapter 4. SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures 69 \u2022 other religious; \u2022 nonsectarian\u2014regular; \u2022 nonsectarian\u2014special emphasis; and \u2022 nonsectarian\u2014special education. Within each affiliation stratum, schools were stratified by grade level (elementary, secondary, and combined schools). The definitions are provided below:\nElementary = lowest grade \u2264 6 and highest grade \u2264 8; Secondary = lowest grade \u2265 7 and highest grade \u2264 12; and Combined = lowest grade \u2264 6 and highest grade > 8, also includes ungraded schools.12 Within affiliation stratum/grade level, schools were stratified by four Census regions: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. The private school sample size selected from the list frame was 3,443 schools. The goal was to select an overall sample of 3,421 private sample schools from the list frame. This difference can be explained by the school\u2019s conditional probability of selection used to minimize the overlapping sample schools with other surveys. This procedure introduces some variability into the sample size, which can result in a sample size slightly larger or smaller than the allocated sample size. The allocation process consists of the steps outlined in \u201cAppendix K.

SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures 71\nList Frame Sample Sort\nWithin each stratum, sorting took place on the variables listed below. Sorting serves to improve the efficiency of the overall design.\n1. State (one for each state and the District of Columbia) 2. Highest grade in the school 3. Locale code based on 1990 Census geography\n1 = large central city 2 = mid-size central city 3 = urban fringe of large city 4 = urban fringe of mid-size city 5 = large town 6 = small town 7 = rural, outside Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) 8 = rural, inside MSA 4. ZIP code 5. Enrollment as reported in the 2001\u201302 PSS (or imputed) 6. PIN number (the PIN number is a unique number assigned to identify the school on PSS)\nArea Frame\nThere were 179 area frame schools identified in the 2001\u201302 PSS area frame within noncertainty PSUs that had not already been added as part of the 2003\u201304 PSS list frame updating operation. All 179 area frame cases (in the noncertainty PSUs) remained in the area frame and were in sample.\nSample Selection\nList Frame\nWithin each stratum, private schools in the list frame were systematically selected using a probability proportionate to size algorithm. The measure of size used was the square root of the 2000\u201301 PSS number of teachers in the school. Any school with a measure of size larger than the sampling interval was excluded from the probability sampling process and included in the sample with certainty.13\nTable 10 shows the number of private schools that were allocated for sampling from the list frame, the number of schools actually sampled, and the percentage of the frame that was sampled for each affiliation stratum. Table 11 shows the number of private schools sampled from the list frame by school level and Census region as well as the percentage of the frame that was sampled within these categories.\n13 After the certainty schools were removed, the sampling interval was recalculated as the sum of the measures of size of the noncertainty schools divided by the desired remaining sample (the stratum total sample size minus the number of certainty schools). The noncertainty schools\u2019 probabilities were then calculated as the measure of size divided by the new sampling interval.\n\n\f72 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable 10.

SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures 73\nSASS Teacher Frame and Sample Selection\nFrame Creation\nIn previous SASS administrations, sampled schools were asked to provide a list of their teachers primarily by mail. This accumulated list of teacher rosters formed the teacher sampling frame. For the 2003\u201304 SASS, sampled schools provided teacher rosters to field representatives during personal visits. The field representatives keyed the roster information into a laptop and teachers were selected from each cooperating sampled school, sometimes during the same personal visit.\nAlong with the names of its teachers, sampled schools were asked to provide the following descriptive characteristics of each teacher:\n\u2022 New/Experienced. Teachers in their 1st, 2nd, or 3rd year of teaching were classified as new teachers.\n\u2022 Teaching status: o Part time; or o Full time.\n\u2022 Race/Ethnicity: o White (non-Hispanic); o Black (non-Hispanic); o Hispanic\u2014regardless of race; o Asian or Pacific Islander; or o American Indian or Alaska Native.\n\u2022 Subject matter taught. Teachers were classified as special education, general elementary, math, science, English/language arts, social studies, vocational/technical, or other.\nStratification\nWithin each sample school, teachers were stratified into one of four teacher types in the following hierarchical order:\n1. Asian or Pacific Islander; 2. American Indian or Alaska Native; 3. New (3 years or fewer in the teaching profession); and 4. Experienced (more than 3 years of teaching).\nTo illustrate the hierarchical ordering, if a teacher was both new and Asian, that teacher would be classified as Asian.\nSample Allocation\nThe goals of the teacher sampling were as follows:\n\u2022 Select at least 1,600 Asian or Pacific Islander teachers and 1,600 American Indian or Alaska Native teachers.\n\u2022 Select a minimum of 2,300 new teachers by sector. For new teachers in public schools, oversampling was not required due to the large number of sampled schools with new teachers. Therefore, teachers were allocated to the new and experienced categories proportional to their numbers in the school. However, for private school teachers, new teachers were oversampled to\n\n\f74 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nensure that there would be enough new private school teachers in both the 2003\u201304 SASS and the 2004\u201305 Teacher Follow-up Survey. In private schools, new teachers were oversampled by a factor of 1.5. \u2022 Select a minimum of one and a maximum of 20 teachers per school. \u2022 Minimize the variance of teacher estimates within school stratum by attempting a self-weighting design. This constraint was relaxed to accommodate the other goals of teacher sampling. \u2022 Select an average of three to eight teachers per school depending upon grade range and sector. The average teacher sample size was limited to this to avoid overburdening the schools, while allowing for a large enough teacher sample to meet the reliability requirements.\n\nBefore teachers were allocated to the new/experienced strata, schools were first allocated an overall number of teachers to be selected. This overall sample size was chosen so as to equalize the teacher weights within school stratum (state/level for public schools, association stratum/level/region for private schools). Teacher weights within stratum were not always equalized, however, due to the differential sampling for Asian or Pacific Islander and American Indian or Alaska Native teachers.\n\nTable 12 provides the average number of new and experienced teachers to be selected within each public and private school by school level. These averages do not include Asian or Pacific Islander or American Indian or Alaska Native teachers.\n\nTable 12. Average expected number of new and experienced teachers selected per school, by school level and type: 2003\u201304\n\nSchool level\n\nSchool type\n\nElementary\n\nSecondary\n\nCombined\n\nPublic\n\n3.8\n\n7.5\n\n5.7\n\nPrivate\n\n3.8\n\n4.7\n\n2.8\n\nNOTE: These averages do not include Asian or Pacific Islander or American Indian or Alaska Native teachers.\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), 2003\u2013\n\n04.\n\nGiven the numbers in table 12, the new/experienced teacher sample size was chosen to equalize the teacher weights within a school stratum. Since the school sample was selected proportional to the square root of the number of teachers in the school, an equally-weighted teacher sample within a school stratum was obtained by selecting ti new or experienced teachers in school i.\n\nti = Wi*Ti(C/Y)\n\nwhere:\n\nWi is the school weight for school i (the inverse of the school selection probability),\n\nTi is the number of new and experienced teachers in school i, as reported on the\n\nTeacher Listing Form,\n\nC is the average teacher cluster size in the frame/grade level category (see table\n\n12); and\n\nY\n\nis the simple average of the school\u2019s base-weighted number of teachers over all\n\nschools in the school stratum.\n\nGiven the allocation of teachers, ti, teachers were allocated to the new/experienced strata, tn and tei,\n\nrespectively, in the following manner.\n\ntni = (A*Tni*ti)/(Tei+A*Tni), and\n\n\fChapter 4. SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures 75\n\ntei = (Tei*ti)/(Tei+A*Tni) where:\n\nA\n\nis the oversampling factor for new teachers (A = 1.0 for public school teachers\n\nand A = 1.5 for private school teachers);\n\nTni is the number of new teachers in school i; and\n\nTei is the number of experienced teachers in school i.\n\nThe new and experienced teacher sample sizes were constrained to force the sample size to be between one and twice the average cluster size for that type of school.\n\nThe Asian or Pacific Islander and American Indian or Alaska Native teachers were allocated in the following manner:\n\ntpi = (Wi *Tpi)/R tai = (Wi *Tai)/H\nwhere:\n\nWi is the school weight for school i (the inverse of the school selection probability);\n\nTpi is the number of Asian or Pacific Islander teachers in school i;\n\nTai is the number of American Indian or Alaska Native teachers in school i;\n\nR\n\nis the national sampling interval to ensure that at least 1,600 Asian or Pacific\n\nIslander teachers are selected nationwide (R = 17.74); and\n\nH is the national sampling interval to ensure that at least 1,600 American Indian or\n\nAlaska Native teachers are selected nationwide (H = 5.42).\n\nThe Census Bureau estimated the R and H factors conservatively so that there would be more than the designated number of oversampled teachers.\n\nTo make sure a school was not overburdened, the maximum number of teachers per school was set at 20. When the number of sample teachers exceeded 20 in a school, Asian or Pacific Islander and American Indian or Alaska Native teachers were proportionally reduced to meet the maximum requirement. In all such cases, at least five Asian or Pacific Islander or American Indian or Alaska Native teachers would have remained in sample, since the sum of the new and experienced teacher sample could not exceed 15.\n\nSample Selection\n\nTeacher records within a school were sorted by the teacher stratum code, the teacher subject code, and the teacher line number code. The teacher line number is a unique number assigned to identify the teacher within the list of teachers keyed by the field representative. Within each teacher stratum in each school, teachers were selected systematically with equal probability. Table 13 shows the actual number of teachers selected as described above.\n\n\f76 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable 13. Number of selected public and private school teachers in SASS sample, by school type and teacher stratum: 2003\u201304\n\nTeacher stratum Total\n\nTotal 63,135\n\nSchool type Public 53,188\n\nPrivate 9,947\n\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native\n\n1,530\n\n1,435\n\n95\n\nAsian or Pacific Islander\n\n1,814\n\n1,466\n\n348\n\nNew\n\n10,528\n\n8,032\n\n2,496\n\nExperienced\n\n49,263\n\n42,255\n\n7,008\n\nNOTE: Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), 2003\u2013\n\n04.\n\nThe actual sample may differ from the desired sample due to the fact that in allocating the sample, the average of the school\u2019s weighted measure of size over all schools in the school stratum was based on universe files of teacher counts from 2 years prior (CCD for public, PSS for private) instead of reported teacher counts from the school just prior to data collection. Also, the response rate for the completed Teacher Listing Forms may be somewhat different than expected, changing the number of schools from which to select sampled teachers. About 16 percent of the in-scope private schools and 11 percent of the in-scope public schools did not provide teacher lists. For these schools, no teachers were selected. A factor in the teacher weighting was used to adjust the weights to reflect the fact that some schools did not provide teacher lists. These factors may cause the overall average number of teachers per school to be slightly different than the target numbers.\n\nTo reduce the variance of teacher estimates, one goal of the teacher selection was to make the teacher sample self-weighting (i.e., equal probabilities of selection), within teacher and school stratum, but not across strata. The goal was generally met. However, since the sample size of teachers was altered due to the minimum constraint (i.e., at least one teacher per school) or maximum constraint (i.e., no more than either twice the average stratum allocation or 20 teachers per school) in some schools, this goal was not fully achieved in all schools.\n\nField Sampling Activities\n\nOnce a sample school was contacted, the grade range was verified. Occasionally, the grade range differed considerably due to a difference in the school\u2019s actual grade range and how it was reported on the sampling frame. When a considerable difference occurred, if the school reported fewer grades than expected, the sample school was considered a split and one school was randomly subsampled from the list of schools covering the expected grade range. The base weights were adjusted upward accordingly as described in chapter 9. If the school reported having more grades than expected, the respondent was interviewed, but the sampling frame was reviewed to see if the responding school corresponded to more than one sampling frame record. When this occurred, the sampled school was considered a merged school, and the base weight was adjusted downward to account for the fact that the respondent could have fallen into the sample through more than one sampling frame record.\n\n\f77\nChapter 5. Data Collection\nThe 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) utilized a field-based methodology for the principal, school, school library media center, and teacher data collection (school-level data collection). Census Bureau field representatives were responsible for all data collection at the sampled schools. The field representatives\u2019 work was coordinated by staff at 12 Census Bureau Regional Offices. The Regional Office staff was responsible for making assignments, supervising fieldwork, checking-in completed questionnaires, editing questionnaires, and implementing quality control procedures.\nThe collection of the school district data was conducted separately and accomplished first by mailout, with field representatives following up with nonrespondents. Advance work with school districts and schools was done to accommodate both collection efforts.\nAn overview of the purpose and content of each questionnaire is discussed in chapter 1. The changes in methodology from the 1999\u20132000 SASS are described in chapter 2. A brief evaluation of the field-based methodology is included at the end of this chapter.\nAdvance Work With School Districts\nSchool districts were contacted prior to the beginning of data collection for four main reasons.\nFirst, approval for conducting the SASS needed to be obtained from 77 school districts that were known to have a formal approval process in order for their schools to participate. These efforts began in February 2003 and continued throughout data collection. Depending upon the requirements of each district, a cover letter, a research application or standard proposal for research, and copies of the SASS surveys were sent to each district. The background, methods, findings, and recommendations of this operation are contained in detail in \u201cAppendix L. Report on Results of Special Contact Districts.\u201d\nSecond, school districts were verified as \u201cone-school districts,\u201d or districts having only one school. These schools received the SASS Unified School Questionnaire, which contains questions from the School Questionnaire in addition to some items from the School District Questionnaire. (See chapter 2 for a more detailed explanation of this questionnaire.) During June and July of 2003, approximately 1,300 school districts were contacted by phone. These included districts that contained only one school (after the collapsing of schools from the Common Core of Data (CCD) frame, discussed in more detail in chapter 4), districts containing only public charter schools, and districts identified to be state agencies, such as the Department of Corrections (in these cases calls were made to the schools). The intent of the calls was to identify entities that would receive the SASS Unified School Questionnaire and those that had an entity separate from the school that should receive the School District Questionnaire. The calling operation resulted in the identification of 744 one-school districts. The calls revealed that many of the state agencies did not function as \u201cdistricts,\u201d so the schools were redesignated as one-school districts. Some schools listed as one-school districts in New England states were found to be operated by \u201csupervisory unions\u201d rather than by the entity identified as the district on CCD. These \u201csupervisory unions\u201d replaced the district named by CCD on the sample file for those schools. (See chapter 4 for details.)\nThird, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) wanted to determine if other school districts had formal approval processes in order for their schools to participate in SASS. During June and July of 2003, 650 school districts were called. These efforts were the first step in a test embedded in this administration of SASS to better understand how districts respond to precontacts, and what implications this has on the cost and timing of SASS. The results of the experiment are covered in \u201cAppendix M.\n\n\f78 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nSchool District Experiment Findings.\u201d Precontacting the districts had no significant impact on district or school response rates, or on cost or timing of the data collection.\n\nFinally, NCES wanted to obtain and/or verify contact information. In August 2004, remaining school districts were called to determine the best persons to receive the School District Questionnaire and to obtain their mailing address and telephone number. The calls made to school districts during June and July of 2003 to verify one-school districts also obtained this information.\n\nTiming of School District Data Collection\n\nThe schedule for the school district data collection is presented in table 14.\n\nTable 14.

Two versions of the advance letter were used. Most school districts were sent a letter that described SASS, requested the school district\u2019s participation, provided the legislation authorizing the survey and information on confidentiality, and informed them that they would be receiving a questionnaire. This letter also informed school district personnel that a field representative would contact the sampled schools to ask for a list of teachers. A brief letter was sent to 34 school districts with research application requirements that agreed to participate during the precontact operations. This letter thanked them for agreeing to participate, provided the collection authority and confidentiality information, and informed them that they would be receiving a questionnaire and that a Census Bureau field representative would contact the sampled schools to ask for a list of teachers.\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Collection 79\nQuestionnaire Mailings and Reminder Postcards to School Districts\nThe first mailout of the School District Questionnaires to the sampled school districts was on September 23, 2003, which was 4 days after the advance letters. As with the advance letters, questionnaires were not mailed to school districts designated to receive the Unified School Questionnaire or to school districts that refused to participate during the precontact operations. The questionnaires were addressed to the contact person whose name had been provided in the advance contact, or, if no name had been provided, to the \u201cSuperintendent.\u201d The eligible respondent for the School District Questionnaire included any knowledgeable school district employee. (For some school districts, the data were provided by several staff members.)\nReminder postcards were mailed in October 2003, approximately 1 week after the initial mailout. On November 10, 2003, a second copy of the questionnaire was mailed to each school district that had not returned the original form. Another reminder postcard was mailed to them on November 17, 2003.\nNonresponse Follow-up of School Districts\nBeginning in October, refusals from the premailout contact operations were assigned to field representatives in an attempt to obtain interviews. Field staff was given an instruction manual to conduct follow-up and to check in and edit completed questionnaires.\nFrom December 8, 2003, through February 27, 2004, all nonresponding school districts were assigned to field representatives for telephone and/or personal visit follow-up. During March, follow-up of a few large school districts continued. In addition, nonresponding districts with special research requirements that indicated that they would respond during the precontact operations received additional follow-up. During March and April, some additional follow-up efforts were made selectively to increase state-level response rates.\nRegional Office staff closely tracked 298 large school districts that have a significant impact on state level estimates (e.g., refusals from these districts would undermine the estimates produced for that state). The Regional Offices assigned potential refusals to senior staff with the most experience in the refusal conversion process.\nOverview of School Data Collection\nAn advance look-up operation was conducted by field staff prior to data collection to verify school name and address information and to obtain principals\u2019 names. Beginning in September 2003, field representatives were responsible for all data collection at the sampled schools. These included\n\u2022 mailing an advance postcard to the schools; \u2022 telephoning the school and asking questions using a computer-assisted personal interviewing\n(CAPI) instrument\u2014the SASS Teacher Listing instrument\u2014to verify school information and set up appointments; \u2022 visiting the school to meet the school principal and/or other school contact person(s) to explain the 2003\u201304 SASS, to pick up a teacher roster (or make arrangements to obtain one), and to drop off the appropriate principal, school, and school library media center questionnaires; \u2022 entering the teacher roster information into the SASS Teacher Listing instrument, which selected a sample of teachers; \u2022 passing out questionnaires to the selected teachers; and \u2022 following up on all questionnaires via telephone calls and return personal visits, if needed.\n\n\f80 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nExperienced field representatives were trained by using an interactive self-study guide that covered procedures, questionnaires, and use of the laptop questionnaire for the survey. Newly hired field representatives received 2 days of classroom training covering topics in more detail.\n\nAdvance Work With Schools\n\nAn advance look-up operation was conducted by Census Bureau Regional Office staff beginning June 4, 2003, and ending July 1, 2003. The purpose of the address look-up operation was to verify school names and other critical information and to identify and resolve sampling frame issues before the survey began on September 24, 2003. In addition, during this look-up operation staff members were to obtain the name of the principal for the schools whenever possible. The look-up operations were conducted in the Regional Office using an online interactive database, internet searches, Phonedisc software, various local resources, and the staff\u2019s general local knowledge of the area. Any name changes or major discrepancies that were discovered were investigated by Census Bureau staff with in-depth knowledge of the sampling frame.\n\nOverall Timing of School Data Collection\n\nThe 2003\u201304 SASS principal, school, school library media center, and teacher data were collected during the 2003\u201304 school year. Table 15 summarizes the specific data collection activities and the time frame within which each occurred. Later in this chapter, the response by questionnaire and details on the timing of follow-up efforts of each questionnaire are presented.\n\nTable 15.

The letter was not personalized, but addressed to the \u201cprincipal/school head.\u201d The letter described SASS, encouraged their participation, provided the collection authority and confidentiality information, and informed them that they would be called by a field representative to set up a meeting, request a list of teachers, and deliver questionnaires. Beginning September 24, 2004, field representatives mailed handaddressed postcards to the school, using the name of the principal/school head. The postcard provided the name and phone number of the field representative and informed the principal/ school head that the school would be called in order to set up an appointment.\nScreening Schools for Eligibility and Making Appointments to Visit Schools\nA few days after mailing postcards to schools, field representatives called schools to administer the SASS Teacher Listing instrument. Once they reached the school by phone, they utilized the SASS Teacher Listing instrument to ascertain whether the school was in-scope or out-of-scope for SASS, and to make appointments to visit schools. In some cases, when field representatives were unable to reach the school by phone to administer the questions, they completed this part of the SASS Teacher Listing instrument at the school.\nIn previous administrations of SASS, many cases were identified where schools had self-reported addresses, grade ranges, or numbers of teachers that differed from that provided in other collections of data by NCES. These differences impact whether a school is in-scope or out-of-scope for SASS. The screening section of the SASS Teacher Listing instrument verified the school name and address, school type, and grade range in order to determine if the school was in-scope.\nThe name/address verification section of the SASS Teacher Listing instrument obtained each school\u2019s correct name, physical address, and mailing address. In some instances it was possible to establish that the school had closed or did not meet the SASS definition of a school. The physical address of the school may or may not have differed from the mailing address. In some districts, mail is addressed to a central\n14 Schools were asked to provide teacher information for field representatives to enter into the SASS Teacher Listing instrument. While many schools generated listings with the requested information, others used this optional form to record the information.\n\n\f82 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nlocation and then is distributed internally so the mailing address will not agree with the location. In some rural areas, all mail is addressed to P.O. boxes, so it was necessary to collect physical location information.\nThe question verifying the school\u2019s type provided the respondent with six categories from which to choose: public, private, public charter, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), homeschool, or only web-based instruction.15 The SASS Teacher Listing instrument compared this reported information with the preloaded designation from the sampling process (discussed in more detail in chapter 4) in order to determine if the school should be made out-of-scope. Homeschools and schools with only web-based instruction were considered out-of-scope for SASS. If the \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d designation was incorrect, the school was coded as out-of-scope.\nThe instrument also prompted the field representative to check grade ranges to confirm that the school in question was the correct school. If the grade range differed completely from the expected grade range, then the instrument collected the information and instructed the field representative to report the information to the sampling frame staff. This staff checked the source files to determine whether the school was in-scope or out-of-scope. If the respondent reported that grade ranges of the school differed significantly from the preloaded grade ranges from the sampling process, then there was a possible problem. In situations where the reported grade range was significantly less than expected, the instrument presented questions to find out if the anticipated grade range was covered by more than one school in the local community. These situations could arise because of an error in the source file or because the original sampled school was split into two or more schools. Once the information for these additional schools was entered, the instrument randomly selected ONE of the schools as the in-scope school for the survey. In that instance, the instrument instructed the field representative how to proceed. In situations where the reported grade range was significantly more than expected, the instrument presented a question to probe for a reason. For example, the school of interest may have merged with another school or the source may have been incorrect. In either instance, however, the school remained in-scope. If the grade range differed by no more than one grade range at either end of the range (e.g., a school with grades 3\u20135 was reported as having grades 2\u20134), then the instrument simply collected the new grade range of the school. More detail on these operations is contained in \u201cAppendix K. Details of SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures.\u201d\nIf the school was determined to be out-of-scope, the instrument made all questionnaires for the school out-of-scope. If the instrument determined that the school was in-scope, then it led the field representative through a series of questions to set up an appointment to visit the school to collect a roster of teachers and hand out the questionnaires.\nConfirming School Appointments and Making Arrangements to Obtain Rosters of Teachers\nWhen field representatives called schools to administer the instrument prior to visiting the school, the school staff was alerted that they would be asked to provide a roster of teachers when the field representative came to the school. They were told whom to include and to exclude as teachers. Field representatives explained that for each teacher they needed to obtain\n\u2022 the subject taught by each teacher; \u2022 the teacher\u2019s full-time or part-time status at the school; \u2022 the teacher\u2019s race/ethnicity; and\n15 Definitions of school types are provided in \u201cAppendix A. Key Terms for SASS.\u201d Homeschools are not included in SASS. Organizations or institutions that provide support for homeschooling but do not offer classroom instruction for students also are not included.\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Collection 83\n\u2022 whether the teacher had taught for more than 3 years at any school (teacher\u2019s experience).\nAfter field representatives completed making appointments with their schools, they alerted the staff in their Regional Office. Some of the staff from Regional Offices faxed appointment confirmations to the schools. These faxes included a paper version of the Teacher Listing Form, which is the form that was used in previous rounds of the SASS to collect the teacher roster information by mail. In this SASS, the Teacher Listing Form was provided by fax so that the school staff could see which data items were needed for each teacher.\nDistributing Principal, School, and School Library Media Center Questionnaires\nBeginning in early October 2003, field representatives went to the schools to explain the survey operations, provide promotional materials (NCES brochures, CD-ROM of the Statistical Abstract of the United States, SASS pens), and obtain the list of teachers. If they had set up an appointment in advance, they requested to meet with the principal. Usually the meeting did include the principal, but in some cases the meeting was with an assistant principal or other school staff. The field representatives used the various handouts and promotional materials to explain the purpose and timing of the survey and to gain cooperation. The appropriate principal questionnaire was given to or left for the principal, the only eligible respondent, to complete. In most cases the school questionnaire also was provided to the principal during the meeting at the school. However, the respondent for the school questionnaire could be any knowledgeable school staff member (e.g., assistant principal or school secretary), and efforts were made to establish who would be the specific respondent.\nIn public schools (including BIA-funded and public charter schools), the School Library Media Center Questionnaire was provided during the visit. Field representatives attempted to locate the school library to deliver it to the school librarian or another school staff member who was familiar with the library. If they were not allowed to walk through the school, they left the questionnaire with the principal or other staff with whom they were meeting.\nThe field procedures allowed the field representative to decide whether to return to the institution to pick up completed questionnaires or whether to leave a return envelope in which each respondent could mail completed questionnaires to the Census Bureau Regional Offices. Regional Office staff provided guidelines for the field representatives; in general, if the school was more than 50 miles away from the field representative, an envelope was left at the school to have respondents mail back the forms.\nAfter questionnaires were distributed, field representatives used an automated case management system on their laptops to indicate that each of the questionnaires had been distributed, along with notes indicating the intended respondent\u2019s name and contact information, and the plan for completing the questionnaire. In the event that the school had no library, they made the School Library Media Center Questionnaire out-of-scope.\nThe questionnaire distribution meetings were completed on a flow basis, with 45 percent completed in October 2003, 31 percent completed in November, and 12 percent completed in December. The remaining schools were completed during follow-up visits in January and February 2004.\nSampling Teachers and Distributing Teacher Questionnaires\nDuring the school visit, field representatives attempted to obtain the roster of teachers. In many cases the person who would produce the roster was not included in the initial meeting, so the field representatives had to make arrangements for another meeting. They sought to obtain the teacher roster during this first visit or, when that was not possible, to make specific arrangements to return after it was completed. Once\n\n\f84 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nthey received the information, the teachers\u2019 names and associated data from the list that the school provided were entered into the SASS Teacher Listing instrument, which then selected the sample of teachers for each school. The teacher questionnaires were distributed to the sampled teachers.\nThe specific arrangement for completing the Teacher Listing Form generally depended on the size of the school.\n\u2022 At smaller schools, the principal or knowledgeable respondent could dictate the list of teachers, which the field representative then entered into the instrument. Alternatively, the respondent provided a handwritten list of teachers.\n\u2022 At some schools, the respondent completed the optional Teacher Listing Form before the field representative arrived at the school or once the field representative got there.\n\u2022 At larger schools, the information often was stored in a database, and respondents preferred to provide a printout of their teacher roster.\nBefore the field representatives entered the teacher roster information, they reviewed the roster for completeness and accuracy. They went through the list of teachers and verified that the correct teachers were listed (e.g., that the teachers listed taught in the sampled grade range). Once they finished entering all information into the SASS Teacher Listing instrument, the instrument selected up to 20 teachers, based on the sampling process. An average of five teachers per school was selected. (See chapter 4 for more information on the sampling.)\nOnce the teachers were selected, the field representatives took prelabeled teacher questionnaires with the control numbers matching the control numbers assigned to each teacher by the instrument. On each, they entered the teacher\u2019s name on the front of the questionnaire. An envelope containing the teacher questionnaire, return envelopes, promotional material, and a note indicating whether the field representative intended to pick up the questionnaire or have the teacher mail it back was prepared for each teacher. In most cases, this envelope was left in teachers\u2019 mailboxes or with administrative staff to be distributed to the teachers. Field representatives used the case management system on their laptops to indicate that each of the questionnaires was distributed, along with notes indicating the contact information, and the plan for returning the questionnaire.\nNonresponse Follow-up of Principal, School, Teacher, and School Library Media Center Questionnaires\nWhen questionnaires were distributed, respondents were requested to return them within 2 weeks. In many cases, field representatives made arrangements to return to the school to pick up completed questionnaires and then FedEx them to the Regional Office. Otherwise, return envelopes were provided so that respondents could mail back questionnaires to the Regional Offices. Regional Office staff provided guidelines to the field representative\u2014generally, if the school was more than 50 miles away from the field representative, an envelope would be left in order for the respondents to mail back the forms. However, some Regional Offices emphasized one approach over the other. For example, the Atlanta and Dallas Regional Offices emphasized picking up questionnaires, and the Denver Regional Office emphasized returning the questionnaires by mail.16\nFollow-up efforts began approximately 2 weeks after questionnaires were distributed. Follow-up efforts consisted of telephone calls and personal visits to schools to obtain completed questionnaires or verify that they had been mailed. Each time field representatives contacted a school, they first checked the case\n16 The Census Bureau has Regional Offices located in Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Kansas City, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, and Seattle.\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Collection 85\n\nmanagement on their laptop, which indicated the status of each questionnaire assigned to the school. Then they would follow up on all questionnaires that had not been completed. After taking a follow-up action (e.g., leaving a message or note, picking up a questionnaire, verifying that the questionnaire had been mailed), they would indicate what had occurred by changing outcome codes and entering notes into the case management system. Field representatives were supplied with extra preprinted labels in the event that respondents needed a new blank questionnaire to complete; they would peel off the label for that respondent, affix it to the questionnaire, and provide it to the respondent.\n\nRegional Offices received mail returns from respondents and questionnaires that were FedExed by field representatives. They edited questionnaires for completeness and worked with their field representatives to resolve incomplete questionnaires. Once complete, they used scanning equipment to check the questionnaires in as \u201ccompleted,\u201d which updated the case management system. They boxed completed questionnaires and sent them to the Census Bureau clerical processing staff for data capture. Regional Office staff also administered a quality control program, which was designed to detect and deter falsification by field representatives; this is discussed in \u201cAppendix N. Results From the Quality Control Reinterview of the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey.\u201d\n\nThe original plan for data collection had specific goals for completion: (1) teacher listing/sampling would be completed by the end of November 2003; (2) principal, school, and school library media center questionnaires would be completed by the end of December 2003; and (3) teacher questionnaires would be completed by the end of January 2004. These goals turned out to be overly ambitious. Table 16 shows the response rates of each questionnaire by month, and table 17 shows the approximate percentage of interviews that were completed by the key milestone dates.\n\nTable 16.

Approximately half of the BIAfunded schools were completed at that date. Approximately 85 percent of the Teacher Listing Forms and 90 percent of the teacher questionnaires were completed by the target dates.\n\nAt the end of January, it was decided to extend data collection by 1 month. Regional Offices were instructed to work all productive cases (those thought likely to refuse), but were given the option to conduct telephone interviews consisting of a subset of questionnaire items if respondents were unlikely to respond otherwise. Table 18 summarizes the telephone interview attempts and interviews. By the end of February, data collection was closed out in almost all cases. Exceptions were made for BIA-funded schools, which had unusually low response rates; for public schools that encountered delayed data collection efforts as a result of the school district\u2019s late approval for participation, and selected school districts to increase state-level response rates. (See earlier section discussing follow-up for school districts.) Field staff continued to attempt to interview BIA respondents through early May.\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Collection 87\n\nTable 18.

In some cases they made arrangements to pick up completed forms; otherwise they gave respondents return envelopes addressed to their Regional Office. The results of this approach compared to prior rounds of SASS were as follows:\n\n\u2022 Most fieldwork was completed by the end of February, rather than the end of May, but poor response caused some school district and BIA work to extend to April/May.\n\u2022 Response rates for school, principal, and school library media center questionnaires were lower. Procedures called for field representatives to establish questionnaire pick-up or mailback dates, and to follow up if questionnaires were not received. Under the new methodology, it was expected that response rates on December 31, 2003, would have exceeded the corresponding response rates on December 31, 1999\u2014when the mail phase, and only for some questionnaires, the computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) follow-up phase, took place. In fact, only the school questionnaires had higher interview rates in 2003. Table 19 shows the comparisons by questionnaire. Response rates are covered in more detail in chapter 6.\n\nTable 19.

However, tracking cases and resolving whether a case was an interview, noninterview, or out-of-scope remained problematic and time consuming.\n\n\f89\nChapter 6. Response Rates\nThis chapter presents the survey response rates for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). First, the unit response rates are presented in detail. Next, the item response rates for each survey type are summarized. Following these sections, the nonresponse bias analyses that were conducted on both the unit and the items for this SASS are described, and major findings are presented.\nSurvey Response Rates\nUnit response rates are the rate at which the sampled units respond by substantially completing the questionnaire. Unit response rates can be calculated as unweighted or weighted. The unweighted response rates are the number of interviewed sampled units divided by the number of eligible (i.e., in-scope) sampled units, which include respondents plus nonrespondents but not ineligible (i.e., out-of-scope) units. The weighted response rates are the base-weighted (i.e., initial basic weight multiplied by the sampling adjustment factor) number of interviewed cases divided by the base-weighted number of eligible cases. The base weight for each sampled unit is the inverse of the probability of selection. See chapter 9 for further discussion of the weighting.\nThe unweighted, weighted, and weighted overall (across all stages of selection, in the case of teachers) response rates for each data file and the Teacher Listing Forms are listed in table 20. Table 21 provides public school response rates by state for districts, schools, principals, teachers, and school library media centers. Exhibit 2 shows which states comprise each of the Census Bureau Regional Offices and which are the 12 offices that were responsible for data collection. Table 22 provides private school response rates by private school typology for schools, principals, and teachers. The response rate tables are useful as an indication of possible nonresponse bias. The unweighted response rates provide a general indication of the success of the data collection effort, while the weighted response rates provide a measure of the quality of the data and the potential for nonresponse bias.\n\n\f90 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable 20.

For all items except the student race items on the district and school questionnaires, a counted response is any item that is not missing and the value of the associated imputation flag is 0. For the student race items on the district (d0052\u2013d0057) and school (s0417\u2013s0422) questionnaires, a counted response is any item that is not missing and the value of the associated imputation flag is 0 or 1. See chapter 8 for detailed information on imputations.\n\nFor SASS, the weighted item response rates ranged from 0 percent to 100 percent. Table 23 provides a brief summary of the item response rates. The item response rates in these tables are weighted and do not reflect additional response loss due to cases that refused to participate in the survey.

The analysis evaluated the extent of potential bias introduced by nonresponse from school districts, schools, school principals, teachers, and school library media centers at both the unit and item levels.\nUnit-Level Nonresponse\nOverview of Methodology\nThe first step in conducting the bias analysis was to examine the overall response rate for each file by state or affiliation stratum and the reporting characteristics (i.e., urbanicity, school level, and enrollment). If the response rate fell below 50 percent, that population would not be reported separately in a published table. Instead, the data would be replaced with a double dagger, but the estimates would be included in the total. The footnote would read, \u201cReporting standards not met. The base-weighted unit response rate was below 50 percent.\u201d For any state or affiliation stratum where the response rate was less than 85 percent, a more detailed analysis was done on the other reporting characteristics. The results were highlighted if that particular cell had a significantly higher or lower response rate than the file as a whole and bolded if the difference was noteworthy. A noteworthy difference had to meet the following conditions:\n\u2022 The difference relative to the overall response rate, or frame proportion, was greater than 10 percent.\n\u2022 The absolute difference was greater than one percentage point. \u2022 The coefficient of variation was less than 15 percent. \u2022 The cell had at least 30 interviews.\nIn addition, the base-weighted distribution of the respondents was compared to the distribution on the frame, which was adjusted for sampled units identified as out-of-scope. As discussed above, significant differences were highlighted and noteworthy cells were bolded. Finally, these same comparisons were analyzed using the final-weighted distributions.\nComparing the overall response rate of each file to the tabulation cells helped to identify areas of potential concern. Comparing the base-weighted distribution of the respondents to the adjusted frame helped to identify areas of potential bias for data items that were not particularly well correlated with the weighting cells. Comparisons with the final-weighted distributions identified areas of potential bias for data items correlated with the weighting cells.\nSummary of Conclusions. Evidence of substantial bias was not found on any of the 12 data files or the 3 Teacher Listing Form files. Nevertheless, response rates that fell below the acceptable level of 50 percent for particular states in public sector files and strata in private sector files were found and will not be reported separately in publications. These include public school districts in Vermont, public school library media centers in the District of Columbia, and principals in Amish private schools.\n\n\fChapter 6. Response Rates 97\n\nSummary for Public School Districts (LEA)17\n\nThe overall response rate for public school districts was 82.9 percent, requiring a closer examination of nonresponse. The more detailed analysis was performed by state and the two primary reporting characteristics (i.e., urbanicity and enrollment).\n\nThe overall response rate for 27 states was below 85 percent and 1 state, Vermont, had a response rate of 36.3 percent. For these states, the frame distribution was compared to the base-weighted respondent distribution for the reporting characteristics. The results of this analysis identified 3 out of 225 comparisons that were significant and noteworthy based upon the previously identified criteria. These differences were found in the enrollment categories for Maine and New Jersey (table 24).\n\nTable 24.

The base-weighted unit response rate was below 50 percent.\nSummary for Public Schools\nThe overall response rate for public schools was 80.9 percent, requiring a closer examination of nonresponse on this file. The more detailed analysis was performed by state and the three primary reporting characteristics (i.e., school level, urbanicity, and enrollment).\nThe overall response rate for 33 states was below 85 percent. For these states, the frame distribution was compared to the base-weighted respondent distribution for the reporting characteristics. The results of this analysis identified 10 out of 396 comparisons that were significant and noteworthy based upon the previously identified criteria.\nWhile the proportion of respondents from California public schools differed significantly from the proportion on the frame, there were no significant differences in the distribution of the reporting characteristics. This suggests that there is no substantial evidence of a nonresponse bias for California public schools. Nine states did have noteworthy differences in the distribution of respondents within urbanicity or enrollment. A selection of these is presented in table 25.\nAmong the reporting characteristics, there were significant and noteworthy differences for two of the enrollment categories: public schools with 100\u2013199 students and 750\u2013999 students. Neither of these enrollment categories was identified as noteworthy and significant within the states.\n\n\fChapter 6. Response Rates 99\n\nTable 25.

Response Rates 105\n\nConclusion/Course of Action. Based on this analysis, evidence of substantial bias was not found. Nevertheless, the overall response rate for principals in the Amish strata was below the 50 percent threshold and, as a result, the data for that stratum will not be reported separately. Data for Amish school principals will be included in the total and footnoted.\n\nFootnote: \u2021 Reporting standards not met. The base-weighted unit response rate was below 50 percent.\n\nSummary for BIA-Funded School Principals\n\nThe overall response rate for BIA-funded school principals was 90.4 percent. Comparisons of the frame distribution to the base-weighted respondent distribution for state groupings, school level, enrollment, and urbanicity showed that none of the comparisons were both significant and noteworthy, because all significant cells had fewer than 30 interviews.\n\nConclusion/Course of Action. Based on this analysis, evidence of substantial bias was not found.\n\nSummary for Public School Library Media Centers\n\nThe overall response rate for public school library media centers was 76.9 percent, requiring a closer examination of nonresponse on this file. The more detailed analysis was performed by state and the three primary reporting characteristics (i.e., school level, urbanicity, and enrollment).\n\nThe overall response rate for 40 states was below 85 percent and the response rate for the District of Columbia was 48.8 percent. For these states, the frame distribution was compared to the base-weighted respondent distribution for the reporting characteristics. The results of this analysis identified 26 out of 480 comparisons that were significant and noteworthy based upon the previously identified criteria. The noteworthy differences occurred in 15 states. Selected states are highlighted below in table 29.\n\nAmong the reporting characteristics, there were significant and noteworthy differences between the frame and base-weighted respondents for library media centers in combined schools, central city and small town/rural schools, and schools in the lowest and highest enrollment categories (less than 100 and 1,000 or more).\n\nTable 29.

The base-weighted unit response rate was below 50 percent.\nSummary for BIA-Funded School Library Media Centers\nThe overall response rate for BIA-funded school library media centers was 81.9 percent. Though this falls below the desired 85 percent response rate, a more detailed analysis of selected states, school level, enrollment, and urbanicity showed that none of the base-weight frame to respondent distribution comparisons was both significant and noteworthy. All of the significant comparisons can be explained by having fewer than 30 interviews.\nConclusion/Course of Action. Based on this analysis, evidence of substantial bias was not found.\nSummary for Public School Teachers\nThe overall response rate for public school teachers was 86.0 percent. The more detailed analysis was performed by state and the three primary reporting characteristics (i.e., school level, urbanicity, and enrollment).\nThe overall response rate for 19 states was below 85 percent and the response rate for the District of Columbia was 76.5 percent.

Based on this analysis, evidence of substantial bias was not found.\nSummary for BIA-Funded School Teachers\nThe overall response rate for BIA-funded school teachers was 92.3 percent. Comparisons of the frame distribution to the base-weighted respondent distribution by state groupings, school level, enrollment, and urbanicity showed that one of the comparisons was significant and noteworthy. The proportion of teachers from BIA-funded schools located in states other than Arizona, New Mexico, and South Dakota who responded to the survey was significantly less than the proportion on the frame.\nConclusion/Course of Action.

The overall response rate for nine states was below 85 percent. For these states, the frame distribution was compared to the base-weighted respondent distribution for the reporting characteristics. The results of this analysis identified 5 out of 104 comparisons that were significant and noteworthy based upon the previously identified criteria.\nConclusion/Course of Action. Based on this analysis, evidence of substantial bias was not found.\nSummary for the Private School Teacher Listing Form\nThe overall response rate for the private school Teacher Listing Form was 85.2 percent. The overall response rate for seven strata (not including the \u201cmissing\u201d category) was below 85 percent. The stratum with the lowest response rate, at 62.8 percent, was Jewish. However, none of the analysis variables within Jewish schools had response rates significantly different than the overall unit response rate.\nFor these strata, the frame distribution was compared to the base-weighted respondent distribution for the reporting characteristics.

If the overall response rate for the item fell below 70 percent, the item will be footnoted in National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) publications with \u201cItem response rate is below 70 percent\u201d as a method of cautioning the user that the low item response rate introduces some potential for bias in the imputation procedure. For any state, affiliation stratum, or state grouping where the item response rate was less than 85 percent, a more detailed analysis was done by the reporting characteristics. The results were\n18 For public school districts, screening items used to determine a district\u2019s eligibility for the survey (A1\u2013A4) or whether the district\u2019s physical location or street address were different than what was presented on the survey cover (C1) were excluded from the analysis. The screening items excluded were used to verify that the respondent was a district and whether the district was still in operation, had the correct grade range, or had merged with another district.\n\n\fChapter 6.

Twenty items had a response rate below 85 percent, requiring a closer examination. Of those items, four had a response rate below 70 percent, necessitating a footnote. The closer examination of response rates revealed no substantial evidence of a bias.\n\nPublic Schools. Nineteen items had a response rate below 85 percent, requiring a closer examination. Of those items, all were above 70 percent, so no footnoting was necessary. The closer examination of response rates revealed no substantial evidence of a bias.\n\nBIA-Funded Schools. One hundred five items had a response rate below 85 percent, requiring a closer examination. Of those items, thirteen were below 70 percent, necessitating a footnote. The closer examination of response rates revealed no substantial evidence of a bias, primarily because most of the detailed analysis cells had fewer than 30 interviews.\n\nPrivate Schools.

Data Processing\nOnce the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) data collection was completed, data processing began. Census Bureau field representatives, who were responsible for all of the data collection at the sampled schools, were also responsible for the first phase of data processing. This involved using the Regional Office Systems Control (ROSCO) system to track cases, as well as assign an outcome code to each one. Once this was completed, all cases were shipped to the Census Bureau clerical processing staff in Jeffersonville, Indiana. There, the cases were assigned a check-in code that indicated their status, and the data from completed questionnaires were captured and sent to Census Bureau analysts in reformatted datasets. Census Bureau analysts were responsible for resolving outcome codes, conducting preliminary data review, and assigning the preliminary interview status. They performed a series of computer edits on the data to identify inconsistencies, assigned a final interview status to each case, and imputed items that were still \u201cnot-answered.\u201d Up to this point, all data were processed and split into data files by questionnaire. The final step of data processing was to split the questionnaire datasets up into 12 final files by respondent type. All tables in this chapter contain data by final file, not questionnaire.\nQuestionnaire Check-in\nSchool district questionnaires were returned to the Census Bureau Regional Offices. The school district questionnaires were checked in and tracked at the Regional Offices using a specially designed database. Field representatives had discretion over the way in which respondents returned their forms. The field representatives could arrange to pick up completed questionnaires at the school or could provide postagepaid envelopes for the schools to mail their completed questionnaires to the Regional Office. In both cases, the school-level forms were checked in and tracked using the ROSCO system, a system that interacted with a case management system on the field representatives\u2019 laptops. Field staff used ROSCO to assign an outcome code to each case. The three outcome codes were completed interview, out-ofscope, and noninterview.\nQuestionnaires were assigned outcome codes and edited for critical items. (See exhibit 5.) Critical items are those that must be answered in order for a questionnaire to be considered completed. If a critical item was missing, the Regional Office supervisor contacted the field representative or respondent directly to obtain the data. After editing the school district questionnaires, field staff grouped them into batches of 100 and shipped all complete and incomplete interviews to the clerical processing staff in Jeffersonville, Indiana, where data keying took place. The remaining SASS questionnaires that were complete interviews were grouped into batches of 100 by questionnaire type and shipped to the same clerical processing staff.\nUpon receipt, clerical processing staff assigned a check-in code (separate from the outcome code previously assigned by field staff) to each questionnaire to indicate its status. All school district questionnaires were assigned a check-in code, but only complete interviews were assigned a check-in code for the remaining SASS forms. The code was entered into the Automated Tracking And Control (ATAC) system. The questionnaires were then grouped into batches by type and interview status (i.e., interviews, noninterviews, and out-of-scope for the survey) for data capture.\n\n\f114 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nExhibit 5.

Manual data keying, used for most of the SASS questionnaires, was accomplished using a Key from Paper (KFP) data capture system. The KFP system was programmed to present screens of questionnaire items to data keying staff, who worked through each page of the questionnaire and keyed any entries into the appropriate fields on the screens. The KFP system performed various edits as the data were keyed. Imaging technology differs from KFP by first capturing an electronic image of each questionnaire page. Along with the image capture, data could be captured using Optical Mark Recognition (OMR). The OMR recognized the marked box (next to precoded items) or the written alphanumerical entry, and entered the appropriate data into the OMR database for that questionnaire. Alternatively, the images could be presented to data keying staff, who captured the data by keying any entries into the appropriate fields on the screens (similar to the KFP process).\n\nAll of the SASS questionnaires except for the public and private teacher questionnaires (including all SASS reinterview questionnaires) were captured utilizing the KFP system.19 Prior to keying, KFP programs were developed for each questionnaire. Images of these forms were captured after data entry was completed. The image files were used during subsequent steps of data processing to view the actual questionnaires online. All KFP entries were 100 percent verified by the keying staff, meaning that each field was keyed twice and the results were compared automatically for discrepancies and, subsequently, verified. The verification during this operation allowed up to a 1 percent error on a field-to-field basis. Unacceptable batches of questionnaires (where there was more than a 1 percent error) were 100 percent verified a second time by keying staff. A more detailed discussion of data capture and results of the keying verification for all SASS questionnaires are provided in \u201cAppendix O. Quality Assurance for Keying and Mailout Operations.\u201d\n\nThe data from SASS teacher questionnaires were captured using imaging technology and a combination of OMR and Key from Image (KFI). The precoded items (all items where the respondent answered by marking a box) on the SASS public and private school teacher questionnaires were captured utilizing OMR. All write-in fields (e.g., open-ended, numeric, and character fields) for these questionnaires were captured by the KFI process. OMR and KFI are both methods used by the Workflow and Image Processing System (WIPS), an automated data capture system.\n\nWhen the SASS public and private school teacher questionnaires were received and checked in by the Census Bureau clerical processing staff, they were disassembled, and each duplex page was scanned. Images of each duplex page were created along with a data response file. The data response file was\n\n19 The Teacher Listing Form data were captured using the SASS Teacher Listing instrument.\n\n\f116 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nprocessed through imaging recognition software at a 99 percent confidence level. If the recognition software was 99 percent certain that the box next to the precoded response field contained a valid mark, the entry was copied to an output file. If the response fell outside the confidence level, the imaged response was presented to a member of the keying staff. This member of the keying staff then had to interpret and key the data from the image of the questionnaire duplex page.\nAll of the open-ended items also were presented to members of the keying staff. All nonblank write-in KFI entries were 100 percent verified, meaning that each field was keyed twice, and the results were compared automatically for discrepancies and, subsequently, verified. The fields that were read as blank by the KFI system were verified at a 5 percent rate. That is, of the total number of write-in fields that were read as blanks for each item, 5 percent were verified a second time to verify that they were blank. The sample verification during this operation allowed a 1 percent error on a field-to-field basis. Unacceptable (sample verified) batches of questionnaires where there was more than a 1 percent error were 100 percent reverified by keying staff by referring back to the original survey. A more detailed discussion of data capture and results of the keying verification for all SASS teacher questionnaires are provided in \u201cAppendix O. Quality Assurance for Keying and Mailout Operations.\u201d\nThe automated OMR and KFI data capture methods were chosen for the teacher forms because of the large quantity of questionnaires, as compared to the other SASS forms. Generally, it takes more time to program the automated OMR and KFI programs than it takes to program the KFP method. But the OMR captures data much faster than keying from paper, so the time savings from a large quantity of OMR data capture can offset the additional programming time for the operation.\nReformatting\nAfter the SASS questionnaire data were captured, the output files were reformatted into SAS datasets in order to facilitate the remaining data processing and cleaning.\nOutcome Code Resolution\nAutomation issues led to a number of problems with accurately recording outcome codes for the library media center, school, teacher, and principal questionnaires and the Teacher Listing Form. The problems fell into three distinct categories: teacher resampling, ROSCO to ATAC mismatches, and SASS Teacher Listing instrument to questionnaire mismatches.\nTeacher Sampling Issues\nThree types of errors occurred during the teacher sampling and data collection: teacher lists were resampled after they had been sampled once, teachers received questionnaires for invalid control numbers, and teacher questionnaires were swapped. A total of 5,045 teacher records, including 1,150 private school teacher records and 3,895 public school teacher records, required some form of reconciliation.\nThe teacher resampling occurred in about 40 schools because the Teacher Listing instrument, as originally released, allowed the field representative to reenter the listing of teachers after the sample of teachers was drawn. Additions or changes to the list of teachers forced the teacher sampling to be rerun and a new teacher sample to appear in place of the original one. Generally, the teacher questionnaires had already been distributed to the original sample, so the original sample was considered valid. To resolve this problem, names of teachers from the instrument were compared to names on the returned questionnaires. If most of the names within a school were nonmatches, then resampling was presumed to\n\n\fChapter 7. Data Processing 117\nhave occurred. The questionnaire names were accepted as the valid sample provided they fit a valid sampling pattern and the listing information was corrected to be consistent with these sampled teachers. The resampling problem had minor implications for the sampling; primarily due to uncertainty in the identity of the nonresponding teachers and their specific listing information. The sampling problem also had implications for field follow-up, since field staff were unable to pursue the nonrespondents. Listing information for these teachers was imputed in order to complete the weighting procedure as described in chapter 9.\nThe second type of error occurred when the field representative had to conduct nonresponse follow-up on sampled teachers and, rather than using replacement labels and blank questionnaires to conduct this operation, the sampled teachers were provided with unused questionnaires from the sampling procedure. This resulted in the correct teachers being interviewed, but the wrong control number being included on the questionnaires. The control numbers were subsequently corrected for responding teachers. This problem had no implications for the integrity of the teacher sampling, because the identity of the correct sample was preserved in the automated case management system.\nThe third type of error occurred when questionnaires were distributed to the correct sample of teachers, but in the wrong order, resulting in a swapping of control numbers for the sampled teachers. Teacher names from the returned questionnaires were compared to the names from the Teacher Listing instrument. When swapping occurred, control numbers on the returned questionnaires were corrected to be consistent with the sampling. This problem had no implications for the integrity of the teacher sampling, since the identities of the correct sample of teachers were preserved in the automated case management system.\nROSCO to ATAC Mismatches\nSASS utilized two distinct systems to track outcome codes for questionnaires. The ROSCO system was set up so that field representatives could update the status of each individual case using their laptop by recording when questionnaires were dropped off or picked up. When each questionnaire was received by the Regional Office, field staff would ensure that the form was a valid and completed interview and update the outcome code appropriately. In order to clear a case from the field representative\u2019s laptop to indicate that it was no longer active, the field representative needed to update the outcome code in ROSCO\u2019s case management and transmit the case to the Regional Office. The field representative would then transmit the case once again to remove the case from his or her laptop. Finally, the Regional Office would check the form out and send it to the centralized check-in facility in Jeffersonville, the Census Bureau\u2019s clerical processing staff. Problems within the ROSCO system caused some Regional Offices to intentionally miscode refusals as completed interviews, because it was the only way to remove the cases from the case management system in the field representatives\u2019 laptops. Only complete, in-scope interviews were supposed to be transmitted to the clerical processing staff (for all questionnaires other than the district).\nThe Census Bureau clerical processing staff used the ATAC check-in system for the questionnaires. Initially, each questionnaire, as identified by the respondent\u2019s control number, was assigned a check-in code of \u201c99,\u201d which means that the form had not been received. As forms were received, the check-in code was changed to \u201c01,\u201d meaning that the interview was received. The field staff mailed a number of forms that were not valid interviews to the clerical processing staff. In some cases, these were discovered before the form was checked in and each one was pulled from the batching process. The ATAC code for these cases remained a \u201c99.\u201d In other cases, the invalid interviews were not discovered until keying; these interviews already had been assigned the ATAC code of \u201c01.\u201d These cases were pulled from the keying process and their ATAC codes were changed to an invalid interview code, either a \u201c97\u201d (blank questionnaire, misc.) or \u201c98\u201d (received but not complete).\n\n\f118 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nAt the conclusion of data collection, Census Bureau analysts compared outcome codes from ROSCO to the check-in codes from ATAC and found many inconsistencies. For example, for some cases, the Regional Office indicated that a form had a ROSCO code of \u201c201\u201d (completed interview), but ATAC did not show that the clerical processing staff had received a completed form. Likewise, there were several cases where a completed form was received by the clerical processing staff, but the ROSCO outcome code indicated an out-of-scope, refusal, or other noninterview code. Census Bureau analysts worked to reconcile each of these cases and then updated the ROSCO and ATAC outcome codes accordingly. Approximately 800 cases went through this resolution process.\nSASS Teacher Listing Instrument to Questionnaire Mismatches\nAfter reconciliation was completed with regard to teacher sampling and the ROSCO/ATAC mismatches, Census Bureau analysts investigated inconsistencies that were discovered between outcome codes from the SASS Teacher Listing instrument and the outcome codes on the related forms (e.g., school, principal, or school library media center questionnaire). For example, some Teacher Listing Forms were coded as complete in ROSCO (code of \u201c801\u201d), but the corresponding teacher questionnaires had an outcome code of \u201c233,\u201d meaning that the Teacher Listing Form had not been completed. This problem was most prevalent on the public and private teacher questionnaires. Over 2,000 individual cases went through this reconciliation.\nThe problem with inconsistencies between the Teacher Listing Form and questionnaire outcome codes was an artifact of the teacher resampling issue and of field representatives restarting cases. Investigation of the discrepancy showed that these cases were refusals that were converted into interviews at a later time. When a Teacher Listing Form was a refusal, all 20 of the teacher records were set to an outcome code of \u201c233\u201d (Teacher Listing Form not completed).20 When a case was converted to an interview during follow-up, the teacher control numbers were assigned valid outcome codes. However, the unused teachers (20 records minus the teachers actually sampled) should have had their outcome codes changed to \u201c247\u201d (unused teacher), but many actually remained as \u201c233.\u201d\nSimilar situations occurred with cases in which the district refused to participate in SASS (code of \u201c923\u201d)21 or the school had no principal (code of \u201c252\u201d). Census Bureau analysts reviewed each case by looking at the questionnaires (which were stored in image files), Teacher Listing instrument notes, and the output from the Teacher Listing instrument. A spreadsheet was created for each of the surveys. These spreadsheets included updated outcome codes for each inconsistent case. Upon completion of the file, analysts updated the outcome codes and reran the comparison. If a new set of mismatches was identified, then it was corrected in a new spreadsheet.\nPrimary Data Review and Preliminary Interview Status Recode (ISR) Classification\nA data review process ran simultaneously with the outcome code resolution process. During data review, Census Bureau analysts examined frequencies of each data item in order to identify any suspicious values (e.g., if an item\u2019s response was outside the range of possible answer choices, or if an answer seemed unlikely given the respondent\u2019s other responses in the survey). For these, they looked at the image of the\n20 The case management system was initialized with 20 teacher records for each school. If the school was made outof-scope in the Teacher Listing instrument, all cases associated with the school were made out-of-scope. If the school remained in scope, some of the 20 teacher records became sampled cases, and the remainders were coded as \u201cunused teachers.\u201d 21 In some cases, the school district refused to allow its schools to participate in SASS from the beginning. Later, some of these districts approved the survey.\n\n\fChapter 7. Data Processing 119\nquestionnaire page to verify that the data were keyed correctly. Appropriate fixes were made to the data files. Analysts also reviewed questionnaires to ensure that key items were answered and that enough of the questionnaire items were completed. When analysts identified a potential problem, they verified that data were keyed correctly by reviewing an electronic image of the questionnaire. If data were missing, analysts attempted to recontact the school or use nonintrusive means of obtaining the data (e.g., school website, intraquestionnaire imputation).\nThe next step in data processing was the preliminary determination of each case\u2019s interview status recode (ISR); that is, whether each case was an interview, a noninterview, or was out-of-scope for SASS. In general, cases with an \u201cout-of-scope\u201d outcome code that had been assigned by the SASS Teacher Listing instrument were classified as out-of-scope (ISR = 3) for the preliminary ISR. Otherwise, cases with data entries were classified as completed interviews (ISR = 1). Cases with no data, cases lacking critical items, or cases where the district or school had refused for all respondents were classified as noninterviews (ISR = 2).\nComputer Edits\nAfter primary data review and the preliminary ISR classification, all files were submitted to a series of computer edits. These edits consisted of a range check, a consistency edit, and a blanking edit.\nThe first of the computer edits was the range check. The range check was used to delete entries that were outside the range of acceptable values that were set prior to the administration of SASS.\nActual changes to the data were made during the consistency edit. The consistency edits identified inconsistent entries within each case and, whenever possible, corrected them. If the inconsistencies could not be corrected, the entries were deleted. These inconsistencies occurred\n\u2022 within items (e.g., if the response to the \u201cYes/No\u201d part of School Questionnaire item 10\u2014 whether or not the school has one or more temporary buildings\u2014was \u201cNo,\u201d but the capacity of temporary buildings was greater than zero for the second part of the item); or\n\u2022 between items (e.g., if School Questionnaire item 56 indicated that the school does not participate in the National School Lunch Program, but one or more students were reported as approved for this program in item 57).\nIn addition, the consistency edit filled in some items where data were missing or incomplete by using other information on the same data record. For example, if some parts of School Questionnaire item 5\u2014 student counts by race\u2014had entries, and the sum of those parts was greater than or equal to the school\u2019s total enrollment, then a zero entry was put in each part that was unanswered during the consistency edit.\nThe blanking edits deleted extraneous entries (e.g., in situations where skip patterns were not followed correctly) and assigned the \u201cnot answered\u201d (.N) code to items that should have been answered but were not.\nThe only records that were put through the series of edits were those classified as interviews in the preliminary ISR. The tables in \u201cAppendix P. Changes Made to Variables During the Computer Edit, by Data File,\u201d show the number of edit changes made to entries for each of the variables within each data file. For information about how the data files were created from the questionnaire data, see the final section, \u201cData Products,\u201d in this chapter.

Teacher and Private School Teacher Questionnaires (Forms SASS-4A and -4B) \u2022 The school where the teacher was selected for sample was classified as out-of-scope by the Teacher Listing instrument. A case was classified as out-of-scope (ISR = 3) if o the teacher no longer worked at the school named on the questionnaire (e.g., he/she transferred to another school, left teaching, retired, or was deceased); or o the person named on the label was a short-term substitute teacher, student teacher, or teacher\u2019s aide; or o the person named on the label was not a teacher; or o the person named on the questionnaire label had never worked at the school; o the person named on the questionnaire worked at the school but did not teach any classes (e.g., he/she was an assistant principal, counselor, or librarian); or o the teacher moved out of the United States. \u2022 A case was classified as an interview (ISR = 1) if o none of the conditions for out-of-scope cases was met; and o the respondent reported either the year that he/she began teaching in the school where he/she was selected for the survey sample (T0034) or the year he/she began full- or parttime teaching at the elementary or secondary level (T0035); and o the respondent reported whether he/she had a college degree (T0116 or T0123 or T0127); and o the respondent reported his/her main teaching assignment field (T0069 or T0075); and o at least one grade level of students taught by the respondent was reported (T0051\u2013 T0065); and o there were data in at least 10 percent (34) of the remaining items (28 for the private school teachers). \u2022 A case was classified as a noninterview (ISR = 2) if an eligible case did not meet the requirements to be an interview case.\n\n\fChapter 7.

Values were created for these items in the next step of the processing, imputation, which is described in \u201cChapter 8. Imputation Procedures.\u201d Exhibit 6 includes the naming convention for flags created to identify changes made to the data during the pre-edit, consistency edit, and imputation stages. Only the imputation flags remain on the restricted-use data files. All three types of flags can be found on the documentation data files. (See the next section for a description of the documentation files.)\n\nAs discussed earlier, the 2003\u201304 school year was a survey year for both SASS and Private School Universe Survey (PSS). The SASS Private School Questionnaire collected all of the PSS data, in addition to some SASS school data, so that private schools selected for the SASS data sample would not be asked to complete two separate questionnaires. Items 1\u20135e, 7\u20139, 14\u201321, 24, 32\u201334, and 96\u2013100 were all \u201cPSS items\u201d and were processed with the PSS data files. For the purpose of imputation, PSS items are defined\n\n\fChapter 7. Data Processing 125\n\nas any item collected for the PSS that remains on the SASS private school record. The private school data file has a distinct set of imputation flag values and definitions. See exhibit 6. The imputation procedures for the Private School Questionnaire are described in greater detail in the \u201cImputation Procedures for the Private School Questionnaire (Form SASS-3B)\u201d section of chapter 8.\n\nExhibit 6.

Twelve data files were created from the questionnaire data files so that the data could be categorized by school type, that is, public, private, and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The sixth digit of each respondent\u2019s unique control number was used to separate BIA-funded schools from the data files, because a sixth digit of a \u201c3\u201d indicates a BIA-funded school.\n\u2022 Public School District (doc_District).

These files were used as the source files for the bias analysis files, the documentation files, and the restricted-use files. The bias analysis files were used to run the unit and item bias analyses. The documentation files were used to produce unit and item response rates and contain all sampled cases and the base weights in addition to the final weights. The restricted-use files contain only the respondents\u2019 records, and processing variables and most sampling variables were removed. In addition, the restricted-use files were altered to meet the requirements of data nondisclosure. (See chapter 11 for additional description of the restricted-use files.)\n\n\f127\nChapter 8. Imputation Procedures\nFollowing the computer edit stage of the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) data processing, \u201cnot answered\u201d items still remained. These \u201cnot answered\u201d items do not include items that respondents should not have answered because of skip patterns in the questionnaires. In order to fill these \u201cnot answered\u201d items with data, questionnaires were put through three separate stages of imputation. With each stage, larger assumptions were made about how the participant might have responded. The first stage of imputation involved using items from either the same questionnaire or other questionnaires from the same school or district to impute missing items. The second stage of imputation included \u201chot deck\u201d imputation (establishing donor records and using them to impute data), creating regression models to predict and impute data, ratio imputation (by subsamples of data), and random ratio imputation (by subsamples of data). After the first two stages of imputation, Census Bureau analysts imputed the remaining unanswered items clerically in the third stage of imputation.\nOverview of Imputation Procedures\nAs questionnaires went through the different stages of imputation, a numerical flag corresponding to the stage of imputation and type of imputation was assigned to each imputed item. In this way it is possible for data users to identify which items were imputed and how the imputations were performed. Data users can use this imputation flag to decide whether or not to include imputed data in their analysis and which types of imputed data to employ.\nFirst-Stage Imputation\nIn the first stage of imputation, missing (not answered) survey data were imputed with a valid response using data from other items in the same questionnaire or from other related sources. In addition, data were ratio adjusted in some circumstances so that items were consistent with one another. For example, if the counts of students by race on a school questionnaire did not sum to the reported total enrollment, the ratio of each race to the total enrollment was preserved, but the actual number was adjusted to be consistent with the total enrollment figure. Except for the Private School Questionnaire, there were four different sources for stage 1 imputations, and each was given a particular numerical flag. The definitions of these flags are as follows:\n0 Data reported. No adjustment or imputation was made. 1 The item was ratio adjusted to be consistent with another item on the questionnaire. 2 The item was imputed based on data from another item within the same questionnaire. 3 The item was imputed based on data from another questionnaire associated with the same school. 4 The item was imputed from the 2001\u201302 Common Core of Data (CCD) or the Teacher Listing\nForm.\nBoth the Private School Universe Survey (PSS) and SASS were conducted during the 2003\u201304 school year. The SASS Private School Questionnaire collected the same items that were present on PSS, plus additional SASS school data, for the private schools included in the SASS sample. The PSS data that were collected on the SASS Private School Questionnaire were processed jointly as part of the PSS processing. These PSS items received PSS imputation flags. The remaining items that appeared only on the SASS Private School Questionnaire were processed during SASS processing. These SASS-only items received SASS imputation flags. The definitions of these two different types of flags are as follows:\nP0 Data reported for the PSS item. No adjustment or imputation was made. P1 The PSS item was ratio adjusted to be consistent with another item on the questionnaire.\n\n\f128 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nP2 The PSS item was imputed based on data from other items in the same questionnaire or based on data from the 2001\u201302 PSS.\nS0 Data reported for the SASS-only item. No adjustment or imputation was made. S1 The SASS-only item was ratio adjusted to be consistent with another item on the questionnaire. S2 The SASS-only item was imputed based on data from other items in the same questionnaire.\nSecond-Stage Imputation\nSeveral different approaches were used in the second stage of imputation. Data were imputed from items found on questionnaires of the same type that had certain characteristics in common or from the aggregated answers of similar questionnaires. These records are called \u201cdonor records.\u201d\nWhen a missing item was imputed from a donor record, and the donor answered using the \u201cother\u201d option, the write-in \u201cplease specify\u201d portion was also imputed.22 For instance, if the donor answered item 5 on the Teacher Questionnaire, which asks the respondent\u2019s main activity last school year, using the \u201cother\u201d option, the information he or she specified in the write-in portion would also be imputed to the missing item. However, not all write-in items (e.g., open-ended items) were imputed from donor records. Many of the write-in items ask about things that are very specific to each respondent. For instance, item 21 on the public school teacher questionnaire asks the name of the college or university in which the respondent earned his or her degree. Items such as these were not imputed and were left unanswered. All items that were imputed during the second stage of imputation were assigned an imputation flag of \u201c7.\u201d\nHot Deck Imputation\nIn hot deck imputation, responses were determined by establishing a donor record and then basing imputation on data found within the donor record. Donors were selected based on their answers to specified items called \u201cmatching variables.\u201d If two respondents answered the selected matching variables in similar ways, then it was assumed that they were comparable and that imputation of one data item from the other was reasonable.\nThe matching variables used to establish donor relationships were selected based on the type of data the donor would supply to the record undergoing imputation. For example, since a respondent\u2019s answer to a given item may be influenced by the school\u2019s enrollment and the proximity of the school to a city, these variables were used to find another respondent in a school with similar characteristics.\nThe datasets were sorted by matching variables in the order of their importance. The sorting helped to ensure that appropriate donors were the most similar to the record with the unanswered data. For example, on the Principal Questionnaire, item 44 asks for the principal\u2019s birth year. If the respondent left this item blank, then important variables in predicting its value would be the number of years of educational experience (EXPER) and the highest degree that he or she had earned (DEGREE). Therefore, the records were sorted by LEVEL / DEGREE / EXPER. However, items 38 to 40 concern the level of parent or guardian involvement at the school, an area in which the number of years of educational experience and the highest degree that he or she has earned would not be useful predictors. Instead, the type of school at which the respondent served as principal (TYPE) and the county of the respondent\u2019s school (GFIPCT) would be more useful indicators. These variables followed the sort routine LEVEL / TYPE / GFIPCT. The various sort routines ensured that the most similar record to the unanswered one served as the donor.\n22 This was done for item 44 on the SASS School Questionnaire; items 23e and 77 on the SASS Private School Questionnaire; items 5, 6, 29, 44, and 48 on the SASS Teacher Questionnaire; and items 5, 6c, 6e, 29, 45, and 48 on the SASS Private School Teacher Questionnaire.\n\n\fChapter 8. Imputation Procedures 129\nWhen there were not enough donor records within any given stratification cell, a collapsing routine was instituted. This was done to make sure that values that were not consistent with other data on the same record would not be imputed simply because a record was close to the boundary between the stratification cells (e.g., there were other records that were suitable donors or the record was not similar enough to be a donor).\nFor example, for the School Questionnaire, the collapsing routine for the matching variable MINEN23 (percentage of students in school who are of a racial/ethnic minority) was as follows:\n(1,2,3,4,0, 2,3,1,4,0, 3,2,1,4,0, 4,3,2,1,5, 5,4,0,0,0)\nIf the value for MINEN on the record with missing data was one and there was no available donor where MINEN = 1, the collapsing program looked for a donor where MINEN = 2. If there was still no available donor, the program looked for a donor where MINEN = 3, then MINEN = 4. It did not look for cases where MINEN = 5. Likewise, if the value for MINEN on the record with missing data was a three and there was no available donor where MINEN = 3, the collapsing program searched for a donor where MINEN = 2, then MINEN = 1, then MINEN = 4. When the collapsing routine hit zero, there was no donor available for this case. In these instances, the value was clerically imputed in the third stage of imputation.\nIn many cases, the donor and imputed records were required to have the same answers on key variables. For example, for public school sector records donors needed to be from the same state as the record with missing data, and for private school sector records donors needed to have the same religious affiliation, or matching strata, as the record with missing data. Finally, to prevent a single record from having an undue impact on the data, a record could only be used as a donor a maximum of five times. There were no exceptions to this procedure.\nOnce the donor relationship was established, the donor record provided data items either directly or indirectly to the imputed record. For example, the unanswered item requesting the \u201cnumber of white nonHispanic students\u201d was filled by accepting the ratio of White students to total students from the donor record and by applying that ratio to the total number of students on the imputed record.\nRegression Imputation\nWhen unanswered items remained after the hot deck imputation process was completed, simple linear regression was used to impute data for items requiring numerical answers. Linear models for such items were based on data from other items on the questionnaire and data from the school survey.\nItems used in the regression model were selected based on how much explanatory power each had in the model and on the manner in which each influenced the overall explanatory power of the model. This was measured by examining the coefficient of the variable in the regression as well as the adjusted R-squared statistic associated with the model. In addition, the certainty of the relationship established through\n23 MINEN = 1 if the percentage of students in school who were of a racial/ethnic minority was less than 5.5 percent. MINEN = 2 if the percentage was between 5.5 percent and 20.5 percent. MINEN = 3 if minority enrollment was between 20.5 percent and 50.5 percent. MINEN = 5 if the percentage was greater than or equal to 50.5 percent. MINEN = 4 if the percentage was unclassified.\n\n\f130 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nregression was a factor in determining which variables to use in the regression. This was measured by the t statistic associated with the coefficient of each variable in the regression as well as the overall F statistic associated with the model. In general, Census Bureau analysts attempted to produce models in which each t statistic was less than 0.20, the F statistic was less than 0.20, and the R-squared was at least 0.40; however, it was not always possible to fulfill all of these requirements. When a sufficient model could not be built for a variable, it was imputed clerically during third-stage imputation.\n\nSubsample Ratio Imputation\n\nFor unanswered items that remained after the hot deck imputation and that were categorical variables, subsample ratio imputation was employed. First, data were broken into five subsamples (or groupings) based on the grade levels offered at the school (LEVEL). The groups were broken down as follows:\n\nLEVEL = 1 LEVEL = 2 LEVEL = 3 LEVEL = 4 LEVEL = 5\n\nGrades kindergarten through 6 (elementary) Grades kindergarten through 8 All grades (combined) Grades 5 through 12 Grades 7 through 12 (secondary)\n\nThe ratio of each type of response was found for each grouping. Finally, the items were assigned answers according to the subsample to which they belonged in order to preserve the response ratios within that subsample.\n\nFor example, an item composed of four categories as answered by a subsample of schools, where LEVEL = 1, had the following distribution of answers: 40 percent chose the first category, 20 percent chose the second, 30 percent chose the third, and 10 percent chose the fourth category. These distributions would then be used to impute the records with missing data for this item where LEVEL = 1. Similarly, the percentage distribution of responses for records where LEVEL = 2 was calculated and the records with missing data that had the same LEVEL value were imputed accordingly. This operation was performed for all LEVEL values, or subsamples.\n\nRandom Subsample Ratio Imputation\n\nRandom subsample ratio imputation is a method similar to subsample ratio imputation but is more effective at handling items that require continuous answers. For a random subsample ratio, cases were imputed using a program that randomly assigned values to categorical variables while preserving the observed distribution of the data. The program also sorted the data into groupings based on the value of those variables that might have impacted the respondent\u2019s answer. Continuous variables were assigned a random probable value (i.e., a value between the 5th and 95th percentile) to cases with missing responses based on the range of values provided by respondents with similar characteristics.\n\nType of school (i.e., school sector), school program type, level of classes taught, and teaching experience were variables used to define a subsample within the dataset. If a record within this subsample had an unanswered item, an answer was randomly assigned so that the distribution of responses to that item remained the same. For example, if teachers who worked in private schools that were alternative schools, taught elementary level students, and had 20 years of teaching experience had a base annual teaching salary that ranged from $20,000 in the 5th percentile to $50,000 in the 95th percentile, then the imputation procedure randomly assigned salary figures to teachers with missing data that were consistent with this distribution.\n\n\fChapter 8. Imputation Procedures 131\nThird-Stage Imputation\nIn some cases, items still remained \u201cnot answered\u201d after the first two stages of imputation. This happened when there was no available donor, the value imputed by the computer was out-of-range or inconsistent with values in other items, or there was no method of imputation suitable for the item other than clerical imputation. Therefore, all remaining unanswered items after the first two stages of imputation were imputed clerically during the third stage of imputation. All third-stage imputations were given an imputation flag of \u201c8.\u201d In order to determine an appropriate value for each unanswered item, Census Bureau analysts reviewed\n\u2022 the original image of the questionnaire to see if the respondent had made any notes in the margin that might provide insight;\n\u2022 other items within the same record with related information; \u2022 similar cases to get an understanding of what the respondent might have answered; and/or \u2022 averages of similar subsamples.\nPost-Imputation Processing\nFollowing both the second and third stages of imputation, the computer edits were re-run and any remaining data issues were resolved. (See chapter 7 for details.) At this point, any items that were imputed at a rate greater than 15 percent were analyzed as part of the item bias analysis. (See chapter 6 for details about the nonresponse bias analysis.) The computer edits were used to ensure that the values imputed in each stage of imputation were within acceptable ranges and were consistent with other items on the questionnaire.\nImputation Procedures for the School District Questionnaire (Form SASS-1A)\nItems on the School District Questionnaire that still were \u201cnot answered\u201d went through a first stage of imputation in which unanswered items were imputed from other items on the same record or items on the district\u2019s sample file (including CCD). The questionnaires then went through the second stage of imputation, or hot deck imputation, in which some of the remaining \u201cnot answered\u201d items were filled using the data record from a similar record. The third stage of imputation filled in the remaining \u201cnot answered\u201d items that were not resolved during the first two stages of imputation.\nPublic and public charter one-school districts had their district data collected on the Unified School Questionnaire and were imputed separately from the public and public charter school districts that completed the School District Questionnaire. Following the stage 3 imputation of both the School District Questionnaire and Unified School Questionnaire, the school district items that appeared on the Unified School Questionnaire were split out from the Unified School Questionnaire data file and included in the School District Questionnaire data file. For further details, see the \u201cImputation Procedures for the Unified School Questionnaire\u201d section.\n\n\f132 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nFirst-Stage Imputation for School District Data\nIn the first stage, unanswered items from the School District Questionnaire were filled in whenever possible using information about the district from the following sources:\n\u2022 Other questionnaire items on the district\u2019s school district questionnaire record. Based on entries from related questionnaire items, assumptions were made about how the respondent might have answered items. For example, if item 59, which asks whether or not the district requires community service for seniors to graduate, was blank, and item 60a, which asks if there is a certain number of hours of community service required, was marked no, then item 59 had the answer \u201cno\u201d imputed, and items 60a and 60b (actual number of hours required) were marked as valid skips since those items did not apply.\n\u2022 District\u2019s sample file record, including data from the 2001\u201302 CCD. In some cases, CCD data from the sample file were used to impute entries to items. For example, if item 1a did not indicate that the district offers kindergarten or 1st grade through 12th grade, and item 1b, which asks which grades are offered, was unanswered, the grades offered were imputed from the sample file data, which was derived from the 2001\u201302 CCD.\nIn addition to filling in items where values were missing, some inconsistencies between items were corrected by ratio adjustment during the first stage of imputation. For records where the sum of the entries in item 4 (number of students by race) did not equal the districts\u2019 K\u201312 enrollment in item 3, the item 4 entries were adjusted to be consistent with item 3. For example, if the sum of the students reported by the racial categories in item 4 differed from the district\u2019s K\u201312 enrollment reported in item 3, the assumption was made that the total enrollment was correct. Consequently, the difference between the racial counts in item 4 and the total value reported in item 3 was resolved by adding or subtracting the misreported students from each racial category without changing the proportion of each racial group to the total enrollment.\nTable 33 includes a summary of imputation performed in stage 1 processing.\nSecond-Stage Imputation for School District Data\nHot Deck Imputation\nIn general, the hot deck stage of imputation filled in unanswered items by using data from the record of a similar district. For example, districts were similar if they were the same level, of similar size, had a similar percentage of minority students, etc. Imputation variables that describe certain characteristics of the districts (e.g., enrollment size, school level, and percent minority students) were created and used to sort the records and to match incomplete records to those with complete entries (donors).\nFor some items, such as item 7, which asks for the number of days in the school year, data were copied directly from the donor record to the record with the missing value. For others, such as item 12 (number of teachers newly hired), the entries on the donor record were used along with other questionnaire data to fill the incomplete items. For example, suppose district A had not answered item 12, number of teachers newly hired, and district B had been established as an appropriate donor for district A. In this case, the ratio of newly hired teachers to the total number of teachers in district B was multiplied by the total number of teachers reported in district A to yield the number that was filled in for the total number of newly hired teachers in district A. Consequently, while district A had the same ratio of newly hired teachers to total teachers as district B, the actual number of newly hired teachers was likely to be different.\n\n\fChapter 8. Imputation Procedures 133\n\nThe School District Questionnaire records were grouped into 23 state groups (typically according to their geographic location) so that records for similar districts were together. District records were sorted by the following variables to ensure similarity between the records receiving information and their donors:\n\nGROUP STATE LEVEL URB D0051\n\nGroups of states with similar districts State in which the school district is located Grade levels offered Proximity to a metropolitan center Total K\u201312 and ungraded enrollment\n\nFor items 5 through 7, 12 through 14, and 24 through 70, records were sorted by GROUP / STATE / LEVEL / URB / D0051. For items 2 through 4, 8 through 11, 15 through 23, and 71 through 77, the records were sorted by GROUP / STATE / URB / D0051.\n\nTable 33 includes a summary of the amount of imputation performed in stage 2 processing.\n\nThird-Stage Imputation for School District Data\n\nClerical Imputation\n\nValues were imputed clerically for cases where there was no available donor, the value imputed by computer was out-of-range or inconsistent with values in other items, or there was no method of imputation appropriate for the item other than clerical imputation. In order to determine an appropriate value for each unanswered item, Census Bureau analysts reviewed\n\n\u2022 the original image of the questionnaire to see if the respondent had made any notes in the margin that might provide insight;\n\u2022 other items within the same record with related information; \u2022 similar cases to get an understanding of what the respondent might have answered; and/or \u2022 averages of similar subsamples.\n\nTable 33 includes a summary of the amount of imputation performed in stage 3 processing.\n\nFinal File Imputation Table for School District Data\n\nDistrict-level data were collected on the School District Questionnaire or the Unified School Questionnaire. Please see the \u201cImputation Procedures for the Unified School Questionnaire\u201d section below for details on the processing of the Unified School Questionnaire data. Public and public charter one-school districts had their district data collected on the Unified School Questionnaire and were imputed separately from public and public charter school districts that completed the School District Questionnaire. Following stage 3 imputation, the school district items that were included on the Unified School Questionnaire were included in the final school district data file, while the school items on the Unified School Questionnaire were included in the public school data file for public and public charter schools. The School District Questionnaire items that were not asked on the Unified School Questionnaire (e.g., items concerning district-wide library media centers, principal hiring policies, homeschooling) were assigned a value of -8, which indicates they were \u201cNot asked of one-school districts\u201d for the Unified School Questionnaire records. Data from the Unified School Questionnaire for BIA-funded schools were placed on the BIA School data file.

For example, during stage 1 imputation 124 survey items were imputed for between 1 and 15 percent of the public school district records.\n\nTable 33.

Imputation Changes to Variables, by Data File,\u201d contains the total number of imputations applied at each stage to each source code.\n\nImputation Procedures for the Principal and Private School Principal Questionnaires (Forms SASS-2A and -2B)\n\nPrincipal data for public, public charter, private, and BIA-funded schools were on the same data file when entering the imputation step of data processing. Items on the principal questionnaires that still had items that were \u201cnot answered\u201d went through the first stage of imputation in which unanswered items were imputed from other items on the same principal record or items on the corresponding school record. Before the principal questionnaires went through the second stage of imputation, both public charter school principals and private school principals were split into their own data files in order to establish appropriate donors and sort patterns. Data for principals from BIA-funded schools were kept in the same dataset as data for principals from public schools. The second and third stages of imputation proceeded with the data split into these types of datasets. After all stages of imputation were completed and no more \u201cnot answered\u201d items remained, the BIA-funded school and private school principal data remained in their own separate datasets. Public and public charter school principal data were moved back into the same data file.\n\nFirst-Stage Imputation for Principal Data\n\nIn the first stage, items that were unanswered on the principal questionnaires were filled in whenever possible by using information about the principal from these sources:\n\n\u2022 Other questionnaire items on the principal questionnaire record. Based on entries from related items on the principal record, assumptions were made about how the respondent might have answered the item. For example, if there was no response to item 1 (total number of years spent as a principal at any school), and item 2 (total number of years spent as principal of the current school) indicated that the respondent had been a principal at the school since he or she was 22 years of age, it was assumed that the respondent had only been principal of the current school. The answer to item 2 was filled in for item 1.\n\n\fChapter 8. Imputation Procedures 135\n\n\u2022 School questionnaire record. Information from the record of the principal\u2019s school was used to impute values in the first stage as well. For example, if item 15, on the level of influence that particular groups have on the school, had any section asking about curriculum specialists unanswered, and the school record indicated there were no curriculum specialists at the school, then \u201cNo Influence\u201d was imputed for these items.\n\nTables 34 through 36 include summaries of the amount of imputation performed in stage 1 processing.\n\nSecond-Stage Imputation for Principal Data\n\nHot Deck Imputation\n\nIn general, the hot deck imputation filled unanswered items using data from the record for a similar principal (e.g., a principal of similar age, experience, education, etc.) who worked at a similar school (e.g., a school that was the same level, the same type, of similar size, etc.). Imputation variables that describe certain characteristics of the principals and their schools were created and used to sort the records and to match incomplete records to those with complete entries (donors).\n\nFor some items, such as item 5 (whether or not the principal also serves as a teacher in the school), data were copied directly from the donor to the record with the missing value. For other items, such as item 10 (number of hours spent per week on school-related activities), the entries on the donor record were factored with other questionnaire data to fill in the incomplete items. For example, if item 10 was unanswered, the donor\u2019s ratio of hours spent on school activities per week to hours spent interacting with students was multiplied by the principal\u2019s reported hours spent interacting with students to calculate the answer that was imputed into item 10.\nPublic School and BIA-Funded School24 Principals. BIA-funded school principal data were kept in the same data file as the public school principal data and received the same processing as a result. Non-BIAfunded school principals could be in a donor relationship with BIA-funded school principals.\n\nThe hot deck imputation was done within state; that is, the donor principal record had to be from the same state as the principal record with missing data. Within each state, the principal records were sorted by the following variables:\n\nDEGREE LEVEL EXPER YEARPRIN HOWOLD GFIPCT TYPE\n\nHighest degree attained Grade levels offered Years of educational experience Years served as a principal Principal\u2019s age FIPS county code for the county of the respondent\u2019s school School type\n\nFor item 44, the records were sorted by LEVEL / DEGREE / EXPER. For items 1 through 6 and 14, the records were sorted by LEVEL / DEGREE / YEARPRIN / HOWOLD. For items 7 through 13, 15 through 37, 41 through 43, and 45, the records were sorted by LEVEL / DEGREE / YEARPRIN / GFIPCT. For items 38 through 40, the records were sorted by LEVEL / TYPE / GFIPCT.\n\n24 \u201cBIA-funded school\u201d refers to schools funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) that were not operated by a local school district. These schools may be operated by BIA, a tribe, or a private contractor.\n\n\f136 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nPrivate School Principals. The hot deck imputation was done within general religious affiliation (AFFILG, where 1 = Catholic, 2 = Other religious, 3 = Nonsecular); that is, the donor principal record had to be for a principal at a school with the same general affiliation as the principal record with missing data. Within each general affiliation category, private school principals were sorted by the following variables:\n\nDEGREE LEVEL EXPER YEARPRIN HOWOLD AFFILR\n\nHighest degree attained Grade levels offered Years of educational experience Years served as a principal Principal\u2019s age School\u2019s religious affiliation25\n\nFor item 38, the records were sorted by LEVEL / DEGREE / EXPER. For items 1 through 6 and 13, the records were sorted by LEVEL / DEGREE / YEARPRIN / HOWOLD. For items 7 through 12, 14 through 37, and 39, the records were sorted by LEVEL / DEGREE / YEARPRIN / AFFILR.\n\nPublic Charter School Principals. Public charter school principal data were kept in the same dataset as the public school principal data through the first stage of imputation. However, the datasets were split prior to hot deck imputation. This was to ensure that no non-public charter school data would be used in the charter school imputation process. Because there were only 220 public charter school principals that were accepted as completed interviews in the data file, it was not possible to use donor imputation for these records. Public charter school data went directly into the next steps of processing, which included regression subsample ratio imputation.\n\nRegression Imputation\n\nFollowing hot deck imputation, some unanswered items remained. For questions that ask for continuous value answers, such as Principal Questionnaire item 45 (current annual salary), simple linear regression was used to impute the data. Linear models for such items were based on data from other items on the questionnaire and data from the school survey. For example, to impute item 45, a model of public school principal salary was created through linear regression using the answers to item 1 (total number of years served as a principal in all schools), item 2 (years spent as a teacher prior to becoming a principal), item 9 (highest degree earned), item 10 (total hours spent per week on all school related activities), item 11 (total hours spent per week interacting with students), item 2 from the public school survey (total K\u201312 and ungraded school enrollment), and URB (a numerical variable based on the school\u2019s proximity to a metropolitan center) as coefficients in the linear regression model.\n\nItems used in the regression model were selected based on how much explanatory power each had in the model and the manner in which each influenced the overall explanatory power of the model. This was measured by examining the coefficient of the variable in the regression, as well as the adjusted R-squared statistic associated with the model. In addition, the certainty of the relationship established through regression was a factor in determining which variables to use in the regression. This was measured by the t statistic associated with the coefficient of each variable in the regression, as well as the overall F statistic associated with the model.\n\n25 AFFILR indicates the religion with which the private school was associated. A code of 26 was assigned when there was no religious affiliation associated with the school.\n\n\fChapter 8. Imputation Procedures 137\nSubsample Ratio Imputation\nFor items that lacked data following hot deck imputation and required categorical answers, subsample ratio imputation was employed. First, data were broken into five subsamples based on the value of LEVEL (grade levels offered at the school). Then, the ratio of each type of response was found for each subsample. Finally, the items were assigned answers according to the subsample they belonged to in such a way as to preserve the response ratios within that subsample.\nFor example, on Principal Questionnaire item 15b(1) (level of influence of state department of education or other state-level bodies on school\u2019s curriculum), there were five available answer categories ranging from 1 (no influence) to 4 (major influence) with 5 indicating \u201cnot applicable.\u201d If it was found that 10 percent of respondents with LEVEL equal to 1 answered \u201c1\u201d for this item, and 90 percent answered \u201c2\u201d and that when LEVEL was equal to 3, some 80 percent answered \u201c3\u201d and 20 percent answered \u201c4,\u201d then items were imputed to maintain this ratio.\nTables 34 through 36 include summaries of the amount of imputation performed in stage 2 processing.\nThird-Stage Imputation for Principal Data\nClerical Imputation\nSome values on the public, public charter, private, and BIA-funded school principal records were imputed clerically. This method was used when there was no available donor that matched the record with the missing values, when the imputed values were outside the range of valid entries or inconsistent with other entries on the record, or if there was no method of imputation appropriate for the item other than clerical imputation. In order to determine an appropriate value for each unanswered item, Census Bureau analysts reviewed\n\u2022 the original image of the questionnaire, to see if the respondent had made any notes in the margin that might provide insight;\n\u2022 other items within the same record with related information; \u2022 similar cases, to get an understanding of what the respondent might have answered; and/or \u2022 averages of similar subsamples.\nTables 34 through 36 include summaries of the amount of imputation performed in stage 3 processing.\nFinal File Imputation Tables for Principal Data\nFollowing stage 3 processing, public charter school principal records were added back into the public school principal data file, while BIA-funded school principal records were removed and placed in a separate BIA school principal data file for the final data files. The number of source codes (specific items) that were imputed on a given percentage of records during a given stage of processing appears below in tables 34 through 36. For example, during stage 1 imputation 115 survey items were imputed for between 1 and 15 percent of the public school (including public charter school) principal records.\n\n\f138 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable 34.

Items on the School Questionnaire that were \u201cnot answered\u201d went through a first\n\n\fChapter 8. Imputation Procedures 139\nstage of imputation in which unanswered items were imputed from other items on the same school record, items on the corresponding school district record, or items from the Teacher Listing Form. Before the public school questionnaires went through the second stage of imputation, public charter schools were split into their own data file in order to establish appropriate donors and sort patterns. The second and third stages of imputation proceeded with the data split into these types of datasets. After all stages of imputation were completed and no more \u201cnot answered\u201d items remained, the public and public charter school data were moved back into the same data file.\nPublic and public charter one-school districts had their school data collected on the Unified School Questionnaire and were imputed separately from the public and public charter schools that completed the School Questionnaire. Following the stage 3 imputation of both the School Questionnaire and Unified School Questionnaire items, the school items that appeared on the Unified School Questionnaire were split out from the Unified School Questionnaire data file and were included in the School Questionnaire public school data file. More details are available in the \u201cImputation Procedures for the Unified School Questionnaire\u201d section below.\nFirst-Stage Imputation for Public and Public Charter School Data\nIn the first stage, unanswered items for the School Questionnaire were filled whenever possible by using information about the school from these sources:\n\u2022 Other questionnaire items on the school\u2019s public school questionnaire record. Based on entries from related items on the school record, assumptions were made about how the respondent might have answered items. For example, if the type of school was not reported in item 14, and item 17a indicated the school had a magnet program, code 3, \u201cSpecial program emphasis,\u201d was imputed to item 14.\n\u2022 School District Questionnaire record for the district that operated the school. If the school\u2019s district participated in SASS, information from the district\u2019s questionnaire was used to complete some unanswered items on the school record. For example, if the number of migrant students was not reported in item 3 and the School District Questionnaire record indicated that there were no migrant students in the district, then zero was imputed to item 3.\n\u2022 Teacher Listing Form for the school. If the counts of full-time and part-time teachers were not reported in item 34 of the School Questionnaire and the school had completed a Teacher Listing Form, the counts of full-time and part-time teachers from the Teacher Listing Form were used to impute missing values in item 34.\n\u2022 School\u2019s sample file record, including data from the 2001\u201302 CCD. In some cases CCD data from the school\u2019s sample file record were used to complete items. For example, if there was no response to item 55a, whether or not the school has prekindergarten students, and the sample file indicated that there were prekindergarten students in the school, \u201cyes\u201d was imputed to the item.\nIn addition to filling in items where values were missing, some inconsistencies between items were corrected by ratio adjustment during the first stage of imputation. For example, if the sum of the students reported by the racial categories in item 5 was greater than the school\u2019s total enrollment reported in item 2, the assumption was made that the proportions assigned to the categories were correct, and the counts in item 5 were adjusted to fit the total reported in item 2; that is, each entry in item 5 was multiplied by the ratio of the enrollment reported in item 2 to the sum of the entries in item 5.\nTable 37 includes a summary of the amount of imputation performed in stage 1 processing.\n\n\f140 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nSecond-Stage Imputation for Public and Public Charter School Data\n\nHot Deck Imputation\n\nIn the second stage of imputation, School Questionnaire items that remained unanswered were filled by using data from the record for a similar school (e.g., a school that was the same level, type, etc.). Imputation variables that describe certain characteristics of the school (e.g., type of community where school is located, type of school, and school level) were created and used to sort the records and to match incomplete records to those with complete data (donors).\n\nFor some items, such as item 53 (whether students with limited-English proficiency are tested to determine their level of English proficiency), data were copied directly from the donor to the record with the missing value. For others, such as item 62 (number of Title I teachers), the entries on the donor record were used as factors along with other questionnaire data to fill the incomplete items. For example, if item 62 was unanswered for school A, the number of teachers who were Title I on the donor record were used with the total teacher count for school A to calculate and impute the number of Title I teachers for school A (school A item 34 = school A total teacher count * (donor school item 34 / donor school total teacher count)).\n\nPublic Schools. The second stage imputation was done within state; that is, the donor record had to be for a school located in the same state as the school with the incomplete record. Within each state, the public school records were sorted by the following variables:\n\nSTCNTY S0414 TYPE LEVEL MINEN URB\n\nSample file code identifying the state and county location of the school Total enrollment School type Grade levels offered Minority enrollment Proximity to a metropolitan center\n\nFor items 34, 1, 7, 27 through 33, 40 through 44, 4, 18, 20 through 21, 22, 24, 38, 39, 9, 10, 36, the records were sorted by LEVEL / TYPE / STCNTY / S0414. For items 5, 3, 37, 35, 47 through 54, 6, 56 through 62, 45 through 46, and 17, the records were sorted by LEVEL / MINEN / URB /STCNTY / S0414.\n\nPublic Charter Schools. Public charter school data were kept in the same data file as the public school data through the first stage of imputation. However the datasets were split prior to hot deck imputation. This ensured that no non-public charter school data would be used in the public charter school imputation process. Because there were only 190 public charter schools in the dataset, it was not possible to use donor imputation on the dataset and public charter school data went directly into clerical imputation.\n\nTable 37 includes a summary of the amount of imputation performed in stage 2 processing.\n\nThird-Stage Imputation for Public and Public Charter School Data\n\nClerical Imputation\n\nSome values on the public school records were imputed clerically. This method was used when there was no available donor that matched the record with the missing values, and when the computer-imputed value was outside the range of valid entries or inconsistent with other entries on the record, or if there was\n\n\fChapter 8. Imputation Procedures 141\n\nno method of imputation appropriate for the item other than clerical imputation. In order to determine an appropriate value for each unanswered item, Census Bureau analysts reviewed\n\n\u2022 the original image of the questionnaire, to see if the respondent had made any notes in the margin that might provide insight;\n\u2022 other items within the same record with related information; \u2022 similar cases, to get an understanding of what the respondent might have answered; and/or \u2022 averages of similar subsamples.\n\nTable 37 includes a summary of the amount of imputation performed in stage 3 processing.\n\nFinal File Imputation Table for Public School Data\n\nOne of the 2003\u201304 SASS questionnaires was the Unified School Questionnaire. This questionnaire was distributed to school district institutions with only one school and included items from the School Questionnaire and the School District Questionnaire in order to simultaneously collect information on the school district and the single school administered by that school district. All BIA-funded schools received the Unified School Questionnaire. Following stage 3 imputation, items on the questionnaire that dealt with the school district were included in the final school district data file, while the items that dealt with the school were included either on the public school data file, if the school was not a BIA-funded school, or on the BIA-funded school data file otherwise. Below is a summary of the amount of imputation performed on both the School Questionnaire and the school items included on the Unified School Questionnaire. Please see the \u201cImputation Procedures for the Unified School Questionnaire\u201d section below for details on the processing of Unified School Questionnaire data and for the table indicating the amount of imputation performed on the Unified School Questionnaire given to BIA-funded schools. The number of source codes (specific items), including unified school items, that were imputed on a given percentage of records during a given stage of processing appears below in table 37. For example, during stage 1 imputation 135 survey items were imputed for between 1 and 15 percent of the public school records.\n\nTable 37.

Imputation Changes to Variables, by Data File,\u201d contains the total number of imputations applied at each stage to each source code.\n\n\f142 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nImputation Procedures for the Private School Questionnaire (Form SASS-3B)\nThe 2003\u201304 school year was a survey year for both SASS and PSS. The SASS Private School Questionnaire collected the same items that are present on PSS, plus additional SASS school data, for the private schools included in the SASS sample. Items 1 through 5a\u2013e, 7 through 9, 14 through 21, 24, 32 through 34, and 96 through 100 (the PSS items within the Private School Questionnaire records) were processed with the PSS data files. Therefore, imputation for the Private School Questionnaire data was done in six stages: PSS stage 1, SASS Private School Questionnaire stage 1, PSS stage 2, SASS Private School Questionnaire stage 2, PSS clerical imputation, and SASS Private School Questionnaire clerical imputation. Following each PSS processing step the relevant PSS data were copied onto the corresponding SASS Private School Questionnaire records.\nFirst-Stage Imputation for Private School Data\nIn the first stage of imputation, values for unanswered items were imputed whenever possible by using information about the school from these sources:\n\u2022 2003\u201304 PSS. If PSS items (items 1\u20135, 7\u20139, 14\u201321, 24, 32\u201334, and 96\u2013100) on the SASS Private School Questionnaire record were unanswered, data from the 2001\u201302 PSS were used to fill the unanswered items whenever possible. For example, if the school\u2019s religious affiliation was not reported in item 14c and it had been reported on the 2001\u201302 PSS questionnaire, the PSS entry was copied to item 14c of the Private School Questionnaire record.\n\u2022 Other questionnaire items on the school\u2019s Private School Questionnaire record. Based on entries from related items on the school record, assumptions were made about how the respondent might have answered items with missing values. For example, if item 40b(4) (whether the school is specifically for special needs students) was unanswered and item 15 indicated the school was a special education school, the assumption was made that the school was specifically for special needs students and the code for \u201cYes\u201d was imputed to item 40b(4).\nIn addition to filling in items where values were missing, some inconsistencies between items were corrected by ratio adjustment during the first stage of imputation. For those where the number of teachers reported in item 25 (teachers by race) did not equal the number reported in item 24, the entries in item 25 were adjusted. For example, if the sum of the teachers reported by the racial categories in item 25 were greater than the total number of teachers reported in item 24, the assumption was made that the proportions assigned to the categories in item 25 were correct and the counts in item 25 were adjusted to fit the total reported in item 24; that is, each entry in item 25 was multiplied by the ratio of the teacher count reported in item 24 to the sum of the entries in item 25.\nTable 38 includes a summary of the amount of imputation performed in stage 1 processing.\nSecond-Stage Imputation for Private School Data\nHot Deck Imputation\nIn the second stage of imputation, unanswered items for the Private School Questionnaire were filled by using data from the records for similar schools (e.g., schools that were the same level, type, size, etc.). As noted previously, items 1 through 5, 7 through 9, 14 through 21, 24, 32 through 34, and 96 through 100 were imputed during the PSS processing. Therefore, for these items, the imputed entries could have come\n\n\fChapter 8. Imputation Procedures 143\n\nfrom private schools not selected for SASS, as well as those that participated in SASS. For non-PSS items, entries were imputed by using data from other SASS private schools.\n\nFor some items, such as item 75 (whether or not most students have access to the internet at the school), data were copied directly from the donor to the record with the missing value. For others, such as item 10 (school capacity), the entries on the donor record were used as factors along with other questionnaire data to fill the incomplete items. For example, if item 10 was unanswered, the donor survey\u2019s ratio of school capacity to total enrollment was multiplied by the reported total enrollment to yield the value of school capacity that was imputed into item 10.\n\nImputation variables that describe certain characteristics of the schools (e.g., religious affiliation, size, and school level) were created and used to sort the records and to match incomplete records to those with complete data (donors). During the stage 2 imputations, the school records were sorted so that records for similar schools were near each other on the file. The variables used for sorting were as follows:\n\nS0734\nTYPE\nLEVEL\nPERMINOR\nURB AFFILR26 AFFILG27 AFFILS28\n\nTotal enrollment School type Grade levels offered Percent of enrollment that is minority Proximity to a metropolitan center School\u2019s religious affiliation School\u2019s general affiliation School\u2019s religious and or association affiliation\n\nDuring the PSS second-stage imputation, the PSS school records (those selected for SASS and those that were not) were sorted AFFLG / LEVEL / AFFILS / TYPE / P305 (PSS total enrollment variable).\n\nThe items that were not part of PSS, the records for SASS private schools for items 5f, 10 through 13, 22 through 23, 30 through 31, 35 through 63, 26, 73, 74, 76, 75, and 77 through 80 were sorted by AFFLG / LEVEL / AFFILS / TYPE / AFFILR / URB / S0734. For items 6, 25, 27, 64 through 72, 89 through 95, and 81 through 88, the records were sorted by AFFLG / LEVEL / AFFILS / URB / PERMINOR / S0734.\n\nTable 38 includes a summary of the amount of imputation performed in stage 2 processing.\n\nThird-Stage Imputation for Private School Data\n\nClerical Imputation\n\nSome values on the private school records were imputed clerically. This method was used when there was no available donor that matched the record with the missing values, and when the computer-imputed value was outside the range of valid entries or inconsistent with other entries on the record. This method was also used for schools where the religious affiliation was not reported and there was no previous PSS information available, or if there was no method of imputation appropriate for the item other than clerical\n\n26 AFFILR indicates the specific religion with which the private school was associated. There were 26 different\nreligious affiliation indicators. 27 AFFILG indicates the school\u2019s general affiliation. This indicates if the school was Catholic, Other religious\naffiliation, or No religious affiliation. 28 AFFILS indicates the school\u2019s religious and/or associated affiliation. It provides more detailed categories for type\nof Catholic or nonsecular school and identifies whether the school was affiliated with the Conservative Christian\nschool association.\n\n\f144 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nimputation.

Imputation Changes to Variables, by Data File,\u201d contains the total number of imputations applied at each stage to each source code.\n\nImputation Procedures for the Unified School Questionnaire (Form SASS-3Y)\n\nThe Unified School Questionnaire was sent to public and public charter school districts with only one school and all BIA-funded schools. In order to simultaneously collect data on the school and the school district that administers the school, items from the School District Questionnaire and the School Questionnaire were included. After all stages of imputation were completed and no more \u201cnot answered\u201d items remained, the BIA-funded schools that received the Unified School Questionnaire were separated into a single dataset. The remaining public and public charter school records had their data split between the school district data file and the public school data file. Thus, items dealing with school district information for public and public charter schools were included on the school district data file and items providing school level information for public and public charter schools were added to the public school data file.\n\n\fChapter 8. Imputation Procedures 145\nFirst-Stage Imputation for Unified School Data\nIn the first stage, Unified School Questionnaire unanswered items were filled whenever possible by using information about the school from these sources:\n\u2022 Other questionnaire items on the school\u2019s Unified School Questionnaire record. Based on entries from related items on the school record, assumptions were made about how the respondent might have answered items. For example, if the type of school was not reported in item 15, and item 18a indicated the school had a magnet program, code 3, \u201cSpecial program emphasis,\u201d was imputed to item 15.\n\u2022 Teacher Listing Form for the school. If the counts of full-time and part-time teachers were not reported in item 51 of the Unified School Questionnaire and the school had completed a Teacher Listing Form, the counts of full-time and part-time teachers from the Teacher Listing Form were used to impute missing values in item 51.\n\u2022 School\u2019s sample file record, including data from the 2001\u201302 CCD. In some cases, CCD data from the school\u2019s sample file record were used to complete items. For example, if item 15, type of school, was unanswered and the sample file indicated the type of school, then the sample file type was imputed to the item.\nIn addition to filling in items where values were missing, some inconsistencies between items were corrected by ratio adjustment during the first stage of imputation. For example, if the sum of the students reported by the racial categories in item 5 was greater than the school\u2019s total enrollment reported in item 2, the assumption was made that the proportions assigned to the categories were correct, and the counts in item 5 were adjusted to fit the total reported in item 2; that is, each entry in item 5 was multiplied by the ratio of the enrollment reported in item 2 to the sum of the entries in item 5.\nTable 39 contains the amount of stage 1 imputation performed on BIA-funded school records. Imputation count information is included in table 33 for the items that deal with the district data, while imputation count information for items dealing with public school data are included in table 37.\nSecond-Stage Imputation for Unified School Data\nHot Deck Imputation\nSince there were relatively few Unified School Questionnaire records, it was not possible to perform hot deck imputation on them. As a result, the records only underwent regression imputation, subsample ratio imputation, and clerical imputation.\nRegression Imputation\nFor questions that asked for continuous value answers, such as item 68a on the Unified School Questionnaire (annual salary for a teacher with a bachelor\u2019s degree and no teaching experience), simple linear regression was used to impute data. Linear models for such items were based on data both from other items on the questionnaire and data from the school survey. For example, to impute item 68a a model of the salary of teachers with no experience and a bachelor\u2019s degree was created through linear regression using the answers to item 63 (contract length), item 51 (number of full-time and part-time teachers employed at the school), and URB (a numerical variable based on the school\u2019s proximity to a metropolitan center) as coefficients in the linear regression model.\nItems used in the regression model were selected based on how much explanatory power each had in the model and the manner in which each influenced the overall explanatory power of the model. This was\n\n\f146 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nmeasured by examining the coefficient of the variable in the regression, as well as the adjusted R-squared statistic associated with the model. In addition, the certainty of the relationship established through regression was a factor in determining which variables to use in the regression. This was measured by the t statistic associated with the coefficient of each variable in the regression as well as the overall F statistic associated with the model.\nSubsample Ratio Imputation\nFor items that lacked data following first-stage imputation and required categorical answers, subsample ratio imputation was employed. First, data were broken into five subsamples based on the value of LEVEL (grade levels offered at the school). Then the ratio of each type of response was found for each subsample. Finally, the items were assigned answers according to the distribution within the subsample to which they belonged in order to preserve the response ratios within that subsample.\nFor example, on Unified School Questionnaire item 67 (whether or not there is a salary scale at the school), there were two available answer categories; 1 = \u201cyes\u201d and 2 = \u201cno.\u201d If 10 percent of the respondents with LEVEL equal to 1 answered \u201c1\u201d for this item and 90 percent answered \u201c2,\u201d then blank responses were imputed to maintain this ratio within the subsample.\nTable 39 contains the amount of stage 2 imputation performed on BIA-funded school records. Imputation count information is included in table 33 for the items that deal with the district data, while imputation count information for items dealing with public school data are included in table 37.\nThird-Stage Imputation for Unified School Data\nClerical Imputation\nSome values for records from the Unified School Questionnaire were imputed clerically. This method was used when there was no available donor that matched the record with the missing values, and when the computer-imputed value was outside the range of valid entries or inconsistent with other entries on the record, or if there was no method of imputation appropriate for the item other than clerical imputation. In order to determine an appropriate value for each unanswered item, Census Bureau analysts examined\n\u2022 the original image of the questionnaire, to see if the respondent had made any notes in the margins that might provide insight;\n\u2022 other items within the same record with related information; \u2022 similar cases, to get an understanding of what the respondent might have answered; and/or \u2022 averages of similar subsamples.\nTable 39 contains the amount of stage 3 imputation performed on BIA-funded school unified school records. Imputation count information is included in table 33 for the items that deal with the district data, while imputation count information for items dealing with public school data are included in table 37.\nFinal File Imputation Table for BIA-Funded School Data\nThe number of source codes (specific items) that were imputed on a given percentage of records during a given stage of processing appears below in table 39. For example, during stage 1 imputation 85 survey items were imputed for between 1 and 15 percent of the BIA-funded school records.\n\n\fChapter 8. Imputation Procedures 147\n\nTable 39.

Items on the teacher questionnaires that still had items that were \u201cnot answered\u201d went through a first stage of imputation in which unanswered items were imputed from other items on the same teacher record or items on the corresponding school record. The teacher questionnaires then went through the second stage of imputation in which some of the remaining \u201cnot answered\u201d items were filled using either the data record from a similar record or random ratio imputation. The third stage of imputation filled in the remaining \u201cnot answered\u201d items that were not resolved during the first two stages of imputation.\n\nAfter all stages of imputation were completed and no more \u201cnot answered\u201d items remained, the private school teacher data stayed in a separate dataset. The teacher data from BIA-funded school teachers were separated into a single dataset.

Based on entries from related items on the teacher record, assumptions were made about how the respondent might have answered items. For example, if item 4, which asks how much time spent at the school, was unanswered, and item 1 indicated that the teacher was a long-term substitute, and item 57 indicated that the teacher worked more than 35 hours per week, then \u201cfull-time\u201d was imputed to item 4.\n\u2022 School questionnaire record for the school in which the teacher taught. If the teacher\u2019s school participated in SASS, information from the record for the school was used to impute values in the first stage. For example, if Teacher Questionnaire item 49, which asks for the number of students\n\n\f148 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\ntaught with individual education plans (IEP), and item 45 on the school form indicated there were no students with IEPs, then zero was imputed to item 49 on the teacher form.\n\nIn addition to filling in items where values were missing, some inconsistencies between items were corrected by ratio adjustment during the first stage of imputation. For example, if the number of hours spent teaching different subjects reported in item 16 was greater than 40, then the ratio of hours per subject to total hours reported was maintained but was adjusted to be consistent with the total hours spent delivering instruction as reported in Teacher Questionnaire item 59.\n\nTables 40 through 42 include summaries of the amount of imputation performed in stage 1 processing.\n\nSecond-Stage Imputation for Teacher Data\n\nHot Deck Imputation\n\nIn general, hot deck imputation filled unanswered items by using data from the record for a similar teacher (e.g., a teacher of similar teaching level, etc.) who worked at a similar school (e.g., a school that was the same level, the same type, of similar size, etc.). Imputation variables that describe certain characteristics of the teachers and their schools were created and used to sort the records and to match incomplete records to those with complete entries (donors).\n\nFor some items, such as item 4 (how much time worked as a teacher in the school), data were copied directly to the record with the missing value. For other items, such as item 8 (year started teaching), the entries on the donor record were used as factors along with other questionnaire data to fill in the incomplete items. For example, if item 8 was unanswered, then the teacher\u2019s year of birth and the donor\u2019s age at the time they started teaching were used to impute an answer for item 8.\n\nPublic School Teachers. For stage 2, the states were combined into 23 groups according to their geographic location in order to increase the size of the data pool. All imputation was done within the state group; that is, the donor record had to be from a teacher within the same state group as the incomplete record. Within each state group, the records were sorted by the following variables:\n\nSTATE\nS0414 SCHKND29\nTEALEVEL\n\nState school location School\u2019s total enrollment Kind of school Grade levels taught\n\nThe records were sorted by STATE / SCHKND / TEALEVEL / S0414.\n\nPrivate School Teachers. The records were sorted by the following variables:\n\nAFFILG AFFILS TEALEVEL URB S0734\n\nSchool\u2019s general affiliation School\u2019s religious and/or association affiliation Grade levels taught Proximity to a metropolitan center School\u2019s total enrollment\n\nThe records were sorted by AFFILG / AFFILS / TEALEVEL / URB / S0734.\n\n29 SCHKND indicates whether the school is a regular public school (including Department of Defense and some one-school districts), BIA-funded school, or public charter school.\n\n\fChapter 8. Imputation Procedures 149\nBIA-funded School30 Teachers. BIA-funded school teacher data were in the same dataset as the rest of public school teacher data and received the same treatment. However, because SCHKND was one of the sorting variables, non-BIA-funded school teachers could not be in a donor relationship with BIA-funded school teachers.\nPublic Charter School Teachers. Public charter school teacher data were in the same dataset as the rest of public school teacher data and received the same treatment. However, because SCHKND was one of the sorting variables, non-public charter school teachers could not be in a donor relationship with public charter school teachers.\nRandom Subsample Ratio Imputation\nAfter hot deck imputations were completed, remaining unanswered items were filled in using a program that randomly assigned values to categorical variables while preserving the observed distribution of the data. The program also sorted the data in order to take into account those variables that might explain why respondents answered one way or another. Continuous variables were assigned a random \u201cplausible value\u201d (a value between the 5th and 95th percentile) to cases with missing responses based on the range of values provided by respondents with similar characteristics.\nFor example, type of school, level of classes taught, school program type, and teaching experience were used to define a subsample within the data. Then, if a record had an item missing and that record belonged to the subset within the data, a random answer was assigned to the record in such a way so as to maintain the distribution of answers to that item within that subsample. So, if it was found that for private, elementary, and Montessori school teachers with 20 years of teaching experience Teacher Questionnaire item 71, base academic pay, had a 5th percentile answer of $20,000 and a 95th percentile answer of $50,000, then the program randomly assigned answers consistent with that distribution to teachers that fit the description.\nTables 40 through 42 include summaries of the amount of imputation performed in stage 2 processing.\nThird-Stage Imputation for Teacher Data\nClerical Imputation\nFor cases where the respondent did not report gender in Teacher Questionnaire item 76, a value was imputed clerically by referring to the respondent\u2019s name whenever possible. For names that were not clearly gendered, Census Bureau analysts clerically imputed the item by looking at other records with similar characteristics (e.g., teaching assignment field, teaching level) and making an appropriate decision on a case-by-case basis. In addition, some values on the teacher records were imputed clerically when there was no available donor that matched the record with the missing values, when the computerimputed value was outside the range of valid entries or inconsistent with other entries on the record, or when there was no method of imputation appropriate for the item other than clerical imputation. In order to determine an appropriate value for each unanswered item, Census Bureau analysts reviewed\n\u2022 the original image of the questionnaire, to see if the respondent had made any notes in the margins that might provide insight;\n\u2022 other items within the same record with related information; \u2022 similar cases, to get an understanding of what the respondent might have answered; and/or\n30 BIA-funded school refers to schools funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) that were not operated by a local school district.

Imputation Changes to Variables, by Data File,\u201d contains the total number of imputations applied at each stage to each source code.\n\nImputation Procedures for the School Library Media Center Questionnaire (Form LS-1A)\n\nLibrary media center data for public and BIA-funded schools were on the same data file when entering the imputation step of data processing. Items from the School Library Media Center questionnaire that still had items that were \u201cnot answered\u201d went through a first stage of imputation in which unanswered items were imputed from other items on the same library media center record or items on the corresponding school record. The library media center data then went through the second stage of imputation in which some of the remaining \u201cnot answered\u201d items were filled using either the data record from a similar record, regression imputation, or random ratio imputation. The third stage of imputation filled in the remaining \u201cnot answered\u201d items that were not resolved during the first two stages of imputation. After all stages of imputation were completed and no more \u201cnot answered\u201d items remained, the library media center data from BIA-funded schools were separated into a single dataset.\n\nFirst-Stage Imputation for School Library Media Center Data\n\nIn the first stage, unanswered items were completed whenever possible by using information about the school library from the following sources:\n\n\u2022 Other questionnaire items on the library record. Based on entries from related items on the library record, some assumptions were made about how the respondent might have answered items. For example, if item 4 on the School Library Media Center Questionnaire (whether the library has a paid state-certified librarian) was unanswered and item 12 indicated that no school staff member has primary responsibility for the library, the code for \u201cYes\u201d was imputed to item 4.\n\u2022 Matching SASS school questionnaire. For a few unanswered items, data from the matching school record were used to impute the entries. For example, if item 6 on the School Library Media Center Questionnaire was unanswered and entries on the school record indicated that the school did not have any library aides, the code for \u201cNo\u201d was imputed to item 6 of the library record.\n\nTables 43 and 44 include summaries of the amount of imputation performed in stage 1 processing.\n\n\f152 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nSecond-Stage Imputation for School Library Media Center Data\n\nHot Deck Imputation\n\nIn general, the second stage of imputation filled unanswered items by using data from the record for a library of a similar school (e.g., a school that was the same level, of similar size, located in same type of community). Imputation variables that described certain characteristics of the schools (e.g., enrollment size and school level) were copied from the matching school record. In addition, a variable that categorized the size of the library was created by using the number of books held at the end of the 2002\u2013 03 school year. These school variables and the library variable were used to sort the library records and to match incomplete records to those with complete entries (donors).\n\nFor some items, such as item 1 on the School Library Media Center Questionnaire (whether library is centralized or decentralized), data were directly copied to the record with the missing value. For others, however, such as item 18a(2) (number of books acquired during the 2002\u201303 school year), entries on the donor record were used as factors along with other information on the incomplete record to fill the unanswered items. For example, if the number of books held was reported for Library A, but the number acquired was not, the donor\u2019s ratio of books acquired to books held was used with the number of books held by Library A to impute the number acquired by Library A (Library A books acquired = Library A books held * (donor library books acquired / donor library books held)).\n\nPublic School Library Media Centers. The School Library Media Center Questionnaire records were sorted so that records for libraries of similar schools were near each other on the file. The data were sorted by the following variables:\n\nSTATE ENR LEVEL URB M0089\n\nState location of school School\u2019s total enrollment Grade levels offered Proximity to a metropolitan center Total number of books in library\n\nThe records were sorted by STATE / ENR / LEVEL / URB / M0089.\nBIA-funded School31 Library Media Centers. BIA-funded school library media centers were not treated separately from public school library media centers.\n\nPublic Charter School Library Media Centers. Public charter school library data were kept in the same dataset as the public school library data through the first stage of imputation. However, the datasets were split prior to hot deck imputation to ensure that no non-public charter school library data would be used in the public charter school library imputation process. Because there were a relatively small number of school libraries in the dataset, it was not possible to use hot deck imputation on the dataset containing only public charter school library data. As a result, public charter school library data went directly into the next steps of processing, which included regression imputation and subsample ratio imputation.\n\nRegression Imputation\n\nFollowing hot deck imputation, there were still some unanswered items. For questions that ask for continuous value answers, such as item 21b on the School Library Media Center Questionnaire (total\n\n31 BIA-funded school refers to schools funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) that were not operated by a local school district. These schools may be operated by BIA, a tribe, or a private contractor.\n\n\fChapter 8. Imputation Procedures 153\namount spent on electronic databases in the 2002\u201303 school year), simple linear regression was used to impute data. Linear models for such items were based on other items on the questionnaire. For example, to impute item 21b, a model of expenditures on electronic databases was created through linear regression using the answers to item 18b(3) (amount spent on video materials), item 18c(3) (amount spent on CDROM titles), and item 19c (amount spent on subscriptions).\nItems used in the regression model were selected based on how much explanatory power each had in the model and the manner in which each influenced the overall explanatory power of the model. This was measured by examining the coefficient of the variable in the regression, as well as the adjusted R-squared statistic associated with the model. In addition, the certainty of the relationship established through regression was a factor in determining which variables to use in the regression. This was measured by the t statistic associated with the coefficient of each variable in the regression, as well as the overall F statistic associated with the model.\nSubsample Ratio Imputation\nFor items that lacked data following hot deck imputation and required categorical answers, subsample ratio imputation was employed. First, data were broken into five subsamples based on the value of LEVEL (grade levels offered at the school). Then the ratio of each type of response was found for each subsample. Finally, the items were assigned answers according to the subsample to which they belonged in such a way so as to preserve the response ratios within that subsample.\nFor example, on School Library Media Center Questionnaire item 20 (whether or not the library had access to electronic databases of periodicals provided for free), there were two answer categories available, \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d If it was found that 10 percent of respondents with LEVEL equal to 1 answered \u201cno\u201d for this item and 90 percent answered \u201cyes,\u201d then items were imputed to maintain this ratio.\nTables 43 and 44 include summaries of the amount of imputation performed in stage 2 processing.\nThird-Stage Imputation for School Library Media Center Data\nClerical Imputation\nSome values on the library records were imputed clerically. This method was used when there was no available donor that matched the record with the missing values, when the imputed values were outside the range of valid entries or inconsistent with other entries on the record, or when there was no method of imputation appropriate for the item other than clerical imputation. In order to determine an appropriate value for each unanswered item, Census Bureau analysts examined\n\u2022 the original image of the questionnaire, to see if the respondent had made any notes in the margins that might provide insight;\n\u2022 other items within the same record with related information; \u2022 similar cases, to get an understanding of what the respondent might have answered; and/or \u2022 averages of similar subsamples.\nTables 43 and 44 include summaries of the amount of imputation performed in stage 3 processing.\n\n\f154 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nFinal File Imputation Tables for School Library Media Center Data\n\nFollowing stage 3 processing, BIA-funded school library records were removed to create a separate dataset, while the public charter school library records where added back into the public school library dataset. The number of source codes (specific items) that were imputed on a given percentage of records during a given stage of processing appears for each file below in tables 43 and 44. For example, during stage 1 imputation 63 survey items were imputed for between 1 and 15 percent of the public school (including public charter school) library media centers.\n\nTable 43.

Weighting and Variance Estimation\nThis chapter describes the weighting procedure used for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). The final weights are needed to have the sample estimates reflect the target survey population when analyzing the data. In addition, the variance estimation procedures are discussed, which include the methods of estimating sampling errors for weighted estimates in SASS using the replicate weights. Weighting is presented first, followed by variance estimation.\nWeighting\nThis section describes the weighting processes for each SASS respondent. The general purpose of weighting is to inflate the sample estimates to represent the target survey population. The steps for weighting various types of respondents are largely the same. The initial basic weight (the inverse of the sampled unit\u2019s probability of selection at the time of initial selection) is used as the starting point, then a sampling adjustment factor is applied to account for any additional circumstances impacting the probability of selection (e.g., subsampling in the field). This product is the base weight. Next, a nonresponse adjustment factor is calculated and applied using whatever information is known about the respondents from the sampling frame data. Finally, various ratio adjustment factors are calculated and applied to the sample. The type and number of ratio adjustment factors varies with each SASS data file, but in general, they each adjust the sample totals to frame totals in order to reduce sampling variability.\nMost components of the weighting employed weighting classes in the calculation of the weighting adjustments. Weighting classes allow for differential adjustment factors to be computed for the same weighting component. This technique is especially useful when the computed factors are presumed to differ substantially, such as when patterns of nonresponse vary across subpopulations. For each component of SASS described in subsequent sections, the formula for computing the particular weighting component is presented, along with a brief description of each component of the weight. When computations were done within weighting classes, or cells, such as nonresponse adjustments, the cells are described. Sometimes a cell did not have enough data to produce a reliable estimate; in such cases, cells were collapsed. The most important variables were always collapsed last. The collapsing criteria are also described below for each component of SASS.\nThe school weight is described first since it is the primary sampling unit. The public, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funded, and private school weights have similar structures and are presented together. They differ only by the definition of the cells that were used to compute the nonresponse adjustment factor and the ratio adjustment factor(s). The specific weighting adjustment factors and cells are described in the second section. Since the public, BIA-funded, and private school administrator weights are similar to the school weights, they are described third. In the fourth section, the public school district weights are described. The fifth section describes how district base weights were computed. Teacher weights are described in the sixth section. Since the public, BIA-funded, and private school teacher weights have the same structure, they are presented together. They differ only in the definition of the cells that were used to compute the various weighting factors. These cells are described separately within the teacher weight section.

Weighting and Variance Estimation 157\nhigh school merge to become a junior/senior high school). Any changes in the school collapsing, as described in chapter 4 (i.e., uncollapsing or additional collapsing of schools), are adjusted for in this step. The collapsing described in chapter 4 is reflected in the initial basic weight.\nNonresponse Adjustment Factor is an adjustment that accounts for total school nonresponse. It is the weighted (product of initial basic weight and sampling adjustment factor) ratio of the total eligible in-scope schools (interviewed schools plus noninterviewed schools) to the total responding in-scope schools (interviewed schools) within cells. Variables used to define cells are presented in exhibit 7. At this stage of the weighting process, noninterviewed and out-of-scope schools are assigned a weight of zero.\nFirst-Stage Ratio Adjustment Factor is a factor that adjusts the sample estimates to known final frame totals after all frame construction. Construction of the frame is described in chapter 4. For public schools, the first-stage ratio adjustment factor is equal to the ratio of the total number of SASS frame noncertainty schools (i.e., schools not selected with certainty as described in chapter 4) to the weighted sample estimate of the total number of noncertainty schools within each weighting class, or cell, defined for this step in the weighting procedure. Certainty schools were excluded from both the numerator and denominators and were assigned a factor equal to one. Since all BIA-funded schools were selected with certainty, this step in the weighting was not applied to them. All BIA-funded schools received a factor of one. For private schools, the adjustment was the same, except for the area frame. For the area frame, all private schools in noncertainty primary sampling units were in sample and there were no universe counts for all noncertainty primary sampling units. These schools were assigned a factor equal to one. Certainty private schools were also excluded from this calculation and received a factor set equal to one.\nSecond-Stage Ratio Adjustment Factor applies only to private schools. It is a factor that adjusts sample estimates based on an older sampling frame to current independent control counts. For the 2003\u201304 SASS, the list frame for private schools was the current 2003\u201304 Private School Universe Survey (PSS) list frame, whereas the area frame was based on an older 2001\u201302 PSS area frame sample. The second-stage ratio adjustment factor is the ratio of the weighted 2003\u201304 PSS estimates of schools to the weighted 2003\u201304 SASS sample estimate of schools within each cell.\nSchool Weighting Adjustment Cells\nSchool noninterview and first- and second-stage ratio adjustments were computed within cells. The schools were classified into cells based on sampling frame data for the noninterview and first-stage ratio adjustments. For the second-stage ratio adjustment, private schools were classified into cells using questionnaire data.\nFor both public and private schools, schools selected with certainty were adjusted using a separate set of cells for the nonresponse adjustment within each sector. This was done due to changes in the variance methodology, which was changed to reflect a variance associated with nonresponding certainty schools. See the \u201cVariance Estimation\u201d section later in this chapter for further details on the variance methodology.\nPublic, Public Charter, BIA-Funded, and Private School Adjustment Cells\nThe following exhibit presents a summary of the collapsing criteria applied for each adjustment factor to the different types of schools in the weighting process.

The collapsing criteria are used within a cell, while the collapsing order is used to determine a similar cell with which to collapse. The categories used in the collapsing order differed by sector, type of public school, state, or affiliation stratum and are detailed in \u201cAppendix R. Weighting Adjustment Cells.\u201d Note that collapsing for public schools was restricted to within type (i.e., certainty, BIA-funded, public charter, high American Indian or Alaska Native enrollment, other). For example, if a particular cell in the certainty public school table met the collapsing criteria (i.e., had at least five interviewed schools, at least one noninterviewed school, and an initial factor of less than two), then it was not collapsed into another cell. However, if that cell did not meet any one of the above criteria, it was collapsed with a similar cell. In this case, the cell would have been collapsed into a cell with a similar enrollment. The number of noninterviewed schools was only used in certainty school cells to determine if the cell needed to be collapsed. In the certainty public school example above, the number of interviewed schools was insufficient to prevent collapsing of the nonresponse adjustment factor cells even though the number of\n\n\fChapter 9. Weighting and Variance Estimation 159\nnoninterviewed schools was sufficient. The number of interviews needed to keep the cell from collapsing was always used as a criterion for collapsing and can differ for different types of schools.\nPrincipal Weight (Principal and Private School Principal Questionnaires)\nThe public, public charter, BIA-funded, and private school principal weighting was done the same way as the school questionnaire weighting described above. Since the response status for each of the principal surveys and the corresponding school surveys could be different, the weighting process was done separately for each questionnaire. The sum of the principal weights may be less than the sum of the school weights because some schools do not have principals. See chapter 7 for a discussion of the interview status of schools and principals.\nPublic School District Weight (School District Questionnaire)\nThe final weight for the public school district data is the product of:\n(Initial Basic Weight) and (Sampling Adjustment Factor) and (Nonresponse Adjustment Factor) and (First-Stage Ratio Adjustment Factor)\nwhere:\nInitial Basic Weight is the inverse of the probability of selection of the district at the time of selection. Note that districts were not selected directly, making the computation of this probability more complex. See the next section, \u201cDistrict Initial Basic Weights,\u201d for a detailed description of the computation.\nSampling Adjustment Factor is an adjustment that accounts for circumstances that affect the district\u2019s probability of selection that are identified after the data collection has begun, such as a merger or split. For example, if two districts consolidated into one, the consolidated district\u2019s base weight would reflect the two chances of selection.\nNonresponse Adjustment Factor is an adjustment that accounts for total district nonresponse. It is the weighted (product of the initial basic weight and sampling adjustment factor) ratio of total eligible in-scope districts to the total responding in-scope districts, computed within weighting classes, or cells (as shown in exhibit 8), within each state. At this stage of the weighting, out-ofscope and noninterviewed districts were assigned a weight of zero. A separate nonresponse adjustment factor was computed for Hawaii. Since there is only one district in Hawaii, no amount of collapsing would satisfy the collapsing criteria.\nFirst-Stage Ratio Adjustment Factor is a factor that adjusts the sample estimates to the 2001\u201302 Common Core of Data (CCD) frame totals. It is the ratio of the total number of noncertainty districts in the frame to the weighted sample estimate of the total number of noncertainty districts in the frame, computed within weighting classes, or cells (as shown in exhibit 8), within each state. Certainty districts were assigned a factor of one.\n\n\f160 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nExhibit 8.

Some of the criteria (collapsing criteria) apply within a cell, while the other criteria (collapsing order) are used to determine a similar cell with which to collapse. Criteria vary by whether or not the district was selected with certainty.\n\nDistrict Initial Basic Weights\n\nGiven the complexity of the sampling scheme, the calculation of the district initial basic weights is not straightforward. Districts were divided into two groups: 1) districts outside Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and West Virginia; and 2) districts in Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and West Virginia, which are all certainty districts.\n\nDistrict Base Weights for Districts Outside Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and West Virginia\n\nThe district sample was not selected directly through a district frame. Instead, the districts were selected through the school sampling. In other words, the districts associated with the sampled schools comprised the district sample. As a result, district weighting requires more factors than other respondents.\n\nSince schools were stratified by school level (i.e., elementary, secondary, and combined) and by type (i.e., high proportion of American Indian enrollment, public charter, other public) the probability of selection for district k, (Pk(sel)) can be written as follows:\n\nPk(sel) =\n\n1 - [(1 - Pk(HAI,ELM))(1 - Pk(HAI,SEC))(1 - Pk(HAI,COM)) (1 - Pk(PUB,ELM))(1 - Pk(PUB,SEC))(1 - Pk(PUB,COM)) (1 - Pk(CHA,ELM))(1 - Pk(CHA,SEC))(1 - Pk(CHA,COM))]\n\nwhere: Pk(HAI,ELM) is the probability of selecting district k that includes schools that are classified as elementary (ELM) and have a high American Indian enrollment (HAI). This equals the sum of the school selection probabilities for the schools that are American Indian, elementary, and in district k. If the sum is greater than one, then Pk(HAI,ELM) is set equal to one.\n\nPk(HAI,SEC)\n\nis the probability of selecting district k that includes schools that are classified as secondary (SEC) and have a high American Indian enrollment (HAI). This equals the sum of the school selection probabilities for the schools that are American Indian, secondary, and in district k. If the sum is greater than one, then Pk(HAI,SEC) is set equal to one.\n\n\fChapter 9. Weighting and Variance Estimation 161\nPk(HAI,COM) is the probability of selecting district k which contains schools that are classified as combined (COM) and have a high American Indian enrollment (HAI). This equals the sum of the school selection probabilities for the schools that are American Indian, combined, and in district k. If the sum is greater than one, Pk(HAI,COM) is set equal to one.\nPk(PUB,ELM) is the probability of selecting district k which contains schools that are elementary (ELM) and are not public charter schools or do not have high American Indian enrollment (PUB). This equals the sum of the school selection probabilities for the schools that are not American Indian or public charter, but are elementary and in district k. If the sum is greater than one, then Pk(PUB,ELM) is set equal to one.\nPk(PUB,SEC) is the probability of selecting district k which contains schools that are secondary (SEC) and do not have a high American Indian enrollment or are not public charter schools (PUB). This equals the sum of the school selection probabilities for the schools that are not American Indian, not public charter, and are secondary and in district k. If the sum is greater than one, then Pk(PUB,SEC) is set equal to one.\nPk(PUB,COM) is the probability of selecting district k which contains schools that are combined (COM) and not American Indian or public charter (PUB). This equals the sum of the school selection probabilities for the schools that are not American Indian or public charter, are combined and in district k. If the sum is greater than one, then Pk(PUB,COM) is set equal to one.\nPk(CHA,ELM) is the probability of selecting district k which contains schools that are elementary (ELM) and public charter (CHA). This equals the sum of the school selection probabilities for the schools that are public charter, elementary, and in district k. If the sum is greater than one, then Pk(CHA,ELM) is set equal to one.\nPk(CHA,SEC) is the probability of selecting district k in which contains schools that are classified as secondary (SEC) and public charter (CHA). This equals the sum of the school selection probabilities for the schools that are public charter, secondary, and in district k. If the sum is greater than one, then Pk(CHA,SEC) is set equal to one.\nPk(CHA,COM) is the probability of selecting district k which contains schools that are classified as combined (COM) and public charter (CHA). This equals the sum of the school selection probabilities for the schools that are public charter, combined, and in district k. If the sum is greater than one, Pk(CHA,COM) is set equal to one.\nNote that 1/Pk(sel) equals the initial basic weight.\nDistrict Base Weights for Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and West Virginia\nThe initial basic weight was one for all districts in Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and West Virginia since all districts in these five states were guaranteed to be selected for sample. Their final weights, however, may not equal one due to adjustment for nonresponse.\n\n\f162 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nTeacher Weights (Teacher and Private School Teacher Questionnaires)\nThe final weight for public and private school teachers is the product of:\n(Initial Basic Weight) and (School Sampling Adjustment Factor) and (Teacher List Nonresponse Adjustment Factor) and (Teacher-Within-School Nonresponse Adjustment Factor) and (First-Stage Ratio Adjustment Factor) and (Teacher Adjustment Factor)\nwhere:\nInitial Basic Weight is the inverse of the probability of selection of the teacher at the time of selection.\nSampling Adjustment Factor is an adjustment that accounts for circumstances that affect the school\u2019s probability of selection that are identified after the data collection has begun, such as a merger, duplication, or incorrect building-level collapsing (i.e., a junior high school and a senior high school merge to become a junior/senior high school). Any changes in the school collapsing described in chapter 4 (i.e., uncollapsing or additional collapsing) are adjusted for in this step. The collapsing described in chapter 4 is reflected in the initial basic weight.\nTeacher List Nonresponse Adjustment Factor is an adjustment that accounts for teachers in schools that did not provide a list of its teachers. It is the weighted (the product of the school initial basic weight and the school sampling adjustment factor) ratio of total eligible in-scope schools to the total in-scope schools providing teacher lists, computed within cells. (See exhibit 9.)\nTeacher-within-school Nonresponse Adjustment factor is an adjustment that accounts for sampled teachers who did not respond to the survey. It is the weighted (product of all previously defined components) ratio of the total eligible teachers to the total eligible responding teachers computed within cells. (See exhibit 9.) At this stage of the weighting procedure, noninterviewed and out-ofscope teachers are assigned a weight of zero.\nFirst-Stage Ratio Adjustment Factor is a factor computed at the school level that adjusts the sampled schools\u2019 frame estimates of full-time equivalent (FTE) teachers to the total full-time equivalent teachers in the whole school sampling frame (either the 2001\u201302 CCD or the updated 2001\u201302 PSS). For the set of noncertainty schools, the factor is the ratio of the frame estimate of the total number of FTE teachers to the weighted (product of all previously defined components) sample estimate of the total number of FTE teachers. These factors are computed within cells. (See exhibit 9.) The sample estimate uses the frame count of the number of FTE teachers in the school.\nFor teachers from certainty schools, the factor is one.\nTeacher Adjustment Factor is a factor that adjusts the inconsistency between the estimated number of teachers from the SASS school data files and the SASS teacher data files. It is the ratio of the weighted number of teachers from the school data file for a cell to the weighted number of teachers on the teacher data file for a cell. The weight is the product of all previously defined components. This factor ensures that teacher estimates from the teacher file will agree with the corresponding teacher aggregates from the school file (after imputation), since the teacher file counts are being adjusted to agree with the school counts.\n\n\fChapter 9. Weighting and Variance Estimation 163\n\nThe teacher list nonresponse adjustments, the teacher-within-school nonresponse adjustments, the first-stage ratio adjustments, and the teacher adjustments are computed within cells. The cells for the teacher list nonresponse adjustments and the first-stage ratio adjustments are the same as those used in the school nonresponse and first-stage adjustments. The cells are described in the school weight section.\n\nExhibit 9.

The collapsing criteria apply within a cell, while the collapsing order is used to determine a similar cell with which to collapse. Criteria vary by school sector and type of school.\n\nSchool Library Weights (School Library Media Center Questionnaire)\n\nSASS school library media center data were used to estimate the characteristics of schools with library media centers as well as schools without library media centers. Whenever possible, sampled schools with library media centers and sampled schools without library media centers were adjusted separately. Thus, interviewed library media centers were weighted up to the weighted estimate of sampled schools known to have library media centers, as determined at the time school library media center questionnaires were distributed. Likewise, the number of interviewed schools without library media centers was weighted up to the weighted number of all schools without library media centers as determined from the questionnaire distribution. This was done to study the characteristics of each type of school. When it was not possible to adjust the library weights by the type of school, all sampled school library media centers and schools without library media centers were adjusted as a whole. This was necessary to handle instances where the existence of the library media center could not be established during data collection. Due to reporting inconsistencies between the school library media center questionnaire and the school questionnaire, school library media center survey data were not adjusted directly to schools reporting to have library media centers on the school questionnaire.\n\n\f164 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nThe final weight for the public school library media center data is the product of the following:\n(Initial School Basic Weight) and (Sampling Adjustment Factor) and (Library Type A, or Unknown status, Nonresponse Adjustment Factor) and (Library Type B, or Known Status, Nonresponse Adjustment Factor) and (First-Stage Ratio Adjustment Factor) where:\nInitial School Basic Weight is the inverse of the probability of selection from the school sample file as reflected at the time of the school sampling.\nSampling Adjustment Factor is an adjustment that accounts for circumstances that affect the school\u2019s probability of selection that were identified after the data collection has begun, such as a merger, duplication, or incorrect building-level collapsing (i.e., a junior high school and a senior high school merge to become a junior/senior high school). Any changes in the school collapsing described in chapter 4 (i.e., uncollapsing or additional collapsing) are adjusted for in this step. The collapsing described in chapter 4 is reflected in the initial basic weight.\nLibrary Type A (Unknown Status) Nonresponse Adjustment Factor is an adjustment that accounts for schools that were general refusals or were never contacted and the library media center status was not known. Because it was not clear if the school had a library media center or not, this factor adjusts all schools (with and without library media centers) together. It is the weighted (product of the initial basic weight and the sampling adjustment factor) ratio of the total school library media center records to the total in-scope interviewed school library media centers plus out-ofscope school library media centers.\nLibrary Type B (Known Status) Nonresponse Adjustment Factor is an adjustment that accounts for library media center nonrespondents where the status of the library media center is known based on the status of the library media center questionnaire. Given that schools with library media centers were able to be distinguished from schools without library media centers, this adjustment was made separately for SASS sampled schools with and without library media centers.\nSchools with libraries. This adjustment is the weighted (product of the initial basic weight and the sampling adjustment factor and the type A nonresponse adjustment factor) ratio of the interviewed schools with library media centers plus the noninterviewed schools with library media centers to the interviewed library media centers.\nSchools without libraries. This adjustment is the weighted (product of the initial basic weight and the sampling adjustment factor and the type A nonresponse adjustment factor) ratio of the interviewed schools without library media centers plus the noninterviewed schools without library media centers to the interviewed schools without library media centers.\nAt the conclusion of the nonresponse adjustment procedures, noninterviewed school library media centers were assigned a weight of zero.\nFirst-Stage Ratio Adjustment Factor is a factor that adjusts the sample estimates to known frame totals. Construction of the frame is described in chapter 4. For public schools, it is equal to the ratio of the total number of SASS frame noncertainty schools (i.e., those schools not selected with certainty as mentioned in chapter 4) to the weighted sample estimate of the total number of noncertainty schools within each weighting class, or cell, defined for this step in the weighting procedure. Certainty schools were excluded from both the numerator and denominators and were\n\n\fChapter 9. Weighting and Variance Estimation 165\n\nassigned a factor equal to one. Since all BIA-funded schools were selected with certainty, this step in the weighting did not apply, so all BIA-funded school received a factor of one.\n\nThis is the same factor that was applied to the SASS school sample.\n\nPublic, Public Charter, and BIA-Funded School Library Adjustment Cells\n\nLibrary noninterview and ratio adjustments were computed within cells.\n\nFor all school library media centers, the types A and B nonresponse adjustment cells were defined the same as those used for the school nonresponse adjustment in the school weighting. The general collapsing criteria were also the same as those used in the school nonresponse adjustment in the school weighting.\n\nFor all school library media centers, the first-stage ratio adjustment cells were the same as those used in the first-stage ratio adjustment in the school weighting. The collapsing criteria were also the same as those used in the first-stage ratio adjustment in the school weighting.\n\nPrivate school library media centers were not surveyed in the 2003\u201304 SASS.\n\nVariance Estimation\n\nThis section describes the variance estimation used for the 2003\u201304 SASS, how the replicates were assigned, and how to use the replicate weights to compute variances.\n\nProducing Replicate Weights\n\nIn surveys with complex sample designs, such as SASS, direct estimates of sampling errors that assume a simple random sample will typically underestimate the variability in the estimates. The SASS sample design and estimation included procedures that deviate from the assumption of simple random sampling, such as stratifying the school sample, oversampling new teachers, and sampling with differential probabilities.\n\nThe preferred method of calculating sampling errors to reflect these aspects of the complex sample design of SASS is using replication. Replication methods involve constructing a number of subsamples, or replicates, from the full sample and computing the statistic of interest for each replicate. The mean square error of the replicate estimates around the full sample estimate provides an estimate of the variance of the statistic. The replicate weights are used to compute the variance of a statistic, Y, as given below:\n\n\u2211 Variance (Y ) = \u239c\u239b 1 \u239f\u239e \u239dn\u23a0\n\nr\n\n(Yr \u2212 Y )2\n\nWhere:\n\nYr = the estimate of Y using the rth set of replicate weights n = the number of replicates\n\nThe SASS surveys completed before 1993 used a procedure known as balanced repeated replication (BRR) for the calculation of sampling variance. BRR assumes sampling is done with replacement, and hence, BRR does not reflect the increase in precision due to sampling a large proportion of a finite population. For most surveys, where the sampling rates are small, the increase in precision will be small and can be disregarded safely. However, with SASS, the public sector surveys (i.e., school, principal, school district, teacher, and library media center) are designed to produce reliable state estimates. This\n\n\f166 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nnecessarily implies large sampling rates, which can lead to very large overestimates of variance with BRR. Likewise, the private sector surveys (i.e., school, principal, and teacher) are designed to produce detailed private school affiliation stratum estimates, which also imply large sampling rates, and subsequent overestimation of variance with BRR.\nIt is possible to adjust the BRR to include a finite population correction (FPC). The FPC corrects the standard error in instances where a large proportion of the frame is in sample. However, since SASS uses a probability proportionate to size systematic selection procedure, it is not clear what the appropriate FPC would be. It is even possible for an appropriate FPC to be greater than one. (See Kaufman 2001.)\nTo overcome this limitation, a bootstrap variance estimator was implemented for the 1993\u201394 SASS, and its role was expanded in the 1999\u20132000 and even more so in the 2003\u201304 SASS. The bootstrap variance estimator was used for public schools, private list frame noncertainty schools, and public school districts in the 1993\u201394 SASS. In the 1999\u20132000 SASS, an additional bootstrap estimator was also included for public schools and private list frame certainty schools. The bootstrap estimator used in the 2003\u201304 SASS was modified from the 1999\u20132000 estimator to make it more stable. In the 2003\u201304 SASS, a new bootstrap estimator for both public and private school teachers was included. The bootstrap variance reflects the increase in precision due to large sampling rates because the bootstrap sampling is done systematically without replacement, as was the original sampling.\nThe idea behind the public school district bootstrap variance estimation is to use the distribution of the sampling weights to generate a bootstrap frame. A series of bootstrap samples of a prespecified bootstrap sample size can be selected from the bootstrap frame, respective replicate weights computed, and variances estimated with standard BRR software. This process is repeated for a number of independent samples following the SASS sample design, using variables from the frame. With estimates from a number of samples, a true estimate of the variance is computed. Given the true variance estimate, the bootstrap stratum sample sizes are chosen to get as close as possible to the true stratum variance estimates. Once the bootstrap stratum sample sizes are determined, bootstrap samples and replicate weights are generated for the actual fielded sample using these bootstrap stratum sample sizes. This process indirectly generates an appropriate FPC. For further details, see Kaufman (1998). The district bootstrap replicate base weights (inverse of the probability of selection) generated for the fielded sample were subsequently reweighted by processing each set of replicate base weights through the weighting procedure.\nThe other bootstrap weights (public schools and teachers and private list frame schools and teacher) were calculated using the updated bootstrap system. This system is based on a series of assumptions about the sampling design: 1) the traditional systematic probability proportionate to size first-stage sample can be approximated using a randomized systematic sample; and 2) the stratified equal probability systematic sample can be approximated by a stratified without replacement simple random sample. Using these assumptions, the bootstrap replicate weights are computed from a single sample. Again, the appropriate bootstrap replicate base weights (inverse of the probability of selection) generated for the sample were subsequently reweighted by processing each set of replicate base weights through the weighting procedure.\nSince the number of certainty schools is substantial, it was decided to treat nonresponse as a stage of sample selection. For certainty schools, this allowed for the reflection of a variance component that otherwise would be regarded as a bias. The nonresponse sampling model is as follows:\n\u2022 For noncertainty schools, nonresponse is considered a nested random process within selected primary sampling units. Within appropriately defined cells (as described in the earlier section on\n\n\fChapter 9. Weighting and Variance Estimation 167\n\n\u201cSchool Weighting Adjustment Cells\u201d in this chapter), it is assumed nonresponse follows a \u201cmissing at random process.\u201d \u2022 For certainty schools, nonresponse is considered the first stage of selection. It is assumed that this process follows a simple random sample without replacement model within appropriately defined cells. (See the earlier section on \u201cSchool Weighting Adjustment Cells\u201d in this chapter.) The frame size for this selection is assumed to be the number of selected certainty schools in the cell and the sample size is the number of responding certainty schools in the cell.\n\nThis procedure also allows for correctly estimating variances for school-based estimates that use school teacher averages generated from the SASS teacher data files.\n\nTo be consistent with the bootstrap procedures described above, the nonresponse modeling of certainty schools was reflected through an appropriately defined bootstrap procedure. For more details on the bootstrap methodology and how it applies to SASS, see Efron (1982), Kaufman (1992, 1993, 1994, 1998, and 2001), and Sitter (1990).\n\nThe newest version of the bootstrap procedure made it possible to compute teacher bootstrap replicate weights at the same time as the school weights, considerably reducing the processing time to form the replicates.\n\nApplying Replicate Weights\n\nEach SASS data file includes a set of 88 replicate weights designed to produce variance estimates. Replicate weights were created for each of the 88 samples using the same estimation procedures used for the full sample and are included in the data files. Most of the replicate weights were produced using a bootstrap procedure.\n\nAs described above, the replicate weights are used to compute the variance of a statistic, Y, as given below.\n\n\u2211 Variance\n\n(Y )\n\n=\n\n\u239c\u239b 1 \u239f\u239e 88 \u239d 88 \u23a0 r=1\n\n(Yr\n\n\u2212 Y )2\n\nWhere:\n\nYr = the estimate of Y using the rth set of replicate weights, and the number of replicate weights is 88 for SASS.\n\nAnalysis of the bootstrap replicate weights revealed that approximately 3 percent of the school (public and private) and teacher (public and private) weights and approximately 9 percent of the district replicate weights fell outside a 95 percent confidence interval. These are nearly the expected 5 percent, indicating the bootstrap replicate weights are close to being distributed normally.\n\nThe computation of sampling errors using these replicate weights can be done easily using one of the following software: WesVar Complex Sample Software, SUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute 2001), AM Statistical Software, or STATA 9.\n\n\u2022 WesVar. The user needs to create a new WesVar data file by specifying the full sample weight variable and the replicate weight variables as defined above, and the replication method, BRR. The replicate weights and the full sample weight can be highlighted and dragged to their appropriate place on the \u201cNew WesVar Data File\u201d window. For more information, visit www.westat.com/wesvar/.\n\n\f168 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\u2022 SUDAAN. The user needs to specify the sample design as a \u201cBalanced Repeated Replication\u201d design as well as specifying the replicate weight variables. Specifying the sample design (DESIGN = BRR) is done in the procedure call statement (i.e., PROC DESCRIPT DESIGN = BRR;). The specification of the replicate weights is done with the REPWGT statement (i.e., to produce the sampling errors for estimates from the principal data files use the statement: REPWGT AREPWT1-AREPWT88;). For more information, visit www.rti.org/sudaan/.\n\u2022 AM. The user needs to set the replicate weights along with the replication method using the rightclick context menu in the variable list window. Once the \u201cSet Replicate Weights\u201d window is displayed, the replicate weights as identified above can be highlighted and dragged into the window. At the bottom of the window are four options for replication method; BRR should be selected. For more information, visit http://am.air.org.\n\u2022 STATA. The use of replicate weights for the generation of standard errors is a new feature to STATA 9. First, the user needs to survey set the data (SVY SET) by defining: the probability weight ([pw = ]); balanced repeated replication weights (brrweight(varlist)); variance estimation type ((vce(brr)); and turning on the mse formula (mse). Once these parameters are set, users are able to call up the survey settings and tell STATA which type of standard errors to produce using the SVY BRR command. SVY BRR also allows users to specify the statistics to be collected (exp_list) and the command to perform (e.g., mean or tab). For more information, visit http://www.stata.com.\nPublic and BIA-Funded School and School Principal Replicates\nThe bootstrap estimator as described in the previous section was used for developing both the public and BIA-funded school and principal replicates. The replicate weights for the public and BIA-funded school files are SREPWT1 through SREPWT88. The replicate weights for the public and BIA-funded principals are AREPWT1 through AREPWT88.\nPrivate School and School Principal Replicates\nFor private schools, the list frame used the bootstrap methodology as described above. For the area frame, the sampling rates for the primary sampling units were very small; consequently, there is no advantage in using the bootstrap. BRR methodology was used in the area frame as it had been for all previous rounds of SASS. Half-samples are defined by pairing sample primary sampling units within each sampling stratum, forming variance strata. The final product is 88 replicate weights. After the variance strata were assigned, an orthogonal matrix (matrix H where: HHT = nIn, where In is the identity matrix of order n) was used to form the 88 balanced half-sample replicates. Thus, the same methodology can be applied to both the list frame and the area frame replicate weights to compute variances. The replicate weights for the private school file are SREPWT1 through SREPWT88.\nPrivate school principal replicate weights were calculated similarly to the school replicate weights. The replicate weights for the private school principal file are AREPWT1 through AREPWT88.\nSchool Library Media Center Replicates\nThe library replicate weights were developed similarly to the school bootstrap replicate weights. The replicate weights for the public and BIA-funded school library media center files are MREPWT1 through MREPWT88.\n\n\fChapter 9. Weighting and Variance Estimation 169\nTeacher Replicates\nThe teacher replicate weights were generated at the same time as the school replicate weights as part of the 2003\u201304 bootstrap system.\nBRR methodology was employed rather than bootstrap if a teacher was in the private school area frame. Teacher sample records were assigned replicate weights by multiplying the school BRR replicate weight times the teacher\u2019s conditional probability of selection given the school is selected in the SASS school sample. The replicate weights for the public, BIA-funded, and private teacher files are TREPWT1 through TREPWT88.\nSchool District Replicates\nTo reflect that the districts were selected through the school, the school district bootstrap samples were drawn from a frame that reflected both the public school and district distributions. This frame was the major difference between the district bootstrap methodology and that described above for schools. The replicate weights for the district file are DREPWT1 through DREPWT88.\n\n\fThis page is intentionally left blank.\n\n\f171\nChapter 10. Reviewing the Quality of SASS Data\nNational Center for Education Statistics (NCES) program staff members have the responsibility of ensuring that data files are acceptable for public release. Before files are released to the public, staff members review the data for errors associated with the edit, imputation, and weighting programs. This review incorporates a number of checks that incorporate univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis that rigorously examine as many aspects of the data as possible without delaying timely release of the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS).\nBelow are aspects of the datasets that were reviewed:\n\u2022 general data quality; \u2022 nonresponse; \u2022 weighting; \u2022 external data checks; and \u2022 response variance.\nGeneral Data Quality\nGeneral data quality included a number of reviews that could be characterized as consistency edits. These checks involved an examination of the individual responses, patterns of response, and summary statistics for variables and files to ensure consistency within items, respondents, and files. In addition, key variables and crosstabulations of key variables were examined for distributions and relationships that were expected based upon prior administrations and other research, a check of face validity. The specific data checks included edits, frequency counts, and reasonableness of data, as described below.\nEdits. The validity of the skip patterns in the questionnaire was established for each SASS questionnaire during the processing of the data; that is, Census Bureau analysts verified that each item in the questionnaire had the number of responses it should have if skip instructions were followed correctly. Quality checks on the edit specifications were performed and resulted in some corrections (which were treated as a form of imputation).\nFrequency Counts. Unweighted record counts for every variable were examined from the restricted-use data files. Variables with out-of-range values or inconsistent values were identified, and these values were corrected.\nReasonableness of Data. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate tabulations of key survey variables were obtained and compared to estimates from the previous SASS. Tabulations were reviewed to determine whether the basic relationships observed were within reasonable bounds, allowing for elements of change (such as random fluctuations in variance, or a trend such as overall population growth in a state). The distributions and relationships observed were consistent with expectations.\nResponse Rates\nResponse rates were examined for possible bias, and little evidence of bias at the unit or item level was found. The details of this analysis are discussed in greater detail in chapter 6, but the nonresponse analysis includes a detailed analysis of unit nonresponse and item nonresponse.\n\n\f172 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nUnit Nonresponse. Response rates were calculated at the state or affiliation stratum level for all SASS data files. (See chapter 6 for unit response rate information.) Nonresponding districts, schools, principals, teachers, and library media centers were studied in greater detail to identify patterns of unit nonresponse. (See chapter 6 for information on the nonresponse unit bias analysis.) While no evidence of substantial bias was found, the response rate fell below 50 percent for particular respondents by state or affiliation stratum: public school districts in Vermont, public school library media centers in the District of Columbia, and principals in Amish private schools. Consequently, these data will not be reported separately in NCES publications.\nItem Nonresponse. The extent of item nonresponse for each SASS data file was determined. (See chapter 6 for item response rate information.) Items with high nonresponse rates are identified and reported in tables. Following this review, no items were removed from the data files. However, items with a response rate lower than 70 percent are footnoted as such in published tables.\nReplicated Weights\nThe review of the SASS replicate weights consisted of reviewing the distribution of these weights. The following was done:\n1. For each replicate, the weights were totaled. Each replicate total, as well as the average of those numbers, was checked against the full-sample estimate. The standard error of the replicate totals was computed and checked for reasonableness.\n2. A check was performed to verify that 95 percent of the replicate weights were contained in an appropriately computed 95 percent confidence interval. This was done with both the basic replicate weights and the final replicate weights.\nExternal Data Checks\nOne way to verify the external validity of SASS data is to make comparisons to the survey universe, or frame, from which the sample is drawn. For public school districts, schools, principals, and teachers, the external file is an adjusted version of the Common Core of Data (CCD), an annual administrative census of all public schools, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funded schools, and public school districts in the United States and its territories. The corresponding frame for private schools, principals, and teachers is the Private School Universe Survey (PSS).\nThe sampling frame is generally drawn from the universe data files about 2 years prior to the field collection of SASS data. Direct comparison can be made between the estimated count of the survey unit, such as school districts or schools, and the corresponding CCD or PSS count. Such comparisons are usually made between SASS and the sampling frame year of the universe data files.\nSASS survey estimates of a characteristic of districts or schools, such as enrollment, were compared to CCD or PSS estimates. Those comparisons are usually made to the concurrent years of the universe data files, as the data collected in the field for 1 year are only valid for the same year of the universe. The number of students attending school or the number of teachers employed is subject to more year-to-year change than the number of schools or districts.\nPublic School District Unit Count Comparison (Public School District File)\nComparisons of the number of public school districts by state and region were made to the CCD 2001\u201302 Public Education Agency Universe as well as to the CCD 2003\u201304 Public Education Agency Universe.\n\n\fChapter 10. Reviewing the Quality of SASS Data 173\nThe CCD estimates are independent from SASS, because SASS collects its data directly from school districts that are in sample and CCD data are collected from the state education agencies. For the 2003\u201304 SASS, the district sample consisted of the set of districts that were associated with the SASS public school sample, including public charter schools that operated independently of a public school district. The districts in-scope (i.e., eligible) for SASS were those that employed elementary- and/or secondarylevel teachers and were in operation in the 2003\u201304 school year. CCD utilizes a less restrictive definition of a district and collects information on supervisory unions and districts that neither administer schools nor hire teachers. Thus, two SASS-CCD comparisons were made; one to the total number of CCD districts for the state and one to the number of \u201cregular\u201d CCD districts (as defined by CCD) in the state. Depending upon the number of out-of-scope districts in each particular state, the SASS estimates are either closer to the total number of districts or to the number of regular districts in CCD.\nComparisons in counts of public school districts by state between CCD and SASS are shown in tables 46 and 47. The first table compares the estimated number of public school districts in SASS (calculated using the district final weight) with the number of total and regular school districts in the 2001\u201302 CCD Public Education Agency Universe. The second table compares the estimated number of public school districts in SASS (calculated using the district basic weight) with the adjusted frame developed by the sampling statisticians at the Census Bureau in preparation for SASS data collection. These are two different measures of \u201cfit\u201d between the weighted count from SASS and the frame count of districts. The sampling frame version of CCD used in table 47 is between the total number of districts and the number of regular districts.\n\n\f174 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable 46.\n\nEstimated number and percentage of public school districts in 2003\u201304 SASS compared with total and regular districts in 2001\u201302 CCD Public Education Agency Universe, by state, region, and community type: 2001\u201302 and 2003\u201304\n\nCharacteristic Total\n\n2001\u201302 CCD\nregular districts1\n14,559\n\n2001\u201302 CCD\nregular districts\nwith students2\n14,229\n\n2003\u201304\n\nSASS frame\n\n2001\u201302 (2001\u201302\n\nCCD\n\nCCD\n\nregular without\n\ndistricts charter and\n\nwith state run schools3 districts)4\n\n14,974\n\n14,421\n\n2003\u201304 SASS frame\n(charter and state\nrun districts\nonly)5\n1,327\n\nSASS\n\n2003\u201304 2003\u201304 estimate\n\nSASS SASS\n\nas a\n\ndistricts districts percentage\n\n(without (charter of CCD\n\ncharter and state districts\n\nand state\n\nrun\n\nwith\n\nrun)6 only)7 schools8\n\n14,331 1,207\n\n95.7\n\nSASS estimate\nas a percentage of 2003\u201304\nSASS frame9\n99.4\n\nState Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California\n\n128\n\n128\n\n131\n\n128\n\n3\n\n126\n\n7\n\n96.2\n\n98.4\n\n53\n\n53\n\n55\n\n53\n\n2\n\n55\n\n0 100.0\n\n103.8\n\n323\n\n301\n\n231\n\n239\n\n253\n\n202\n\n273\n\n87.4\n\n84.5\n\n312\n\n312\n\n323\n\n320\n\n5\n\n314\n\n8\n\n97.2\n\n98.1\n\n986\n\n986\n\n1,046\n\n1,024\n\n25 1,021\n\n28\n\n97.6\n\n99.7\n\nColorado\n\n178\n\n178\n\n190\n\nConnecticut\n\n166\n\n166\n\n179\n\nDelaware\n\n19\n\n19\n\n20\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nFlorida\n\n67\n\n67\n\n72\n\n189\n\n0\n\n189\n\n0\n\n99.5\n\n100.0\n\n174\n\n20\n\n173\n\n3\n\n96.6\n\n99.4\n\n20\n\n10\n\n21\n\n9\n\n105.0\n\n105.0\n\n1\n\n33\n\n1\n\n23\n\n100.0\n\n100.0\n\n71\n\n2\n\n71\n\n2\n\n98.6\n\n100.0\n\nGeorgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana\n\n180\n\n180\n\n178\n\n178\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n114\n\n114\n\n115\n\n114\n\n893\n\n893\n\n1,008\n\n1,002\n\n294\n\n292\n\n309\n\n305\n\n2\n\n181\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n114\n\n7\n\n996\n\n3\n\n306\n\n1 101.7\n\n0 100.0\n\n1\n\n99.1\n\n5\n\n98.8\n\n1\n\n99.0\n\n101.7 100.0 100.0\n99.4 100.3\n\nIowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine\n\n371\n\n371\n\n371\n\n304\n\n304\n\n304\n\n176\n\n176\n\n178\n\n66\n\n66\n\n76\n\n282\n\n279\n\n235\n\n371\n\n0\n\n371\n\n0\n\n100.0\n\n100.0\n\n304\n\n0\n\n304\n\n0\n\n100.0\n\n100.0\n\n176\n\n2\n\n180\n\n0\n\n101.1\n\n102.3\n\n68\n\n20\n\n65\n\n7\n\n85.5\n\n95.6\n\n174\n\n4\n\n171\n\n6\n\n72.8\n\n98.3\n\nMaryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi\n\n24\n\n24\n\n24\n\n350\n\n244\n\n330\n\n554\n\n554\n\n611\n\n417\n\n413\n\n391\n\n152\n\n152\n\n162\n\n24\n\n0\n\n24\n\n0 100.0\n\n100.0\n\n329\n\n44\n\n306\n\n66\n\n92.7\n\n93.0\n\n611\n\n187\n\n593 210\n\n97.1\n\n97.1\n\n382\n\n74\n\n393\n\n54\n\n100.5\n\n102.9\n\n152\n\n10\n\n156\n\n7\n\n96.3\n\n102.6\n\nMissouri\n\n524\n\n523\n\n530\n\n528\n\nMontana\n\n452\n\n444\n\n446\n\n376\n\nNebraska\n\n555\n\n526\n\n550\n\n546\n\nNevada\n\n17\n\n17\n\n18\n\n17\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n178\n\n164\n\n164\n\n123\n\nSee notes at end of table.\n\n2\n\n520\n\n2\n\n378\n\n5\n\n551\n\n1\n\n16\n\n0\n\n167\n\n3\n\n98.1\n\n0\n\n84.8\n\n0\n\n100.2\n\n1\n\n88.9\n\n0 101.8\n\n98.5 100.5 100.9 94.1 135.8\n\n\fChapter 10.

These \u201cother\u201d types of districts are largely (960 out of 1,066 \u201cother\u201d districts in the 2001\u201302 CCD) either administrative units that oversee charter schools or independent charter schools that are recognized within their state as if they were districts. Methodologically, singleschool districts, some public charter schools, and state or federally-run schools were not sent a separate district questionnaire, but instead received the Unified School Questionnaire. The Unified School Questionnaire incorporated district-level items into the school questionnaire. When the data files were created from the questionnaires, district-level data for these \u201cother\u201d types of districts were included on the district data file. It is important to include these district-level data for a single-school district, state or federally funded school, or public charter school record on the district file in order to approximate the district data reported by CCD and to provide SASS data for \u201cother\u201d types of districts that exist at the elementary and secondary level. Table 47 provides the comparison between the total district count in CCD and the SASS estimate of districts, including those for public charter or state-run schools.\n\nDifferences in the count of districts between CCD and SASS do occur for various reasons. In New England, the main reason why CCD and SASS estimates diverge is because CCD counts all local districts\n\n\fChapter 10. Reviewing the Quality of SASS Data 177\nas districts. SASS, however, defines a district as an entity that operates at least one school and is responsible for hiring, firing, and setting policies. In Vermont and, to some extent, in Maine, the functions that define a district in SASS are performed by the supervisory union, school union, or co-op. Supervisory unions, school unions, or co-ops may oversee several districts, as defined by CCD. Consequently, the \u201cdistrict of record\u201d in CCD may not actually be the district that directs the operations for these small, rural schools.\nThe adjusted SASS sampling frame reflects the changes that are made to better fit the SASS definition of eligible districts for sampling. Even after those adjustments are made, there are still some remaining discrepancies between the SASS sampling frame and the actual sample, as shown in table 46\u2019s rightmost column. In general, it is not possible to completely subtract districts that would be ineligible for SASS from CCD, because they are not always readily identifiable. For example, in some states supervisory units may oversee school operations, while in other states that is not as common.\n\n\f178 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable 47.\n\nEstimated number and percentage of public school districts in 2003\u201304 SASS compared with total public school districts in 2001\u201302 CCD Public Education Agency Universe, by state and region: 2001\u201302 and 2003\u201304\n\nCharacteristic Total\n\n2001\u201302 CCD total districts 17,085\n\n2003\u201304 SASS frame total with charter\nand state-run schools 15,748\n\n2003\u201304 SASS total districts (including charter and state-run) 15,538\n\nSASS estimate as a percentage\nof CCD total districts1\n90.9\n\nSASS estimate as a percentage\nof 2003\u201304 SASS frame2\n98.7\n\nState Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California\n\n131 55 513 338 1,056\n\n131 55 492 325 1,049\n\n133 55 475 322 1,049\n\n101.5 100.0 92.6 95.3 99.3\n\n101.5 100.0 96.5 99.1 100.0\n\nColorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida\n\n200\n\n189\n\n189\n\n94.5\n\n100.0\n\n197\n\n194\n\n176\n\n89.3\n\n90.7\n\n30\n\n30\n\n30\n\n100.0\n\n100.0\n\n34\n\n34\n\n24\n\n70.6\n\n70.6\n\n73\n\n73\n\n73\n\n100.0\n\n100.0\n\nGeorgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana\n\n180 1\n115 1,060\n326\n\n180 1\n115 1,009\n308\n\n182 1\n115 1,001\n307\n\n101.1 100.0 100.0\n94.4 94.2\n\n101.1 100.0 100.0\n99.2 99.7\n\nIowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine\n\n386\n\n371\n\n371\n\n96.1\n\n100.0\n\n304\n\n304\n\n304\n\n100.0\n\n100.0\n\n196\n\n178\n\n180\n\n91.8\n\n101.1\n\n88\n\n88\n\n72\n\n81.8\n\n81.8\n\n325\n\n178\n\n177\n\n54.5\n\n99.4\n\nMaryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi\n\n24\n\n24\n\n24\n\n100.0\n\n100.0\n\n479\n\n373\n\n372\n\n77.7\n\n99.7\n\n799\n\n798\n\n803\n\n100.5\n\n100.6\n\n485\n\n456\n\n447\n\n92.2\n\n98.0\n\n162\n\n162\n\n163\n\n100.6\n\n100.6\n\nMissouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire\n\n530\n\n530\n\n523\n\n98.7\n\n98.7\n\n531\n\n378\n\n366\n\n68.9\n\n96.8\n\n671\n\n551\n\n551\n\n82.1\n\n100.0\n\n18\n\n18\n\n17\n\n94.4\n\n94.4\n\n257\n\n123\n\n168\n\n65.4\n\n136.6\n\nNew Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota\nSee notes at end of table.\n\n665\n\n642\n\n642\n\n96.5\n\n100.0\n\n89\n\n89\n\n89\n\n100.0\n\n100.0\n\n787\n\n762\n\n759\n\n96.4\n\n99.6\n\n212\n\n211\n\n206\n\n97.2\n\n97.6\n\n263\n\n259\n\n222\n\n84.4\n\n85.7\n\n\fChapter 10.

The number of public schools in SASS is 2.1 percentage points smaller than the number of CCD public schools with students (table 48). Two states have an estimated number of public schools for SASS that is below 90 percent of the SASS frame: Alaska and Minnesota. There are 14 states in which SASS estimates are higher than the CCD estimates: Arkansas, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin. Ten of those states are within 1 percentage point of the CCD estimates (Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin), while the SASS estimates for the other four range from 2.4 percentage points to 13 percentage points higher than the CCD counts (Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma). Overall, the percentage difference between SASS and the frame year CCD count of public schools was 6.4; this narrows to 2.1, once the school collapsing operation is taken into consideration. The school collapsing operation described in chapter 9 was expected to reduce the consistency of the count of schools between CCD (particularly in the frame year) and SASS, in some states. These are states in which K\u201312 schools may be broken up administratively into several different schools for either internal state administrative reasons or for reporting to CCD.\n33 BIA refers to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\n\fChapter 10.

Reviewing the Quality of SASS Data 183\nPublic School Student Count Comparison (Public School and BIA-Funded School Files)\nComparisons of the number of public school students in SASS were made to the frame year of CCD from the published student counts for 2001\u201302 and to the 2003\u201304 CCD (table 49). Two comparisons were made, one to the CCD total number of students, and the other to the CCD K\u201312 student count. The latter count does not include any prekindergarten students. The SASS student counts are for K\u201312 grade levels, as long as the school reporting a kindergarten also has a 1st grade. While there are at least some public schools included in CCD\u2019s definition of K\u201312 that may not have been eligible for SASS, in general most public kindergarten students would be eligible as students in SASS; therefore, it does not make sense to exclude kindergarten from the student counts when making the comparison to CCD.\nOverall, the SASS student count is about 1 percent higher than CCD\u2019s count of total K\u201312 students from 2 years prior to SASS and 0.6 percent lower than CCD\u2019s count of total K\u201312 students from the same year as SASS (table 49). There were 866,969 prekindergarten students included in CCD in 2001\u201302 and 949,643 prekindergarten students included in CCD in 2003\u201304. Excluding them brings the SASS student count into a closer degree of \u201cfit\u201d than was achieved with the comparison of the number of schools in SASS to CCD. However, excluding the prekindergarten students enlarges the amount of difference in those states for which SASS has a higher number of students than the prekindergarten\u201312 frame year CCD counts. Population growth (i.e., births and/or migration) may account for SASS count in 2003\u201304 being higher than the frame year CCD count, but that does not help to explain why the SASS count of students in 2003\u201304 is lower for some states than the frame year CCD count. The amount of that difference is reduced in some states when comparing the SASS data to the same year of CCD. Exceptions to this pattern are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Utah. There were 14 states in which the number of students was higher in SASS compared to the 2003\u201304 CCD, but because of a declining number of students reported in the CCD between 2001\u201302 and 2003\u201304, the SASS student count was closer to the frame year: Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Some of these changes were relatively small; and some of these states are among those that have sometimes had overreporting of enrollment and teachers in SASS. This may indicate that the school collapsing operation narrowed, but did not entirely eliminate, the overreporting of students.\n\n\f184 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable 49.\n\nEstimated number and percentage of public and BIA-funded school students in 2003\u2013 04 SASS compared to 2001\u201302 and 2003\u201304 CCD, by state and region: 2001\u201302 and 2003\u201304\n\nCharacteristic Total\n\nSASS as a SASS as a\n\n2001\u201302\n\n2003\u201304 2003\u201304 percentage percentage\n\n2001\u201302 CCD public 2003\u201304 CCD public\n\nSASS of 2001\u201302 of 2003\u201304\n\nCCD public students CCD public students\n\npublic CCD less CCD less\n\nstudents1 less pre-K2 students3 less pre-K4 students5\n\npre-K6\n\npre-K7\n\n47,687,871 46,820,902 48,540,725 47,591,082 47,315,662\n\n101.1\n\n99.4\n\nState Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California\n\n737,294 134,358 922,180 449,805 6,248,610\n\n725,349 133,105 915,556 448,182 6,147,375\n\n731,220 133,933 1,012,068 454,523 6,413,862\n\n729,368 132,050 1,002,692 451,950 6,298,928\n\n742,813 125,226 979,096 489,070 5,771,918\n\n102.4 94.1 106.9 109.1 93.9\n\n101.8 94.8 97.6 108.2 91.6\n\nColorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida\n\n742,145 570,228 115,555\n75,392 2,500,478\n\n722,629 559,178 114,969\n71,287 2,443,440\n\n757,693 577,203 117,668\n78,057 2,587,628\n\n737,700 565,380 117,026\n72,889 2,538,040\n\n716,172 541,893 116,341\n72,908 2,518,510\n\n99.1 96.9 101.2 102.3 103.1\n\n97.1 95.8 99.4 100.0 99.2\n\nGeorgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana\n\n1,470,634 184,546 246,521\n2,071,391 996,133\n\n1,437,324 183,629 244,180\n2,013,841 989,986\n\n1,522,611 183,609 252,120\n2,100,961 1,011,130\n\n1,486,125 182,434 249,448\n2,033,813 1,005,569\n\n1,383,173 196,159 250,955\n1,993,566 987,794\n\n96.2 106.8 102.8\n99.0 99.8\n\n93.1 107.5 100.6\n98.0 98.2\n\nIowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine\n\n485,932 470,205 654,363 731,328 205,586\n\n480,218 468,173 621,956 714,129 204,253\n\n481,226 470,490 663,885 727,709 202,084\n\n474,319 468,044 631,851 704,522 200,287\n\n475,145 445,556 676,189 727,449 222,411\n\n98.9 95.2 108.7 101.9 108.9\n\n100.2 95.2 107.0 103.3 111.0\n\nMaryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi\n\n860,640 973,140 1,730,668 851,384 493,507\n\n840,326 952,474 1,714,106 841,713 491,702\n\n869,113 980,459 1,757,604 842,854 493,540\n\n847,722 957,926 1,735,880 831,978 491,332\n\n859,556 1,017,085 1,740,115\n862,457 510,002\n\n102.3 106.8 101.5 102.5 103.7\n\n101.4 106.2 100.2 103.7 103.8\n\nMissouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire\n\n909,792 151,947 285,095 356,814 206,847\n\n891,277 151,441 280,031 354,667 205,017\n\n905,941 148,356 285,542 385,401 207,417\n\n894,726 147,692 279,622 382,623 205,196\n\n906,237 147,302 295,166 363,066 199,749\n\n101.7 97.3 105.4 102.4 97.4\n\n101.3 99.7 105.6 94.9 97.3\n\nNew Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota\nSee notes at end of table.\n\n1,341,656 320,260\n2,872,132 1,315,363\n106,047\n\n1,321,905 316,761\n2,831,920 1,306,043\n105,326\n\n1,380,753 323,066\n2,864,775 1,360,209\n102,233\n\n1,358,007 319,090\n2,823,319 1,348,523\n101,481\n\n1,297,491 323,357\n2,905,019 1,347,202\n108,355\n\n98.2 102.1 102.6 103.2 102.9\n\n95.5 101.3 102.9 99.9 106.8\n\n\fChapter 10.

As an external check, this spots gross differences. There are several reasons why the number of teachers, approximated to FTE counts from the Public School Teacher data file, would differ from CCD State Nonfiscal Survey counts. CCD counts are statewide official tallies of teaching positions, reported from a central agency, and unduplicated to account for teachers in multiple districts or schools. The teacher count from SASS depends in part on the cooperation of the schools to provide a list of all teachers. Approximately 11 percent of schools in 2003\u201304 SASS did not provide a teacher list. The CCD count reflects some teaching positions for which the teacher is away from the school during the SASS data collection, such as a teacher who is on maternity leave. The assumptions about the proportions of part-time to full-time teachers, which are used to adjust the headcount data to FTEs, may be reasonable overall but may not be as accurate on a state-by-state basis. When a public school in sample for SASS is declared out-of-scope, such as when that school merged with another nonsampled school, the teachers that would have been or actually were sampled are also declared out-ofscope. While such factors affect relatively small proportions of the sampled cases, there may be a cumulative effect on the overall count of teachers in some states.\n\nTable 50.\n\nEstimated number and percentage of full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers in public and BIA-funded schools in 2003\u201304 SASS compared to the 2001\u201302 and 2003\u201304 CCD, by state and region: 2001\u201302 and 2003\u201304\n\nCharacteristic Total\nState Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California\n\n2001\u201302 CCD FTE\npublic school teachers1\n2,997,741\n\n2003\u201304 CCD FTE\npublic school teachers2\n3,048,549\n\n2003\u201304 SASS FTE\npublic school teachers (teacher\nfile)3\n3,117,208\n\n2003\u201304 SASS public school\nteachers (approx.\nFTE) (school\nfile)4\n3,129,360\n\nSASS school file\n(approx.

There could be several reasons for this. One reason is that the approximation of FTE teachers from SASS is not as accurate as the reporting of FTE positions in CCD. Another possible reason is that the school collapsing operation in SASS may not have completely taken care of the overreporting of teachers in combined K\u201312 schools.\n\n\fChapter 10. Reviewing the Quality of SASS Data 189\nPublic Charter School Comparison (Public School File)\nPublic charter schools in the 2003\u201304 SASS were selected to be representative at the national level only, since the data on public charter schools would be published only at the national level. The comparisons that are shown in table 51 should not be interpreted as a critique of the sampling that was employed to draw a national sample. Rather, the comparisons show how closely the sample does or does not fit to subnational counts of public charter schools as identified in the CCD frame year. Comparisons are made to the frame year from CCD, as opposed to the concurrent data collection year, because the sample as drawn from the frame year has no way to include any newly-created schools. This is of particular importance for public charter schools, which are counted after the state grants a charter for the school and permits the school to begin operation.\n\n\f190 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable 51.\n\nEstimated number and percentage of public charter schools in 2003\u201304 SASS compared to 2001\u201302 CCD, by state, region, and community type: 2001\u201302 and 2003\u2013 04\n\nCharacteristic Total\n\n2001\u201302 CCD public\ncharter schools1\n2,348\n\n2003\u201304 SASS frame (2001\u201302\nCCD with adjustments)2\n2,309\n\n2003\u201304 SASS\n\npublic charter SASS estimate as SASS estimate as\n\nschools (CCD a percentage of a percentage of\n\nidentified)3\n\nCCD4\n\nSASS frame5\n\n2,200\n\n93.7\n\n95.3\n\nState Arizona California Colorado Florida Michigan North Carolina Ohio Pennsylvania Texas Wisconsin All other states\n\n370\n\n365\n\n367\n\n99.2\n\n100.5\n\n350\n\n343\n\n317\n\n90.6\n\n92.4\n\n86\n\n85\n\n88\n\n102.3\n\n103.5\n\n192\n\n182\n\n191\n\n99.5\n\n104.9\n\n204\n\n201\n\n204\n\n100.0\n\n101.5\n\n93\n\n92\n\n81\n\n87.1\n\n88.0\n\n85\n\n85\n\n67\n\n78.8\n\n78.8\n\n77\n\n75\n\n62\n\n80.5\n\n82.7\n\n243\n\n241\n\n218\n\n89.7\n\n90.5\n\n109\n\n99\n\n100\n\n91.7\n\n101.0\n\n539\n\n541\n\n507\n\n94.1\n\n93.7\n\nRegion Northeast Midwest South West\n\n237\n\n234\n\n222\n\n93.7\n\n94.9\n\n531\n\n521\n\n494\n\n93.0\n\n94.8\n\n666\n\n652\n\n611\n\n91.7\n\n93.7\n\n914\n\n902\n\n873\n\n95.5\n\n96.8\n\nCommunity type (Census)\nCentral city\nUrban fringe Non-MSA6\n\n1,244 739 365\n\n1,226 724 359\n\n1,267 568 371\n\n101.8 76.2 101.6\n\n103.3 77.8 103.3\n\nCommunity type\n\nCentral city\n\n1,244\n\n1,226\n\n1,267\n\n101.8\n\n103.3\n\nUrban fringe/large town\n\n763\n\n748\n\n586\n\n76.8\n\n78.3\n\nRural/small town\n\n341\n\n335\n\n347\n\n101.8\n\n103.6\n\n1 Overview of Public and Secondary Schools and Districts: School Year 2001\u201302 (NCES 2003-411), Table 9, Column 7. 2 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), \u201cPublic School Frame\u201d (CCD 2001\u201302 with Adjustments\u2014Charter School Indicator),\n\n2003\u201304 (Final School Weight). 3 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), \u201cPublic School (Charter Schools Only) and BIA School Documentation Data Files,\u201d\n\n2003\u201304. 4 Column 3 / Column 1. 5 Column 3 / Column 2. 6 MSA refers to Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nNOTE: CCD refers to the Common Core of Data.

However, the number of private schools measured in the 2003\u201304 SASS has been adjusted to match the number of private schools in the 2003\u201304 PSS, and the number of private schools in the PSS did decrease from 2001\u201302 to 2003\u2013 04.\nThe stratification groups for the 2003\u201304 SASS (termed Affiliation stratum in these tables) are somewhat different from what had been used for all previous SASS data collections. The previous 19 groups, plus \u201cother,\u201d a rather large category, were streamlined into 17 categories including an \u201cAll other religious\u201d category that is smaller than the previous \u201cother\u201d category. The new stratification groups do not use the association membership responses for forming any of the categories; rather, only the religious orientation and religious affiliation items are used.\nPrivate School Student Comparison (Private School File)\nComparisons were made of the number of private school students in SASS to the number of private school students in the frame year (2001\u201302) as well as to the concurrent year of PSS. Overall, the SASS student count is about 5 percent lower than the PSS count in 2001\u201302 and about 1.2 percent lower than the concurrent year\u2019s student count in PSS (table 53). By affiliation stratum, SASS estimates as a percentage of the 2001\u201302 SASS ranged from 49.8 for the Pentecostal program category to 119.7 for Mennonite program category, and the SASS estimates as a percentage of the 2003\u201304 PSS ranged from 75.1 for the Pentecostal program category to 117.7 for the Nonsectarian\u2014regular program category. However, by NCES typology, the SASS count of private school students was slightly lower for two out of the three typology categories when compared to the 2003\u201304 PSS, with the Nonsectarian category higher by about 8 percent.\nThe percentage differences between SASS and the concurrent PSS are smaller than the differences between SASS and the frame year PSS. While the differences are smaller, sampling variability for some of the smaller strata may account for percentage differences greater than 10 percent.\n\n\fChapter 10.

PSS always reports FTE counts of teachers. For ease of comparison, the headcounts of teachers in SASS were converted to approximate FTE counts.\nThe number of private FTE teachers in SASS (table 54) is 2.1 percent lower overall than the frame year count of teachers in PSS and 2 percent lower overall than the concurrent year\u2019s count. However, both the frame year and concurrent year\u2019s PSS teacher counts are quite close in absolute numbers. There are much larger differences by affiliation strata, ranging from about 14 percent below the concurrent PSS count for Nonsectarian special education school teachers to about 17 percent above the PSS count for Mennonite teachers. The small sample size of both of these groups (and consequently, relatively larger variance estimates) probably contributes to the large percentage differences in FTE teacher counts.\nWhile the overall number of private schools in SASS is controlled to the concurrent PSS total, this is not true of the number of FTE teachers. There are several factors that contribute to differences between SASS estimates and PSS estimates. Schools that closed between the sampling year of 2001\u201302 and 2003\u201304 would tend to lower the FTE estimate in SASS relative to the 2003\u201304 PSS, at least to the extent that there are differences in the number of FTE teachers between schools that closed and schools that remained open. Similarly, growth in the number of schools would be reflected in the current PSS and to a lesser extent in SASS; both used the same frame, but the 2003\u201304 SASS used the 2001\u201302 PSS area frame instead of the 2003\u201304 PSS area frame. The difference in area frames could either raise or lower the FTE estimates of teachers in SASS.\nA higher estimate of FTE teachers in SASS by NCES typology could result from one or more factors. The overall count of private schools in SASS is controlled to the 2003\u201304 PSS, but not within each type of private school, so that the number of schools by NCES typology category may be higher in SASS than in PSS. In addition, differences in the area frames between SASS and PSS may contribute to this effect.\n\n\fChapter 10.

Rather, the only comparisons that can be made are the changes between the previous school library counts and the current count. Without any external data for verification, it can be difficult to tell how much of the difference between the two counts is due to sampling variability or nonresponse rate change and how much to substantive change (i.e., a change in the number of schools with library media centers).\nAlthough public charter schools were included both in 1999\u20132000 and 2003\u201304 SASS, the way that charter schools were sampled and the way that the data were collected for library media centers differed enough so that public charter schools were excluded from the comparison.\nThe counts presented in this section are almost entirely from the Public School Library Media Center data file. The last column does use the count of schools both with and without school library media centers from the Public School data file.\nChanges in the number of non-charter public schools that lack a library media center are much larger in percentage terms than the change in the number of non-charter public schools with a school library media center (table 55). While the percentage of non-charter public schools lacking such a center is relatively low, some of the percentage difference in the count of these schools, especially by state, can be quite large. These changes are large enough that it is unlikely that they are entirely due to sampling variability. Given the general historical pattern that the percentage of schools lacking a library media center is declining over time, these data seem to suggest that budgetary pressures may be forcing some schools to close their library media centers (probably by laying off any paid library staffers). Another factor is that, with turnover in library media center staff, there may have been no one in the school who could serve as a respondent for the library media center questionnaire items concerning the previous school year. There was evidence that the noninterview rate for the library media center questionnaire was higher in 2003\u201304 than in 1999\u20132000.\n\n\fChapter 10.

Reinterview programs are typically designed to evaluate fieldwork and/or estimate error components, such as simple response variance and response bias, in a survey model (Forsman and Schreiner, pp. 279\u2013301). The purpose of the SASS reinterview programs was to estimate simple response variance; that is, to measure the consistency in response between the original survey and the reinterview (reliability of the data) for certain questions considered critical to the survey or suspected to be problematic. High response variance (i.e.,\n\n\f200 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\ninconsistency) indicates there is a problem with the design of the question or the nature of the data being collected. It also can often indicate the presence of bias in the data. However, while reinterview studies allow the detection of problems in the questions, they usually cannot identify causes of response error or correct the problems. The 2003\u201304 SASS reinterview program consisted of administering reinterview questionnaires that consisted of a subset of questions from the original questionnaires. There were four reinterview questionnaires: the Principal Reinterview Questionnaire (for private and public school principals), the School Reinterview Questionnaire (for private and public schools), the Private School Teacher Reinterview Questionnaire, and the Public School Teacher Reinterview Questionnaire.\nThis section summarizes material from the full report contained in \u201cAppendix S. Response Variance in the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey.\u201d\nContent of Reinterview Questionnaires\nThere were 17 questions evaluated from the Principal Reinterview Questionnaire for private school principals, and 20 questions evaluated from the Principal Reinterview Questionnaire for public school principals. The topics included experience, training, and working conditions; teacher and school performance; school climate and safety; parent or guardian involvement; and demographic information.\nThere were 20 questions evaluated from the School Reinterview Questionnaire for private schools, and 38 questions evaluated from the School Reinterview Questionnaire for public schools. The topics included general information, staffing, and special programs and services.\nThere were 24 questions evaluated from the Private School Teacher Reinterview Questionnaire for private school teachers, and 26 questions evaluated from the Public School Teacher Reinterview Questionnaire for public school teachers. The topics included general information; class organization; educational background; certification and training; professional development; resources and assessments of students; and working conditions.\nReinterview Procedures\nThe sample included the cases selected for reinterview where Census Bureau clerical staff received a completed original questionnaire from the respondent. Then, staff mailed out the appropriate reinterview questionnaires with a letter explaining the purpose of the reinterview to the respondents. The respondents completed the reinterview questionnaires (self-administered) and then mailed the questionnaires back to the Census Bureau in the provided envelopes.\nReinterview Sample Design\nThe reinterview sample for each of the SASS surveys was a random subsample of that survey\u2019s full sample. The sample size was designed to obtain a certain number of completed interviews. The cases selected for reinterview included 686 cases for private school principals and private schools, 1,951 cases for public school principals and public schools, 1,375 cases for private school teachers, and 2,758 for public school teachers.\nReinterview Response Rates\nThere were 278 Principal Reinterview Questionnaires completed for private school principals, for a reinterview response rate of 61 percent, and 1,055 completed for public school principals, for a reinterview response rate of 68 percent (table 56). There were 244 School Reinterview Questionnaires\n\n\fChapter 10. Reviewing the Quality of SASS Data 201\n\ncompleted for private schools, for a reinterview response rate of 53 percent, and 667 completed for public schools, for a reinterview response rate of 43 percent. There were 304 completed Private Teacher Reinterview Questionnaires, for a reinterview response rate of 61 percent, and 763 completed Public Teacher Reinterview Questionnaires, for a reinterview response rate of 58 percent.\n\nTable 56.

The reinterview data was weighted to reflect the sample design and to obtain an unbiased estimate.\n\nThe index of inconsistency and the gross difference rate were the principal measures of response variance in the categorical data. The index of inconsistency was the principal measure of response variance in continuous data.\n\nThe net difference rate (NDR) indicated how well the reinterview met the model assumptions for categorical data. The McNemar Test for the Yes/No questions tested whether the NDR is significant. The Hui-Walter Method was used to calculate the index for the Yes/No questions if the NDR was found to be significant. The Bowker Test is an extension of the McNemar Test and was used for questions that had multiple categories. For the quantitative questions the mean difference between the paired responses was tested to see if it was significantly different from zero. This test provided information analogous to the NDR.\n\nFor the questions with high indexes, logistic regression was used to test a model for inconsistency with explanatory variables gender, age, race, and ethnicity for the principals and teachers. The data were not distributed properly for logistic regression to be appropriate for the categorical questions. The logistic regression was used for the quantitative questions where the t test did not fail.\n\nIn some cases where questions in the 2003\u201304 SASS were asked in previous administrations of SASS, the 1999\u20132000 reinterview results were given for the comparison.\n\nMajor Findings\n\nOf the 17 questions evaluated from the Principal Reinterview Questionnaire for private school principals, 41 percent displayed high response variance, suggesting poor reliability. Response variance was moderate for 47 percent of the questions analyzed and low for 12 percent. The attitudinal questions (6 of them) had high response variance. If attitudinal questions were excluded for private school principals, then 9 percent\n\n\f202 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nof the 11 questions had high response variance, 73 percent had moderate variance, and 18 percent had low variance.\nOf the 20 questions evaluated from the Principal Reinterview Questionnaire for public school principals, 65 percent displayed high response variance, suggesting poor reliability. Response variance was moderate for 30 percent of the questions analyzed and low for 5 percent. The attitudinal questions (5 of them) had high response variance. If attitudinal questions were excluded for public school principals, then 53 percent of the 15 questions had high response variance, 40 percent had moderate variance, and 7 percent had low variance.\nOf the 20 questions evaluated from the School Reinterview Questionnaire for private schools, 5 percent displayed high response variance, suggesting poor reliability. Response variance was moderate for 15 percent of the questions analyzed and low for 80 percent.\nOf the 38 questions evaluated from the School Reinterview Questionnaire for public schools, 18 percent displayed high response variance, suggesting poor reliability. Response variance was moderate for 32 percent of the questions analyzed and low for 50 percent.\nFor private school teachers, 25 percent of the 24 questions from the Private Teacher Reinterview Questionnaire displayed high response variance, suggesting problems with reliability. There was moderate response variance for 29 percent of the questions analyzed and low response variance for 46 percent. There was one attitudinal question that had high response variance. If attitudinal question was excluded for private school teachers, then 22 percent of the 23 questions had high response variance, 30 percent had moderate variance, and 48 percent had low variance.\nFor public school teachers, 19 percent of the 26 questions from the Public Teacher Reinterview Questionnaire displayed high response variance, suggesting problems with reliability. There was moderate response variance for 46 percent of the questions analyzed and low response variance for 35 percent. There was one attitudinal question that had high response variance. If attitudinal question was excluded for public teachers, then 16 percent of the 25 questions had high response variance, 48 percent had moderate variance, and 36 percent had low variance.\n\n\f203\n\nChapter 11. Information on Data Files and Merging Components\n\nThe Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) is composed of nine survey questionnaires: the School District Questionnaire, School Questionnaire, Private School Questionnaire, Unified School Questionnaire, Principal Questionnaire, Private School Principal Questionnaire, Teacher Questionnaire, Private School Teacher Questionnaire, and Library Media Center Questionnaire. The Unified School Questionnaire was given to schools that function independently from regular school districts or are the only school within a regular school district. This included Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funded schools, public charter schools that were not operated within a public school district or managing entity, traditional public schools that were single-school districts, and state-run schools such as schools for the blind. (See chapter 5 for details.) These nine questionnaires were transformed into 12 data files that separate each type of respondent into three sectors: public, private, and BIA-funded. Private school library media centers were not given a questionnaire to complete, due to budget reasons; therefore, there is no private school library media center data file. The table below identifies each data file and the questionnaire data used to build the file.\n\nTable 57.

Both restricted-use and public-use data include confidentiality edits, which add \u201cnoise\u201d to the data in order to make the identification of respondents in published data less certain. (See the section below on \u201cConfidentiality Edits to the Data.\u201d) Access to the restricted-use data files is limited to individuals associated with organizations that have received a license to use SASS data, while the DAS is available to the public. How to receive a restricted-use license is discussed in the next section.\n\n\f204 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nRestricted-use data are accessed through an ECB, which is a searchable codebook, or data dictionary, on a CD-ROM that produces data files as specified by the user. Data are restricted-use because they contain individually identifiable information, which is confidential and protected by law. While direct identifiers, such as the respondent\u2019s name, are not included on the data files, the restricted-use data files do feature more variables that can indirectly identify a respondent or that can be used to link SASS with Common Core of Data (CCD) or other data files, which could provide the name of the school and lead to the identification of individual respondents.\nThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) uses the term \u201cpublic-use data\u201d for survey data when the individually identifiable variables and data have been removed, recoded to collapse the number of categories, or perturbed to protect the confidentiality of survey respondents. The DAS constitutes public-use data. The DAS system will be available online and will produce survey results in tables on demand for the general public.\nThe 2003\u201304 SASS data are released in accordance with the provisions of the amended National Education Statistics Act of 1994 (20 U.S.C. 9017), as amended, the Privacy Act of 1974, the Computer Security Act of 1987, and the U.S. Patriot Act of 2001. Under the provisions of Section 183 of the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002, Public Law 107\u2013279 (20 U.S.C. 9873), NCES is responsible for protecting the confidentiality of individual respondents and releases data (CD-ROMs) for statistical purposes only. Record matching or deductive disclosure by any user is prohibited by federal law.\nHow to Get Restricted-Use Data Files\nResearchers who can demonstrate a need for more detailed information may request access to the restricted-use datasets for statistical research purposes, provided that they follow computer security requirements and fill out an Affidavit of Nondisclosure.\nResearchers requesting access to the restricted-use datasets must obtain a license to use those data by providing the following information:\n\u2022 the title of the survey(s) to which access is desired; \u2022 a detailed discussion of the statistical research project that necessitates accessing the NCES\nsurvey; \u2022 the name of the principal project officer at the institution who will be heading up the research\neffort and who will enforce the legal provisions of the license agreement; \u2022 the number, name(s), and job title(s) of professional and technical staff, including graduate\nstudents, who will be accessing the survey dataset; and \u2022 the estimated loan period necessary for accessing the NCES survey dataset.\nReturn all of the above information to\nNCES Data Security Office Department of Education/NCES/ODC/SSP 1990 K Street NW Room 9061 Washington, DC 20006\nAll of these procedures are detailed in the NCES Restricted-Use Data Procedures Manual, available for download at http://nces.ed.gov/statprog/rudman.\n\n\fChapter 11. Information on Data Files and Merging Components 205\nAfter the access request has been reviewed, the requestor will be informed whether a license to use the restricted data has been approved.\nRequestors and/or institutions that violate the agreement are subject to a fine of not more than $250,000 (under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 3559 and 3571) or imprisonment for not more than 5 years, or both. The confidentiality provisions that NCES must follow by law can be found at http://nces.ed.gov/statprog.\nHow to Access Public-Use Data\nThe public-use version of the teacher (public and private) and school (public and private) data files will be available through an online Data Analysis System (DAS) in early 2007. The DAS permits the user to create crosstabulations and standard errors. The user is not able to link datasets. While the user may recode variables in the DAS, many continuous variables have been recoded into created variables to facilitate the use of the DAS.\nAll NCES public-use data files can be accessed at no cost from the NCES website. At the time of publication, the DAS for this set of surveys was in development. It will be accessible on the NCES website for SASS at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/sass/.\nUnderstanding the Data Files\nConfidentiality Edits to the Data\nThe restricted-use data files, which are also the source for data accessed through the DAS, have been altered according to NCES standards. Known as confidentiality edits, \u201cnoise\u201d was added to the data in order to make the identification of respondents in published data less certain. These edits directly alter some data for individual respondents, but preserve the overall distributions and level of detail in all variables included on the data file. There are several ways in which the data can be altered, including blanking and imputing for randomly selected records; blurring (e.g., combining multiple records through some averaging process into a single record); adding random noise; and data swapping or switching (e.g., switching the variable for age from a predetermined pair of individuals). All 12 restricted-use data files were altered through one or more of these methods.\nTreatment of Public Charter Schools and BIA-Funded Schools\nPublic charter schools were first included in the 1999\u20132000 administration of SASS. At that time, the number of public charter schools was small enough that all known to be operational in 1998\u201399 and still operating in 1999\u20132000 were surveyed. The number of public charter schools has continued to grow, making it more feasible to sample public charter schools. A sample of 303 public charter schools was selected for SASS. (See chapter 4 for details.) Data from these respondents were included in the public sector data files. The variable CHARFLAG, which identifies whether or not the public school is a traditional public school or a public charter school, can be used for separately analyzing public charter data.\nPublic charter schools received either the Unified School Questionnaire or the School Questionnaire, depending upon whether or not the school was associated with a regular school district as defined by CCD. When a public charter school was selected, the sample file (CCD) had information about whether the public charter was part of a regular school district or was under the authority of a chartering agency. Public charter schools operating under the jurisdiction of a district followed the procedure for traditional public schools. Public charter schools that were their own school district or that were under another type\n\n\f206 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nof chartering agency filled out the Unified School Questionnaire, which included district items (e.g., data on salary schedules and hiring policies).\nAll schools funded by BIA were given the Unified School Questionnaire. The variable BIAFLAG identifies whether or not a school is BIA-funded. These schools were placed on separate data files that only include BIA-funded school-related components. Public schools with a high American Indian student enrollment (defined as at least 19.5 percent of the total enrollment) were oversampled for SASS. (See chapter 4 for details.) These cases were included on the public sector data files.\nThere were instances when schools did not fit exclusively into the categories of traditional public, public charter, or BIA-funded schools. In these instances, the following priority for determining school sector was applied:\n\u2022 schools included on the BIA Directory of schools were categorized as BIA-funded schools and included on the BIA data files; and\n\u2022 schools that were on the BIA Directory of schools but also indicated that they were charter schools were categorized as BIA-funded schools and included on the BIA data files.\nIn addition, how a school was classified on CCD (as public, public charter, or BIA) may not match how the school classified itself on the questionnaire. The following decisions were made to assign the school\u2019s sector:\n\u2022 schools that were classified as public charter schools on CCD but did not claim charter school status on the questionnaire were categorized as traditional public schools;\n\u2022 schools that were classified as public schools on CCD but claimed to be charter schools on the questionnaire were categorized as public charter schools;\n\u2022 schools were not asked on the questionnaire whether or not they were funded by BIA; there were no inconsistencies with the school\u2019s sector as it was assigned on the sampling frame or on the data files.\nCategories of Variables\nVariables on SASS data files were organized into the following five categories on each record layout: frame, survey, created, weighting, and imputation flag variables. Each of these categories was further separated into subcategories that provide more detail on each variable\u2019s source. The purpose of these categories is to help the user better understand what types of variables are included on the data files and what the sources were for the variables.\nVariables were classified as frame variables if they were drawn from or based on the SASS sampling frame, CCD, or the Private School Universe Survey (PSS). Frame variables may or may not have been used for sampling. (See chapter 4 for details on sampling variables.) There are four types of frame variables, or subcategories, identifying the source of each frame variable: 2001\u201302 CCD or PSS, SASS frame, 2003\u201304 CCD or PSS, or CAPI. The CAPI instrument was used in the field by field representatives to verify school information and determine whether schools were in-scope or out-ofscope. (See chapter 5 for more details.) Only one variable, the school\u2019s physical address ZIP code (SC_ZIP), was used from the CAPI on the private school data file. This is because the private school sampling frame did not include the physical address ZIP code for the school. Selected variables from these sources were included on the data file if they provided potentially valuable information to the user that was not available from the survey itself. Examples of frame variables include the respondent\u2019s control, or identification, number (i.e., CNTLNUMS for schools, CNTLNUMT for teachers,\n\n\fChapter 11. Information on Data Files and Merging Components 207\nCNTLNUMD for districts, CNTLNUMP for principals, and CNTLNUML for school library media centers) and locale codes (i.e., SLOCP_99, SLOCP_03, and URBANS03 on the school data files). The frame variables are listed in \u201cAppendix T. Frame and Created Variables.\u201d Survey variables are the actual variables drawn from the questionnaire responses. Each item on a questionnaire has a small number printed to the left. This series of numbers is the source code. A single letter was added to the beginning of the series to signify which type of respondent (i.e., district, school, principal, teacher, or school library media center) is associated with a source code. Consequently, the letter \u201cD\u201d was added for district, \u201cS\u201d for school, \u201cA\u201d for principal or administrator, \u201cT\u201d for teacher, and \u201cM\u201d was added for school library media center. For example, on the School District Questionnaire, item 1a has the source code 0035 printed to the left. On the data file, the source code for this item is D0035.\nCreated variables are based on survey variables, frame variables, other created variables, or a combination of these. These variables are frequently used in NCES publications and have been added to the data files to facilitate data analysis. The code used to create these variables can be found in the description of each variable in the Codebook Window of the restricted-use Electronic Codebook. There are two subcategories for created variables based on whether the data used to create the variable are on the same data file. Created variables labeled as being \u201cwithin\u201d a file are based on data found on the same data file. For example, the variable TEALEV on the teacher data files identifies whether a teacher teaches primary, middle, or high school grade levels, or a combination of grade levels. It is built from the individual grades that the teacher indicated he or she teaches on the Teacher or Private School Teacher Questionnaire; consequently, the created variable is located on the same data file from which the source data are drawn. A created variable labeled as being \u201cother\u201d is on one data file but based on data from a different data file. \u201cOther\u201d created variables are typically based on the school or public school district data files and then placed on the teacher, principal, or school library media center data files as a convenience to the user. For example, the variable SCHLEVEL, which identifies whether a school is an elementary, secondary, or combined school, is considered an \u201cother\u201d created variable on the principal, teacher, and school library media center data files. This is because the individual grade levels used to build this variable were reported by the school and are located on the school data files. The created variables are listed in \u201cAppendix T. Frame and Created Variables.\u201d\nThere are two types of weighting variables on each data file. (For more information on weighting and standard errors, see chapter 9.) The first is the sampling weight, or final weight for the respondent, and the second includes the 88 replicate weights. The final weight adjusts for nonresponse and oversampling and is used so that estimates represent the population rather than simply the sample. The replicate weights are used as a set to generate standard errors for estimates. On the school data files, the final weight is called SFNLWGT and the replicate weights are SREPWT1 through SREPWT88.\nThe imputation flags identify whether or not a survey item was imputed for missing data (as discussed in more detail in chapter 8) or whether a created variable was imputed because of a nonresponding school or district. In addition, there is one frame variable, SLOCP_03, that has a corresponding imputation flag (FL_SLC03) on all public sector files, except the public school district data file. This variable and its flag were pulled directly from the 2003\u201304 CCD. No other frame variable has a corresponding imputation flag. All survey variables have a corresponding imputation flag that indicates whether a value was imputed and, if so, what method was used. All survey imputation flags begin with \u201cF_\u201d and are followed by the name of the variable. For example, the imputation flag for T0026 from the teacher data files is F_T0026. Certain created variables were also given imputation flags. These created variables were built with data from either the public school district or school data files and placed on the teacher, principal, or school library media center data files. However, if the public school district or school failed to respond to SASS, data would not be available to place on other data files. These data were imputed using data from the sampling frame, if available, or imputed by hand. The imputation flag for these created variables indicates whether or not the school or public school district failed to respond to SASS and, if so, then\n\n\f208 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nwhat type of imputation was used as the source for the data. All created variable imputation flags begin with \u201cFL_\u201d and are followed by at least the beginning of the name of the created variable. For example, the variable ENRK12UG comes from the school data file and provides the total K\u201312 and ungraded enrollment in the school. It is placed on each school\u2019s associated principal, teacher, and school library media center data files. If the school did not respond to SASS, data are still present for this variable on the other data files. The variable\u2019s imputation flag is called FL_ENRK.\n\nNonresponding Units\n\nAs described in chapter 4 on sampling selection, the school is the primary sampling unit. For each sampled school, the principal, selected teachers, the school library media center, and the public school district, if applicable, were included in SASS. Not all of these types of respondents chose to participate in SASS. Consequently, it is possible to have several teacher records but no corresponding school record, because the school did not complete a school questionnaire. Similarly, the public school district could have agreed to participate in SASS but failed to complete the questionnaire, resulting in having completed questionnaires for schools and principals but no corresponding public school district data. Table 58 below identifies the number of cases that have a corresponding unit that did not respond. This information is particularly useful for identifying how many cases are missing when merging data files.\n\nTable 58.

Information on Data Files and Merging Components 209\n\nLinking Data Files Within SASS\n\nWhen each school was selected for the school sample, its principal or school head was also selected for the principal sample, along with a sample of teachers at that school who received teacher questionnaires. For public schools, the public school district having jurisdiction over the sampled school was selected for the public school district sample. For public and BIA-funded schools, a staff member who was responsible for the school library media center, if any, was also included in the sample for the School Library Media Center Questionnaire. The School Library Media Center Questionnaire was not given to private schools.\n\nOn the restricted-use files, any combination of the school, principal, teacher, and school library media center (if applicable) datasets within each SASS school sector can be merged using the school\u2019s control number (CNTLNUMS). The school control number is present on all of these data files and will link them together.\n\nThe public teacher, school, principal, and school library media center datasets may be merged with the public school district dataset. School and public school district datasets can be merged using the district\u2019s control number (CNTLNUMD) or by parsing out the first five digits of the school\u2019s control number and the district\u2019s control number.\n\nThere are two ways in which data files can be merged. The first involves merging data files by matching them using the school\u2019s control number. An example of this is when the user would like to merge a school\u2019s record with the records of its teachers. The school and the teachers are linked through the school\u2019s control number. Instructions on how to match merge data files in SAS, SPSS, and Stata are provided below. The second method of merging is appending, or concatenating, data files. For example, if the user would like to analyze public and private school data, these files can be appended together. Because these data files do not need to be \u201cmatched,\u201d no control number needs to be specified to append the data files. This type of merging is not discussed in this chapter. Please see the manual for the statistical program being used to determine how to append data files and for additional information on how to merge data files.\n\nSample SAS Syntax for Merging Data Files and Attaching Variable Labels\n\nMerging Restricted-Use Data Files Using the School Control Number (CNTLNUMS)\n\nWhen merging any of the school, principal, teacher, or school library media center data files together for a given school, the school\u2019s control number, CNTLNUMS, is used to match data files. In the SAS code below, please note that both data files being merged must be sorted by the variable listed in the \u201cby\u201d statement prior to performing the merge. Comments to explain lines of code are contained within \u201c/* */\u201d Words in italics are meant to be replaced by meaningful file or variable names.\n\nproc sort data = dataset1; by CNTLNUMS; run; proc sort data = dataset2; by CNTLNUMS; run; data newfilename; merge dataset1 (in=a) dataset2;\n\n/* create new merged file name */ /* merge the two files and specify dataset1 as\nunit of analysis */\n\n\f210 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nby CNTLNUMS; if a=1;\nrun;\n\n/* keep all dataset1 records and only matching dataset2 records */\n\nMerging the Restricted-use Public School District Data File with Other Public Sector Data Files\n\nThere are two ways to merge the public school district data file with other public sector data files. The first is with the district\u2019s control number (CNTLNUMD). This variable is included on the public school district data file as well as the public school data file. The sample code provided above is correct, except that the merging variable will be CNTLNUMD.\n\nThe second method is by parsing out the first five digits of the district\u2019s and the school\u2019s control number. Users will need to use this method if the school did not respond to SASS. The first five digits of CNTLNUMS and CNTLNUMD are identical, so users can create a new variable using a substring of these control numbers and merge the data files by the new variable name. The SAS syntax provided below illustrates how to merge the public school district data file with other data files using a substring. Please note that the data files being merged must be sorted by the variable listed in the \u201cby\u201d statement prior to performing the merge.\n\ndata workfilename1; set school_or_principal_or_teacherdatafile; newvariablename = substr (CNTLNUMS,1,5); run; proc sort; by newvariablename; run; data workfilename2; set districtdatafile; newvariablename = substr (CNTLNUMD,1, 5); run; proc sort; by newvariablename; run; data mergedfilename; merge workfilename1 workfilename2; /* no unit of analysis file is identified, so all\nrecords from both files will remain */ by newvariablename; run;\n\nAttaching Value Labels to Variables Extracted from the Electronic Codebook (ECB)\n\nWhile the formatting syntax is provided, it is up to the user to call up the labels. There are three primary ways to accomplish this.\n\nFirst, value labels for each variable can be reviewed within the ECB. When variables are extracted from the ECB there is a box on the right-hand side of the pop-up window that requests the creation of a codebook. Check this box in order to have the ECB create a text file with the codebook information for all extracted variables. Then within this text file use the find function to locate the variable and determine the value labels.\n\n\fChapter 11. Information on Data Files and Merging Components 211\n\nSecond, labels may be manually attached using the PROC step in SAS. To do this, review the syntax created from the extraction process to determine the value label name associated with each variable. In general, the Format name drops the last digit or letter in the variable name and adds the letter \u201cF\u201d at the end. There are exceptions to this rule.\n\nFor example, the appropriate SAS syntax for a PROC FREQ is\n\nproc freq; format varname formatname.; tables varname; run;\n\nA third method is to create a permanent value label library in SAS. This requires users to manipulate the SAS syntax generated from the extraction. To begin, users need to create a permanent library for the value formats that includes all of the value formats they would like to keep. The SAS syntax is as follows:\n\nlibname library \u2018C:\\librarypath\u2019;\n\n/* assigns format library, libname must be \u201clibrary\u201d */\n\nproc format library=library;\n\n/* creates permanent formats in the directory\n\nspecified in library libname statement */\n\n[List all of the value formats here]\n\nVALUE URBANIF\n\n1 = \u201cLarge or mid-size central city\u201d\n\n2 = \u201cUrban fringe of large or mid-size city\u201d\n\n3 = \u201cSmall town/rural\u201d\n\n;\n\nVALUE VIOLPRF\n\n0 = \u201cSchool does not have a violence prevention program\u201d\n\n1 = \u201cSchool has a violence prevention program but no formal procedure for assessing its\n\neffectiveness\u201d\n\n2 = \u201cSchool has a violence prevention program and a formal procedure for assessing its\n\neffectiveness\u201d;\n\nThe above syntax is written before the user\u2019s first data step and set statements. Within the data step programming that follows, the following format commands must be included:\n\nFORMAT varname valuename.;\n\nA complete list of variables and their assigned formats can be found in the ECB under the ECB\u2019s Documentation/Supplemental Materials label, in the table, \u201cSASS Format Names for the SAS Programming Language.\u201d\n\nSample SPSS Syntax for Merging Data Files Within SASS\n\nNOTE: Both data files being merged must be sorted by the variable listed in the \u201cby\u201d statement prior to performing the merge. In SPSS, value labels are attached automatically during the extraction process. Words in italics are meant to be replaced by meaningful file or variable names.\n\n\f212 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nMerging Data Files Using the School Control Number (CNTLNUMS)\nWhen merging any of the school, principal, teacher, or school library media center data files together for a given school, the school\u2019s control number, CNTLNUMS, is used to merge data files. The SPSS syntax is provided below.\nget file = \u2018dataset1.sav\u2019; sort cases by CNTLNUMS(A); save outfile = \u2018dataset1.sav\u2019; get file = \u2018dataset2.sav\u2019; sort cases by CNTLNUMS(A); save outfile = \u2018dataset2.sav\u2019; match files file = \u2018dataset1.sav\u2019\n/table \u2018dataset2\u2019 /by CNTLNUMS; save outfile = \u2018mergeddatafile.sav\u2019;\nMerging the Public School District Data File with Other Public Sector Data Files\nThere are two ways to merge the public school district data file with other public sector data files. The first is with the district\u2019s control number (CNTLNUMD). This variable is included on the public school district data file as well as the public school data file. The sample code provided above is correct, except that the merging variable will be CNTLNUMD.\nThe second method is by parsing out the first five digits of the district\u2019s and the school\u2019s control number. Users will need to use this method if the school did not respond to SASS. The first five digits of CNTLNUMS and CNTLNUMD are identical, so users can create a new variable using a substring of these control numbers and merge the data files by the new variable name. The SPSS syntax provided below illustrates how to merge the public school district data file with other data files using a substring. Please note that the data files being merged must be sorted by the variable listed in the \u201cby\u201d statement prior to performing the merge. In addition, including \u201c(a5)\u201d for the substring specifies the new variable as a five-character alphanumeric variable.\nget file = \u2018school_or_principal_or_teacher_or_librarydatafile.sav\u2019; string newvariablename (a5); compute newvariablename = substr(CNTLNUMS,1,5); sort cases by newvariablename; save outfile = \u2018temporarydatafile.sav\u2019; get file = \u2018districtdatafile.sav\u2019; string newvariablename (a5); compute newvariablename = substr(CNTLNUMD,1,5); sort cases by newvariablename; save outfile = \u2018temporarydistrictdatafile.sav\u2019; match files file = \u2018temporarydatafile.sav\u2019\n/table \u2018temporarydistrictdatafile\u2019 /by newvariablename; save outfile = \u2018mergeddatafile.sav\u2019;\n\n\fChapter 11. Information on Data Files and Merging Components 213\nSample Stata Syntax for Merging Data Files Within SASS\nMerging Restricted-use Data Files Using the School Control Number (CNTLNUMS)\nWhen merging any of the school, principal, teacher, or school library media center data files together for a given school, the school\u2019s control number, CNTLNUMS, is used to merge data files. The Stata syntax is provided below. Notice that both data files being merged must be sorted by the school control number prior to performing the merge. Words in italics are meant to be replaced by meaningful file or variable names.\nuse dataset1 sort CNTLNUMS save dataset1, replace use dataset2 sort CNTLNUMS save dataset2, replace merge CNTLNUMS using dataset1\nMerging the Restricted-use Public School District Data File with Other Public Sector Data Files\nThere are two ways to merge the public school district data file with other public sector data files. The first is with the district\u2019s control number (CNTLNUMD). This variable is included on the public school district data file as well as the public school data file. The sample code provided above is correct, except that the merging variable will be CNTLNUMD. However, since CNTLNUMD is not included on the principal, teacher, or school library media center data file, merging the public school district data file with these data files requires a different approach. Users will also need to use this method if the school did not respond to SASS.\nThe second method parses out the first five digits of the district\u2019s and the school\u2019s control number. The first five digits of CNTLNUMS and CNTLNUMD are identical, so users can create a new variable using a substring of these control numbers and merge the data files by the new variable name. The Stata syntax provided below illustrates how to merge the public school district data file with other data files using a substring. Please note that the data files being merged must be sorted by the variable listed in the \u201csort\u201d statement prior to performing the merge. Users may need to increase memory before beginning the merge.\nuse districtfile generate newvariablename = substr(CNTLNUMD,1,5) sort newvariablename save tempdistrictfile, replace use school_or_principal_or_teacher_or_libraryfile generate newvariablename = substr(CNTLNUMS,1,5) sort newvariablename save tempschool_or_principal_or_teacher_or_libraryfile, replace merge newvariablename using tempdistrictfile drop if _merge= =2 save mergedfile, replace\nUnless specified, the default name of the merge variable created during the merging of files is _merge. The variable _merge identifies the various categories of data in a one-to-one merge. For example, if users merge the public school district (\u201cusing\u201d data file) file onto the principal file (\u201cmaster\u201d data file):\n\n\f214 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n_merge= =1 observations from principal data file, no public school district data added (occurs with district nonresponse)\n_merge= =2 observations from only public school district data file (e.g., district responded, but there is no principal from that district)\n_merge= =3 observations from public school district and principal data files\nBy dropping the _merge= =2 observations, the merged data file will contain only principals, regardless of whether their district responded. No observations will remain when a district responded without a principal.\n\n\f215\nChapter 12. User Notes and Cautions\nThe following notes cover the created variable for percent minority enrollment (MINENR), Title 1 data in Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funded schools, data anomalies in created variables, the effect of missing data across files, the locale codes used on the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), departmentalized and elementary enrichment teachers with no reported classes, and the existence of leading spaces on certain character variables in extracted SPSS files.\nUsers may also be interested in examining the crosswalk of variables contained in \u201cAppendix U. Crosswalk Among Items in the 1987\u201388, 1990\u201391, 1993\u201394, 1999\u20132000, and 2003\u201304 SASS.\u201d This appendix has crosswalks for each SASS questionnaire as well as four crosswalks that compare similarities and differences across the 2003\u201304 SASS questionnaires given to each type of respondent (i.e., district, principal, school, or teacher). \u201cAppendix V. Main Teaching Assignment Variable\u201d may also be of interest. It contains a crosswalk that outlines how the changes in teaching assignment fields from the 1999\u20132000 SASS to the 2003\u201304 SASS were grouped to produce the main teacher assignment variable (ASSIGN03).\nPercent Minority Enrollment (MINENR)\nThis created variable is based on data from the school questionnaires and is placed on the principal, teacher, and school library media center data files. In cases where a sampled school did not respond to the SASS school questionnaire (i.e., unit nonresponse), this variable was created based on data from the Common Core of Data (CCD\u2014for public and public charter schools only) for 2001\u201302, which is the frame year. For about 400 records, the data that were pulled from the frame dataset onto the SASS principal, teacher, or school library media center file resulted in minority enrollment percentages that exceeded 100 percent. This occurred because data on total minority enrollment exceeded the data for total enrollment on CCD. These data were not edited to the same level of consistency that the SASS questionnaire variables received. Consequently, MINENR was edited so as not to exceed 100 percent; these cases have a value of 3 for the corresponding imputation flag variable (FL_MINEN). This affects 351 public school teachers, 73 public school principals, and 65 public school library media centers.\nTitle I Data in Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Funded Schools\nSome data checks for reasonableness do not require exact correspondence between the frame year and the SASS data collection year. One such case is that for the BIA-funded schools, where the Common Core of Data (CCD) data indicated that 100 percent were receiving Title I schoolwide funding in 2002\u201303. Schoolwide funding does not pay for particular teachers or services, but serves the school overall; eligible schools must have at least 40 percent of the students\u2019 families fall below the poverty threshold. In the 2003\u201304 SASS, only about 14.5 percent of the BIA-funded schools reported receiving Title I funding. This could be due to respondent error. Since BIA-funded schools already receive their funding from federal programs, at the school level, the respondents may not realize that Title I funds had also been received. The CCD information on Title I funding for BIA-funded schools comes directly from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Upon reviewing the reported data and noting the inconsistency with the CCD data, all of the Title I related variables, S0635 through S0656, were deleted from the BIA school data file. These are the only items removed from any of the 2003\u201304 SASS data files.\n\n\f216 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nData Anomalies in Created Variables\nConsistency edits were not always performed on created variables, which may result in some data anomalies. As one example, nine private schools reported a higher number of K\u201312 students participated in the free and reduced-price lunch program (S0634) than were enrolled in those grades (S0422). The created variable NSLAPP_S, which measures the percentage of K\u201312 students participating in the National School Lunch Program, was truncated to 100 percent for these nine cases.\nMissing Data Can Cause Inconsistencies Across Files\nConsistency edits are applied to survey items for each questionnaire, but there are some cases in which the inconsistencies cannot be resolved. For example, on the private school teacher data file, if the school did not respond to the 2003\u201304 SASS, but one or more teachers did respond, the school\u2019s program type (PGMTYPE), typology (TYPOLOGY), affiliation (AFF_99), affiliation stratum (STRATA), and religious classification (RELIG) may have inconsistent data. When the school questionnaire is not filled out, assumptions are made about which type of school it is in order to put that information on the principal, teacher, or school library media center data file. It is assumed that the sampling frame information is correct.\nLocale Codes Based on 1990 and 2000 Census Geography\nThe locale codes that exist on the 2003\u201304 SASS data files are based upon the geographic concepts used in the 1990 and 2000 Decennial Censuses. (SLOCP_99 uses the 1990 Census metropolitan areas, and SLOCP_03 and URBANS03 use the 2000 Census metropolitan areas.) That is, while the district classifications reported in the locale codes are based on the Census Bureau\u2019s annual update, the specific categories reported in the 2003\u201304 SASS and how these categories are defined are based, respectively, upon the 1990 or 2000 set of definitions for central city, urban fringe of large or medium-sized central city, large or small town, and rural areas either inside a metropolitan area or outside a metropolitan area.\nOver time, how metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas are defined has evolved. The 1990 Decennial Census geographic areas were based upon countywide definitions of metropolitan or nonmetropolitan areas. By the 2000 Census, urban and rural classifications were based on a subcounty level. In 2003, the Office of Management and Budget changed the terminology, replacing \u201ccentral city\u201d with \u201cprincipal city\u201d and \u201cStandardized Metropolitan Statistical Area\u201d (SMSA) with \u201cCore-based Statistical Area\u201d (CBSA). However, these newer terms and locale codes could not be used in the 2003\u201304 SASS because the 2003 geographic classification of schools or school districts had not been completely implemented into the Common Core of Data (CCD) or the Private School Universe Survey (PSS), which serve as the sampling frames for SASS, by the time the 2003\u201304 SASS data were being processed. Since then, the 2003\u201304 CCD and 2003\u201304 PSS have incorporated a new set of 12-level locale codes.\nDepartmentalized and Elementary Enrichment Teachers With No Reported Classes (T0076)\nOn the 2003\u201304 SASS teacher data files (public, private, and BIA), respondents with departmentalized and elementary enrichment classes were asked to report the number of separate classes (or sections) they currently teach (Q18, T0076). For each class (or section), they were to provide detailed information on the subject, grade level, and enrollment of each class (Q19). Of all departmentalized and elementary enrichment teachers, a total of 26 teachers reported teaching no classes in question 18. No edit was done\n\n\fChapter 12. User Notes and Cautions 217\non teachers reporting zero classes and question 18 was not imputed for any of the 26 teachers (F_T0076 = 0). Since all teachers in the SASS sample should be teaching in some capacity, this is an anomaly of which users should be aware. These teachers differ on a variety of characteristics, including sector, classroom organization, employment status, main assignment, teacher and school level, and urbanicity. For example, of the 26 teachers\n\u2022 nineteen are departmentalized and seven are elementary enrichment; and \u2022 twenty-one come from public schools, four from private schools, and one from a BIA-funded\nschool.\nThese teachers have been included in analyses done by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Researchers who choose to exclude them will produce slightly different estimates.\nLeading Spaces on Character Variables\nSeveral character variables on the 2003\u201304 SASS data files have been formatted with leading spaces: SC_NEID and the teacher grade-level codes (T0078, T0081, T0084, T0087, T0090, T0093, T0096, T0099, T0102, and T0105). This occurs only on the extracted SPSS files and not the SAS or Stata files. When using these variables to run an analysis in SPSS involving a restriction on the type of cases to include (e.g., \u201cselect if\u201d or \u201cfilter by\u201d statements), users will need to either enter the leading space(s) in the syntax or recode the variable(s) to remove the spaces. The following code demonstrates how to recode character variables with leading spaces.\nThe single character grade-level codes (1\u20139 and K) contain one leading space. The following sample code demonstrates how to recode these variables using T0078 as an example:\nRECODE T0078 (' 1'='1') (' 2'='2') (' 3'='3') (' 4'='4') (' 5'='5') (' 6'='6') (' 7'='7') (' 8'='8') (' 9'='9') (' K' = 'K')\nCases assigned a valid skip on SC_NEID contain 10 leading spaces before the -8 value. Use the following code to recode this variable:\nRECODE SC_NEID (' -8'='-8').\n\n\fThis page is intentionally left blank.\n\n\f219\nReferences\nEfron, B. (1982).

Key Terms for SASS\nThe following terms are defined as they apply to the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS).\nAffiliation stratum. SASS uses 17 categories into which all private schools are divided based on religious or nonreligious orientation/affiliation. These categories are Catholic\u2014Parochial, Catholic\u2014 Diocesan, Catholic\u2014Private, Amish, Assembly of God, Baptist, Episcopal, Jewish, Lutheran Church\u2014 Missouri Synod, Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, Mennonite, Pentecostal, Seventh-Day Adventist, Other Religious, Nonsectarian\u2014Regular, Nonsectarian\u2014Special Emphasis, and Nonsectarian\u2014Special Education.\nBase weight. This is the inverse of the probability of selection including all sampling, the inverse of the initial probability of selection (termed the initial basic weight), subsampling, or adjustments to the probability of selection due to schools determined to be splits or mergers during field operations. These adjustments to the initial probability of selection are called the sampling adjustment factor. The base weight is defined as the product of the initial basic weight and the sampling adjustment factor.\nCapacity. The SASS questionnaires do not provide a definition for this term. A general definition is the number of students a building can accommodate without being considered overcrowded.\nCertification. A license or certificate awarded to teachers either by the state or by another accrediting or certifying body to teach in a public or private school. The SASS surveys include five types of certification granted by the state: regular or standard state certification or advanced professional certificate; probationary certificate\u2014issued after satisfying all requirements except the completion of a probationary period; provisional or other type of certificate given to persons who are still participating in what the state calls an \u201calternative certification program\u201d; temporary certification\u2014requires some additional college coursework, student teaching, and/or passage of a test before regular certification can be obtained; and waiver or emergency certificate\u2014issued to persons with insufficient teacher preparation who must complete a regular certification program in order to continue teaching.\nCommon Core of Data (CCD). CCD is the Department of Education\u2019s primary database on public elementary and secondary education in the United States. CCD is a comprehensive, annual, national statistical database of all public elementary and secondary schools and school districts, and contains data that are designed to be comparable across all states. The objectives of CCD are twofold: first, to provide an official listing of public elementary and secondary schools and school districts in the nation, which can be used to select samples for other National Center for Education Statistics surveys; and second, to provide basic information and descriptive statistics on public elementary and secondary schools and schooling in general.\nContent area. This term is not defined in the SASS questionnaires. A general definition is a division or field of organized knowledge, such as English or mathematics.\nDistance learning. The SASS School Library Media Center Questionnaire defines distance learning as programs in which lessons are taught via television, satellite, or computer network.\n\n\fA-2 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nEducation Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS). A longitudinal survey commissioned by the National Center for Education Statistics that is designed to monitor the transition of a national sample of young people as they progress from 10th grade through high school and on to postsecondary education and/or the world of work. ELS will follow the progress of a cohort of high school students over time with the goal of explaining how their earlier aspirations, achievement, and high school situation affect their postsecondary school lives.\nFinal weight. This is the product of the initial basic weight, sampling adjustment factor, separate adjustments for nonresponse at each stage of selection, and one or more stages of ratio adjustment to the frame or to independent sources. The final weight is used to produce weighted estimates from the survey data. See chapter 9 for details of the weighting procedure.\nFIPS. FIPS stands for Federal Information Processing Standards and refers to a variety of codes for standardized reference. FIPS county and state codes are developed by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) as numeric identifiers for each county and state in the United States; state codes are listed in the codebooks, while the county codes may be looked up in NIST publications. (For more information go to www.nist.gov.)\nFull-time equivalent (FTE). Full-time equivalent (FTE) quantifies school district and school staff positions in proportion to a full-time position. For example, if a full-time teacher works 35 hours per week in school district X, then a teacher who works 21 hours would have an FTE of 0.6 in that school district.\nFree or reduced-price lunches. A federally funded program to aid schools in providing an adequate lunch at school. Schools are reimbursed to provide meals to students, either free or for a reduced price. See the description of the National School Lunch Program.\nIndividual Education Plan (IEP). An Individual Education Plan (IEP) is required for all students with an identified disability under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Each public school child who receives special education and related services must have an IEP. Each IEP must be designed for one student and must be a truly individualized document. The IEP creates an opportunity for teachers, parents, school administrators, related services personnel, and students (when appropriate) to work together to improve educational results for children with disabilities.\nInitial basic weight. This is the inverse of the probability of selection from the initial sampling procedure. In contrast, the base weight is the inverse of the probability of selection covering all sampling, including any subsampling or adjustments to the probability of selection due to schools determined to be splits or mergers during field operations.\nLibrarian. A librarian is a school staff member whose main responsibility is taking care of the school\u2019s library.\nLibrary expenditures. Expenditures for information resources are divided into five categories: books, video materials, CD-ROM titles, current subscriptions in any format, and electronic databases. The SASS School Library Media Center Questionnaire also asks for total expenditures for all information resources, which may be greater than the sum of the five categories. Other types of library expenditures may include a professional collection, computer hardware and other communications equipment, and other audiovisual equipment. Expenditures may vary greatly from one administration of SASS to the next, due to the receipt of grants or gifts by school library media centers.\n\n\fAppendix A. Key Terms for SASS A-3\nLibrary media center. A library media center is an organized collection of printed, and/or audio-visual, and/or computer resources that (a) is administered as a unit, (b) is located in a designated place or places, and (c) makes resources and services available to students, teachers, and administrators. A library media center may be called a library, media center, resource center, information center, instructional materials center, learning resource center, or some other name.\nLibrary media specialist. A library media specialist is a school professional staff member who is statecertified in the field of library media.\nLimited-English Proficiency. The SASS school questionnaires define limited-English-proficient (LEP) students as students whose native or dominant language is other than English and who have sufficient difficulty speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English language as to deny them the opportunity to learn successfully in an English-speaking-only classroom. LEP students can be taught subject matter courses in a variety of methods such as using their native language; in English as a Second Language (ESL), bilingual, or immersion classes; and in English-only classrooms.\nLocal education agency (LEA). An LEA, or public school district, is a government agency that employs elementary or secondary teachers and is administratively responsible for providing public elementary or secondary instruction and educational support services. To be considered an LEA in SASS, the organization must be responsible for hiring and firing teachers and setting teacher salaries. Additionally, the organization should have a role in setting teacher and administrator professional development and training priorities.\nMajor or minor. A field of study in which an individual has taken substantial academic coursework, implying that the individual has substantial knowledge of the academic discipline or subject area.\nMissing data. SASS is a fully imputed dataset. Consequently, the only survey items that lack responses are either those that are part of a skip pattern and should not have been answered by a particular respondent or write-in responses, which include data too specific to reasonably impute from another respondent\u2019s data. Data pulled from the frame (i.e., the Common Core of Data or the Private School Universe Survey) are not necessarily imputed for missing data. In these instances, a value of -9, indicating missing data, is provided for that variable.\nNational School Lunch Program. The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) is a federally assisted meal program operating in public and nonprofit private schools and residential child care institutions. It provides nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free lunches to children each school day. School districts and independent schools that choose to take part in the lunch program receive cash subsidies and donated commodities from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for each meal they serve. In return, they must serve lunches that meet federal requirements, and they must offer free or reduced-price lunches to eligible children. School food authorities can also be reimbursed for snacks served to children through age 18 in afterschool educational or enrichment programs.\nNational School Lunch Program, Approved. To be approved for a free or reduced-price lunch, a student must meet the income eligibility requirements and must be enrolled in a school or district that participates in the National School Lunch Program. In addition, the student\u2019s family must fill out an enrollment form to apply for a free or a reduced-price lunch.\nPrivate School Universe Survey (PSS). PSS is a biennial survey designed to collect data from all K\u201312 private schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. It is the universe from which the sample for the private school component of SASS is selected.\n\n\fA-4 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nSalary schedule. The SASS questionnaires do not provide a definition. A general definition is a listing of teacher salary levels offered by the school or district on which a teacher\u2019s salary is based. The schedule is often based on years of experience and degrees earned.\nSampling adjustment factor. In the weighting process for each SASS respondent, the sampling adjustment factor is applied to the initial basic weight to account for any additional circumstances affecting the probability of selection. The product of the initial basic weight and the sampling adjustment factor is the base weight. See the definitions for initial basic weight and base weight.\nSchool. SASS defines a school slightly differently than the Common Core of Data (CCD). Both consider a school to be an institution or part of an institution that provides classroom instruction to students; has one or more teachers to provide instruction; serves students in one or more grades (1\u201312) or the ungraded equivalent; and is located in one or more buildings. It is possible for two or more schools to share the same building; in this case they are treated as different schools if they have different administrations (e.g., principals). It is with the definition of \u201cadministration\u201d that SASS diverges slightly from the CCD definition of a school. For the purposes of SASS, the schools are separate if the grade ranges are autonomous from one another. For example, in a case of an elementary school where the principal reports to the high school principal who is also the district level superintendent, SASS would consider this one school, since the elementary school does not operate independently of the high school. CCD would consider these two schools since they have separate administrators.\nSchool, alternative. Alternative schools serve students whose needs cannot be met in a regular, special education, or vocational school. They provide nontraditional education and may serve as an adjunct to a regular school. They fall outside of the categories of regular, special education, and vocational education, although they may provide similar services or curriculum. Some examples of alternative schools are those for potential drop-outs, residential treatment centers for substance abuse (if they provide elementary or secondary education), and schools for chronic truants.\nSchool, high American Indian. High American Indian schools are public schools where 19.5 percent or more of the students are American Indian or Alaska Native, as reported in the 2001\u201302 Common Core of Data. This classification was used in stratifying the SASS public school sample in order to improve estimates of the American Indian and Alaska Native student population.\nSchool, Bureau of Indian Affairs-funded (BIA). BIA-funded schools meet all school criteria and are funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. These schools may be operated by or under contract with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Indian nations, or private entities (e.g., Jesuit orders). Schools are reported as a BIA-funded school by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and offer services to Indian students. These may include day schools, boarding schools, previously private schools, cooperative schools, and contract schools.\nSchool, charter. A public charter school is a public school that, in accordance with an enabling state statute, has been granted a charter exempting it from selected state or local rules and regulations. A public charter school may be a newly created school or it may previously have been a public or private school.\nSchool, combined. A school is classified as combined if it has one or more of grades K\u20136 and one or more of grades 9\u201312; for example, schools with grades K\u201312, 6\u201312, 6\u20139, or 1\u201312 were classified as having combined grades. Schools in which all students are ungraded (i.e., not classified by standard grade levels) are also classified as combined.\n\n\fAppendix A. Key Terms for SASS A-5\nSchool, elementary. A school is classified as elementary if it has one or more of grades K\u20136 and does not have any grade higher than grade 8; for example, schools with grades K\u20136, 1\u20133, or 6\u20138 are classified as elementary. Schools with only kindergarten or prekindergarten were not included in the survey.\nSchool, private. A private school is a school that is not supported primarily by public funds (i.e., it is not a public school). It must provide instruction for one or more of grades 1 through 12 (or comparable ungraded levels) and have one or more teachers. Organizations or institutions that provide support for homeschooling but do not offer classroom instruction for students are not included.\nSchool, public. A public school meets all school criteria; has an assigned principal or acting principal; receives public funding as primary support; provides free public elementary and/or secondary schooling to eligible students; and is operated by a local education agency or a contracted education program.\n\u2022 Also includes domestic Department of Defense schools. \u2022 Is considered a school by the state (or in the case of California and Pennsylvania by the county\neducation office) in which it is located.\nSchool, secondary. A school is classified as secondary if it has one or more of grades 7\u201312 and does not have any grade lower than grade 7; for example, schools with grades 9\u201312, 7\u20139, 10\u201312, or 7\u20138 are classified as secondary.\nSchool, special education. Special education schools provide educational services to students with special physical or mental needs; that is, students with mental handicaps (e.g., mental retardation or autism), physical handicaps (e.g., hearing impairment), or learning disabilities (e.g., dyslexia).\nSchool, traditional public. Traditional public schools are the subset of all public schools that are not public charter schools. They include regular, special education, vocational/technical, and alternative schools. They also include schools in juvenile detention centers, domestic schools located on military bases and operated by the Department of Defense, and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funded schools operated by local public school districts. See also the definitions for public and public charter schools.\nSchool, vocational. Vocational schools primarily serve students who are being trained for semi-skilled or technical occupations.\nTeacher. A teacher is any full-time or part-time school staff member who teaches one or more regularly scheduled classes in any of grades K\u201312 (or comparable ungraded levels).1 In addition to regular full-time teachers, the following types of teachers are also included:\n1. itinerant teachers; 2. long-term substitutes who fill the role of a regular teacher on a long-term basis; 3. administrators, counselors, librarians, and other professional or support staff who teach any\nregularly scheduled classes; and 4. other part-time teachers.\nShort-term substitute teachers and student teachers are not included.\n1 This definition differs from the one used for the 1987\u201388 and 1990\u201391 administrations of SASS. In those surveys, a teacher was defined as a school staff member whose primary assignment was teaching in any of grades K\u201312. School staff whose primary assignment was something other than teaching were excluded, even if they taught some regularly scheduled classes.\n\n\fA-6 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nTeacher, itinerant. An itinerant teacher teaches at more than one school; for example, a music teacher who teaches 3 days per week at one school and 2 days per week at another.\nTeachers, newly hired. Newly hired teachers are teachers who were hired by a public school district, public charter school, private school, or BIA-funded school for the 2003\u201304 school year. They included teachers returning from an unpaid leave of absence of one school year or more, but not short-term substitute teachers.\nTitle I. The SASS school questionnaires define Title I as a federally funded program that provides educational services, such as remedial reading or remedial mathematics, to children who live in areas with high concentrations of low-income families. Title I can be administered as a targeted assistance or schoolwide program. A targeted assistance Title I program provides categorical funding to specific students identified as in need of assistance. A schoolwide Title I program refers to schools that use Title I funds to improve the effectiveness of the entire school.\nTypology, private school. Private schools were assigned to one of three major categories (i.e., Catholic, other religious, and nonsectarian). Within each of these major categories, three additional subcategories were assigned. As a result, two typology-based variables exist on the private sector data files; a \u201c3-level typology\u201d (RELIG) and a \u201c9-level typology\u201d (TYPOLOGY). The categories and subcategories are\n1. Catholic\u2014parochial, diocesan, and private; 2. Other religious\u2014conservative Christian, affiliated with a religious school association, and not\naffiliated with a religious school association; and 3. Nonsectarian\u2014regular, special program emphasis, and special education.2\nUngraded students. Ungraded students are those who are not assigned to a particular grade level (kindergarten, 1st grade, 2nd grade, etc.); for example, special education centers and alternative schools often classify their students as ungraded. Students in Montessori schools are also considered ungraded if the school assigns them to \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201cintermediate\u201d levels instead of specific grades.\nValid skip. An item that was not applicable due to a response to a previous item on the same questionnaire and was provided with a value of -8, indicating a valid skip. Certain survey items direct respondents to skip subsequent items based on their answers to the original item, or stem. For instance, if a respondent answered \u201cNo\u201d to item 8a on the School Questionnaire (\u201cDoes this school have a kindergarten?\u201d), he or she was directed to skip items 8b and 8c (respectively, \u201cHow long is the school day for a kindergarten student?\u201d and \u201cHow many days per week does a kindergarten student attend?\u201d) and to \u201cGO TO item 9 below.\u201d Because the respondent answered that the school in question does not have a kindergarten, subsequent questions about kindergarten students at that school were not applicable. In instances when an item should not have been answered by the respondent, a value of -8, which designates a valid skip, is applied to that variable(s).\n2 For more complete information, see NCES 92-082, Diversity of Private Schools, by Marilyn M. McMillen and Peter Benson, at http://nces.ed.gov/pubs92/92082.pdf.\n\n\fB-1\nAppendix B. Questionnaire Availability\nOnline, Downloadable PDF Files\nQuestionnaires for every data collection component in every survey cycle since the first 1987\u201388 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) and the first 1988\u201389 Teacher Follow-up Survey (TFS) are available online as downloadable PDF files at\nhttp://nces.ed.gov/surveys/sass/questionnaire.asp\nSelect the survey year of interest and then proceed to select the specific questionnaire to browse or download. The Teacher Listing Form is the form that gathers the data used to select the teacher sample. While no data for this form are reported publicly, the questionnaire form is available on the SASS website only for those interested in survey methodology.\nIn general, as the 4-year survey cycle advances toward the next data collection, the questionnaires will be posted online as they are finalized and sent to the printer. That is generally about 2 months prior to the data collection phase of the survey cycle. The next survey cycle is planned for the 2007\u201308 school year.\nThe portable document format (PDF) files of the questionnaires are also available on the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) CD-ROM with Electronic Codebook. All of the 2003\u201304 SASS questionnaires are available on the restricted-use version (NCES 2007-313). No public-use version of the ECB will be produced.\nAll of the SASS and TFS questionnaires are in the public domain. All survey items may be copied by anyone who wishes to use them in another survey, without any restrictions.\n\n\fThis page is intentionally left blank.\n\n\fC-1\nAppendix C.

Nonrespondents were contacted first by telephone, using the computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) instrument for all forms except the Teacher Listing Form, and ultimately by Census Bureau field staff. The 2001\u201302 Pretest featured a new data collection methodology, in which the initial contact with the school and all subsequent follow-up were conducted during personal visits by Census Bureau field staff. The purpose of the Pretest was to see if this new approach would be more timely, yield a higher response rate, improve data quality, and decrease costs.\nOverview of Pretest Operations\nField operations for the Pretest began on October 1, 2001, and were completed by March 29, 2002. The Pretest was conducted with the assumption that personal visits to the schools by Census Bureau field representatives from the beginning of the survey would build relationships with schools; this would result in similar or better response rates in a more timely manner than the past collection methods of mailout, CATI follow-up, and field follow-up. The Pretest had several objectives, as follows:\n\u2022 to use all information from the test to decide the best methods for data collection in the next fullscale SASS;\n\u2022 to estimate the costs of using field staff in the full-scale SASS, using this new approach; \u2022 to develop and test field materials and procedures that would be used with this approach; \u2022 to observe effects on the schools\u2019 willingness to respond; and \u2022 to test two methods of teacher sampling and data collection.\no Teacher Listing Forms were sent to the Census Bureau clerical processing staff, where sampling took place. The clerical processing staff labeled and mailed forms to respondents at schools. Field representatives conducted nonresponse follow-up in the spring.\no Field representatives selected teachers from the Teacher Listing Form, filled in the cover page of questionnaires, and conducted interviews in the fall.\nThe Pretest included two phases and two methods of teacher sampling and data collection. The first phase involved visiting 357 schools in the areas surrounding the Seattle, Atlanta, and Denver Census Bureau Regional Offices to complete the Teacher Listing Form, the appropriate questionnaires for schools and principals, and the school library media center questionnaire. In the first method of teacher sampling and data collection, the field representatives themselves sampled teachers from the Teacher Listing Form at half of the schools and left the appropriate teacher questionnaires for the selected teachers to complete. The field representatives either collected all the forms for the school at the end of this initial visit or made arrangements to either pick up completed forms at a later time or have them mailed to the Regional Office. The schools that did not have their teachers sampled on site received the second method for teacher sampling and data collection, and they were instructed to send their Teacher Listing Forms to the Census Bureau clerical processing staff for the teacher sample selection. The first phase was scheduled for completion on November 21, 2001, but the Regional Offices found that they could not meet this deadline with adequate response rates on all forms. Therefore, after consultations at a previously scheduled debriefing session, the Regional Offices were given until January 28, 2002, to complete this phase of the Pretest.\nThe second phase began on November 29, 2001, when the Census Bureau clerical processing staff made the initial mailout of the appropriate teacher questionnaires to the sampled teachers at their schools. Field follow-up of the nonresponding teachers began on February 5, 2002, and was completed on March 29, 2002.\n\n\fAppendix C. Report on 2001\u201302 SASS Pretest and Recommendations for 2003\u201304 SASS C-3\nDetailed Methodology\nIn order to determine whether or not the proposed data collection methodology would be beneficial, the Pretest needed to be conducted in a sufficient number of schools. A total of 357 schools in three Regional Offices were chosen. The characteristics of the schools included in the Pretest were designed to be representative of the national SASS sample. For example, an appropriate mix of large and small schools, urban and rural schools, and schools from groups or affiliations that were less or more likely to respond to SASS were used in this Pretest. In addition, the workloads given to the 21 field representatives were to approximate what each field representative would normally receive during a full-scale SASS, which was approximately 17 schools each. For half of the schools, field representatives sampled teachers in the field.\nDetailed procedures and training were prepared for field staff to accomplish the work using the new data collection procedures. Field representatives\u2019 visits to schools were observed and, in addition, field representatives kept detailed logs documenting the time they spent and the activities they accomplished during the Pretest.\nStaff followed the procedures outlined below.\n1. Regional Office staff and field representatives were trained using training developed by Census Bureau headquarters staff: o Three supervisors traveled to headquarters for a 1-day training session. o Field representatives completed a 6-hour self-study.\n2. Schools were mailed an advance letter in September 2001.\n3. Field representatives contacted schools and made appointments. They selected a sample of teachers in designated schools and distributed questionnaires, logged all time and travel required for contact and visits, and documented what worked and what did not. They visited each school to o verify status of the school and find out if any actions with the school district or county were required before data collection could begin (contacting their supervisor for instructions on how to handle split or merged schools); o drop off (or complete on-the-spot) the Teacher Listing Form, the appropriate questionnaires for principals and schools, and the school library media center questionnaire; o present critical school staff with SASS objectives and timetable; o go over appropriate grade ranges to report for that school; o complete a form that designates the contact name, phone number, e-mail address, and location of the staff member responsible for filling out each questionnaire; o discuss plan for contacting selected teachers and document details; and o meet with each contact and document plan for completing questionnaire (this may include getting a listing of teachers from school in lieu of filling out the Teacher Listing Form).\n4. Field representatives attempted to arrange three or four of these visits in a 2-day period. Observers from the Census Bureau, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and the Education Statistics Services Institute sometimes accompanied field representatives to these schools.\n5. Field representatives conducted telephone follow-up to check on the status of forms. Depending on circumstances, a field representative may have decided to o conduct telephone interviews to complete forms; or\n\n\fC-4 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\no make another visit to the school to pick up completed forms and/or complete remaining forms in person.\n6. In general, follow-up efforts continued until the Regional Office achieved response rates greater than or equal to the 1999\u20132000 national response rates.\n7. Again, field representatives logged all time and travel required for contact and visits (if any), and documented what worked and what did not.\n8. For schools that had their teachers sampled by Census Bureau clerical processing staff, questionnaires were mailed to teachers in November. The Regional Offices mailed second questionnaires to nonresponding teachers in January 2002. Field representatives conducted nonresponse follow-up beginning in February. Again, field representatives logged all time and travel required for contact and visits (if any), and documented what worked and what did not.\n9. Census Bureau clerical processing staff keyed all Teacher Listing Forms.\nSchool Sample\nThe 1999\u20132000 sampling programs were rerun with a different start, resulting in a new sample of approximately 14,000 public and private schools. Using the Regional Office code, schools were extracted in the three test Regional Offices. Field staff looked over the lists of schools and selected field representatives to work on the test, including experienced field representatives, some of whom had worked on SASS (just as in a full-scale SASS). Field staff, along with Census Bureau analysts and sampling staff, selected schools by hand so that each field representative had a realistic SASS workload. The sampling staff attempted to include schools with the following characteristics:\n\u2022 urban and rural; \u2022 large and small student enrollment; \u2022 some schools with definitional issues; and \u2022 private schools with different affiliations (if it is decided to include these schools).\nWithin each field representative\u2019s workload, like-kind schools were matched, with one designated for field representative sampling and the other for sampling by Census Bureau clerical processing staff.\nMaterials Developed and Tested\n\u2022 Advance letter to school. This letter included the Regional Office 800-telephone number to call with any questions. Regional Office staff referred questions to Census Bureau analysts as necessary.\n\u2022 Field representative manual. This included sections on overview of procedures, initial visit to school, teacher sampling procedures, follow-up procedures, and detailed instructions on questionnaires (for each of the principal, school, school library media center, and teacher questionnaires).\n\u2022 Field supervisor training. This 1-day training consisted of individual presentations, mostly based on the field representative manual.\n\u2022 Field representative self-study. This self-study training was provided to all field representatives and took between 6 and 12 hours to complete.\n\u2022 Action flowchart for initial visit. This flowchart provided a list of scenarios and solutions to cover out-of-scope schools, school district and county issues, and issues with the school\u2019s grade range.\n\n\fAppendix C. Report on 2001\u201302 SASS Pretest and Recommendations for 2003\u201304 SASS C-5\n\u2022 School contacts form. There was a control form for each questionnaire that the field representative used to record contact information about the respondent for that questionnaire.\n\u2022 Time and actions log. These logs were for field representatives to record their actions and the time spent at each school.\nEvaluation\nThe evaluation of the proposed methodology was to be based on debriefing sessions in December, cost analysis, observation reports, field representative logs, response rates, and examination of completed questionnaires.\nSummary of Results and Recommendations\nAfter reviewing the Pretest results, the methods used in the Pretest were recommended for adoption for the 2003\u201304 SASS. The results are summarized briefly below. The sections following the summary provide a detailed discussion of the results. The final two sections, \u201cNotes from the Supervisors\u2019 SASS Debriefing\u201d and \u201cComments from SASS Field Representative Debriefing Conference,\u201d contain the summary of feedback obtained from Regional Office staff and field representatives, respectively, at a centralized debriefing session conducted December 3 and 4, 2001, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\nTiming. The survey products could be completed 6 to 8 months earlier by using the new methods. Data collection would begin in October 2003 and be completed by February 2004, that is, 4 months earlier than the previous SASS. Staff could begin working on processing specifications 4 months earlier if the work involved in preparing the CATI instruments were eliminated.\nResponse. The response rates on the Pretest were lower than the rates achieved on the 1999\u20132000 SASS at the school level, but higher at the teacher level. The lower school-level rates occurred because several schools that may have participated in a full-scale SASS refused to participate in the Pretest. Field staff anticipated that response would at least be maintained at the same level and would probably improve in the future when SASS is a full production survey rather than a Pretest.\nData Quality. As with response rates, the Pretest did not demonstrate a clear improvement in data quality. However, there were indications that the Teacher Listing Form data were less problematic and that a few items on the other SASS questionnaires may have had better item response rates than previously.\nFindings: Timing\nTiming of Data Collection\nCensus Bureau field division staff requested that the three participating regions preselect a group of field representatives to participate in the SASS Pretest. Census Bureau sampling staff selected a full sample of schools using the 1999\u20132000 sampling frame, and then used the field representatives\u2019 physical location as a basis for selecting the specific sample of schools. (This will not be repeated for the full-scale SASS.) The field representative training guide was written during the summer of 2001 and consisted of a selfstudy only (no classroom session). This training package will be used as the basis for the training used for the full-scale 2003\u201304 SASS.\nThe fall of 2001 time frame for the SASS Pretest appeared to work well despite heavy survey demands that faced the Regional Offices for other one-time projects that occurred concurrently. Originally, data collection was planned to start in mid-September, but because of the events of September 11, 2001, this\n\n\fC-6 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nwas delayed roughly by 2 weeks. In addition, the school district portion of SASS was not conducted as part of the Pretest, and sometimes when the district participates the schools feel that they have \u201cpermission\u201d to participate as well. For this reason, some schools chose not to participate but said they would have participated if it had been a full-scale SASS. A key timing element for the full-scale SASS will be school district contact and approval prior to initial school visits.\nFieldwork for the questionnaires assigned in the fall was scheduled to be completed by November 21, 2001. In fact, staff needed additional time to complete the work, because several schools or respondents were unwilling to participate in the survey during the first several weeks, and additional follow-up efforts were needed. In order to achieve adequate response rates, the Regional Offices were given until January 28, 2002, to complete this phase of the Pretest. Field staff members were confident that a time frame of October through February is achievable. Under the mailout/CATI/field methods used in previous rounds of SASS, data collection continued up until schools closed for the summer.\nAn element that will improve timing in the future is the conversion to Regional Office Sample Control (ROSCO). In the Pretest, staff developed an MS Access database for Regional Office staff to use in controlling assignments. While the system contained all of the relevant information, the system did not have \u201creal-time\u201d links directly to the field representatives to monitor work. The Regional Offices only knew whether a completed questionnaire had been received. Supervisors had to contact field representatives to determine the status of work not yet received, making it difficult for the supervisors to monitor the progress of field representatives. ROSCO will provide all field staff with the current status of all assigned questionnaires, allowing for more proactive supervision.\nTiming of Work on Processing Specifications\nUnder the mailout/CATI/field methods used in previous rounds of SASS, Census Bureau analysts first worked on preparing all procedures for the mailout activities that began at the start of the school year. From September through January 2001, staff prepared the CATI instruments and procedures. Staff began working on the SASS processing system in February 2001. By eliminating CATI, staff would be able to begin work on processing specifications in the fall months, which was expected to accelerate processing activities by approximately 4 months.\nFindings: Data Quality of Teacher Listing Form\nCensus Bureau sampling staff reviewed the Teacher Listing Forms that were completed in the Pretest to determine if the quality of these forms differed from the quality of the forms completed during the 1999\u2013 2000 SASS. Table C-1 displays the results of this review in terms of the number of errors found.\n\n\fAppendix C. Report on 2001\u201302 SASS Pretest and Recommendations for 2003\u201304 SASS C-7\n\nTable C-1.

This compared favorably with 1999\u20132000, when approximately 80 percent of all the sample schools\u2019 forms contained no error.\n\nA few of these errors are worth discussing further. Eight schools reported all or nearly all of their teachers as English as a Second Language (ESL)/Bilingual. It is not clear whether or not this situation can realistically happen. Further investigation is needed to determine if these ESL/Bilingual teachers classified themselves as such on the teacher questionnaire. If there is some confusion, the Census Bureau would recommend revising the wording of the form. In addition, only three of the potential definitional problem schools reported teachers covering the wrong grade range, which represents approximately 5 percent of the potential definitional problem schools. The incidence of this is much reduced from the 1999\u20132000 SASS, when an approximate minimum of 10 percent of the schools with a potential problem with their grade range reported the wrong grade range initially. Consequently, the new procedure of having the field representative meet with a school official to discuss the grade range issue resulted in a considerable improvement in the quality of the Teacher Listing Form reporting for the definitional problem schools. A related problem is found in the two schools that reported teacher status incorrectly. A school may have many teachers who are employed full time, but only teach part of the time in the selected grade range. This distinction appears to have been made successfully to the affected schools in general, with the exception of a few cases. This problem is less severe than reporting teachers who do not teach in the selected grade range, since the teacher\u2019s full-time or part-time status does not affect the eligibility of teachers for sampling or the probability of selection.\n\n\fC-8 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nInvestigation of Definitional Problem Schools\nCensus Bureau sampling staff investigated schools in the Pretest that had potential definitional problems. The school questionnaire data were reviewed and compared to the Common Core of Data (CCD) as well as to the Teacher Listing Forms. These schools were located in Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Of the 53 schools selected in these states, 2 refused the survey, 3 were out-of-scope, 32 appear to have reported correctly (i.e., their responses matched the information on CCD), and 16 reported incorrectly (enrollment or teacher counts or both). Of the 16 reporting incorrectly, 13 had filled out the Teacher Listing Form correctly, and 3 had made the same mistake in filling out the Teacher Listing Form. The implication is that about 33 percent of the definitional problem schools are reporting incorrectly on the school questionnaire even though most reported correctly on the Teacher Listing Form. This school questionnaire error rate is quite high and fairly comparable to the error rate observed for these schools in the 1999\u20132000 SASS. It appears the improvement in the Teacher Listing Form did not extend to the school questionnaire.\nOne hypothesis was that the field representative initially met with the principal to explain the definitional problem, and then another staff member who was unaware of the problem filled out the school questionnaire. However, of the 13 schools that reported correctly on the Teacher Listing Form and incorrectly on the school questionnaire, at 9 schools the Teacher Listing Form and school questionnaire were completed by the same person and only at 3 schools by a different person (for one survey, the respondent could not be determined). This compares to the three cases where both forms were completed incorrectly, in which two cases were completed by the same respondent and one by a different respondent. There appears to be no evidence that the lack of improvement to the school questionnaire was due to miscommunication within the responding school. The wording of item 7a\u2014\u201cK\u201312 enrollment\u201d may be problematic for respondents. However, this alone was not entirely the cause, since several questionnaires were internally inconsistent; item 3e\u2014\u201cIs the grade range on the cover correct?\u201d\u2014was marked \u201cyes\u201d and then item 6\u2014\u201cgrades offered\u201d\u2014was marked inconsistently. Additional research needs to be undertaken to determine ways to get this particular class of respondents to report the correct grade range.\nFindings: Data Quality of School, Principal, School Library Media Center, and Teacher Questionnaires\nStaff reviewed most of the completed questionnaires to assess the quality of the data. They first looked at how completely the questionnaire was filled out. Next, they tallied item nonresponse and, in most cases, compared it to the item nonresponse from the 1999\u20132000 SASS. For the school and teacher questionnaires, they also examined consistency between some of the items on the questionnaire. These assessments are presented below for the school, principal, school library media center, and teacher questionnaires.\nSchool Questionnaires\nThe majority of the school questionnaires (74 percent) were returned with all of the correct items completed (table C-2). Approximately 7 percent of the questionnaires were returned with most of the items complete, but with some items left blank because skip patterns were not followed correctly. More commonly, there were situations where most of the items were completed but some items were intentionally left blank (14 percent). There also existed situations where most of the items were complete, while partial sections were left blank (4 percent). Approximately 1 percent of the questionnaires were returned partially completed.\n\n\fAppendix C. Report on 2001\u201302 SASS Pretest and Recommendations for 2003\u201304 SASS C-9\n\nTable C-2.

Comparing the item nonresponse rates with the 1999\u20132000 SASS nonresponse indicates an increase in the response rate for most of these items (table C-3). For several items a comparison was not possible because the response rates for these SASS 1999\u20132000 items were reduced as a result of the imputation process.1 These item response rates are denoted with a superscript 1. When compared to the 1999\u20132000 SASS response rates, three of the items (graduation, enrollment, and race of students) had a lower response rate in the Pretest.\n\n1 In computing final item response rates, an item is considered \u201canswered\u201d if the imputation flag = 0, meaning no changes were made to the item. For some items, respondents had provided an answer, but it was adjusted and given an imputation flag. For example, on the school file, enrollment is broken out into categories of race. Many or all of these categories may have had an original answer. However, if the sum of these categories did not exactly match total enrollment, then many or all of the race categories may have been ratio-adjusted so that the sum would match the total. Each of the changed values would receive an imputation flag. No imputation was done to field test data.\n\n\fC-10 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable C-3.

The higher teacher response suggested that the Pretest methods may be more effective at reaching teachers. The teacher half-sample that received their questionnaires first by mail, followed by field follow-up, had the highest response. However, the length of the data collection time-period was significantly longer, which may account for the higher rate when compared to the fall Pretest teacher cases.\n\nThe lower school level responses did cause concern, but may also be explained. In the Pretest, 17 of the 360 schools (nearly 5 percent) refused entirely, but indicated that they might have cooperated in a fullscale survey rather than a test. Seven of these schools were in one school district.\n\nField staff members anticipated that response at least would be maintained and probably improved in the future when SASS is a full production survey and not a pretest. The involvement of senior field representatives was not originally part of the SASS Pretest. Senior field representatives are local firstlevel supervisors who assist the field representatives with difficult cases and provide additional training if needed. All three Regional Offices used senior field representatives on refusal conversion during December and January to raise response rates. Involving senior field representatives from the beginning would enable supervisors to target refusals early and to assist field representatives when needed.\n\nThe general feeling in Field Division was that the cooperation improved because of the personal visit with the principal. Field representatives were able to meet directly with school staff and solicit cooperation with the support of the principal. At that point they knew whether cases would need some extra followup. With the traditional mail/telephone/field, field representatives never received the support of the principal or knew that cooperation would be difficult to gain. This cooperative relationship enabled the field representatives to have better access to the schools, which resulted in smoother dissemination of forms to the teachers, librarians, and other school personnel.\n\nThe NCES identification badges were helpful in some cases and should continue for production.\n\nFindings: Costs\n\nIt was estimated that the cost of the 2003\u201304 SASS using the field-based methods would be somewhat higher than using the mail/telephone/field methods. The main differences in cost between the two methods were as follows:\n\n\fC-16 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\u2022 The field-based data collection method was likely to cost more than the methods used in previous administrations of SASS. While the field-based methods would eliminate the costs of postage and CATI and would shift the bulk of data collection from early 2004 to late 2003, the personal visits to all schools resulted in greater costs overall.\n\u2022 Under the field-based method of data collection, staff would likely spend less time on data processing. The initial visits to the schools would determine right away if schools were in-scope or out-of-scope and resolve any other school definition issues. During prior SASS data processing, staff had to do a significant amount of work to resolve data problems that occurred because these issues had been discovered later in the process. Also, there was some indication that there may be improvement in data quality, which could reduce the amount of time to resolve edits and imputations.\nNotes from the Supervisors\u2019 SASS Debriefing\nAfter the fieldwork was completed, Census Bureau headquarters staff held a meeting with the field supervisors to discuss every aspect of the field procedures in order to identify what changes needed to be made for the full-scale survey. The following sections document the discussions on staffing, controlling the work, cost, staff training, timing of data collection, and correspondence.\nStaffing\nSupervisors had a difficult time staffing for this test due to other program commitments.\nAsking for \u201cexperienced\u201d field representatives made staffing more difficult, since many of the other programs also were calling for \u201cexperienced\u201d field representatives.\nSenior field representative availability was also limited due to other program commitments.\nIn looking forward to 2003 the supervisors saw fewer problems. It was their opinion that this year was rather unique with regard to work in the field.\nHeadquarters needed to allow more flexibility to the program supervisors to run the survey. This should not be a problem in 2003 since it would be a regularly run survey.\nControlling Work\nThere was no way that the Regional Office was able to truly control or even know at any particular time what the status of the field representative work was.\nThe combination of mail back and pick up was good in one respect\u2014it gave flexibility to the Regional Office, the field representative, and the schools. However, this combination contributed to the difficulty in controlling the work being done by the field representatives.\nOne of the suggestions made for 2003 was using time frames (phases) for the return of the various forms.\nThe use of ROSCO in 2003 will enable headquarters to develop a more comprehensive control system that will enable the Regional Office to better control the forms and also be more user friendly.\n\n\fAppendix C. Report on 2001\u201302 SASS Pretest and Recommendations for 2003\u201304 SASS C-17\nCost\nSupervisors did not detect any areas where they thought the field representatives were working inefficiently.\nTraining\nField representatives did not understand sampling very well. (Since computer-assisted personal interviewing [CAPI] will be used in 2003 this will not be a problem.) However, the field representatives and supervisors will need to be able to explain sampling well enough when asked.\nSupervisors suggest that the 2003 supervisor training include the following:\n\u2022 ROSCO; \u2022 response rate expectations; \u2022 refusal letter use (these need to be developed); and \u2022 discussion of the paper intensity of this survey.\nSupervisors also did not realize how paper intense the survey is. The point has been reached in Field Division where the majority of supervisors have either not worked a paper survey, or it has been so long since they have that they are not accustomed to what must be done in a paper survey.\nThe field representative training needs to spend more time on clarification of the definition of \u201cteacher.\u201d\nSince this survey will involve a considerable amount of Regional Office control the supervisors recommended that the clerical staff be included in any future national training.\nTiming\nTiming was not good; however, the comment was also made that for 2001, \u201cNo time was a good time.\u201d\nFor school districts the \u201cstarts and stops\u201d made the flow of the survey more difficult.\nThey believe that in 2003 they could close out the collection process by the end of the year.\nDiscussion regarding 2003 close out produced a few different approaches:\n1. Schedule a firm close out with the possibility of an extension for particular schools and/or school districts where considerable delays have been encountered that were outside the control of the field representative or Regional Office;\n2. Close out the Teacher Listing Forms by the end of October (5 weeks), close out the school, principal, and school library media center questionnaires just before winter break. Since there will be more teacher forms, extend the teacher questionnaire close out until the end of January.\n3. Set specific goals (percentage) that need to be done by certain predetermined dates. Let the final close out go into the next year.\nAnother suggestion was that specific time lines by school be set based on the time that forms were delivered to the school. Everyone agreed that this certainly would be more equitable with regards to time; however, it would be very difficult to accomplish.\n\n\fC-18 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nRegional Office Correspondence\nIn order for Census Bureau headquarters staff to get a better idea of the problems encountered during interviewing, the supervisors agreed to send in all memos and other communication used to clarify procedures or instructions.\nComments from SASS Field Representative Debriefing Conference\nAfter the fieldwork was completed, Census Bureau headquarters staff also held a meeting with the field representatives to discuss all aspects of the field procedures from their perspective. The following sections document the points that were made.\nScheduling and Principal Visit\n\u2022 The preaddressed introductory letter to the principal should be sent to the field representatives so that it can be mailed at the most appropriate time. Many field representatives thought that the principal had received the letter but had forgotten about it because of the time differential between receipt of the letter and the field representative\u2019s visit.\n\u2022 Have a distinctive color of the introductory letter\u2019s envelope, so that way the field representative could ask about the \u201cred, white, and blue envelope.\u201d\n\u2022 Some field representatives thought that it would be more effective to have the principal\u2019s name on the introductory letter. The major problem with that is that there is no way to get a reliable list of principals\u2019 names before the letters are prepared. Field representatives were confident that they could get names, but then there is a problem with how to get it on to the letter other than writing it. Other field representatives did not see a big advantage to the letter being personally addressed.\n\u2022 There was a wide variety of persons who ended up as the \u201cbest contact.\u201d Many field representatives dealt with the principal directly, others with a vice principal, still others with an administrative assistant. Instructions need to emphasize the need for this flexibility.\n\u2022 There was much discussion regarding the timing of when this survey starts. The discussion centered around the first visit, especially as it related to contacting the principal. The bottom line was that there probably is no \u201cbest\u201d time or, for that matter, any \u201cgood\u201d time. These are people who are terribly busy the entire time they are at the school.\n\u2022 The field representatives pointed out that some of the time it was necessary to make personal contact with the person at the school district that has responsibility for surveys and getting their approval before getting permission from the principal.\n\u2022 There was a variety of ways that the field representatives dealt with the first visit. Most called after the letter was received but before making a personal visit. They normally attempted to talk to or make an appointment with the principal. There were varying degrees of success expressed.\n\u2022 Some schools are only reachable by a personal visit. The field representatives need to stress the importance of the school having a listing of teachers available when they arrive for their first meeting. Could an example of what is wanted be on the back of the initial letter?\n\n\fAppendix C. Report on 2001\u201302 SASS Pretest and Recommendations for 2003\u201304 SASS C-19\n\u2022 Other suggestions included having the letters sent from the Regional Office, having two different letters (one for elementary and one for secondary), and still others thought the discussion of the letters was over emphasized.\n\u2022 There was also considerable discussion regarding whether it was best to have someone at the school send the various forms back to the field representative or Regional Office versus making a return trip to pick them up. This also appears to be an area where there are several successful methods. Certainly when long distances are involved it would be better to mail the forms. This is another area where there is need to emphasize flexibility of methods of returning surveys.\n\u2022 For the most part the field representatives agreed that an envelope should be included with the teacher form. It should be sealable and marked \u201cconfidential.\u201d The general agreement was that this method would improve the teacher response rate. This envelope also needs to be marked SASS so that when it gets returned to the Regional Office it gets routed to the correct area.\n\u2022 Some of the field representatives would like to have the ability to have the envelopes mailed to their own homes. Although this would allow the field representatives to monitor what has been sent in, it would delay the check-in of the forms in the Regional Office.\n\u2022 As far as completing the Teacher Listing Form, 13 of the 16 field representatives had no problem.\n\u2022 Some field representatives thought the principal or secretary at some schools did not do a good job in seeing that the librarian received the school library media center questionnaire.\n\u2022 The field representatives need to ensure that the librarian is at the initial meeting.\n\u2022 The field representatives said that most schools had the forms completed by the agreed-on date of pickup.\n\u2022 The introductory letter should include more graphics and fewer words.\n\u2022 Design different kinds of introductory letters for different types of schools in the sample, for example, elementary, high school, large, small, urban, rural, etc.\nMaterials Other Than Forms\n\u2022 The Regional Offices (field representatives and office) need the form that requests results of the survey to give to respondents.\n\u2022 A number of schools mentioned to the field representative that they liked the Census Map that was given to each school.\n\u2022 Leave some sort of incentive plan with the school, such as: o lesson plan; o map; o brochure; o pen (for all who complete forms); or o thank you certificate.\n\n\fC-20 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\u2022 Several field representatives said that it would be nice if something could be given to the schools for participating. Suggestions included things like a Thank You letter, a pen, a certificate, etc.\n\u2022 Most of the field representatives thought a fact sheet high lighting the results of previous surveys would be very beneficial. The NCES representative pointed out that such a brochure would be part of the survey when it goes to the field.\n\u2022 The SASS overview form was well received. \u2022 A flash card or instruction card showing in outline form who needed to do what would have been\nhelpful.\n\u2022 The use of the large zip lock bag with all materials for a school in it was universally well received.\nNCES Badge (I.D.)\n\u2022 Most all of the field representatives said the NCES identification card was helpful, although four field representatives did not use it at all and reported they had no real problems.\n\u2022 Four field representatives thought it would be helpful if the NCES identification card had the field representative\u2019s picture on it. The rest did not think it would make a significant difference. (One field representative\u2019s personal note: \u201cI believe we need to be careful in how we present the NCES card. We want to make sure we do not lead the field representatives to start using that card only. Field representatives need to keep in mind that although NCES pays for the survey, they are Census employees, not NCES employees.\u201d)\nResponse Rates\n\u2022 Several field representatives reported that the fact that it was a test affected the response rate negatively. When polled, it affected a total of 17 schools, 7 of which were in the same school district.\n\u2022 Although there was general agreement that there is no real good time to conduct this survey, several field representatives thought later in the year would be better. No consensus was reached on this, however.\n\u2022 Everyone thought that a refusal letter would be helpful. Where it would originate and who would sign it were points of disagreement, however.\nInterviewer Time per School\n\u2022 Fourteen of the field representatives reported that it took less than 10 hours to complete all the work from one school. This includes organizing, calling a school in advance, travel, and interviewing.\n\u2022 Three reported that it took between 11 and 20 hours to complete a school.\n\u2022 Twelve of the 17 field representatives said that due to the uniqueness of this survey, they were not able to combine much of the work with other survey work.\n\n\fAppendix C. Report on 2001\u201302 SASS Pretest and Recommendations for 2003\u201304 SASS C-21\nTraining\n\u2022 Generally, the field representatives thought the training was satisfactory. However, there were areas, outlined below, where they thought it could be improved.\n\u2022 Although the training went over all of the forms they thought more time could have been allotted to tying it all together.\n\u2022 One practice exercise would have been helpful. \u2022 Most did not think a classroom session was needed, but several thought a teleconference would\nhave helped.\n\u2022 The time allowed for the self-study was about 2 hours too short; they wanted 8 hours rather than 6 hours.\n\u2022 Several got the impression from the self-study that they would need to track down each teacher, which is not the case.\n\u2022 Many thought there was not enough emphasis on the timing of the different operations. For example, how soon after the initial visit should they start following up on the various forms?\n\u2022 Training on sampling needs to be included so that the field representatives can explain why their schools/teachers are selected.\n\u2022 The training needs to emphasize the flexibility of methods of returning surveys needed for the success of this survey. This survey is considerably different than many of the current surveys.\n\u2022 Need to explain what is meant by edit. On some surveys the field representative conducts the interview, does a complete review (edit), and then calls back for missing information. Is this what is meant or something else?\n\u2022 Grade range in some instances was a problem. The solution might be either more explanation in training materials or a clear instruction to the field representatives to call their supervisor if problems are encountered.\n\u2022 The field representative instructions need to be expanded to include more information on how to handle part-time teachers and how to handle specialty areas such as audiologist, special education teachers, etc.\n\u2022 Instructions need to be clear that the field representative will be asking the race/ethnicity item for each teacher listed on the Teacher Listing Form. This is very much different that any other surveys where race and ethnicity are asked of the household respondent.\n\u2022 Training should include recent press releases. A few months prior to the SASS, headquarters staff should provide the Regional Offices with SASS press releases to hand to reluctant schools. Further, headquarters staff should train to pull or have the Regional Office provide internet information on how SASS helps the specific school district.\n\n\fC-22 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nForms\n\u2022 Forms need to be redesigned to be more field representative friendly. \u2022 Add the field representative name and expected pick up date to all the forms.\n\u2022 On the teacher form add a space for teacher name and teacher line number.\n\u2022 Put the information from the Commissioner of NCES on the inside front cover of every questionnaire.\n\u2022 Put a thank you statement, Census Bureau clerical processing staff address, and e-mail information on the inside back cover of every questionnaire.\n\u2022 Since it is the field representative\u2019s option to pick up the forms or have the respondents mail them, each form should have a check box for the field representative to use to indicate to the respondent what they are to do with that particular form. This field representative check box could be put on the inside back cover of the form(s) or in some other suitable location.\n\u2022 It would be helpful if the 800 number was printed so it\u2019s more easily noticed. Also regarding the 800 number, it might be helpful to print it on the same page that the web page information is printed.\n\n\fD-1\nAppendix D. Report of Findings From a Test on the SASS Teacher Listing Instrument\nThe material in this appendix is organized as follows:\nOverview ............................................................................................................................................D-2 Methods ..............................................................................................................................................D-2 Key Findings ......................................................................................................................................D-3 Limitations..........................................................................................................................................

The screening process sometimes yielded inaccurate or inconsistent information about the school\u2019s status. For example, a private school might report that it is public because it receives tuition money from a public school district on behalf of some students. The methodology itself added significant time to the data collection. Although the SASS operation typically began in October, the last teacher questionnaires were mailed out in January, leaving little time during the school year for nonresponse follow-up. In an attempt to improve the screening process and reduce the time required to conduct the survey, a SASS Teacher Listing instrument was developed that could screen schools and select a sample of teachers from eligible schools. The instrument was designed to screen schools by phone for inscope/out-of-scope status. Next, the field representative was instructed to set up an appointment with the school to collect the Teacher Listing Form. The field representative could then key the Teacher Listing Form into the instrument and a sample of teachers would be selected. This allowed the field representative to sample teachers and hand questionnaires to the selected teachers all in one visit to the school. In order to verify that the SASS Teacher Listing instrument and procedures would work in a field setting, a two-part test was conducted prior to the full-scale SASS administration. The test had several objectives, including the following:\n\u2022 examining issues and problems with the SASS Teacher Listing instrument, including: o determining whether respondents understand the intent and wording of the scope and grade range questions, o determining whether the answer categories for each question are sufficient and verifying that paths exist to handle all of the possible scenarios, o identifying where help screens may be needed, and o testing the questions and procedures for obtaining lists of teachers;\n\u2022 identifying how often the questions can be completed by phone; \u2022 identifying who at the school is able to answer the questions; and \u2022 observing field representatives administering the instrument to identify any deficiencies in their\nprocedures or training.\nMethods\nOne hundred and eighty schools in states likely to be problematic1 (Oklahoma, Montana, South Dakota) and the District of Columbia (DC) metropolitan area (Virginia, Pennsylvania, DC, Maryland) were selected to participate in this test. In order to ensure a variety of scenarios were encountered (e.g., merged or split schools), some of the schools selected had their sample frame information altered (grade ranges or enrollment counts were modified to create discrepancies). Following normal SASS procedures, an advance letter was sent to schools prior to interviewing. Five field representatives and headquarters staff were trained to administer the SASS Teacher Listing instrument and conduct a debriefing with respondents about their experience. A standardized debriefing form was used to structure the feedback. Twenty cases in the DC area were selected for in-person visits.\n1 In past SASS administrations, it was more common to find a discrepancy between grade ranges on the Common Core of Data and actual grade ranges identified in SASS for schools in Oklahoma, Montana, and South Dakota than it was for schools in other states. (See sections on school collapsing in chapter 2 and \u201cAppendix K. Details of SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures.\u201d)\n\n\fAppendix D. Report of Findings From a Test on the SASS Teacher Listing Instrument D-3\nInterviewers were able to conduct 15 of the 20 planned local interviews in the DC area. One school refused to participate in the test. The other four schools could not be contacted during the study time period. Of the 180 schools selected for telephone interviewing, 32 were contacted by researchers and completed the interview. A debriefing of research staff was held daily at the Census Bureau during which field representatives shared their observations about all aspects of the test with analysts and made suggestions about how the test could be improved. The test was conducted in early January 2003.\nKey Findings\n\u2022 The instrument was not able to handle breaks in grade range. For example, a high school that had a kindergarten would have needed to be reported as 9\u201312. It was recommended that grade range handling be improved to allow this flexibility.\n\u2022 The instrument moved slowly during the keying operation. It was recommended that improvements be made to the performance of the Teacher Listing Form portion of the instrument.\n\u2022 The instrument was successful at identifying in-scope and out-of-scope schools and collecting teacher lists from schools. It was recommended that a modified instrument be used in the fullscale SASS.\n\u2022 The test indicated that Regional Offices should conduct a prefield clean-up operation of the listing file before field interviewing begins.\n\u2022 The test identified many procedural recommendations, which are discussed below. o Training for field representatives should be modified to improve their understanding of how to use the instrument and contact schools. o Field representatives should review every Teacher Listing Form with a knowledgeable person at the school before keying the form into the instrument. During the pretest, field representatives did not check the quality of the Teacher Listing Form before leaving the school, which led to the inclusion of nonteachers in the sample. o Greater flexibility should be built into the instrument so that field representatives can change demographic fields such as name and address during the interview.\nLimitations\nThis test was designed to focus on the SASS Teacher Listing instrument. The methodology of this test differed significantly from the full-scale SASS administration. For this reason, the findings of this test cannot be extrapolated to the full-scale SASS.\nThe test differed from a full-scale SASS in the following ways:\n\u2022 The advance letter indicated that this was a pretest. \u2022 Field representatives received an abbreviated, in-person training. \u2022 Participants were informed up front about the debriefing. \u2022 Only schools selected for an in-person visit were asked to complete a Teacher Listing Form.\nThe findings of this test should not be used to predict response rates or other outcomes for a full-scale SASS.\n\n\fD-4 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nRecommendations\n\nRecommendations from this study fell into three distinct categories: changes to training, changes to procedures, and changes to the instrument. The observations and recommended changes are detailed below.\n\nField Representative Training Recommendations\n\nObservations During the middle of the day, interviewers received a lot of busy signals or were unable to reach the principal.\n\nRecommendations Train field representatives that 7:45\u20139:00 a.m. or after 2:45 p.m. appear to be the best times to reach principals.\n\nWhen the field representatives were unable to get all information about the teachers, they were unsure which items on the listing were the most important to try to get from the school.\n\nStress at field representative training the relative importance of stratification items (experience, race, classes, etc.)\u2014it is more important to get names than to focus on these items.\n\nNot all lists originally received at the school were complete.\n\nAdvise field representative to check the list before they leave the school to ensure that it is complete.\n\nField representatives felt that having background information about the school would help them gain cooperation before they visited/called the school.\n\nMany school districts have websites with links to individual schools\u2014this is a good place to find current information for school contacts. Address in field representative training.\n\nField representatives had difficulty reaching some principals/knowledgeable respondents by phone.\n\nThe initial contact may need to be in person if there is difficulty reaching the principal or knowledgeable respondent. Address in field representative training.\n\nField representatives unsure what to bring to the school.\n\nInform field representatives to bring all necessary school forms, information sheets, Teacher Listing Form, laptop, and envelopes addressed to the field representative or Regional Office.\n\nField representatives did not feel confident in the instrument/procedures for handling outlier scenarios (for instance, merged or split schools).\n\nHave field representatives conduct two or three practice cases with various scenarios so that they get an opportunity to see most of the screens in the laptop. Address in field representative training.\n\nInterviewers expected standard hot keys/shortcuts to work in the SASS Teacher Listing instrument.\n\nInclude a cheat sheet of working hot keys in training.\n\n\fAppendix D. Report of Findings From a Test on the SASS Teacher Listing Instrument D-5\n\nProcedural Changes\nObservations Not all scenarios that occur in the field can be handled through the instrument.\nRespondents wanted a copy of the Teacher Listing Form before the field representative came to pick up their list.\nPrincipals were not always available for their scheduled appointment.\nSome problem schools (related to name, address, etc.\u2014e.g., school has \u201cprogram\u201d in its name) were not identified until the call. Prescreening of these schools could speed fieldwork.\nSchools wanted a way to contact field representatives after the visit.\nField representatives unsure how to handle the case where there are two principals with one campus (elementary and middle), with the same phone line and both listed as one school in sample.\nField representative unsure how to handle the case where the school changed location and name.\nNeed for a packet ready for Regional Office to fax to schools that ask for one (including letter, Teacher Listing Form, general information).\n\nRecommendations Regional Office will need a direct connection to Census Bureau sampling staff to settle issues with outlier cases (e.g., school has moved and changed names, school name and phone number do not match but each leads to a different school, etc.).\nProvide faxable copies of Teacher Listing Form to Regional Office. Field representative will contact Regional Office and Regional Office will fax to school. Provide copy of Teacher Listing Form with the advance letter.\nMake an appointment ahead of time with the principal. Call the day of the appointment to reconfirm. (Principals\u2019 days change minute by minute based on what happens in the school.)\nIdentify potential problem in field-based edit and have Regional Offices conduct a clean up operation before sample is given to field representatives.\nProvide business cards for field representatives.\nField representatives call the Regional Office. Census Bureau sampling staff will need to be contacted.\nField representatives call the Regional Office. Census Bureau sampling staff will need to be contacted.\nPrepare packet for the Regional Office.\n\n\fD-6 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nInstrument Changes\nObservations Need to be able to correct school name if field representative discovers that it is incorrect any time during the interview other than the beginning.\nInstrument was too slow, especially with larger schools. This performance issue appears to be tied to duplicate checking functionality.\nNeed a way to pass the contact name from the case management system into the instrument.\nMailing address is automatically changed when physical address changes. Flow of address screens is awkward. P.O. box appears as physical address.\nField representatives need a way to verify entry at the end of keying.\nField representative unsure of procedures if teacher\u2019s name is entered incorrectly in instrument and effects this has on follow-up and Teacher Follow-Up survey.\nField representatives unsure of best way to categorize nontraditional classes (study habits, computer class, learning center, etc.)\nNames are not collected/maintained early enough in the instrument. Field representatives forgot the names of some respondents.\nScreens did not always flow in a logical order, especially when there were address or name changes.\nInterviewers expected standard hot keys/shortcuts to work.\n\nRecommendations Create tab that will allow the field representative to update the school address, name, and contact names.\nHave the instrument check for duplicate names at the end of the listing rather than during the listing.\nPass principal and other contact name information from case management into the instrument.\nProvide option for field representative to change or keep both addresses from the same screen. Reword screens to make it easier to follow. P.O. box should not appear as physical address.\nTotal count by columns (i.e., number of new teachers, full time or part time) screen will be added to the instrument.\nName correction will be made by Census Bureau clerical processing staff.\nHelp screen should be created.\n1. Ask for respondent/principal name earlier in the instrument.\n2. Display name on the instrument. 3. Adjust instrument to record multiple\ncontacts/respondents.\nNeed to review wording and flow for name and address change, split, and merge. The screens will be reworded/moved based on this review.\nEnable standard hot keys to work in as many places as possible.\n\n\fE-1\nAppendix E.

UserWorks conducted a series of cognitive interviews (think-aloud sessions) to identify problems with comprehending the meaning and intent of the questions, the procedures to complete the survey, and sensitivity of questionnaire items.\nUtilizing UserWorks\u2019 participant database and personal contacts of both UserWorks and Census Bureau analysts, 30 participants of varying characteristics were recruited. All taught in the greater Washington, DC-Baltimore metropolitan area. The questionnaire was broken up into two parts, or panels, which covered different topics and questionnaire items so that interviewees\u2019 responses could be thoroughly investigated and interviews could be kept within a reasonable time limit. Sixteen participants completed Panel A and 14 participants Panel B, for a total of 30 participants. Interviews were conducted at the participants\u2019 schools, various public places in the DC metropolitan area, and the UserWorks lab in Silver Spring, Maryland, between December 2002 and January 2003.\nParticipants were asked to think aloud but otherwise to complete the questionnaire as they normally would, in whatever order and with whatever degree of attention, thoroughness, and completeness would be natural for them, first using themselves and their experiences as a source of information. Concurrently, while working on each item and retroactively, after completing an item or related set of items, participants were probed regarding their responses to the questionnaire.\nThis report lists each question and its corresponding bulleted instructions or examples (\u201capple points\u201d) and answer choices. Problems indicative of confusion with or misunderstanding with questionnaire items are presented along with less problematic \u201cobservations\u201d of participant comments or behavior. In cases where questions in version 1 of Panel A were revised or added in version 2, a note to that effect with the altered answer choice or question is provided in context.\nIn just a few cases, participants found the wording of some questions confusing. When they did have difficulty answering a question, however, it was not because they failed to understand it but because the question did not neatly apply to their circumstance. For instance, elementary school teachers who taught reading as part of language arts, or who covered language arts issues in social studies, could not easily classify\u2014and thus readily apportion\u2014the time they spent on reading or language arts.\nA more common problem was that participants, though certain of the meaning of an item, would differ from each other in their interpretations of that item. One teacher would recognize two or more alternative interpretations of the same item, or the teachers\u2019 interpretations would differ from what staff suspected was the intent of the question. An example of such an item would be the statement \u201cI worry about the security of my job because of the performance of my students on state and local tests\u201d; someone may disagree with it while still worrying about job security, or agree with it even if the students were performing well. Even when there was little debate over how a question should be interpreted, participants sometimes answered \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cno,\u201d \u201cagree,\u201d or \u201cdisagree\u201d to an item for reasons other than those implied in the question. For instance, participants might agree that they use district standards because they are forced to, not because they wish to, or might deny that they receive state test scores if their students never take state tests to begin with.\nAnother common, overall problem was that teachers did not feel they had sufficient knowledge of current school practices and student status or memory of past events\u2014such as their past college coursework\u2014to\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-3\nprovide accurate answers. While they understood the questions, they would have rated very low their confidence in their answers.\nA fourth common problem was that participants read instructions only for the information they felt they needed to complete each item. This tendency led them to overlook mandatory apple points, options lower in a list that might have been more relevant than those higher in a list, and qualifying information appearing at the end of a sentence. Many of our recommendations therefore involve rearranging or highlighting information in an existing sentence or dividing a sentence into two or more parts.\nThe greatest challenge for participants was calculating hours spent on activities. In part this was because they tended to classify their work time and professional development by number of classes taught and number of days per week worked, including half-day workshops, rather than by hours. However, the difficulty also stemmed from divergent interpretations of certain key phrases used repeatedly throughout the questionnaire such as \u201cat this school,\u201d \u201cmost recent full week,\u201d \u201cschool-related activities,\u201d \u201cprofessional development activities,\u201d \u201cmain teaching assignment field,\u201d and \u201cmajor field of study.\u201d Several of our recommendations thus encourage more specific wording or explanation of these recurrent terms.\nWhile participants had concerns with most questions on some level, the remainder of this executive summary highlights the most problematic areas and provides selected suggestions to resolve these \u201cshowstoppers.\u201d\n\n\fE-4 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nPanel A (Versions 1 and 2)\n\nItem # and question\n\nRecommendation\n\n4a Which statement best Reword answer options so that, as in option 4 (team teaching), information\n\ndescribes the way\n\ndescribing students or mapping teachers to students is closer to the beginning of\n\nYOUR classes (or\n\nthe answer choice than is course or subject information:\n\nsections) at this school \u2022 You instruct several classes of different students most or all of the day in\n\nare organized?\n\none or more subjects (such as algebra, geometry, music, history,\n\ngovernment, and/or biology).

In an effort to develop questionnaire items that will accurately capture teachers\u2019 responses to these issues, the Demographic Surveys Division of the U.S. Census Bureau hired UserWorks Inc. to evaluate the SASS questionnaire by conducting a series of cognitive interviews (think-aloud sessions) to identify problems that can be corrected prior to the survey\u2019s official release.\nThe objectives of these interviews were\n\u2022 to identify items which teachers might fail to comprehend, misinterpret, or interpret in different ways;\n\u2022 to identify difficulties teachers might have following procedures (for instance, recognizing an instruction applied to more than one item, flipping pages to obtain information from tables, or skipping questions that do not apply to them); and\n\u2022 to determine the sensitivity of the questionnaire items to unanticipated contextual factors such as the type of school or the teacher\u2019s background and dialect.\nThe interviews were also useful for suggesting where researchers are likely to draw unjustified inference from responses to the questionnaire or where variation in respondents\u2019 interpretation of items may be great enough to suggest the items\u2019 unreliability as measures of the phenomena they were designed to investigate.\nMethods\nMaterials\nTo permit interviewees\u2019 responses to be thoroughly investigated while keeping sessions to a reasonable duration, the questionnaire was divided into two parts, or panels, and half of the interviewees were assigned to each panel.\nCoverage of topics was as follows:\nPanel A\u2014 \u2022 General Information (background and work status); \u2022 Class Organization (type of class and courses taught); \u2022 Educational Background (academic degrees); \u2022 Certification and Training (teaching certificates); and \u2022 Working Conditions (how time is divided among a number of different school-related activities).\nPanel B\u2014 \u2022 General Information (background and work status); \u2022 Professional Development (self-initiated and departmental learning activities as well as continuing education courses and workshops); \u2022 Resources and Assessment of Students (including class questions pertaining to class assignment, student grouping, and teaching special populations); \u2022 Working Conditions (how time is divided among a number of different school-related activities);\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-13\n\u2022 Attitudes and Opinions (on other working conditions such as class size and cooperation in the department); and\n\u2022 School Climate (additional opinions on quality of life at work issues and identification of problems in the school).\nThe first part, General Information (consisting of only two introductory questions), was the same on both panels; the purpose of this pared-down section helped participants adjust to the think-aloud procedure. A section of items labeled \u201cWorking Conditions,\u201d regarding the number of hours teachers spend on various activities, appeared on both panels but with slight differences in wording on each of the two panels. There was no other overlap among actual items on the two panels, though there was significant overlap in coverage of topics. For instance, while panel A asked about education institutions and type of certification, panel B asked about actual coursework both in advanced degree programs and in subsequent professional development for continuing certification. Thus both panels asked questions about education and training. Both also asked about type and composition of classes (in the panel A section \u201cClass Organization\u201d and in the panel B section \u201cResources and Assessment of Students\u201d). It was not within the scope of the project to investigate how items in panel A that discuss a certain topic might influence respondents\u2019 perceptions of and responses to other items in panel B that discuss the same topic. It was also not in the scope to recommend how to organize or integrate questions on related topics appearing in the two different panels in the final version of the questionnaire.\nSix attachments contain additional information. After a meeting in which UserWorks and Census Bureau analysts met to discuss the first 15 of 30 interviews, panel A was slightly altered in an attempt to increase comprehension and participants\u2019 likelihood of following the correct sequence of items (attachment E-1). Owing to the lag time involved in formatting and printing the revised version of panel A, only two participants were given the revised version. Of those, a portion was probed for their opinion of the wording in the new panel, but none were asked to compare the new panel to the old panel.\nA consent and nondisclosure form (attachment E-2) was prepared to obtain participant signatures assenting to audiotaping for research purposes. In signing this form, participants also agreed not to discuss with colleagues problems with the current questionnaire until the Census Bureau had the opportunity to make revisions based on participant input.\nAn orientation to the project (attachment E-3) was prepared for participants, as well as the probing questions to be used for each of the panels (attachments E-4 and E-5). The probes were designed to elicit user expectations and points of confusion (if any). Some probes were asked of all test users; others were used only if interviewers considered them relevant to participants\u2019 responses or situations.\nA screening questionnaire (attachment E-6) was also created for the participant recruiter to identify characteristics of the participant.\nParticipants\nUtilizing UserWorks\u2019 participant database and personal contacts of both UserWorks and Census Bureau analysts, 30 participants of varying characteristics were recruited. An e-mail was sent to prospective participants informing them of the study. To obtain a mix of participant characteristics representative of the teaching population for which the survey was designed, those interested were then asked the screening questions over the telephone.\nOf those selected, most were public school teachers, though seven who taught at private schools were recruited in anticipation of the development of an additional questionnaire directed towards that population. Participants varied by gender (33 percent were males, higher than the 26 percent typical of the\n\n\fE-14 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nteaching population according to the National Education Association), as well as by grades (prekindergarten through 12) and subjects taught, school location, and years of teaching and educational attainment. Some were involved with student extracurricular activities, others had special education or students with Individual Education Plans (IEPs), one taught students released from their regular classes, and a couple were involved in team teaching.\nAll participants taught in the greater Washington, DC-Baltimore metropolitan area. Participants were not asked to identify the school system in which their school was located; however, systems represented include a Department of Defense Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary School at Quantico, the District of Columbia, Virginia\u2019s Fairfax and Arlington Counties (including the Falls Church City school system), and Maryland\u2019s Montgomery, Prince George\u2019s, Howard, and Carroll Counties.\nSixteen participants completed panel A and 14 participants panel B, for a total of 30 participants.\nParticipants were interviewed by one of two employees of UserWorks. Interviews were scheduled between December 13, 2002, and January 10, 2003. Several factors were responsible for this length, such as intervening holiday vacations and snow days, the need for interviewers to travel to separate schools each day, and the fact that most teachers preferred to be interviewed after school or during their planning periods. The interviewers met frequently to discuss the progress of the interviews and their experiences with participants and items on the questionnaire, initially after practicing with each panel using two additional members of UserWorks staff as mock participants, and subsequently between the actual interviews.\nParticipants were given the option of holding the interviews either in their schools (the preferred option), in a public place convenient for them (such as a library, bookstore, or caf\u00e9), or in the UserWorks research lab. Most chose to be interviewed at their schools.\nInterviews were audiotaped with participants\u2019 permission. Each participant was given $30.00 as a thank you for offering his or her time. Most sessions lasted about 1.5 hours, though several sessions ran longer if participants were motivated, not worried about the time, and continued to volunteer information. None lasted more than 2 hours.\nProcedure\nInterviews were conducted at participants\u2019 schools, various public places in the DC metropolitan area, and the UserWorks lab in Silver Spring, Maryland, between December 2002 and January 2003. Interviewers took handwritten notes during the interviews to supplement the recordings. In several cases, portions of the recordings were of inferior quality owing to background noise from external sources. After the first few interviews, the interviewers asked for assurances from participants that a quiet place in which to conduct the interview would be available.\nUpon arriving at the interview site, the test administrator signed in at the main office if the site was a school, met the participant, set up the tape recorder and other materials, read the introduction to testing (attachment E-3), obtained the participant\u2019s signed consent form to participate, and answered any questions that the participant may have had. If necessary for understanding, the interviewer provided an example of the think-aloud process. Participants were asked to think aloud but otherwise to complete the questionnaire as they would if they had been asked by an administrator to complete it on their own, in whatever order and with whatever degree of attention, thoroughness, and completeness would be natural for them, first using themselves and their experiences as a source of information. Participants were also asked to consider hypothetical teachers or teaching situations provided in a list of scenarios. In some cases participants were asked to read the scenarios aloud before applying the information to the\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-15\nquestionnaire item at hand. For simpler scenarios, when short of time, or when the interviewer was trying to better understand a specific point raised by a participant, the scenario was simply described by the interviewer.\nConcurrently, while working on each item, and retroactively, after completing an item or related set of items, participants were probed regarding their responses to the questionnaire. General probes were used to encourage participants to think aloud and to understand participants\u2019 interpretations and determine how much of an item participants read or noticed on their own: \u201cHow did you arrive at your answer?\u201d \u201cTell me about that.\u201d \u201cWhat is this asking, in your own words?\u201d More specific preplanned probes (in attachments E-4 and E-5) were used if participants had little to say about an item or were unable to articulate their concerns, as well as to elicit opinions of wording and situations which UserWorks or Census Bureau staff anticipated might prove problematic.\nIn the course of participating in the interview, most of the participants who initially appeared to be reading and completing the questionnaire rather casually and spontaneously began to attend more carefully to the language of the questionnaire and took more time before offering responses. Since all participants completed the items in the order they appeared in the questionnaire except when they followed or failed to follow directions to skip questions, UserWorks staff must assume that responses to later sections of the questionnaire are heavily influenced by interviewers\u2019 incessant requests that participants reflect on, explain, and elaborate on their responses.\nAfter answering the final questions and offering their final overall opinion of the questionnaire, participants were paid and thanked for their time.\nCognitive Test Results\nThis section provides the results of cognitive testing of SASS panels A (versions 1 and 2) and B. The question is provided verbatim, along with bulleted instructions or examples (\u201capple points\u201d) and answer choices. In cases where questions in version 1 of panel A were revised or added, a note to that effect with the changed answer choice or question is provided in context of the original question or answer choice.\nFollowing the text of each item, problems indicative of confusion with or misunderstanding of that item are presented along with less problematic \u201cobservations\u201d of interesting or insightful participant comments or behavior. Where appropriate, counts of participants and their comments are provided to give perspective. For those items on the questionnaire that require no change, a remark to that effect is recorded.\nFor most of the problems that have been identified, however, recommendations are offered. The proposed recommendations appear BEFORE the elaboration of the respective problem to facilitate use of this document as a guide to potential revisions. The correspondence between a recommendation and its associated problem is further highlighted through the assigning to each problem a letter that is unique within the set of problems described for each item of the questionnaire. The same letter is used to identify the recommendation corresponding to that problem.\nProblems with and recommendations that apply to SETS of lettered subitems or sections of the questionnaire AS A WHOLE rather than to individual items are offered at the end of each set or section under a heading \u201cItem X Overall\u201d or \u201cSection X Overall.\u201d\n\n\fE-16 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nI. General Information: Panels A and B, Items 1\u20132\n\nThis section asks for general information about participants\u2019 teaching and other experiences. (NOTE: It combines results from Panels A and B.)\n\nQuestion 1:\n\nIn what year did you begin teaching in THIS school?\n\n\u2022 If your assignment at this school has included a break in service of one year or more, please report the year that you returned to this school from your most recent break in service.\n\u2022 Do not include time spent as a student teacher.\n\n__|__|__|__| Year\n\nObservations:\n\nParticipants who had difficulty or erred in answering the question included\n\n\u2022 those who have a long teaching career with breaks in service but with salary and retirement credits; and\n\u2022 those who had a long teaching career and taught at several schools.\n\nSome participants wondered if \u201cTHIS school\u201d referred to the school system, the school they were assigned, or where they happened to be physically located if completing the survey at one of several schools where they worked.\n\nRecommendation a:\n\nAs discussed at the 12/31/2002 debriefing conference, replace \u201cTHIS school\u201d with the name of the teacher\u2019s school, or ask:\n\n\u201cIn what year did you begin teaching at the school where you currently teach all or most of your classes (receive your paycheck, etc.)?\u201d\n\nProblem a:\n\nActual respondents may not be completing the survey at their school. Participants who currently taught only in one school but had taught in several schools in the past and were conducting the interview at UserWorks or in a public area did not know which school was \u201cthis school.\u201d They suggested the question ask about their \u201ccurrent school.\u201d\n\nRecommendation b:\n\nUse an icon other than an apple to denote warnings that, if ignored, will produce erroneous data. Save apple icons for examples, helpful hints (e.g., \u201cgifts to the teacher\u201d).\n\nTo force respondents with breaks in service to address the issue, separate the question into two parts. Ask first for year they began teaching at the school, then about returning from breaks. If both parts are completed, treat the upper portion as just a worksheet and take the lower number on the page as the data point:\n\nIn what year did you first begin teaching at this school?\n\n__|__|__|__| Year\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-17\n\nProblem b: Recommendation c: Problem c: Observations c:\nRecommendation d:\nProblem d:\n\nIf your experience at this school included any breaks in service of one year or more [use boldface type], please indicate in what year you returned from your most recent break in service:\n__|__|__|__| Year\n[Do not use the phrase \u201ctenure at this school\u201d in place of \u201cexperience at this school\u201d since teachers interpret it as \u201cjob security.\u201d]\nApple points were not always read or read thoroughly by people to whom they applied. Some respondents either did not read supplemental instructions regarding breaks in service or if they did, they often provided start dates following breaks of service of less than a year.\nTo make experienced teachers feel better and obtain more accurate data from teachers with breaks in service, ask first for their years of service over their entire teaching career. If data are actually being collected on when the teacher began teaching at this school, if it is not an introductory practice question, ask that question next.\nTeachers with a long teaching career feel invalidated if they had only spent a short time at their current school. Several teachers expressed surprise that they were not asked more demographic background questions. Experienced teachers thought the Census Bureau might not give their responses much credence if it appeared they had only been teaching at a school a year. They thought their extensive amount of experience should count for something.\nThis problem is mentioned not solely out of concern for the teachers\u2019 opinions towards the questionnaire. Concerns about how their teaching experience would be perceived led participants to enter erroneous data on purpose. Because three of the teachers who had a break in service felt question 1 did not permit them to indicate their extensive experience, they opted to enter the first year of their teaching career at their current school, knowing full well they could have entered a different year. One participant who was out of school for almost 2 years remarked that, \u201cYou would not know I had been teaching at this school for 15 years.\u201d\nAdd the instruction \u201cIf you teach at more than one school, please consider the school where you teach most of your COURSES,\u201d and accompanying bullet points:\n\u2022 If your instructional time is equally divided among schools, please consider your official main school assignment, that is, where you receive your paycheck.\n\u2022 If your instructional time is equally divided among schools and you have no main school assignment, please consider the school where you spend most of your planning time.\nTeachers who currently taught at multiple schools were not sure which school they were being asked to consider.\n\n\fE-18 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nRecommendation e: Problem e: Recommendation f:\n\nProvide advance notification that teachers will be asked to complete questionnaire and should determine when they began at the school.\nIf accuracy of year is important, consider asking teachers to enter a school year (fiscal year covering August/September of one year to July/August of the next) instead of a normal calendar year:\n__|__|__|__| to __|__|__|__| School year\nTeachers could not recall start year. Two participants were not sure of the exact date when they began teaching at THIS school and they estimated the year. Both participants specifically stated that if the Census Bureau wanted exact dates, then advance warning or instructions to that effect should be provided.\nOne participant said it was easier to think of the school year when he started. He had started second semester but was not sure if he was hired in December of one calendar year or January of the next.\nIf it is important to avoid this source of error, determine and indicate how teachers should interpret \u201cschool,\u201d using one or more of the following as a guide:\nIf the school where you are currently teaching has\n\u2022 separated from a larger school during your time there,\nthen consider your first year there to be when the separation occurred.\nIf the school where you are currently teaching has\n\u2022 changed its name; \u2022 merged with another school; and/or \u2022 moved to another building during your time there;\nthen consider your first year there to be when you first began working on the same staff as other teachers who have also experienced this transition from start to finish in the same physical locations as you.\n[Do not replace \u201cworking on the same staff as\u201d with \u201cworking with\u201d since teachers may have worked with current colleagues at other schools in the past.] [Do not shorten to \u201cexperienced this transition\u201d since teachers from the other merged school also experienced the transition.]\nIf the school where you are currently teaching has\n\u2022 experienced a nearly complete turnover in staff; or \u2022 been reassigned students from a different geographical region;\nthen consider your first year there to be when you first began teaching in the physical location where you currently teach.\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-19\n\nProblem f: Recommendation g: Problem g: Question 2:\nRecommendation a:\nProblem a:\n\nParticipants did not know start date for a school if its attributes changed. Teachers whose schools had moved to a new building, been consolidated with other schools, and/or been renamed (in one case, all three at once) did not know whether the year in which they came to the original school or the year of the school\u2019s alteration or most recent incarnation was more appropriate.\nIf it is important, define break in service more specifically, perhaps as follows:\nConsider a break in service to be any period in which you EITHER\n\u2022 temporarily left the field of teaching (maternity leave, travel, etc.); OR \u2022 left the school where you are currently teaching to teach at another\nschool or in another school system.\n\u201cBreak in service\u201d was unclear to teachers who remained in teaching. Participants who left their current school and continued teaching but at a different location before returning to their current school did not know if their absence constituted a break of service because their retirement benefits were unaffected.\nHow much time do you work as a TEACHER at THIS school?\n\u2022 Mark (X) only one box.\n[ ] Full-time [ ] \u00be time or more, but less than full-time [ ] \u00bd time or more, but less than \u00be time [ ] \u00bc time or more, but less than \u00bd time [ ] Less than \u00bc time\nContact various school systems\u2019 personnel departments to determine the most common decimal representations for part time work. If there is no common representation, use days instead of hours and ask instead of fractional time:\nHow many days a week do you usually work as a teacher? (Please round to the nearest half day)______\n\u2022 If your schedule varies week by week, please report the average number of days per week.\nFractional divisions not used and not appropriate for describing amount of part time work. Several participants said they or their colleagues worked or had at some time taught part time, but that they had never described their time using fractions and would not know how to do so on a questionnaire.\nPart of the problem is that some schools do not make these distinctions. At some schools, the only distinction made is full vs. part time, with no distinctions made among different levels of part-time work. In the Arlington system, apparently, one may only work full time or half time.\n\n\fE-20 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nRecommendation b: Problem b:\nObservations:\n\nA related issue is the suitability of the representation. Fractions are inappropriate because they suggest a number of hours worked, whereas teachers are on salary and hours worked often vary by week, even for part-timers. One participant trying to make sense of the options wondered if \u00be time meant he had taken a quarter of the year off.\nOf the participants who were familiar with any sort of system for calculating time for part-time teachers, all claimed their school system used decimals rather than fractions, usually to indicate how many days the teacher worked. For instance, a \u201cpoint 4\u201d teacher would work 2 days a week, while a \u201cpoint 6\u201d teacher would work 3 days a week. According to a participant at another public school, however, a \u201c3 point 5\u201d teacher worked 3\u00bd days per week at that school, suggesting the implementation of decimal notation may vary with the school system.\nIt may be necessary at some point to specify whether work status should be determined by course load or by hours or days per week worked, since different respondents calculate this differently.\nIs work status determined by courses or by hours? Some teachers at one participant\u2019s school teach fewer courses than the standard number of courses but have additional administrative duties and work full days at the school. It was not clear to this participant whether working \u201cas a TEACHER\u201d refers to the proportion of time spent instructing in the classroom relative to that spent by other teachers or to the number of hours worked relative to those of other teachers.\nUncertainty regarding whether status is determined by course load or workdays is also reflected in the responses of participants concerned about how the time of part timers is apportioned. According to one participant, a \u201cpoint 2/point 8\u201d teacher teaches 20 percent of his courses at one school, the rest at another. According to him, the actual number of hours spent at a school is irrelevant. According to other participants, however, a \u201cpoint 2/point 8\u201d teacher would teach 1 day a week at one school and 4 days a week at another school. For them, courses taught are irrelevant.\nThe problems and recommendations a and b above refer to only the most general cases. There is probably a great deal more variation in how part-time status is treated; for instance:\n\u2022 At one participant\u2019s school, the only part-time staff are substitutes. \u2022 One participant, as a full-time long-term substitute, is hourly and\nchooses to work \u00bc time.\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-21\n\nII. Class Organization: Panel A, Items 3\u20139\n\nThis section asks about participants\u2019 meetings with other teachers and the organization of classes in participants\u2019 schools.\n\nQuestion 3:\n\nIn which grades are the students you currently teach at THIS school?\n\n\u2022 If you teach at more than one school, report only for the grades you teach at THIS school.\n\u2022 Mark (X) all that apply.\n\n[ ] Ungraded\n[ ] Prekindergarten\n[ ] Kindergarten [ ] 1st [ ] 2nd\n\n[ ] 3rd [ ] 4th [ ] 5th [ ] 6th [ ] 7th\n\n[ ] 8th [ ] 9th [ ] 10th [ ] 11th [ ] 12th\n\nRecommendation a:\n\nCapitalize \u201cSTUDENTS\u201d in question and follow up with a parenthetical \u201c(not courses)\u201d to discourage analysis by course. Capitalize \u201call\u201d in second apple point to emphasize that all grades are of interest. To discourage analysis by teacher identity, clarify with an apple point: \u201cIf you teach a specific grade, such as 4th grade, be sure to include any students from other grades who are in your classroom.\u201d\n\nProblem a:\n\nParticipants omitted grade levels of some students they taught. Some participants thought the purpose of the question might be to identify either the teachers themselves, by the grade levels they taught, or the courses they taught, by their grade level content, so they considered these criteria more than grade levels of actual students enrolled. Others listed the grades of only the majority of their students.\n\nObservations:\n\nSome elementary school teachers thought of themselves as teaching grade\nlevels, not subject areas, so a couple said they would not include students of\nother grades, such as remedial students repeating a class or precocious students\nattending their classes for enrichment. For example, one participant said if she had a 1st grader completing 2nd grade work in the 1st grade class, she would not mark 2nd grade in addition to 1st grade.\n\nSome high school teachers thought of themselves more as teaching courses\ndirected towards various grade levels than as teaching students at various grade levels. For instance, one said that if she had an 8th grader in her 9th grade class, she would look for an \u201c8th grade AP (advanced placement)\u201d option; if students in 12th grade were completing college-level work, she would look for \u201c12th grade AP.\u201d Another, who taught a course to 10th and 11th graders and marked\nboth grades, was then probed for her rationale and revised her response to include 9th and 12th graders, since, she said, the course was open to them as well, but the classes were generally understood to be for 10th and 11th graders.\n\nA third set of participants may simply have missed the instruction to include all grades taught. They assumed that they just needed to check grades \u201cmostly\u201d\n\n\fE-22 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nRecommendation b: Problem b:\nObservations:\nQuestion 4a:\n\ntaught. These included, for example, a participant who teaches mostly 10th grade but has one or two 9th graders enrolled.\nRevised phrasing to encompass concept of \u201cMontessori or other school system without student grade-level assignments\u201d in place of \u201cungraded.\u201d\nParticipants did not understand \u201cungraded.\u201d The option to select \u201cungraded,\u201d if it was noticed, confused participants because they did not know what it meant. If it was pointed out to participants, it seemed to contribute to their impression that they should describe the grades of their classes or their own specialty grades rather than the grades of their students.\nThe option should be reworded to encourage its use only in very special cases, since participants, particularly one who taught in both a middle and a high school, appreciated being able to enumerate the entire range or nonconsecutive set of grades of their students rather than feeling constrained to select a single option for multiple grades.\nThis confusion about the meaning and purpose of \u201cungraded\u201d is a recurring issue, arising elsewhere in the survey. (See item 9.) The ungraded option may only apply to students at a school for the extremely disabled, students who could never reach grade 1, or to English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) students in their first year, or to students in another educational program like Montessori.\nIt was not as significant in question 3 because participants did not need this option. Because the wording of the instruction uses the plural of grade (\u201cin what grades\u2026\u201d), no participant appeared to feel restricted to choose one grade (despite the fact that several did so voluntarily, as described in problem a). Therefore, the issue of how to represent multiple grades with one answer option never arose for item 3.\nWhich statement best describes the way YOUR classes (or sections) at this school are organized?\n\u2022 Mark (X) only one box.\n[ ] You teach subject matter courses (e.g., math, history, music, biology) to several classes of different students all or most of the day. (Departmentalized Instruction) [ ] You teach only one subject (e.g., art, music, physical education, computer skills) in an elementary school. (Elementary Enrichment Class) [ ] You teach multiple subjects to the same group of students all or most of the day. (Self-Contained Class) (Version 2 bolds \u201call or most of the day\u201d) [ ] You are one of two or more teachers who teach multiple subjects to the same group of students. (Team Teaching) [ ] You provide instruction (e.g., special education, reading) to selected students who are released from their regular classes. (\u201cPull-Out\u201d Class)\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-23\n\nRecommendation a1:\n\nReword answer options so that, as in option 4 above (team teaching), information describing students or mapping teachers to students is closer to the beginning of the answer choice than is course or subject information:\n\n\u2022 You instruct several classes of different students most or all of the day in one or more subjects (such as algebra, geometry, music, history, government, and/or biology).... [Answer Option 1]\n\u2022 You are an elementary [enrichment? specialist? resource?] school teacher who teaches only one subject (such as art OR music OR physical education OR computer skills).... [Answer Option 2]\n\u2022 You instruct the same group of students all or most of the day in multiple subjects.... [Answer Option 3]\n\u2022 [No change to Answer Option 4.] \u2022 You provide remediation or special needs services\u2026 OR You instruct\nselected students released from their regular classes in specific skills or to address specific needs (for instance, gifted and talented, special education, reading remediation, English as a Second Language).... [Answer Option 5]\n\nProblem a:\n\nAnswer options appear to focus on the courses or subjects taught rather than the method of instruction. One participant\u2019s reaction sums up the nature of the confusion here: \u201cThe question should focus on how the classes are offered, not what is being offered.\u201d As was the case throughout the survey, participants concentrated attention on the first few words of the answer options, reading only until they felt they understood each option. As a result, several participants attended to the subjects in the examples in the first two answer options (e.g., art, music, physical education, computer skills) and made one or more of the following mistaken assumptions:\n\n\u2022 Option 1 or 2 applied to them only if they taught one of those classes explicitly listed in the examples provided rather than some other subject not listed (like chemistry).\n\u2022 They automatically qualified for option 1 or 2 if they saw a subject they taught listed in the examples.\n\u2022 If they were to qualify for option 1, they needed to teach multiple subject matter courses, not just one.\n\nThose who were under the third assumption, that option 1 stipulated that they teach multiple subjects, were uncertain as to whether they could qualify if they taught multiple subjects within the same department (e.g., algebra, geometry, trigonometry, consumer math), or whether they needed to teach in multiple departments of the school to offer \u201cdepartmentalized instruction.\u201d More varied options would give readers a better understanding of the range of situations the fall under option 1.\n\nThe examples in option 5 also were not sufficiently varied to convince readers that they should base their choice on the mapping of teachers to students, not the specific course content. One participant mentioned that her school had a pull-out program for gifted and talented students, but the examples in option 5 seem oriented towards remediation only.\n\n\fE-24 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nRecommendation b: Problem b:\nObservations:\n\nIn addition, there did not seem to be an appropriate category for certain teachers of students with special needs. Several participants noted that they taught special education or ESOL students exclusively. In those cases, although they are mainstreamed, attending regular schools, the students are not \u201cpulled out\u201d for part of a class, but attend classes as part of a curriculum designed especially for them. These classes are \u201cregular classes\u201d for these students; they are not \u201creleased,\u201d as in option 5.\nThese teachers were also uncomfortable with the other options. Most taught one or two subject areas such as reading and science to exclusively IEP or limitedEnglish-proficient (LEP) students. In the sense that they shared these students with other special education or ESOL teachers teaching other subjects, such as math and social studies, they were team teachers (option 4). In their own opinion, they were subject matter teachers (option 1) whose department affiliation happened to be determined by the type of students they taught rather than the subject they taught. In the opinion of their school, however, they were ESOL or special education teachers, not subject matter teachers, who taught a \u201cSelf-Contained Class\u201d of subjects all day to the same group of students, namely various sets of IEP or LEP students who came through their classroom (option 3). One participant\u2019s school actually used the term \u201cself-contained\u201d to describe classes in which special education students were taught certain subject matter courses (e.g., geometry) but then were mainstreamed into regular (uncontained) classes. These teachers did not know how to classify themselves.\nConsider allowing participants to denote another category, to describe \u201cmain\u201d organization and \u201csecondary\u201d organization. If appropriate for the desired definition, change option 4 (Team Teaching) to say \u201ctwo or more teachers (not aides) in the same room simultaneously teaching multiple subjects to the same group of students\u2026.\u201d\nThe suggested answer choices and accompanying parenthetical labels did not match terms participants understood in their school system or did not match situations participants experienced. Several participants described situations where, for example, part of their day was self-contained with block times for reading/language arts and math, then departmentalized when students (as a whole) went to another teacher for science, physical education, and media. The same participant might teach science to other teachers\u2019 classes for one or two periods. These teachers wanted to choose two options to describe the situation. Participants were also confusing an aide with a coteacher or could not find a means to adequately note that they had an aide in the classroom when teaching students who were mainstreamed.\nSeveral participants noted that the phrases at the end of each of the answer choices, for example, Self-Contained Class, in parentheses, along with the preceding definitions in the answer choices, helped them to confirm the selection of a particular response. One participant mentioned that he had jumped to scanning those phrases after reading one or two of the longer descriptions since they were more concise. Two others read the long descriptions carefully as well as the parenthetical descriptions. When asked what they would do if provided only one of the elements\u2014just the phrases or just the definitions\u2014 these participants said they would probably not change their answer.\n\n\fQuestion 4b: Recommendation: Problem: Question 5:\nRecommendation: Problem:\nObservations:\n\nAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-25\nFinding just one option that covered most situations proved problematic for some participants. Participants understood the meaning behind the answer choices, but some had some difficulty in limiting their choices to just one of those described in the answers. As in the case of the special education teacher who teaches in a tailored curriculum (she teaches geometry and career exploration), the curriculum is considered self-contained but the classes are departmentalized. In other elementary school cases, classes were somewhat self-contained but students also had departmentalized instruction for part of the day (music, physical education, art, science, media) depending on the day of the week; participants wanted to be able to record both situations.\nWhich box did you mark in item 4a above?\n[ ] Box 1 or 2 \u00ce Go to item 7 on page 7. [ ] Box 3, 4, or 5 \u00ce Continue with item 5 below.\nIn the second answer option, point arrow downwards to question 5 (directly below) to distinguish it from the pattern in the first answer option.\nSeveral participants erred in the skip pattern and incorrectly continued to question 5. A couple did not select a box but correctly continued to question 5 or skipped to question 7. The right-facing arrow in the second option currently implies \u201cforward,\u201d suggesting the reader should continue to the next page. Fortunately, none who skipped correctly to question 7 returned later to attempt to complete 5 and 6.\nAt THIS school, what is the total number of students enrolled in the class (or section) you taught during your most recent FULL WEEK of teaching?\n\u2022 If you teach two or more classes (or sections) per day, please enter the average number of students in a class (or section).\n__|__| Students\nRephrase stem to include the direction to average in the question.\nSome participants were unclear what to record until reading the apple point on averaging. For example, one kindergarten teacher was unclear how to record her response for a.m. and p.m. classes until she read the apple point to average; otherwise, she would have combined the total number of students. Another participant has several small \u201cclasses\u201d (reading groups of 5 students) and one large traditional class of 23. In her opinion, the average would not be accurate. To counter this situation, a participant suggested asking for low to high range of classes taught. One participant misinterpreted the question as asking for how many students were physically present.\nDefinition of \u201cclass\u201d can vary from a small reading group to a \u201cteam\u201d of 6th graders.\n\u201cMost recent full week\u201d is generally understood to be a particular week with no snow days, no delays (in most cases), no early dismissals, no teacher in-service\n\n\fE-26 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\ndays (in most cases), and no holiday parties. In practice, however, most participants defaulted to \u201ctypical, normal, or average\u201d week, regardless of the time of year. Several music teachers, a coach, and a participant who taught horticultural science mentioned that, depending on the time of year when they filled out the survey, more time would be recorded for extracurricular school activities.\n\nQuestion 6a:\n\nDuring your most recent FULL WEEK of teaching, approximately how many hours did you spend teaching each of these subjects at THIS school?\n\n\u2022 If you taught two or more subjects at the same time, apportion the time to each subject as best you can. Report hours to the nearest whole hour; do not record fractions or minutes. If you did not teach a particular subject during the week, mark (X) the \u201cNone\u201d box.\n\n(1) English/Reading/Language Arts __|__| Hours per week \u00ce Of these hours, how many were\n\n__| None\n\ndesignated for reading instruction?

And, as explained in problem a2, they were apparently not able to distinguish the different instructions (e.g., the instruction to \u201capportion as best they could\u201d).\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-27\n\nRecommendation a2:\n\nGiven that only two participants saw the version 2 copy, and it was not met with resistance, UserWorks staff suggests using it to help to break up the page. Staff suspects that with version 2, users will not feel they have to do as much work on a single subitem.\n\nConsider asking first about reading activities AND reading instruction (or just time spent teaching reading, if more appropriate), then asking how much time spent on other language arts activities outside of reading, so users will not have to extract reading time from various language arts activities. For example, an elementary school participant wondered which parts of reading (e.g., phonics, directed book studies, read to aloud) should be included and whether reading included free reading time outside of reading. The aligned vertical format in version 2 could have an impact on the participant\u2019s understanding of the question.\n\nProblem a2:\n\nSome participants remarked that it was difficult to break out the division of time because, especially in kindergarten and preschool, lessons were chunked, taught less formally and more informally, and lasted only for about 10 or 15 minutes at a time, but were greatly integrated with other subject matter. Apparently, they did not see the instruction to \u201capportion as best they could.\u201d\n\nThe elementary teachers had fewer problems with this because they devoted an hour or two per day specifically to English/Language Arts and that time would also incorporate teaching reading skills; however, one elementary school teacher did have problems calculating time in reading because she teaches language arts (writing, grammar) as part of reading. In addition, she incorporates social studies and science topics into her reading periods. She noted that she would have put down the reading periods as reading time, but it would have made it appear she spent very little time on language arts that was not reading.\n\nA couple of participants who were middle school or high teachers wondered if Drop Everything and Read (DEAR) would count as Reading. One science/math teacher recorded .3 (for 20 minutes spent every week in DEAR) in Reading.\n\nRecommendation b: Give examples as to what included in English/Reading/Language Arts.\n\nProblem b:\n\nFor preschool and kindergarten teachers, is prereading considered part of English/Language Arts/Reading? Should they count only formal instruction in reading?\n\nObservations:\n\nInconsistent use of \u201cNone\u201d box by one participant who wrote in zero for reading and checked none for others. Another participant mostly correctly checked \u201cNone,\u201d but still erred by writing zero for Science, rather than checking \u201cNone.\u201d\n\nOne participant missed the arrow to the reading breakout question, until prompted. This participant wanted the question in two parts, which was reflected in version 2 of the panel.\n\n\fE-28 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nQuestion 6b:\nRecommendation a:\nProblem a:\nRecommendation b: Recommendation c: Observation: Question 6c: Recommendation:\n\nParticipants had fewer problems completing questions 2\u20134 because they were pretty straightforward. One participant did not include landscaping in science (he taught horticultural science) because he considered that a voc-tech course, not a science course.\n\nA couple of participants wondered if, in their kindergarten or preschool classes, social skills were the same as social studies.\n\nThis school year, what is your MAIN teaching assignment field at this school, that is, the field in which you teach the most classes?\n\n\u2022 Record the teaching assignment field code and name from Table 1 on page 6.\n\nCode ____|\n\nMain teaching assignment field _________________________|\n\nClarify if goal is to identify \u201cmost subjects taught\u201d (e.g., three earth science classes vs. two general science classes vs. being just a 9th grade science teacher, 2-hour block of reading in a self-contained 2nd grade class where participant also\nteaches math, etc.) or elementary vs. middle vs. high school teacher who\nhappens to specialize in some subject.\n\nParticipants were unclear on the purpose of the question. Was it to identify the most important subject/class taught or if participant identified self as 6th grade/ middle school classroom teacher? Of those participants who had difficulty answering the question, several would identify (pre-)reading as the most important subject taught, even though they did not consider themselves reading teachers. They recorded kindergarten grade/code but then listed reading as the main teaching assignment field.\n\nSee also discussion under Question 7.\n\nRevise instruction to refer to table 1 to refer to table 1A instead.\n\n\u201cMain teaching assignment field,\u201d to most participants, implied a predominant\nsubject taught (most said reading was most important) rather than status as a 4th grade/elementary school classroom teacher.\n\nGo to Section III \u2013 Educational Background on page 9. (6c only on version 1; version 2 gives a skip instruction.)\n\nConsider an arrow pointing to skip instruction on same line (aligned with the left margin underneath) as 6b.\n\nConsider putting the skip instruction within 6b:\n\nCode\n\nMain teaching assignment field\n\n____|\n\n_________________________| \u00ce \u201cSkip to Item 10a (Section\n\nIII\u2014Educational Background) on page 9\u201d AND/OR include instructions:\n\nSTOP! Do NOT go to page 7. Please skip to item \u2026 on page ....\u201d\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-29\n\nProblem:\nObservation: Question 7:\nRecommendation a: Recommendation b: Problem b: Recommendation c: Problem c:\nRecommendation d: Recommendation e: Observations:\n\nHalf of all the participants at this point overlooked the skip to page 9. One participant erred in understanding the skip in 4b and did answer question 7 but continued to question 8. (Later, this participant was overly attentive, which confused him throughout the remainder of the survey). Two participants caught the skip they had missed after realizing that question 7 was the same as question 6b.\n\nFor some participants, \u201cgo\u201d did not imply \u201cpass over the items\u201d; \u201cskip\u201d was a more directive term.\n\nThis school year, what is your MAIN teaching assignment field at this school, that is, the field in which you teach the most classes?\n\n\u2022 Record the teaching assignment field code and name from Table 1 on page 6.\n\nCode ____|\n\nMain teaching assignment field _________________________|\n\nSee discussion under 6b.\n\nNo recommendation.\n\nSeveral participants missed the instruction to skip from question 4b to question 7 or to skip questions 7-8-9 after completing 6b. Of those who did, they remarked that questions 6b and 7 were the same. Two participants completed question 7 but then skipped questions 8 and 9, saying that they did not apply.\n\nAdd new assignment codes or reword existing ones. Replace \u201cESL/Bilingual\u201d with \u201cESL or Bilingual.\u201d\n\nAn art teacher wanted a code for Photography, rather than using code 141, and then she mentioned that Visual Arts is the preferred term for this code (141). A music teacher wanted more specific options within Music, (e.g., choral or instrumental is the usual division). Another participant, an ESOL teacher, was confused by the use of \u201cbilingual\u201d in the ESL codes. She figured it out, but she was not sure what the difference was between \u201cgeneral\u201d and \u201cSpanish\u201d or \u201cother.\u201d\n\nRevise instruction to refer to table 1 to refer to table 1A instead.\n\nConsider moving this question after item 9. (See \u201cObservation\u201d in Item 9.)\n\nOne participant said if (s)he taught at another school, (s)he would want to record classes taught at both schools, so (s)he would not seem like (s)he was not \u201cworking.\u201d\n\nOne participant, after noticing that questions 6b and 7 are the same, wondered if the Census Bureau would fill in the codes. Another wondered if (s)he was being \u201ctested.\u201d\n\n\fE-30 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nQuestion 8:\nRecommendation a: Problem a: Recommendation b: Problem b: Observation:\n\nSeveral participants noted after seeing questions 6b and 7 (but not necessarily remarking that questions were the same and that they erred in catching the skip instruction) said that question 7 should ask about secondary teaching assignment.\nOne participant made a mistake when using the code for kindergarten; (s)he used K instead of 101.\nOne participant wanted to include all codes for classes he teaches. He created new boxes or indicated that new boxes would be needed for this purpose.\nDuring your MOST RECENT FULL WEEK of teaching, how many separate classes (or sections) did you teach AT THIS SCHOOL?\n\u2022 Do not include homeroom periods or study halls. \u2022 If you teach 2 classes (or sections) of chemistry 1, a class (or section) of\nphysics 1, and a class (or section) of physics II, you would report 4 classes (or sections). \u2022 If you teach 3 music classes (or sections) to students at THIS school, and 2 music classes (or sections) to students at other schools, you would report ONLY 3 classes (or sections).\n__|__| Number of classes or sections\nExclude study hall from apple points.\nSeveral participants noted that study hall is no longer used, but some described \u201clabs\u201d where students have the opportunity to do homework, such as in an ESOL-supported environment.\nConsider use of \u201cperiod\u201d to distinguish subject from class. Alternatively, rephrase question to indicate \u201cIn your job assignment, how many classes are assigned to you?\u201d AND \u201cCount only once periods that meet more than once a week\u201d (or \u201cCount each time you meet with a class during the week,\u201d if that\u2019s the intent.) In the examples under the instruction, show how to treat periods that meet several times a week.\nA couple of participants remarked that \u201c(or section)\u201d cluttered up the page. More importantly, several participants were still unclear how to record classes; the use of \u201cin the week\u201d implied that it would be a multiple of five. (Answers ranged from 3 or 4 to 25.) At least four said the question was ambiguous. Apple points are critical in answering the question correctly; the question otherwise would seem to ask how many times your periods meet in a week.\nOne participant was confused about the meaning of \u201chomeroom\u201d; the term in his school was \u201chome base.\u201d\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-31\n\nQuestion 9:\nRecommendation a: Problem a: Recommendation b: Problem b:\n\nComplete a line of the table below for each class (or section) that you taught during your MOST RECENT FULL WEEK of teaching at this school.\n\u2022 Record the subject name, subject matter code, and the grade level code from table 1 on page 6.\n\u2022 The number of lines filled should equal the number of classes (or sections) reported in item 8.\n\u2022 For classes with mixed grades, list the grade with the most number of students. (Version 2)\na. Subject name, e.g., English b. Subject matter code, e.g., 153 c. Grade level code, e.g., 11 d. Number of students, e.g., 33\nClarify that respondents should only list each period taught followed by the number of students in each period (or else combine periods of the same subject on one line and list the total number of students for all such periods).\nPeriods of the same subject were listed only one time with all students studying that subject summed together. One participant confused how many students to record for a class on English as 50 (instead of 2 at 25). Another participant recorded 75 for the World Studies class instead of 3 at 25. A third participant tutored two students in reading separately for 30 minutes each in one period, so she recorded two in column D. At least two participants had a double reading period and listed both of them twice, one as a language arts period and another as a reading period, even though the same students were taught.\nConsider updating codes in table 1 that this question refers to.\nOne participant listed subjects first, and then went to the table to locate matching codes for those subjects, such as World History.\nOne participant suggested adding \u201ccareer exploration\u201d under voc-tech, as well as updating computer-associated voc-tech classes (e.g., omitting \u201ckeyboarding\u201d and adding \u201ccomputer technology\u201d).\nAnother participant suggested reordering codes from general to specific subjects. Also, at this point in the survey, one participant was annoyed that his various classes in music (e.g., guitar, concert band), unlike various subjects in math, were not accounted for. The participant, who in item 7 had written in a specialty field that did not match the field code he selected, did not specify here the type of music class in column A because by this point he figured it did not matter.\n\n\fE-32 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nObservation:\n\nOne participant suggested emphasis should be on leading respondents from all the subjects they teach to the question he felt item 7 was really getting at, \u201cWhere do you feel your concentration lies?\u201d; this participant, therefore, suggested moving question 7 under question 9. This reversal of question 9 in place of question 7 may help teachers to spotlight what their main teaching assignment field is after listing all the subjects they teach, if that is the goal. One participant who teaches at two schools wanted additional questions for his other school.\n\nSix participants were unsure about the term ungraded or wanted to use an \u201cMG\u201d code to denote that their classes have multiple or mixed grades in them. Ungraded to them meant, \u201cno grades are assigned in this class\u201d so it did not seem like an appropriate or even a relevant choice. One participant assumed \u201cungraded\u201d must be the nursery school grade prior to prekindergarten, since it appeared first in the list of grades. One participant who saw version 2 wrote in \u201c9\u201312,\u201d another left the column empty for those she did not know how to record, and another recorded 11th grade as the \u201cmajor grade.\u201d UserWorks staff did not have a sufficient sample to determine whether the new apple point in version 2 would clarify the mixed grades issue.\n\nIII. Educational Background: Panel A, Items 10\u201314\n\nThis section asks for information about participants\u2019 academic degrees.\n\nQuestion 10/12a:\n\nDo you have a [Bachelor\u2019s/Master\u2019s] degree?\n\n__| Yes __| No \u00ce Go to item 13a on page 10.\n\nRecommendation a: Consider adding venue to record double bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nProblem a:\n\nSeveral participants remarked that it is not clear until question 13 that they can record another bachelor\u2019s, nor is it clear how to record a double major.\n\nObservation:\n\nParticipants with a master\u2019s equivalency from a state/local/county Department of Education wanted to complete master\u2019s questions with reference to the generalized nature of the courses they\u2019ve taken and the certificate they\u2019ve earned.\n\nQuestion 10/12b:\n\nIn what year did you receive your [Bachelor\u2019s/Master\u2019s] degree?\n\n__|__|__|__| Year\n\nObservation:\n\nOne participant was annoyed at having to recall year graduated, saying that it was so long ago and (s)he wanted to have advance notice of need for transcripts.\n\nAnother participant could not remember the exact year, so (s)he wrote mid1980s instead.\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-33\n\nQuestion 10/12c: Recommendation a: Problem a:\nRecommendation b: Problem b:\nRecommendation c: Problem c:\nQuestion 10/12d:\n\nWas this degree awarded by a department of education, college of education, or school of education?\n\n__| Yes __| No\n\nConsider allowing participants to check off whether and how degree was education related.\n\nSeveral participants had degrees awarded by a non-education academic unit of a college or university (e.g., School of Arts and Sciences, or College of Agriculture), but the degree did relate to education, for example Art Education or Agricultural Education. The wording of the question implied to them that their degree did not \u201ccount\u201d as an education degree. One participant noted that her math degree was from a well-known college that was mostly known for its education program, but she had a strictly math Bachelor of Arts (B.A.).\n\nReword question to give context to the academic units within a higher education institution, for example, \u201cDid a university\u2019s college of education or a college\u2019s school of education award this degree?\u201d\n\nSeveral participants were confused, calling the wording \u201cambiguous,\u201d and interpreted part of this question as referring to a state/local/county department of education, especially among those who had master\u2019s equivalency awarded by the state/local/county department of education. In addition, several participants remarked that they expected they would have had the option of choosing which of the three academic units awarded the degree, noting that \u201cyes\u201d seemed an inadequate answer.\n\nIf \u201cno\u201d to item 10/12c, point to a subitem that conveys, \u201cIf your degree was not from a department or school of education within your college (e.g., school of music), if your degree was not from a school or college of education within your university, did you take education-related courses (e.g., methods in teaching music) WITHIN that department, school, or college?\u201d\n\nWording of the question does not cover all situations in which respondents receive education degrees. Respondents who answered fully understood the question, and those who answered \u201cno\u201d may have received a degree in education through taking education courses in their specialty field department (history) or school (School of Music). It may not be obvious whether to treat this situation as a full-fledged education degree, as issues of accreditation may arise.\n\nWhat was your major field of study?\n\n\u2022 Record the field of study code and the field name from Table 2 on page 8.\n\nCode ____|\n\nMajor field _________|\n\n\fE-34 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nRecommendation a: Problem a: Recommendation c: Problem c: Recommendation b: Problem b:\nRecommendation c1: Recommendation c2: Problem c:\n\nConsider recording minor or area of specialization.\nSeveral participants with a master\u2019s in secondary education wanted to record area(s) of specialization. For those whose programs crossed elementary/middle school boundaries, they wanted codes to reflect 1st through 8th grade endorsement, or prekindergarten through 3rd grade endorsement, or kindergarten through 12th endorsement.\nConsider adding new education-related codes.\nOne participant had a Master of Arts (M.A.) in curriculum and instruction but did not like that she had to select \u201cother\u201d (136) from the education column. Another participant had an M.A. in Art Education and mentioned that it was different from an M.A. in Art.\nConsider relabeling general education codes by grade ranges.\nGrade level ranges in general education codes do not reflect actual certification. Currently many education programs train elementary education teachers to teach through 8th grade middle school and secondary education teachers to teach 6th through 12th grade. There is often no degree program for teaching the middle grades. The secondary education codes, by distinguishing \u201cmiddle\u201d from \u201csecondary,\u201d imply that the questionnaire designers think of \u201csecondary\u201d as the same as \u201chigh school.\u201d A middle school teacher certified in \u201csecondary education,\u201d or \u201celementary education\u201d might therefore justifiably feel that by listing her true certification as \u201csecondary,\u201d or \u201celementary\u201d she would be implying she was teaching in grades outside of those she was trained in. Indeed, those whose programs crossed elementary/middle school boundaries, wanted codes to reflect 1st through 8th grade endorsement, or prekindergarten through 3rd grade endorsement, or kindergarten through 12th endorsement.\nConsider adding an apple point for participants who cannot find their exact degree name:\n\u2022 If the field of study name is not listed in Table 2, please choose the closest match.\nAlso, again assuming the intention of the item is to determine the name of the degree, increase the likelihood that respondents will find an exact match in table 2 by adding a section to table 2 labeled \u201cCombined Degree\u201d with codes and field names that include both a specialty field and the word \u201ceducation.\u201d\nIf the purpose of item 10/12d is to help determine whether the respondent has an education degree, it does not succeed for all cases. Both the wording of the question and the set of options provided in table 2 encourage respondents to think of unofficial areas of expertise rather than official credentials. The phrase \u201cmajor field of study\u201d connotes concentration area for a bachelor\u2019s degree and simply confuses master\u2019s degree recipients, since having a \u201cmajor\u201d implies one has the opportunity to study something other than one\u2019s major, which is not the case in most advanced degree programs. The division of table 2 into General Education and Subject Matter Specific areas forces respondents to choose\n\n\fQuestion 11a:\nQuestion 11b:\nRecommendation: Problem:\nObservation: Question 13a:\n\nAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-35\nwhether they studied education or a specialty area, when the focus of their program may have been on both equally.\nWhat is the name of the college or university where you earned this degree?\nName of college or university _______________________|\nIn what city and state is it located?\nCity State ___| ____| __| Located outside the United States\nNo change.\nOne participant was confused and thought this question pertained to question 10; she realized her mistake, erased her original answer, and wrote in the correct one.

Several participants in Maryland have or are in the process of completing a master\u2019s equivalency that entitles them to a substantial raise in pay. The participants were not sure if this master\u2019s equivalency (which included college courses as well as collegeequivalency classes) could be classified as educational specialist. (One participant had two educational specialists \u201cdegrees\u201d but used that and the Certificate of Advanced Graduate Studies to record certificates related to music instruction.)\n\nAdd a row for National Board certificate.\n\nOne participant had obtained National Board certificate and one participant was in the process of creating a portfolio in anticipation of taking National Boards. Similar to the master\u2019s equivalency, the National Boards offered participants a substantial raise in pay.\n\nModify skip instruction to read, \u201cIf no, GO to item ....\u201d\n\nOne participant did not realize the arrow and skip instruction after the \u201cNo\u201d answer choice in question 10a applied only to people who answer \u201cNo.\u201d After answering question 10a, she went to question 13a and was unable to find a place to put her additional degree, her first master\u2019s degree. She had a Master\u2019s of Education (M.Ed.), but recorded it under \u201cDoctorate or first professional degree\u201d by writing in her degree.\n\nParticipants had no problems navigating the table itself, but did not know until seeing the table that they could record a 2nd bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degree.\n\nOne participant had an Associate in Arts awarded but opted not to record it because she \u201cconsidered it part of my BA program.\u201d\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-37\n\nQuestion 14:\nRecommendation a: Problem a:\nRecommendation b: Problem b: Recommendation c: Problem c:\nObservations: Section III overall: Problem:\n\nOne participant incorrectly completed questions 10\u201312 because of confusion with the skip pattern. She had an M.Ed., but recorded it under \u201cDoctorate or first professional degree\u201d by writing in her degree.\nHave you ever taken any graduate or undergraduate courses in teaching methods or education?\n\u2022 Include courses you are now taking as well as courses taken to earn a degree and courses taken outside a degree program.\n__| Yes \u00ce How many? __|__| __| No\nProvide a range of hours for participants to select.\nAlmost all participants said that it is hard to estimate (or obtain) the number of methods or education courses completed and/or that they would either prefer advance notice of the need for transcripts or they would have to resort to guessing. Several remarked it is difficult to think that far back, especially if they have been teaching for 20 or 30 years. One participant asked about the value of such a question.\nTarget this question more specifically to teachers who might have no education degree (perhaps after asking if participants have an education degree awarded by a college\u2019s school of education or a university\u2019s college of education).\nSeveral participants said the question was ambiguous because all teachers with education degrees would have taken some methods or education courses. The question is very broad because it says, \u201cever taken,\u201d which includes undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate coursework.\nIf the question is kept as is, offer examples of the types of classes that count as methods or courses in education.\nAs mentioned in problem b, at least four participants said the question is ambiguous and needed clarification in what should be considered a methods course. For example, should it have the words \u201cmethods\u201d in the title of the course? One participant erred in not including courses taken while obtaining an M.A.; this person considered the question ambiguous and was not sure if C&I classes counted as methods or education classes.\nOne participant incorrectly skipped the question.\nOne participant said yes, but did not record a number, saying it was too many to think about.\nThe section uses imprecise roundabout methods to get at the issue of whether teachers have been educated in what they are teaching. It is not clear why teachers are not directly asked if they are or are not teaching one or more\n\n\fE-38 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\ncourses outside the field or fields in which they received their education. Perhaps it is assumed that some teachers might feel threatened by the question in cases where they are not teaching in the field in which they were trained and are not given the opportunity to explain why. To keep the survey quantitative, respondents could be asked to choose from explanations presumed likely or write in a reason. It may be difficult to avoid write-ins however, since certain reasons may have nothing to do with teacher preference or school scheduling demands. For instance, a teacher who initiates a class in Latin to encourage students to master roots, prefixes, and suffixes as well as ancient history may be less likely to have majored in Classics or foreign languages than in English or history.\nThe following are examples that stand out in the participant pool: Categorization of degrees:\n\u2022 One participant has an M.A. in Art Education, teacher certification in Art Education, and teaches visual arts and photography. Does her degree count in education or in art?\n\u2022 One participant has a B.A. in Agriculture Education, certification to teach Agricultural Science, and teaches horticultural science (a subset of agriculture). For the purposes of the survey, does his degree count in education or in agriculture? He also has a master\u2019s equivalency focusing on education from the state of Maryland; is this integrated into the survey?\n\u2022 One participant has a bachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s in music education from a School of Music, with additional certifications (educational specialist) in performance and opera. For purposes of the survey, do his degrees count in education or in music?\nTeaching out of area:\n\u2022 A teacher with a business education master\u2019s degree (from screener; on the survey she classified it as secondary education), certification almost completed in special education, is teaching geometry and career exploration in a high school curriculum targeted to students in special education. At first glance, what she is teaching may seem out of area but \u201ccareer exploration\u201d is a business topic, and math is a business skill.\n\u2022 A \u201ckindergarten\u201d teacher with no B.A., M.A., or teacher certification, is employed by a daycare center where she uses a kindergarten curriculum to teach 5-year-olds in the morning. (The afternoon session is mostly daycare.) She underwent mandatory training to be a lead teacher; the training consisted of two sessions, 90 hours and 45 hours. She has no way to show this credentialing process, so the survey can not determine what her educational area is.\n\u2022 A Title I reading teacher is certified as an elementary school teacher. Depending on assessment needs, she may teach reading, remedial math, etc. At any one time she is not teaching general elementary education, but rather, an elementary specialty. Yet over the course of several years, she will have taught all general elementary education courses.\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-39\n\n\u2022 Some elementary school teachers who teach multiple elementary school subjects are thus teaching in their areas of certification, elementary education, but the survey may not convey this since they put \u201creading\u201d as their main teaching assignment field, thinking it the most important subject for young children.\n\nIV. Certification and Training: Panel A, Items 15\u201320\n\nThis section asks for information about participants\u2019 certification.\n\nQuestion 15\u201318a:\n\nDo you have a [SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH] teaching certificate in this state?\n\n__| Yes (arrow points to question b) __| No \u00ce Go to item 21 on page 15 (for first certificate, in Version 1;\nVersion 2 directs participants to item 20) Go to item 20 on page 14 (for 2nd, 3rd, 4th certificate)\n\nRecommendation a: Focus on area of specialization. (See 15\u201318c.)\n\nProblem a:\n\nParticipants were confused for several reasons:\n\n\u2022 Question seemed to emphasize counting number of certificates renewed or advanced over teaching career.\n\u2022 Several remarked that the questions did not distinguish between current or lapsed/expired certificates.\n\nQuestion 15\u201318b:\n\nWhat type of certificate is this?\n\n\u2022 Mark (X) only one box.\n\n__| Regular or standard state certificate or advanced professional certificate __| Probationary certificate (the initial certificate issued after satisfying all requirements except the completion of a probationary period) __| Provisional or other type given to persons who are still participating in what the state calls an \u201calternative certification program\u201d __| Temporary certificate (requires some additional college coursework and/or student teaching before regular certification can be obtained) __| Emergency certificate or waiver (issued to persons with insufficient teacher preparation who must complete a regular certification program in order to continue teaching)\n\nObservation:\n\nOne participant remarked that her understanding of what the different types of certifications were did not match the descriptions.\n\n\fE-40 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nQuestion 15\u201318c:\nRecommendation a: Problem a:\nRecommendation b: Problem b: Observations:\nQuestion 19a: Question 19b: Recommendation:\n\nIn what content area is this certificate?\n\n\u2022 Record the content area code and the content area name from Table 3 on page 11.\n\nCode ____|\n\nContent area __________|\n\nAllow teachers to record elementary or secondary teaching certification and then area of specialization or endorsement.\n\nA few participants did not like the use of \u201cgeneral\u201d in the tables because they did not feel it was accurate. In addition, while they were certified in elementary education (rather than \u201cgrade\u201d) or secondary education (e.g., considered themselves a 6th grade classroom teacher), they wanted to record an area of specialization (such as science) or endorsement. The wording of the questions confused those teachers who had one certificate (one piece of paper) with several areas of specialization, such as math and earth science, and a reading endorsement. They could not readily ascertain that \u201cteaching certificate\u201d pertained to individual areas of specialization.\n\nEnsure that in the final version of the survey that tables are as close as possible to the referring questions.\n\nTwo participants remarked about the amount of page flipping needed to record codes from the tables. It did not prevent them from completing the question correctly; however, they did suggest moving the tables closer to the questions, possibly on the same page as the question.\n\nTwo participants wanted a new code to record certification for grades prekindergarten through 3rd grade; currently no code covers early childhood\nAND lower elementary grades. Further, some teachers are certified for kindergarten or 1st through 8th, but no code covers that range, either.\n\nOne participant thought he already included this information, but he did admit to not fully reading questions and instead was just looking for a few key words to clue him in.\n\nDo you currently hold ANY ADDITIONAL regular or standard state certificate(s) or advanced professional teaching certificate(s) in this state?\n\n__| Yes __| No \u00ce Go to item 20 below.\n\nHow many?\n\n__|__| Additional certificates\n\nMove question 20 to its own page.\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-41\n\nProblem: Question 20:\nRecommendation a: Problem a: Recommendation b: Problem b: Observation:\n\nMost participants correctly skipped this question. One participant erred in responding to this, not paying attention that the first question was 19 and not 20. (In earlier skips, participants are referenced to item 7, which is the first question on page 7 or to item 5 after 4b, which is the first question after 4b.) Another participant marked \u201cno\u201d incorrectly followed the skip pattern and continued to question 20.\nHow did you earn your initial teaching certificate? (Version 1)\nThinking about all of the teaching certificates you have earned in any state, how did you earn your first certificate?

(Version 2)\nRephrase or add answer choice, \u201cAfter I obtained bachelor\u2019s degree, but before I began teaching.\u201d\nOne participant went back to college after obtaining a B.A. to obtain a teaching certificate. This participant was unsure what supplemental or alternative program referred to and was looking for interim stage between completion of B.A. and before teaching career began. Another participant worked with a state agency to determine what courses were needed after the B.A. was awarded in order to obtain teaching certificate. (This participant chose \u201cother\u201d as the answer, but had no idea how to specify the process.)\nProvide examples for \u201calternative program.\u201d\nParticipants were unclear what alternative program meant. When asked about something like Teach for America, some participants would consider it an alternative program, while some would not.\nIn considering what \u201cinitial certificate\u201d meant, four participants were evenly divided in whether they would consider a temporary/emergency/provisional certificate as the first certificate.\nOne participant commented that the reworked version of the question posed no problem to understanding its intent when asked to explain what the question meant.\n\n\fE-42 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nV. Working Conditions: Panel A, Items 21\u201323, and Panel B, Items 14\u201316\n\nThis section asks about the hours spent at participants\u2019 teaching assignment at THIS school. (Note: Findings for both panels are combined here to compare and contrast wording and participant behavior.)\n\nPanel A Question 21:\n\nHow many total hours did you spend working on school-related activities for this school during your MOST RECENT FULL WEEK of teaching?\n\n\u2022 Include both official school hours and time spent working before school, after school, and on weekends.\n\n__|__|__| Total hours in the week\n\nPanel B Question 14:\n\nDuring your MOST RECENT FULL WEEK, how many total hours did you spend working on school-related activities for this school?\n\n\u2022 Include time during school hours and time spent working before school, after school, and on weekends.\n\n__|__|__| Total hours in the week\n\nRecommendation:\n\nAdd an explanation after the instruction: \u201cConsider \u2018school-related activities\u2019 to be anything you do in your capacity AS A TEACHER to help your students, their parents, your school, or other people or organizations, whether during school hours or before or after school or on weekends.\u201d\n\nAlso, to conserve space and save respondents\u2019 time, remove the now redundant apple point in question 14. Respondents tend to ignore apple points unless they need clarification anyway, and this apple point is not a supplementary illustration but a mandatory instruction.\n\nProblem:\n\nParticipants were unsure about what types of activities should be considered \u201cschool-related activities.\u201d Narrow interpretation of \u201cschool-related\u201d as merely \u201cinstruction-related\u201d led a minority of panel B participants to underestimate hours in question 14.\n\nSeveral participants simply failed to read the apple point in item 14. These participants assumed that they should include only official school hours in the hours requested. Significantly, however, some interpreted the phrase even more narrowly and included only instructional time in question 14. One participant initially wondered if \u201csports\u201d was a \u201cschool-related activity.\u201d Because the previous section in panel B concentrates on classroom instruction, and because examples of activities are not provided in item 14, respondents may not realize until they encounter items 15 and 16 that they are supposed to include activities unrelated to instruction or management of students. When participants read \u201cadministrative duties\u201d in item 15c and \u201ccoaching, acting as a club sponsor\u201d in item 16a, some broadened their understanding of \u201cschool-related activities,\u201d but they did not automatically return to question 14 to add more hours; they had to be led back to item 14 by the interviewer. Even the terms \u201ccoaching, acting as a club sponsor\u201d do not necessarily clarify the scope of school-related activities,\n\n\fObservations:\nPanel A Question 22:\n\nAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-43\nwhich could include academic, community oriented, and special-interest nonacademic activities.\nSince respondents will always be involved in school-related activities that cannot be anticipated (e.g., working lunches; running errands\u2014buying seeds and dirt for the school, not the classroom; monitoring nap time, play time, or recreational recess instead of lunch or the bus), it is probably best to offer as broad a definition of \u201cschool-related activities\u201d as possible. Yet the definition should not be so broad as to include aspects of the teacher\u2019s personal life that may involve school connections (e.g., having dinner with a friend who happens also to be a parent of a student in one\u2019s class).\nBoth sets of participants had trouble with the term \u201cMost Recent Full Week,\u201d but it did not seem to be affected by where in the sentence the phrase \u201cduring your most recent full week\u201d appeared, or whether or not the words \u201cof teaching\u201d were included.\nOne panel A participant having reached this point was less inclined to take care in considering responses, so when she recorded hours worked in a week, she entered only those above and beyond the average week, later wondering if she should go back and change the total hours.\nOne Panel A participant erred by writing in 60+ hours after marking that he worked less than \u00bc time. He mentioned that was the typical number of hours he worked when he was a full-time teacher, before he retired and became a permanent substitute teacher. He was still involved in teen club activities, however.\nDuring official school hours, how much time did you spend on the following school-related activities during your MOST RECENT FULL WEEK of teaching at this school?\n\u2022 Official school hours include a minimum number of hours required to receive base pay.\n\u2022 Official school hours do NOT include hours spent on activities for which you receive additional compensation.\na.

She suggested that where the survey is only asking about what happens during the workday it should say \u201cwork-related.\u201d Other participants may have had similar interpretations. For instance, a panel B participant thought \u201cschool-related\u201d meant \u201cnon-academic,\u201d having to do with school but excluding the fine details of instruction.\nExclude study hall from apple point in 22c.\nSeveral participants noted that study hall is no longer used, but some described \u201clabs\u201d where students have the opportunity to do homework, such as in an ESOL-supported environment.\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-45\n\nRecommendation c: Problem c: Recommendation d:\n\nInclude additional examples in questions 15/22b and 15/22c or create new categories showing where to classify other activities:\n\u2022 recess duty and other supervised recreation; \u2022 lunch (teacher\u2019s own lunch time, which is not the same as lunch duty); \u2022 staff, faculty, department, and committee meetings that take place\nduring school (contract) hours; \u2022 creating, preparing, duplicating, and setting up materials; \u2022 cleaning up the classroom; \u2022 field trips during the school day; and \u2022 parent conferences during the school day.\nEnd the list by saying \u201cand other similar activities performed during official school hours\u201d to emphasize that it is the time they are performed that determines whether they should appear in question 15/22 rather than question 16/23, not the nature of the activity.\nParticipants carefully classified their time according to the examples in italics but when attempting to classify activities that were not listed, they had difficulty generalizing from the examples to a class of activities with shared properties that would belong in a certain category.\nSuch unlisted activities included time between when they were required to arrive and when students arrived or between when students left school and when teachers were required to leave. One participant wondered whether to include school-sanctioned holiday parties during part of class time. Kindergarten and preschool teachers wondered if and how they should account for the informal learning (free play).\nIt was not clear to participants whether \u201crequired meetings\u201d was the same as faculty or staff meetings: one could be required to meet with the principal on occasion and one could schedule an extra faculty meeting other than regular monthly or weekly ones.\nParticipants were not sure whether to treat manual or clerical activities such as creation and duplication of materials for students\u2019 use, setting up a room for an activity, and cleaning up materials after class as planning or preparation activities, which were often conceived as primarily intellectual or professional activities.\nOne participant wondered where to put daytime field trips, another daytime parent conferences, since field trips and parent conferences were listed only in question 16/23, not question 15/22.\nIf participants will not yet have completed the professional development section, use more specific terms than \u201cprofessional development\u201d (e.g., \u201cinservice classes\u201d) or clarify whether \u201cprofessional development\u201d is to be limited to college courses and/or in services courses or includes other activities like faculty discussions.\n\n\fE-46 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nProblem d: Recommendation e: Problem e:\nRecommendation f: Problem f:\n\nSeveral Panel A participants were not sure what professional development meant; they thought it meant afterschool (usually weekend) workshops, seminars, and other trainings they attended for college or Continuing Education Unit credit. If professional development includes in-service days or duringschool trainings (or even presentations during staff or faculty meetings), participants wanted to know what would \u201ccount.\u201d This was not a problem for Panel B participants, since they had just completed a section on professional development where the phrase was defined rather broadly.\nDetermine whether item 15b should include ALL time spent planning, in which case it should read \u201cb. All school time spent planning.\u201d Otherwise, a separate category should be added: \u201cd. Additional school time spent planning (not scheduled planning periods).\u201d\nParticipants were not sure where to put, and thus did not include, time during official school hours that they used for planning but which was not officially scheduled as planning time. This confusion contributed to participants\u2019 listing more hours in item 14 than they were able to account for in items 15 and 16.\nWhen probed as to whether there were any hours they included in item 14 that were not included in items 15 or 16, nearly half the participants mentioned up to an hour before and up to an hour after school when they were required to be in the building but when students were not so required. Several noted that they completed most of their planning at these times, since there were fewer distractions than during official planning periods, but they were not sure where to include these hours.\nOne participant, from a private preschool, said she was not officially assigned any planning time whatsoever. Rather than putting zero hours in question 15b, however, she listed the same number of hours there as she listed for preparation and grading in question 16b, since the planning time she had was what she could schedule for herself through carving out a little time from the day here and there.\nDetermine whether 15b should include ONLY time spent actually planning, in which case it should reads \u201cb. School time spent on planning.\u201d Otherwise, append the current wording with \u201c\u2026whether actually used for planning or not.\u201d\nParticipants were unsure how to classify scheduled planning time if they did not have the opportunity to use it for its intended purpose.\nParticipants often found themselves using their officially scheduled planning periods for purposes other than planning lessons, purposes such as monitoring make-up exams for students who were absent, tutoring students who were falling behind, taking calls from concerned parents, discussing students\u2019 problems with other teachers, or trying to keep order among students in the halls. Most listed scheduled planning hours in question 15b but informed the interviewer that the question was a poor indication of the amount of time they spent planning during official school hours.\n\n\fAppendix E.

Working on a school newsletter, for instance, could be an example of item 16/23b, while developing individual education plans could be an example of item 16/23a. The phrase \u201cacting as a club sponsor\u201d could be expanded to \u201cacting as a club or activity sponsor,\u201d as suggested by a participant. Expanded examples in question 15/22 as suggested above should clarify confusion about official time before students arrive at school and after they leave school.\nUse as prime examples of a particular classification only items that are typical of that classification. Since the majority of field trips occur during school days, not overnight or on weekends, \u201cfield trips\u201d and \u201ctransporting students\u201d should\n\n\fE-48 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nProblem a:\nRecommendation b: Problem b:\n\ninitially appear as an example not in question 16/23a but in question 15/22. Question 15/22c should say, \u201cInclude time spent transporting students to and from field trip sites,\u201d while question 15/22a should say, \u201cInclude instruction provided both in the school and outside on supervised field trips.\u201d\nQualify conditions that would justify classification of activities that typically occur during school hours as outside of school hours. In 16a, rather than \u201cfield trips,\u201d say, \u201cportions of certain extended field trips.\u201d Rather than \u201ctutoring,\u201d say, \u201cbefore or after school tutoring,\u201d etc.\nAs in question 15/22, participants had difficulty categorizing activities that were not listed in the examples. They based their classification of activities on the italicized sample activities rather than on the boldfaced classification criteria, official school hours vs. other hours.\nSome participants who noticed the terms \u201cfield trips,\u201d \u201ctutoring,\u201d \u201cpreparation,\u201d \u201cgrading papers,\u201d \u201cparent conferences,\u201d and \u201cattending meetings\u201d in item 16 listed such activities in items 16a or 16b even if these activities occurred during official school hours. Their strategy was to find a match for each activity in one of the categories, not to classify the time and type of activity. They may have been influenced by the word \u201cincluding\u201d in the apple points in items 16a and 16b, which suggested these were the places to INCLUDE all instances of these activities, regardless of when they transpired.\nOne participant is a case manager for several special education students and spends much time in addition to her regular teaching duties catching up on students\u2019 progress, counseling students, teachers and parents, and doing administrative work related to IEPs. She did not see these activities listed and did not know where to put them.\nParticipants wanted clarification about whether activities during contract hours (before and after students arrive) should be counted in question 23. For example, preparation time can take place during the half hour or so teachers have between the time they are required to show up to work and when students arrive, as well as after students leave and the official end of the teacher\u2019s duty day.\nOne teacher suggested having checkboxes for other types of miscellaneous activities that teachers do, such as preparing and taking down class activities (e.g., the horticultural science teacher and the art teacher), doing clerical activities such as e-mailing or calling parents, working with other teachers, and acting as students\u2019 case managers during unofficial school hours.\nClarify what \u201cmeetings\u201d in apple points mean, while simultaneously reiterating the official/unofficial distinction, for example, \u201cfaculty meetings held during school\u201d vs. \u201cbefore or after school faculty or PTA meetings.\u201d\nOne participant counted as hours spent \u201cattending meetings\u201d in question 23b hours she had already recorded as \u201crequired meetings\u201d in question 22c. She was concentrating more on the examples than on when the meeting had occurred. Although the intent of the wording distinction may be to convey indirectly that\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-49\n\nmeetings in question 23b are outside school hours since they are not required, the distinction is too subtle to be perceived in a quick reading.\n\nObservations:\n\nWhile two participants overlooked the apple points, several commented about them, saying on the one hand that there was a lot of detail to consider, but also that teachers should be alerted to read the question and examples carefully. In order to correctly answer the questions, it is important to read the answer points too; they are more than just tips.\n\nWorking Conditions overall:\n\nRecommendation a:\n\nUse the apple points defining hours and reiterating what to include in items 22 and 23 of panel A. (These instructions were missing in items 15 and 16 in panel B.)\n\nMake question 14/21 the main question and indent questions 15/22 and 16/23 as subsections (part a, part b, etc.) under it to imply that the hours are related. In addition, wording questions 15/22 and 16/23 as \u201cOf the hours you reported in question 14 [or 21], how many were designated for X?\u201d will likely prevent respondents from including more hours in items 15/22 and 16/23 combined than in item 14/21, a situation that would be difficult to interpret.\n\nAt the same time, UserWorks staff does NOT recommend forcing respondents to account for all the hours in item 14/21 when categorizing those hours in items 15/22 and 16/23, since participants felt some of their activities were not covered. Instead staff suggests adding a new question 17/24 at the end of the working conditions section if the resulting data would not be too cumbersome to handle:\n\nFor any hours you listed in question 14/21 that you did not account for in either question 15/22 or 16/23, please describe any additional professional activities and the number of hours you spent on them.\n\nActivity Number of hours\n\n_______\n\n____\n\n_______\n\n____\n\nRegardless of whether this additional item is added, staff proposes eliminating the most common source of time unaccounted for by changing question 15/22 b from \u201cscheduled school time for planning\u201d to phrasing that includes unscheduled time:\n\nb. School time spent planning, preparing, setting up or cleaning up \u2022 Include time spent on these activities during scheduled planning\nperiods, during lunch, from when you must arrive until the first students arrive, and from when students leave until you are free to leave.\n\nIf part b is to remain as is, a bullet point should be added to ensure that participants include this time regardless of how it is used:\n\n\fE-50 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nProblem a: Recommendation b:\n\nb. Scheduled school time for planning \u2022 Include any such time scheduled for you even you do not actually use it\nfor planning purposes\nIn that case, item 15/22c should be relabeled as 15/22d and a new item 15/22c under item 15/22b added:\nc. unscheduled official school time used for planning, preparing, setting up or cleaning up\n\u2022 Include time spent on these activities during lunch, from when you must arrive until the first students arrive, and from when students leave until you are free to leave.\nThe numerical relationship between sets of hours was unrecognized by panel B participants, misused by panel A participants, and unrepresentative of actual hours spent for all participants.\nPanel A participants seemed more aware of the relationship between hours in item 21 and those in items 22 and 23 than panel B participants were of that between those in item 14 and those in items 15 and 16, suggesting that the additional apple point clarifications in panel A were helpful. (Only one panel A participant seemed confused; this participant thought hours in item 22 should equal those in item 21.)\nIn panel B, nearly all participants listed more hours in 14 than in 15 and 16 combined. In panel A, many participants started down the same path, but because they more often realized the numbers should balance out, they altered numbers in question 23b to make the hours in questions 22 and 23 sum to those in question 21, and were reluctant to admit they might have left hours unaccounted for. When panel B participants were probed to describe any hours listed in item 14 not accounted for in items 15 and 16, they were able to account for all such hours as consisting of unscheduled time carved out either during lunch, right after their official day began, or right before their official day ended. Such time was sometimes used for planning and sometimes for creation, duplication, and disposal of materials for students\u2019 use.\nSome panel A participants also mentioned they took unscheduled planning time, suggesting that more panel A participants would have recognized the same discrepancy if they had not attempted to manipulate the numbers to create the impression of consistency. For instance, one panel A participant who taught kindergarten/childcare worked full-time but subtracted out hours children were engaged in naptime, eating, and playing. She said she had no scheduled planning time, though she tried to plan during naptime. If she had been offered the option of including unscheduled planning time, she probably would have accounted for naptime.\nIf variant schedules should be excluded, append to \u201cMOST RECENT FULL WEEK\u201d the phrase \u201cin which all classes were held for their standard duration.\u201d If variant schedules should be included, add an apple point for clarification: \u201cIf school was open all week but regularly scheduled classes were preempted or shortened, include that week.\u201d\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-51\n\nProblem b:\nRecommendation c: Problem c: Compounding problem:\n\nPanel B respondents were uncertain whether to classify as \u201cfull\u201d weeks in which school is open all week but class schedules are altered or certain classes are not held. These participants were uncertain how to classify weeks in which certain classes were preempted by emergencies (such as a teacher\u2019s funeral) or special occasions (such as holiday concerts and assemblies). When presented with a situation in which school is delayed two hours owing to icy roads but all classes are held for a shorter than normal duration, participants were not in agreement regarding whether to consider the week a \u201cfull\u201d week.\nIf respondents are not supposed to consider a typical week, add the wording \u201c(even if NOT typical)\u201d after \u201cMOST RECENT FULL WEEK.\u201d\nRespondents presume they are being asked to provide information on a typical week rather than the most recent full week.\nMost recent full weeks often ended as much as 4 or 5 weeks prior to the interview owing to Thanksgiving or Christmas holidays and snow days, so teachers could not recall details of those weeks.\nIt seems as though participants did notice the capitalized phrase appearing in each item. Participants read \u201cMOST RECENT FULL WEEK\u201d aloud, commented on it, and were probed on it. Yet they seemed to presume that the test makers were really interested in having them describe a typical week. One participant working in a nursery school with a number of part-time teachers noted that she had initially considered the word \u201cfull\u201d redundant in her situation, assuming that since she was a full-time worker, all of her weeks were full weeks. She had concentrated instead on her typical week.\nThe problem was certainly compounded by the fact that the interviews took place after winter holidays and weeks with snow days, so that it was difficult for participants to recall the most recent week in which school was open all week. Unable to recall a full week, many participants simply fell back on their schematization of their typical weeks. Others tried to imagine what the most recent week would have been like had it been more complete: \u201cSay I\u2019d had classes this Monday; then....\u201d\nHowever, even participants who had recently experienced a full week and could recall the details of their schedule were concerned that the schedule might not be sufficiently representative. Some panel A participants asked if they really needed to describe an actual week and if they could not just use a typical week instead. When probed, panel B participants invariably said \u201cfull\u201d meant to them \u201cnormal,\u201d \u201ctypical,\u201d or \u201cusual,\u201d never \u201ccomplete\u201d or \u201centire.\u201d The term \u201cfull week\u201d seemed to suggest that they should not describe an unusual or odd week any more than one that was incomplete. In several cases, during the most recent week in which the school remained open every day and/or all classes were held at their normal times for their full duration, the respondent\u2019s schedule was nevertheless not typical, either with regard to student activities (e.g., holiday pageants and parties) or noninstructional responsibilities (e.g., no bus duty, extra final exams to grade). In such cases, the participant assumed the Census Bureau would not be interested in knowing his or her hours that week and would prefer the respondent to consider a more typical week. In such cases,\n\n\fE-52 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nRecommendation e: Problem e:\nRecommendation f:\n\nrespondents appeared to interpret the phrase \u201cmost recent\u201d as merely words of encouragement to make the not insignificant task of categorizing their time seem easier: \u201cIf this seems hard, just think back to your most recent week.\u201d None entertained the notion that the Census Bureau might be interested in collecting a statistical sample of recent weeks including both normal weeks and outliers. Teachers whose weekly schedule alternated week-by-week or day-byday (\u201cblock schedules\u201d) attempted to average the hours of multiple equally typical weeks together. Those who did not have a regular schedule at all attempted to average the hours per week for each category over the entire school year. Though most gravitated toward the mode, the most common week in the year, one participant attempted to take a mean. If an activity averaged out to less than 1 hour per week over the entire year, that participant omitted such activities. A few made an effort to answer the question literally but then informed the interviewer that the data they were entering was not representative, that it provided a poor picture of their schedules, and that the wording of the questions should be changed so they could have the opportunity to enter more representative data.\nOnly one participant exploring the B panel, a music teacher from a school catering exclusively to the needs of severely disabled children, expressed no reservations about describing an unusual week, and her willingness to do so may have been motivated by an additional agenda. It was not that she felt she had no typical week or would have had to combine aspects of various weeks to arrive at a typical week. Rather, throughout the interview she had been making a point of how different her school, more like a hospital, was from normal schools and how certain questions did not apply to her. Having laughed repeatedly when responding to questions that seemed odd in the context of her school situation, she seemed to believe that the division of hours she could provide by describing an unusual week would help illustrate how different her school was from the norm.\nChange wording of 16a apple point to \u201cIncluding paid or unpaid coaching, acting as a club sponsor, etc.\u201d\nParticipants were confused as to where to put paid time outside school hours.\nA couple of participants were unsure whether they should include paid coaching time in 16a, since 16 appeared to describe unofficial activities and time spent voluntarily. One participant left this time out of both 15 and 16 since he considered it a kind of officially scheduled, compensated overtime but not a \u201cscheduled administrative duty\u201d as described in 15c.\nWhile there may be no way to remedy this problem short of adopting a different classification system for the hours, be aware that participants simply estimated hours for these tasks based on what seemed reasonable and sometimes had little confidence in their answers. If this is a real concern, one might want to add an item 15d asking respondents how many of the hours they listed in 15, if any other than lesson planning, were spent on activities that were continued outside of official school hours.\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-53\n\nRecommendation g:\nRecommendation g: Problem g: Observations:\n\nA place to put unscheduled planning during official school hours would also be helpful. 15c is not appropriate, since planning lessons is a professional task, not an \u201cadministrative\u201d one, since unscheduled planning is not a \u201cscheduled duty,\u201d and since professional tasks are more akin to responsibilities than \u201cduties.\u201d\nParticipants had difficulty estimating and assigning hours spent on certain activities which extended across official school hours into part of the day or evening outside those hours; it was not an important distinction in their lives.\nWhen asked how they would classify hours in hypothetical Friday afternoons entirely devoted to planning, participants were unanimous in deciding the answer hinged on \u201cwhen they were allowed to go home.\u201d However, understanding a theoretical distinction is not all that is required to attend to that distinction in one\u2019s own life.\nAs salaried, overtime-exempt professionals who were hired expecting to work greater than 40-hour weeks, participants had little incentive to track their hours. They therefore had difficulty judging how many hours were spent on activities such as faculty meetings, parent conferences, and field trips that straddled the boundary between official school hours and other hours. Unaccustomed as they were to tracking their hours, they did not stop in the middle of an activity to note that they had just gone \u201coff the clock.\u201d It seemed to them ridiculous that they should be asked to recall when during a meeting the school bell rang.\nAll participants experienced difficulty estimating hours if they engaged in activities that straddled the official/unofficial time boundary, but one participant counted the same hours in two categories to indicate that the distinction was meaningless. She did not receive any scheduled planning time, so she carved out official time during student naptime for some of her planning and stayed after school for additional planning. Not seeing a place for unscheduled planning during official hours, she did not attempt to divide her 5 planning hours between 15b (scheduled planning in official hours) and 16b (unscheduled planning during unofficial hours) but wrote the same 5 hours in both 15b and 16b to indicate that for her the only time that was scheduled for planning was her own discretionary time, that in her mind they were essentially equivalent.\nIncluding an instruction to round answers to the nearest whole hour.\nParticipants wrote in partial hours using fractions or decimals.\nOne participant wondered how to record field trips that take place during school hours.\nOne participant asked, \u201cIf parent conferences occur during school hours, where is that time recorded?\u201d\nSeveral participants remarked that their time at school they consider schoolrelated activities, even if they stay well into the evening. Is there a need to clarify activities on school grounds outside of contract hours versus all other activities regardless of location? One participant suggested that where teachers spend their time is also important to ask.\n\n\fE-54 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nWhile two participants overlooked the apple points, several commented about them, saying on the one hand, there was a lot of detail to consider, but also that teachers should be alerted to read the question and examples carefully. In order to correctly answer the questions, it is important to read the answer points, too; they are more than just tips.\n\nVI. Professional Development: Panel B, Items 3\u20134\n\nThis section asks about various professional development activities and their impact.\n\nQuestion 3:\n\nIn the past 12 MONTHS, did you participate in any of the following professional development activities?\n\nQuestion 3a:\n\nUniversity course(s) taken towards recertification or advanced certification in your MAIN teaching assignment field\n\nExclude courses taken for your initial certification in your main teaching assignment field or other teaching field(s).\n__| Yes \u00ce How many? __|__| __| No\n\nRecommendation a1: Clarify what to do with courses currently in progress.\n\nProblem a1:\n\nMust classes be completed? A participant had registered for and begun a course and wanted to know if she could include it.\n\nRecommendation a2: Specify whether to include general education courses:\n\n\u2022 \u201cInclude both general education courses and specialty area courses\u201d\n\nProblem a2:\n\nMain teaching assignment field unclear regarding inclusion of educational methods courses. Participants with a specialization who taught one or more subjects in a middle school or high school could not tell if general education courses should be considered in their main teaching assignment field. Regardless of their major, they did not view their subject areas as simply \u201cmath\u201d or \u201chistory\u201d but as \u201cmath education\u201d or \u201chistory education,\u201d since what they were assigned to do was not to know, write about, or expound upon math or history but to teach it well. The issue may become more pronounced when questions from panel A are introduced, since teachers who describe themselves as education majors may tend to assume they need to include courses in education while those who have majored in subject areas may assume they should not.\n\nRecommendations a3:\n\nDefine the cumbersome phrase main teaching assignment field, but retain it. Most participants\u2019 suggestions for alternative nomenclature such as \u201cdiscipline\u201d or \u201carea of specialization\u201d might be confused with educational or certification specialty rather than teaching specialty.\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-55\n\nAlternatively, for clarity, adopt a participant\u2019s suggestion to ask instead:\n\n\u201cIn the last 12 months what courses have you taken for recertification or advanced certification in the subject or subjects that you are primarily teaching now?\u201d\n\nunless the item is to include courses for recertification or advanced certification in subjects they are NOT currently teaching.\n\nRegardless, provide guidance on how to determine main teaching assignment field for teachers who divide their course time equally among subjects or teach all subjects.\n\nProblem a3:\n\nCertain populations had trouble determining the main teaching assignment field. Preschool teachers, elementary school teachers, and others who taught multiple subjects were not sure what their main teaching assignment field was, and unlike panel A, panel B did not offer a definition such as \u201cthe field in which you teach the most courses.\u201d Even had they been given such a definition, teachers in this group would have had difficulty deciding which courses were relevant, since many taught all subjects, dividing their time equally among them, and thus felt that any course related to education could be considered to be in their main teaching assignment field. This was also the case for a special education teacher without a specialty area, and even for a high school English teacher, who felt almost anything can be related to English or taught in English class through literature.\n\nRecommendation a4: Consider rephrasing as \u201cuniversity or college course(s)\u201d or \u201cgraduate courses,\u201d whichever is appropriate.\n\nProblem a4:\n\nOne participant was not sure if university courses included courses taken at a small college. Another suggested \u201cgraduate\u201d courses to distinguish them from undergraduate courses. However, most participants probed on the issue assumed that college and online courses should be included.\n\nQuestion 3b:\n\nUniversity course(s) in your MAIN teaching assignment field\n\n\u2022 Exclude courses taken for recertification or advanced certification.\n__| Yes \u00ce How many? __|__| __| No\n\nRecommendation b:\n\nReverse the order of items 3a and 3b, but promote the apple point in 3b into the main instruction so it is not overlooked as supplemental:\n\n\u201cUniversity course(s) in your MAIN teaching assignment field that were NOT taken for recertification or advanced certification.\u201d\n\nAdd an apple point saying:\n\n\u2022 \u201cIf you are a new teacher, include courses taken towards your initial certification.\u201d\n\n\fE-56 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nAlternatively, keep the existing apple point but make the item emphasize initial certification:\n\n\u201cUniversity course(s) in your MAIN teaching assignment field taken for your initial certification.\u201d\n\nAdd an apple point:\n\n\u2022 \u201cIf you were not initially certified in the last 12 months, your answer may be \u2018No.\u2019\u201d\n\nProblem b:\n\nQuestion order is confusing. The current ordering is admirably consistent with usability principles. Since the number of first-year teachers is a small proportion of the teaching population, teachers are more likely to have taken courses for recertification or advanced certification than for initial certification in the last 12 months, and teachers who have taken courses for more than one certification in the last 12 months will be rare indeed. It thus makes sense to put respondents at ease by asking first about the more common situation and follow with a question about the less common situation.\n\nHowever, the ordering of the questions conflicts with the chronological ordering in respondents\u2019 mental models of their educational experience. Some participants were confused by the fact that they were being asked first in \u201ca\u201d about continuing education and then in \u201cb\u201d about their initial or basic education. They thought that questions about initial education should come first and that therefore they may have misread something.\n\nAnother participant thought it odd that the first item, 3a, should only be concerned about something so specific as advanced certification when some teachers, himself included, just like to take courses to improve their knowledge, not because they are required.\n\nQuestion 3c:\n\nObservational visits to other schools\n__| Yes \u00ce How many? __|__| __| No\n\nQuestion 3d:\n\nPresenting at workshops, conferences, or trainings\n__| Yes \u00ce How many? __|__| __| No\n\nQuestion 3e:\n\nAttending other workshops, conferences, or trainings\n\nExclude conferences in which you were a presenter\n__| Yes \u00ce How many? __|__| __| No\n\nRecommendation e1: Reword apple point as \u201cexclude entirely\u2026\u201d or \u201cexclude entire conferences....\u201d\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-57\n\nProblem e1:\n\nOverlap between d and e is still possible. A participant said he would have counted a conference in both d and e if he presented on only 1 day of the event and attended on the remaining days.\n\nRecommendation e2: Specify in an apple point whether to include informal training during meetings, in-service courses, etc.:\n\n\u2022 \u201cInclude/exclude \u201cin-service\u201d presentations at your own school.\u201d\n\nProblem e2:\n\nConfusion exists over whether to include workshops in their own school (inservice days) or trainings conducted at faculty meetings. Several participants initially assumed a narrow definition of professional development as courses or workshops, but when they got down to items 3f through 3j and realized that simply talking to a colleague could be considered professional development, they wondered if less formal training conducted as part of an administrative meeting would count in item 3d or 3e.\n\nQuestion 3f:\n\nIndividual or collaborative research on a topic of interest to you professionally\n\n__| Yes __| No\n\nRecommendation f: If the definition of \u201cresearch\u201d matters, pick and choose how to restrict:\n\n\u2022 \u201cInclude/exclude finding information or articles for students in your classes; personal experiences you discuss in class; formal research on educational methods mandated by school system or coursework, etc.\u201d\n\nObservation f:\n\nDefinitions of \u201cresearch\u201d and \u201ctopic of interest to you professionally\u201d differ widely. Research might be anything from looking up students\u2019 test scores to browsing the Internet in order to find an article for students to read to conducting library research to prepare a paper for presentation at a teachers\u2019 conference. When probed, some indicated they did several types of research but had initially thought only one type should be included. Others thought the only type of research they performed should not be included.\n\nFor some, a topic of professional interest would have to be a topic in education such as how to improve scores on a certain skill or how to help students with a certain disorder. For others, a topic of professional interest could be one\u2019s own trip to Europe, since it could motivate class discussion.\n\nQuestion 3g:\n\nRegularly-scheduled collaboration with other teachers on issues of instruction\n\n\u2022 Exclude administrative meetings\n\n__| Yes __| No\n\n\fE-58 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nRecommendation g: Problem g:\nQuestion 3h: Observations h:\nQuestion 3i: Recommendation i:\n\nDefine \u201cadministrative meetings\u201d or replace it with a clearer term like \u201cfaculty meetings\u201d if appropriate.\nResponse may depend on interpretation of \u201cadministrative meetings.\u201d A participant who interpreted \u201cadministrative meetings\u201d as meetings that dealt with clerical or bureaucratic matters, issues other than curriculum and instruction (for instance, software for taking attendance), answered \u201cYes\u201d since such collaboration often happened at faculty meetings.\nParticipants who interpreted \u201cadministrative meetings\u201d as meetings with the administration of one\u2019s department, hence faculty meetings, answered \u201cNo,\u201d since it would be unusual to regularly schedule meetings that would exclude the department chair or team leader.\nBoth participants collaborated with other teachers on the same types of issues, but each offered a different answer. Other teachers also wondered what types of meetings were to be excluded, but were able to decide on an answer based on other contacts with colleagues.\nDiagnosing individual students with other teachers (e.g., discussing specific students and arranging appropriate help)\n__| Yes __| No\nSeveral participants noted that though they tried to identify problems, not just discuss them, they were technically unqualified to offer medical diagnoses and that to do so might anger parents and get the teacher in trouble. They nevertheless marked \u201cyes\u201d since they did \u201cdiscuss students and arrange for help.\u201d Most were comfortable with the wording \u201cdiagnosing individual students,\u201d interpreting it as restricted to the activities suggested in the parentheses.\nOne participant suggested \u201cdiagnosing\u201d implied there is something wrong with the student and suggested more neutral terms such as \u201cdiscussing individual students\u2019 problems with other teachers or colleagues.\u201d \u201cEvaluating\u201d is not recommended, since it has misleading connotations of assessment.\nObserving or being observed by other teachers in your classroom (for at least 10 or 15 minutes at a time)\n__| Yes __| No\nReword to force readers to read about the time stipulation before the sentence ends:\n\u201cObserving or being observed for at least 10 or 15 minutes at a time by the other teachers in your classroom\u201d\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-59\n\nProblem i: Observation i: Question 3j: Observation j:\nRecommendation j: Problem j: Question 4a:\nQuestion 4a(1):\nQuestion 4a(2):\n\nParenthetical instructions are overlooked. Participants failed to read the 10- to 15-minute minimum and asked if they should include other teachers \u201cpopping in and out\u201d of the classroom.\n\nOne participant\u2019s answer should not be taken as representing the policies for other teachers at his school or department because department heads are sometimes required to observe and mentor, while others at the school are not.\n\nActing as a coach or mentor to other teachers or staff in your school, or receiving coaching or mentoring\n\n__| Yes __| No\n\nParticipants appreciated the distinction between item 3i and 3j, since observing or being observed by other teachers did not necessarily mean they offered each other advice afterwards. Teachers are apparently protective of their own autonomy in the classroom and reluctant to be perceived as telling each other how to teach. The distinction is particularly relevant for teachers who share a room and cannot help observing each other.\n\nAdd an apple point instructing readers on whether to include or exclude student teachers or say \u201cteachers or teachers to be\u201d if they are to be included.\n\nThere is uncertainty regarding student teachers. In several cases, inclusion of student teachers would change \u201cno\u201d answers to \u201cyes\u201d answers in this item and in 3i. However, teachers were hesitant to apply the item to student teachers, particularly for item 3j, since student teachers are not staff.\n\nIn the past 12 months, have you participated in any professional development activities that focused on in-depth study of the content in your MAIN teaching assignment field?\n\n__| Yes __| No \u00ce Go to item 4b below.\n\nIn the past 12 months, how many hours did you spend on these activities?\n\n\u2022 Mark (X) only one box.\n\n__| 8 hours or less __| 8\u201316 hours __| 17\u201332 hours __| 33 hours or more\n\nOverall, how useful were these activities to you?\n\nNot useful __|\n\nSomewhat useful __|\n\nUseful __|\n\nVery useful __|\n\n\fE-60 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nRecommendation a1:\n\nConsider restating \u201cfocused on in-depth study of your main teaching assignment field\u201d as \u201c\u2026focused on your main teaching assignment field and directed at teachers with some knowledge and experience\u201d if that is what \u201cin-depth study\u201d is intended to mean. Or, if the issue is not to include general training applicable to multiple fields, it might be appropriate to say \u201c\u2026specific to and concentrating on the subject(s) you primarily teach.\u201d\n\nProblem a1:\n\nThere was disagreement over hours that qualify as \u201cin-depth study.\u201d Participants generally gathered that the phrase \u201cin-depth\u201d was meant to exclude casual overviews of material they had already learned in their initial courses in their fields, but this was by no means the unanimous view.\n\nOne participant said he would not consider attending a useful conference on the latest teaching methodologies in his field to be \u201cin-depth\u201d unless it had forced him to do some work (e.g., to memorize statistics supporting the method or to study the classroom materials used).\n\nAnother participant could not see how a course of 8 hours or less could be \u201cindepth,\u201d since such a course probably would not require research and writing a paper. Another was even more vehement, saying one would have to take a sabbatical to do any \u201cin depth study,\u201d that in-service courses never go into much depth. However, this opinion was balanced by that of another who believed the typical half-day (4-hour) in-service courses are generally intensive and \u201ccover a lot of ground.\u201d\n\nAn additional participant, thinking of faculty meetings as professional development, said \u201cin-depth study\u201d would be impossible in her English department because they would all have to read the same work of literature and discuss it together at school, and no one would have time for this.\n\nRecommendation a2:\n\nWhen panel A and panel B are combined, participants hopefully will recall the definition of main teaching assignment field from panel A and apply it here. However, as described in item 3a, the definition could be expanded to address teachers with multiple assignments of equal emphasis.\n\nProblem a2:\n\nParticipants had difficulty identifying \u201cMAIN teaching assignment field.\u201d Some participants found the term main teaching assignment field confusing and would have preferred something simpler like \u201cyour specific area of teaching,\u201d but this wording would not have gotten at the issues of primary field or the field assigned regardless of what they like to teach, so UserWorks staff cannot support the proposed change.\n\nOthers were pulled in different directions by the term. A special education music teacher considered herself primarily a music teacher because everyone else in her school also taught special education, as this was a school for severely learning disabled and physically disabled students.\n\n\fAppendix E.

Change wording to one of the following:\n\n\u2022 \u201c\u2026that focused on educational software students can use to explore concepts on computers\u201d;\n\u2022 \u201c\u2026that focused on teaching students how to use a computer\u201d; or \u2022 \u201c\u2026that focused on preparing lessons, presenting material, calculating\ngrades, etc. using computers.\u201d\n\nParticipants focus on \u201ccomputers\u201d and stop reading. Some participants miss the final phrase \u201cfor instruction\u201d and include instruction in computers for their own use, for instance, to write lesson plans or calculate students\u2019 grades.\n\nMany have been trained in using computers several years ago, but the presumption now is that teachers are computer literate, and many school systems do not have the funds to purchase new software or connect classroom computers to the Internet. As a result, some teachers have little opportunity or incentive to take these courses.\n\nIn the past 12 months, have you participated in any professional development activities that focused on reading instruction?\n\n__| Yes __| No \u00ce Go to item 4d below.\n\n\fE-62 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nQuestion 4c(1):\nQuestion 4c(2): Observation: Question 4d: Question 4d(1):\nQuestion 4d(2): Recommendation: Question 4e:\n\nIn the past 12 months, how many hours did you spend on these activities?\n\n\u2022 Mark (X) only one box.\n\n__| 8 hours or less __| 8\u201316 hours __| 17\u201332 hours __| 33 hours or more\n\nOverall, how useful were these activities to you?\n\nNot useful __|\n\nSomewhat useful __|\n\nUseful __|\n\nVery useful __|\n\nSeveral school systems are now requiring courses in reading instruction of all teachers.

Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-63\n\nRecommendation e: Problem e:\nQuestion 4 overall: Recommendation f:\nProblem f:\nRecommendation g: Problem g: Recommendation h: Problem h:\n\nMove \u201cnot included in 4a\u20134d above\u201d directly after the words \u201cprofessional development activities.\u201d\nConfusion regarding \u201cother topics\u201d vs. \u201cother courses\u201d leads to overlap with courses listed in item 4a. Participants who taught lower grades and had taken general education or subject matter courses which they considered part of their main teaching assignment field but with a different emphasis listed the putative topics of these courses in item 4e. For instance, a kindergarten teacher whose specialty was general education specified \u201cscience\u201d in item 4e for a science education course she had listed in item 4a. An elementary school teacher specified \u201cassessment\u201d for a course in evaluation and testing she had also listed in item 4a.\nSpecify what activities should or should not be included or be more specific (say \u201cin-service courses\u201d in place of \u201cprofessional development activities\u201d). If faculty meetings are a separate issue but also of interest, add a separate question such as \u201cHas your staff gotten together to discuss....\u201d\nAlternatively, under the first reference to \u201cprofessional development activities,\u201d specify with an apple point:\n\u2022 \u201cInclude/exclude in-service courses, faculty meetings, presentations you gave yourself....\u201d\nThere was uncertainty as to what activities are included in \u201cprofessional development activities.\u201d Since the preceding question 3 suggested a pretty broad definition of professional development, participants were not sure whether to include hours spent in university rather than in-service courses, in faculty meetings during which the issues mentioned in items 4a\u20134d arose spontaneously, in informal private meetings discussing these issues with other teachers, or even reading about these issues on their own.\nSince UserWorks staff did not probe participants on this issue, staff is not sure how important it is, but it might be helpful to provide examples of activities that should or should not be included in calculating hours.\nThere is some uncertainty regarding whether to include supplemental enrichment and applications of training. Two participants mentioned they were unclear on whether the range of hours they selected for a given professional development activity should include time spent outside of the class on homework or trying out the course\u2019s teaching suggestions on their own students.\nIf they should not have double listed their training, participants need to be informed of this, or main teaching assignment field needs to be described in more detail.\nOverlap exists in course listings among item 4a and 4b or 4c. Participants whose main field involved computers or special education included the same hours twice in 4a and 4b or 4c. This was more common for teachers of the lower grades, who considered anything education-related to belong in item 4a.\n\n\fE-64 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nRecommendation i:\n\nIndicate if training sessions, which the participant herself taught, are to be excluded.\n\nProblem i:\n\nShould \u201cparticipated in\u201d include \u201ctaught\u201d? One participant had taught courses on computers and wondered if she should include them in her hours of professional development.\n\nObservation a:\n\nThis section was one of several areas where it would have been helpful if participants had been asked to have their records or transcripts available in advance.\n\nObservation b:\n\nInterpretation of \u201chow many hours did you spend on\u201d varied. Participants seemed to interpret hours as clock hours, not course credit hours. For instance, a participant said she would put the number of hours she attended classes, not the number of hours listed in a course catalog. If that question is also an issue, it might be better put \u201chow many course hours did you take of....\u201d\n\nObservation c:\n\nHours as a unit of measurement varied. Most in-service courses are half-day or day courses, so participants thought more in terms of days of development than in hours.\n\nRecommendation d:\n\nExtend \u201cOverall, how useful were these activities to you?\u201d with \u201c\u2026in your current situation\u201d or \u201cpotentially.\u201d\n\nObservations d:\n\nThere was variation in the definition of potential vs. actual \u201cusefulness.\u201d Most participants determined the degree of \u201cusefulness\u201d based largely on how much of the activity could be successfully applied to their own classroom. However, one participant mentioned that she could see the value in some development courses (on behavior problems) but could not apply them to her own students (who were high-achieving and well behaved). She seemed to want to separate usefulness to the teaching profession from applicability to her class. Another respondent said she had taken a course that was potentially useful but had rated it \u201cnot useful\u201d because it was too short and she had not followed up on obtaining more training in that area.\n\nVII. Resources and Assessment of Students: Panel B, Items 5\u201313\n\nThis set of questions asks about different types of students, the resources provided for teaching them, and participants\u2019 use of student assessment scores.\n\nQuestion 5:\n\nAre students assigned to your classes on the basis of achievement or ability level?\n\n__| Yes __| No\n\nRecommendation a:\n\nAdd \u201cin some cases, specify:___\u201d OR Ask \u201care most of your students\u2026\u201d or \u201care some of your students\u2026\u201d OR Provide answer options like \u201csome classes\u201d and \u201cmost classes\u201d\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-65\n\nProblem a: Recommendation b: Problem b: Recommendation c: Problem c: Recommendation d: Problem d: Question 6:\nRecommendation a: Problem a: Recommendation b:\nProblem b:\n\nNo intermediate answer options. Participants who taught advanced placement or remedial classes as well as classes of mixed abilities did not know whether to answer yes or no.\nRephrase as \u201cIs either achievement or ability level a basis for how students are assigned to your classes?\u201d\nSeveral participants insisted that this was an either/or question, so they could not understand why the answer options were \u201cyes/no\u201d rather than \u201cachievement/ability.\u201d\nAdd \u201cDo not know\u201d option.\nSome participants did not know on what basis students were assigned to them.\nIndicate assignment \u201cby teachers\u201d and/or \u201cguidance counselors\u201d or \u201cadministrators\u201d if important.\nPassive voice does not clarify who must do the assigning. In one school, students assign themselves to harder or easier classes based on how hard they want to work and what they think they can handle. The participant decided they were technically grouped as described in question 5 but was not certain.\nDo you use different groupings of students in your classroom to teach students who learn at different rates?\n__| Yes __| No\nAdd \u201cin some situations, specify:___\u201d OR ask \u201cdo you ever...\u201d or \u201cdo you at least sometimes...\u201d OR provide answer options such as \u201coften\u201d and \u201cinfrequently.\u201d\nNo intermediate answer options. Some participants grouped students by ability for special activities but normally did not group students or grouped them on some other criteria such as age in preschool.\nRephrase to clarify emphasis, either:\n\u201cWhen grouping students, do you select students who can all learn at the same rate to be in a particular group?\u201d\nOR\n\u201cWhen grouping students, do you mix students who learn at different rates in the same group?\u201d\nHomogeneous or heterogeneous rates are not specified. Some participants grouped students into high, middle, and low groups by reading ability; others mixed students of various ability levels in the same group to help each other learn; it was not clear which of these options was being asked about.\n\n\fE-66 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nRecommendation c:\n\nAdd \u201cN/A\u201d option or distinguish possible \u201cno\u201d responses; that is, \u201cNo, I do not group my students for this purpose\u201d from \u201cNo, I do not divide my students into groups.\u201d\n\nProblem c:\n\nThose who do not use grouping may prefer answering \u201cN/A.\u201d Group instruction is not appropriate for certain curricula. A \u201cno\u201d answer presupposes teachers group students in other ways or for purposes other than instructing learners at different learning rates.\n\nQuestion 7a:\n\nOf all the students you teach at this school, how many have an Individual Education Plan (IEP) because they have disabilities or are special education students?\n\n__|__|__| Students __| None \u00ce Go to item 8 below.\n\nRecommendation a1:\n\nIf accuracy is important, request a percentage to the best of their knowledge rather than relying on an exact number or permit them to opt out by checking \u201cInformation not available.\u201d\n\nProblem a1:\n\nInformation is not available to all teachers. Some teachers did not know the number of students but could estimate a percentage based on the likelihood that certain students would have an IEP. Some could obtain this information through a colleague. Others would have had to conduct name-by-name research in a lengthy database or did not know where to start. Since most teachers had only a few IEP students, a difference of one student may be statistically significant.\n\nObservation:\n\nAt least one participant entered single zeroes in the two leftmost boxes before a single digit response here and in question 9a.\n\nRecommendation a2: Insert the word \u201ccurrently\u201d between \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cteach.\u201d\n\nProblem a2:\n\nA participant considered more than her current year\u2019s students in answering this question.\n\nQuestion 7b:\n\nDo you or these students receive the following types of support in your classroom?\n\nQuestion 7b(1):\n\nSpecial aide or personal assistant\n\n__| Yes __| No\n\nRecommendation b1: Redundantly append \u201ceither for you, your classroom, or for individual students\u201d to the current wording.\n\nProblem b1:\n\nA couple participants were not sure if the aide was for the teacher or for an individual disabled student.\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-67\n\nRecommendation b2:\n\nRevise wording to read, \u201csupport at various times in your classroom.\u201d Do not remove \u201cin your classroom,\u201d since it is necessary to distinguish this type of support from external support.\n\nProblem b2:\n\nTwo participants could not relate students\u2019 personal aides or assistants to the phrase \u201cin your classroom.\u201d They thought they might have the wrong concept of aide or assistant since a student aide would presumably follow the student around the school and not stay in the teacher\u2019s classroom longer than one period.\n\nQuestion 7b(2):\n\nConsulting/itinerant teacher\n\n__| Yes __| No\n\nRecommendation b3: Use a term more familiar to teachers, perhaps \u201cspecial education resource teacher\u201d if that title corresponds to the job function intended here.\n\nProblem b3:\n\nSome participants were not sure what sort of teacher this was. There was general agreement that this person would have more special education training than an aide and would advise the teacher on individual students but not work directly with individual students. However, some did not know what \u201citinerant\u201d meant and those that did thought the teacher referred to here might be an outside expert consultant who would not necessarily be physically present \u201cin the classroom.\u201d\n\nOne participant wondered if he should count himself, since he only had himself with which to consult. A special education teacher thought the question might not apply to her because she was already special education teacher, though not necessarily the official \u201cresource\u201d teacher (department head), and hence would never have another such teacher assigned to her.\n\nQuestion 7b(3):\n\nAccommodations such as more time on tests or a behavioral management plan\n\n__| Yes __| No\n\nObservation a:\n\n\u201cIEP\u201d is not a term that can be used to describe all special education students. A participant had Section 504 students who required special accommodations but did not have individual education plans.\n\nObservation b:\n\nA participant noted that (1) through (3) do not seem to include counseling services for emotionally disturbed students.\n\nQuestion 8:\n\nIn the last 3 years, have you had 8 hours or more of training or professional development on how to teach special education students?\n\n__| Yes __| No\n\n\fE-68 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nObservation: Question 9:\nRecommendation: Problem: Observations:\nQuestion 10: Question 11:\n\nTeachers who have not had this training recently or are highly experienced and have not had training in a long time feel this question and question 10 suggest their knowledge is out-of-date and that they are less qualified than someone with more recent training. They do not believe training changes that much in 3 years.\nOf all students you teach at this school, how many are of limited English proficiency?\n(Students of limited English proficiency are those whose native or dominant language is other than English, and who have sufficient difficulty speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English language as to deny them the opportunity to learn successfully in an English-speaking-only classroom.)\n__|__|__| Students __| None \u00ce Go to item 11 below.\n(Same problem/recommendation as for item 7.) If accuracy is important, request a percentage to the best of their knowledge rather than relying on an exact number.\nInformation is not available to all teachers. Some teachers did not know the number of students but could estimate a percentage based on the likelihood that certain students would have be of limited English proficiency. Some could obtain this information through a colleague. Others would have had to conduct name-by-name research in a lengthy database or did not know where to start. Since most teachers had only a few LEP students, a difference of one student may be statistically significant.\nOne participant missed the phrase \u201cnative or dominant\u201d and did not know whether to include her students born in the U.S.A. who spoke another language at home. It may be worth making \u201cnative or dominant\u201d appear more prominent.\nTwo participants mentioned having non-native students with reading or writing problems in English (foreign sounding syntax or idioms) who had no trouble learning or communicating in her English-only class. They seemed to treat verbal and written skills as separate issues and may not have read the parenthetical description closely. One wanted separate questions for each.\nIn the last 3 years, have you had 8 hours or more of training or professional development on how to teach students with limited English proficiency?\n__| Yes __| No\nDo you receive your students\u2019 scores on state or local achievement tests?\n__| Yes __| No \u00ce Go to item 13 below.\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-69\n\nRecommendation a: Problem a:\nRecommendation b: Problem b: Recommendation c: Problem c:\nQuestion 12: Question 12a:\nQuestion 12b:\n\nRephrase: \u201cDo you have access to your students\u2019 scores on state or local achievement tests?\u201d Add answer options \u201csometimes\u201d or \u201cwhen possible.\u201d\n\nThis presupposes that scores are available to be received. Some teachers do not receive the scores but can look them up should they wish to review them. Some receive last year\u2019s scores for the current year\u2019s students, particularly if there is no test in their students\u2019 current grade level. If a student was not in that school the previous year, their scores may not be available. This is apparently a problem in an inner-city neighborhood school but might be true of affluent transients as well. An ESOL teacher who does not have her own classroom and who works with students throughout the school wondered to which students and scores the question was referring. If she had access to the scores, she certainly would not receive them together in a single package.\n\nRephrase: \u201cIf your students take state or local achievement tests, do you receive (have access to) their scores?\u201d Add \u201cNot Applicable\u201d to answer choices. Remove the question from the private school survey or ask about standardized national tests.\n\nThis presupposes of existence of tests. Certain teachers (e.g., special education or kindergarten) cannot receive their students\u2019 scores because their students do not take them.\n\nAppend \u201c, NOT national standardized tests\u201d to the question if this is an issue. Alternatively, first ask \u201cDo your students take state or local achievement tests?\u201d and add an apple point:\n\n\u2022 \u201cDo not include national standardized tests such as....\u201d\n\nMistaking national private standardized tests for state or local achievement tests. Certain state and local achievement tests are sent to the county for internal verification that students are meeting standards but are not published to any statistical abstract or made available to teachers. Particularly if teachers did not have access to these tests, or if their district offered no such tests, they often mentioned national achievement tests by name and answered the question with regard to those.\n\nTo what extent do you use the information from your students\u2019 test scores:\n\nTo group students into different instructional groups by achievement or ability?\n\n\u2022 Mark (X) one box on each line.\n\n(For each question, participant could select:)\n\nNot at all __|\n\nTo a small extent __|\n\nTo a moderate extent To a great extent\n\n__|\n\n__|\n\nTo assess areas where you need to strengthen your content knowledge or teaching practice?\n\n\fE-70 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nQuestion 12c:\n\nTo adjust your curriculum in areas where your students encountered problems?\n\nRecommendation c1:\n\nIf item 12 is intended to measure or may be interpreted as indicating to what degree teachers value the tests, remove a source of error in 12b and c by asking the questions:\n\n\u201cIf you have access to students\u2019 state or district achievement test scores, are these scores presented in a form you can use?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre they available when you can use them?\u201d\n\n(answer choices: Yes/No/not applicable)\n\nPlace the questions between items 11 and 12.\n\nProblem c1:\n\nThis presupposes a usable and timely format. Participants thought marking \u201cnot at all\u201d or \u201cto a small extent\u201d suggested they did not respect the test content, when in fact the scores may not have been in a form they could use. If they receive aggregate scores, either for the class or the grade level as a whole, they cannot determine needs of individual students. If the scores summarize performance on general areas of the exam like \u201cverbal\u201d and \u201cmath,\u201d they do not know what skill areas they need to improve. If they receive item-by-item or skill-by-skill results but do not receive the actual test forms, they may have difficulty identifying students\u2019 deficiencies. One participant said teachers in his school receive scores at the end of the school year when there is no longer an opportunity to make use of them.\n\nRecommendation c3: Reiterate that it is state and local test scores that are at issue in item 12.\n\nProblem c2:\n\nIt was not obvious that only state and local achievement tests are being discussed in this question.\n\nRecommendation c3:\n\nIf the question must be separated out ask, \u201cIs the content of students\u2019 state and local achievement tests relevant to the courses you teach?\u201d and offer a \u201cdo not know\u201d answer option.\n\nProblem c3:\n\nThere is a presupposition of usable content in standardized tests. Standardized tests are often in basic skills like reading and arithmetic and may not relate to the curriculum of a specialist in a field like history or biology. Even a literature teacher may have little use for reading scores, since her classes may involve interpretation, not just comprehension.\n\nQuestion 13:\n\nTo what extent do you use state or district standards to guide your instructional practice in your main teaching assignment field?\n\nRecommendation a:\n\nAsk instead, \u201cHow big of a role do district standards play in guiding your instructional practice,\u201d or \u201cTo what extent do you cover state or district standards in your instructional practice\u2026,\u201d whichever applies.\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-71\n\nProblem a:\n\nDoes \u201cextent\u201d of \u201cguid[ance]\u201d refer to completeness of coverage of standards or to significance of standards relative to teacher\u2019s entire curriculum? A participant said she was able to cover all the standards without giving them a central place in her teaching. She checked \u201cto a moderate extent\u201d since she emphasized other things.\n\nRecommendation b:\n\nIf important for drawing inferences from question 13, additionally ask how easy it is to apply state or district standards to one\u2019s instructional practice.\n\nProblem b:\n\nThere is a presupposition of usable standards. An ESOL teacher had encountered different district standards for each student depending on their English proficiency, so it was not easy for her to use them as a general guide to teaching ESOL. Another teacher also said each student\u2019s IEP was the standard for that student.\n\nA science teacher wanted to comply with standards but could not do so owing to factors beyond his control like funding for materials.\n\nObservations:\n\nParticipants had reasons for using standards as a guide that did not necessarily reflect a positive opinion of the standards. Some participants were required to comply. One said she complied primarily in order to have externally generated objective benchmarks for performance regardless of their quality.\n\nUnlike state achievement tests, state or at least multiple state (\u201cMiddle States\u201d) standards may indeed apply to private schools, since, according to one private school teacher, compliance with such standards is required for accreditation and for compatibility with public university entrance requirements.\n\nVIII. Attitudes and Opinions: Panel B, Item 17\n\nThis section asks about participants\u2019 influence on staffing, budgeting and instructional policies, and their perceptions of various issues about teaching.\n\nQuestion 17:\n\nDo you agree or disagree with each of the following statements?\n\n\u2022 Mark (X) one box on each line.\n\n(For each question, participant could select:)\n\nStrongly agree Somewhat agree\n\n__|\n\n__|\n\nSomewhat disagree Strongly disagree\n\n__|\n\n__|\n\nObservation:\n\nAlthough participants sometimes wished they had the opportunity to display neutrality, most recognized the survey\u2019s need to obtain an opinion on every point. Several who felt neutral about an item said that if a \u201cneutral\u201d option were actually offered they might be tempted to overuse it on items with which they had no strong feelings.\n\n\fE-72 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nQuestion 17a:\n\nMost of my colleagues share my beliefs and values about what the central mission of the school should be.\n\nObservation:\n\nA participant said many of her colleagues have not been there long enough to get a sense of the mission, so her disagreement has nothing to do with differences of opinion (beliefs and values), though it might have to do with poor communication of the mission by administrators and staff.\n\nQuestion 17b:\n\nThe principal knows what kind of school he/she wants and has communicated it to the staff.\n\nQuestion 17c:\n\nThere is a great deal of cooperative effort among the staff members.\n\nQuestion 17d:\n\nIn this school, staff members are recognized for a job well done.\n\nObservation:\n\nBasis for judgment varied because if expectations for recognition are low, a small sign can count as significant recognition. Extra pay is rare. The only case of it a participant mentioned was recognition for extra time spent coaching a successful sports team. Appreciation in a faculty meeting or an occasional pat on the back from a principal is all most can expect. A nursery school teacher in an unsupportive environment said the only recognition she received was Christmas cards from a few parents.\n\nQuestion 17e:\n\nI worry about the security of my job because of the performance of my students on state and local tests.\n\nRecommendation e1: Rephrase to clarify intent:\n\n\u201cThe actual performance on state and local tests of the students I have now makes me worry about the security of my job.\u201d\n\nOR\n\n\u201cIf my students were to perform poorly on state and local tests I would worry more than I do now about my job security.\u201d\n\nProblem e1:\n\nMultiple interpretations of agreement are available:\n\n\u2022 \u201cI worry because if they were to perform poorly my job would be threatened.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cI worry because my students actually do perform poorly.\u201d\n\nNo evidence of which interpretation might be more common is available because\n\n\u2022 participants generally did not agree; and \u2022 if they did agree, they were not probed for their interpretation since the\ninterviewers did not wish to imply the teacher was incompetent.\n\nRecommendation e2: Rephrase as suggested in the previous recommendation.\n\n\fProblem e2:\nQuestion 17f: Recommendation: Problem: Observation f1: Observation f2: Question 17g: Observation g1:\n\nAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-73\nMultiple interpretations of disagreement are available:\n\u2022 \u201cMy job is safe because my students perform well.\u201d o by chance\u2014\u201cI got lucky this year\u201d o by willful design\u2014\u201cI prepare students well for tests\u201d or o by obligatory design\u2014\u201cI have to teach to the tests.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cMy job is relatively safe because poor performance is not an issue.\u201d (\u201cMost of our students here are naturally high-achievers.\u201d)\n\u2022 \u201cMy job is safe despite my students\u2019 low scores.\u201d (\u201cWho else could they find to teach here [in the inner city]?\u201d)\n\u2022 \u201cMy job is in danger for other reasons.\u201d (\u201cFunding for electives like music and art is being cut.\u201d)\nThe first couple of interpretations come to mind most easily for the interviewers, yet participants tended to represent all of these interpretations EXCEPT the first. The \u201cby chance\u201d and \u201cby willful design\u2019 interpretations were not represented, and only one participant, by way of complaining about a testoriented curriculum, suggested he had adopted the \u201cby obligatory design\u201d interpretation.\nState or district content standards have had a positive influence on my satisfaction with teaching.\nIf this is really what is being asked, rephrase as \u201cI am more satisfied with teaching (a more satisfied teacher) thanks to (since the adoption of) state or district content standards.\u201d Otherwise, rephrase as \u201cI am satisfied with the state or district content standards,\u201d or \u201cI feel I am a better (more successful) teacher owing to the adoption of state and district content standards.\u201d\nConfusing wording: Some participants seemed to think they were being asked whether they were satisfied with the standards or with their effectiveness in the classroom (their ability to teach effectively) rather than with their own work situation as a result of the standards\u2019 having been implemented.\nInfluence is indirect, through state-sponsored teaching materials. Several participants seemed to be thinking about the materials packets the state or district sends them to use in bringing students up to standards, not the standards themselves. One teacher who disagreed said she finds the materials cumbersome or difficult to explain to students, even if the standards themselves are admirable.\nPotentially not applicable: Some students, like the learning disabled, and some fields, like music, appear not to have any state or district standards to abide by, so participants felt the question was not applicable to them. An N/A option might be helpful.\nI am satisfied with my class size(s).\nPotentially not applicable: A special education teacher who was at the moment working as a personal assistant for a single student was satisfied working with\n\n\fE-74 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nonly one student. However, she suspected the question did not apply to her since as a personal assistant she would never have had more than that one student. An N/A option might be helpful.\n\nRecommendation g2: Rephrase as \u201cMy class size(s) is/are too large\u201d if that is really the issue.\n\nObservation g2:\n\nSeveral participants mentioned independently or agreed when probed, that class size could be too small if there are not enough students to generate discussion without one or two students dominating.\n\nObservation g3:\n\nAnswers may differ for different class compositions\u2014a participant said more boys or LEP kids may make a small class more difficult to handle.\n\nQuestion 17h:\n\nI am given the support I need to teach students with special needs.\n\nObservation h1:\n\nDefinition of \u201csupport\u201d often included a special education or ESL resource specialist but varied widely, including emotional support from other teachers or parents in the classroom, volunteer tutors from outside the school, new technologies, large print books or books on tape, translation services for nonSpanish LEP students, research information sources on students\u2019 disabilities.\n\nObservation h2:\n\nPotentially not applicable: None of the answer choices were appropriate for teachers who did not have any special education students.\n\nQuestion 17i:\n\nI make a conscious effort to coordinate the content of my courses with that of other teachers.\n\nObservation:\n\nTeachers value cooperation but also autonomy. In some schools it is important that all teachers teaching a certain grade or course be teaching the same thing, but where it is not, teachers do not like to tell each other how to teach. Different approaches or content emphases are considered creative and innovative, not necessarily indicative of poor coordination.\n\nQuestion 17j:\n\nThe amount of student tardiness and class cutting in this school interferes with my teaching.\n\nObservation j1:\n\nTeachers can have opinions about how circumstances affect people in the system other than themselves. A participant who thought the question was phrased as a criticism of students remarked that these questions are all about her, that the Census Bureau did not seem to care whether she thought these problems also hurt her students, and if so, how much. This feeling was consistent with another participant\u2019s frustration that nothing was asked about his opinion of the effect of district and school board politics on his students.\n\nRecommendation j1:\n\nBe wary of drawing any inferences from this question. Add a question about the amount of tardiness and absence in the teacher\u2019s own classroom, not the school as a whole. Compare responses to the two questions.\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-75\n\nProblem j1:\n\nGreater tardiness and class cutting can actually result in less interference: Some teachers who disagreed experience a lot of tardiness and class cutting but have adjusted to the interruptions and to dealing with students who are frequently absent.\n\nRecommendation j2: If appropriate, ask instead about absences, late arrivals, and early departures.\n\nProblem j2:\n\nSome respondents may not count late arrivals and absences that result in the greatest interference as tardiness or class cutting: One participant said the source of the greatest interference are problems beyond students\u2019 control: late arrival, early departure, and absence owing to work responsibilities and commuting, leaving class for a school sports team meet, the need to visit colleges, or to take care of younger siblings or their own children.\n\nObservation j2:\n\nPotentially not applicable: In a private nursery school/kindergarten, parents bring their kids to school, so any tardiness is the parent\u2019s fault and does not count. Students are supervised all day so they cannot cut class. The participant put \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d but meant \u201cdoes not apply\u201d since the situation presumed to occur could not occur.\n\nQuestion 17k:\n\nI sometimes feel it is a waste of time to try to do my best as a teacher.\n\nObservation:\n\nSometimes it is fatigue, the demands on teachers\u2019 time, or parents\u2019 lack of support that makes it difficult to do one\u2019s best, not apathetic students or indifferent administration.\n\nQuestion 17l:\n\nI plan with the library media specialist/librarian for the integration of library media services into my teaching.\n\nObservation:\n\nPotentially not applicable: Some small private schools do not have a media specialist/librarian.\n\nQuestion 17m:\n\nI am generally satisfied with being a teacher at this school.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nNo changes.\n\nIX. School Climate: Panel B, Items 18\u201320\n\nThese questions ask participants about the factors that contribute to the educational climate in their schools.\n\nQuestion 18:\n\nPlease indicate the extent to which you agree or disagree with each of the following statements.\n\n\u2022 Mark (X) one box on each line.\n\n(For each question, participant could select:)\n\nStrongly agree Somewhat agree Somewhat disagree\n\n__|\n\n__\n\n__|\n\nStrongly disagree __|\n\n\fE-76 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nQuestion 18a:\n\nThe stress and disappointments involved in teaching at this school aren\u2019t really worth it.\n\nRecommendation a1: Rephrase as one of the interpretations listed below, or create a more appropriate one.\n\nProblem a1:\n\nAmbiguous reference; participants did not know what \u201cit\u201d was, so interpretations were wildly different and participants ended up confusing themselves when paraphrasing.\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe stresses and disappointments are not worth getting stressed out over or disappointed about?\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cBeing in teaching is not worth the stresses and disappointments involved?\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cThe stresses and disappointments make me want to leave?\u201d \u2022 \u201cThe stresses and disappointments outweigh the joys of teaching, of\nhelping students learn?\u201d \u2022 \u201cThe stresses and disappointments are not worth the money they pay\nme?\u201d \u2022 \u201cTeaching is not worth what they pay me owing to the stresses and\ndisappointments?\u201d\n\nRecommendation a2:\n\nUse a positive statement like \u201cTeaching is worthwhile despite its stresses and disappointments\u201d so respondents will be certain of what they are saying if they disagree.\n\nProblem a2:\n\nThe stress involved in understanding what one is agreeing to when disagreeing with a negated proposition is not worth it. Participants had trouble understanding that in saying they disagreed that something was NOT worthwhile, they were conveying that they agreed that WAS worthwhile.\n\nQuestion 18b:\n\nThe teachers at this school like being here; I would describe us as a satisfied group.\n\nObservation b1:\n\nTwo dimensions of satisfaction are possibly combined. A participant suggested the teachers could like being at the school without necessarily liking the group dynamics of being with each other. She suggested separating the two clauses into two separate subitems.\n\nObservation b2:\n\nSatisfied can mean complacent. A participant suggested teachers who are doing nothing to help students may be happy to be left alone, collect their paychecks, and go home to their families instead of grading papers.\n\nQuestion 18c:\n\nI like the way things are run at this school.\n\nObservation c1:\n\nFor whose benefit? A participant wondered if she should be considering the effect of how things are run on the teachers, the students, or the parents, since what is good for one group may not be good for another.\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-77\n\nObservation c2:\n\nParticipants had different ideas of who was running things: some considered only the principal, others the \u201cresource teachers,\u201d \u201cteach leaders,\u201d or department chairpersons, others the public school system, others were thinking of how the school ran itself as a self-organizing system.\n\nQuestion 18d:\n\nIf I could get a higher paying job I\u2019d leave teaching as soon as possible.\n\nRecommendation d1: Rephrase \u201cleave teaching\u201d as \u201cleave the field of teaching.\u201d\n\nObservation d1:\n\nWhen probed, a few participants thought the higher paying job could include teaching jobs. \u201cLeave teaching\u201d may have meant \u201cleave this particular teaching job\u201d to them, or they many not have read closely.\n\nObservation d2:\n\nOne participant was not sure what \u201csomewhat agree\u201d or \u201csomewhat disagree\u201d would mean here. Would the respondent want to leave after giving generous notice? Would the respondent be debating pros and cons? Would it depend on the salary?\n\nQuestion 18e:\n\nI think about transferring to another school.\n\nObservation e1:\n\nSome teachers had a specific school or district in mind; others who agreed had thought about transferring hypothetically or with an ideal school in mind.\n\nObservation e2:\n\nQuestion seemed designed to elicit negative response: A participant would have preferred to have been asked how often she thinks this, because, she said everyone thinks of leaving their current position on occasion.\n\nObservation e3:\n\nAnswer depends on pros and cons of alternatives, which vary with age and experience level, not just satisfaction with teaching: Older teachers have a pension to look forward to; it seems they lose some contributions if they leave; younger teachers have more job options outside of teaching.\n\nQuestion 18f:\n\nI do not seem to have as much enthusiasm now as I did when I began teaching.\n\nObservation:\n\nPotentially not applicable: The question presupposes some amount of teaching experience. A new teacher said he had not been teaching long enough to either maintain or lose enthusiasm.\n\nQuestion 18g:\n\nI think about staying home from school because I\u2019m just too tired to go.\n\nObservation:\n\nQuestion seemed designed to sabotage whatever good will teachers have established with the general public or make schools look like terrible places. Because participants said, everyone in every profession sometimes thinks about not going into work, it is impossible to answer honestly (\u201csomewhat agree\u201d) without suggesting teachers do not care about their jobs.\n\n\fE-78 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nQuestion 19:\nQuestion 19a: Recommendation:\nProblem:\nQuestion 19b: Problem: Question 19c: Problem: Observation: Question 19d: Question 19e: Question 19f: Recommendation:\n\nTo the best of your knowledge how often do the following types of problems occur at your school?\n\n\u2022 Mark (X) one box on each line.\n\n(For each question, participant could select:)\n\nHappens daily __|\n\nHappens at least once a week __|\n\nHappens at least once a month __|\n\nHappens on occasion __|\n\nNever happens __|\n\nTardiness\n\nRange of options for response to 19a and 19c might be partitioned more finely than \u201chappens daily\u201d to include \u201chappens hourly,\u201d but the change might still not pick up any differences and would not be applicable to 19b. Ask instead about \u201cegregious tardiness,\u201d \u201crampant absenteeism,\u201d \u201cconspicuous class cutting.\u201d\n\nNo changes suggested if the items as currently written are needed as benchmarks against which to score other responses.\n\nQuestion appears designed to elicit negative response. Most participants assumed tardiness, absenteeism, and in the higher grades, class cutting must happen daily in their schools even if not in their own classes, since these problems are part of life, just as they are in all large corporations, government, factories, etc. They assumed that if one person in a school of 3,000 was tardy, absent, or cut class each day, they had to put \u201chappens daily.\u201d To participants, putting these problems in a teachers\u2019 survey seemed designed to exaggerate the problems in schools.\n\nAbsenteeism\n\nSee 19a above.\n\nClass cutting\n\nSee 19a above.\n\nPotentially not applicable: Elementary schools supervise students at all times, and the students cannot hide in such small buildings. Students in schools for the severely disabled cannot move around to cut class.\n\nPhysical conflicts among students\n\nRobbery or theft\n\nVandalism\n\nIf appropriate say \u201cvandalism by students of the school.\u201d\n\n\fProblem:\nQuestion 19g: Observation: Recommendation: Problem:\nQuestion 19h: Observation: Question 19i: Question 19j: Question 19k: Recommendation:\nProblem: Observation:\nQuestion 19l: Observation:\n\nAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-79\nAgent of the action not identified. In elementary schools, apparently, most vandalism is perpetrated by outsiders, older youths who return to the school after school hours, not by the school\u2019s students. Teachers did not know whether to consider this type of vandalism. The same might be asked of \u201crobbery or theft,\u201d but since these problems were more rare than vandalism to begin with, participants did not mention them.\nUse of alcohol\nSome participants could smell alcohol on students\u2019 breath. Others said they could not tell and had to assume.\nSay \u201cstudent use of alcohol\u201d if that is all that is intended.\nUse by whom? At certain schools, this item made teachers think of their colleagues or students\u2019 parents, not the students. Such schools include not only those with low morale or severe student behavior problems, but all elementary schools.\nUse of illegal drugs\nSome participants knew how to recognize signs of illegal drug use. Others did not and thus they had no basis for judgment.\nPossession of weapons\nPhysical abuse of teachers\nStudent racial tensions\nRephrase initial question as \u201cTo the best of your knowledge, which of the following activities do students at your school engage in\u201d if appropriate to all lettered items; otherwise specify agent of each item, for example, \u201cstudent use of alcohol.\u201d\nUse of the word \u201cstudent\u201d in 19k through m but not in previous items suggests students are NOT the parties engaged in the actions described in 19a through j.\nPotentially not applicable to schools where all students are the same race or to schools where students are considered by teachers to be too young to understand the concept of race (preschool, kindergarten).\nStudent bullying\nFor participants that were probed about this, this includes d, physical conflicts among students, as well as verbal intimidation and physical actions that are not conflicts, like shoving. For elementary school students, it might include smaller offensives like taking a pencil away from another student or ignoring the student.\n\n\fE-80 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nQuestion 19m:\n\nStudent verbal abuse of teachers\n\nRecommendation:\n\nIf the objective of having both questions is to determine indirectly the degree of disrespect for teachers that is not verbal abuse, better data might be obtained by asking directly for the frequency of \u201cacts of disrespect for teachers OTHER THAN verbal abuse.\u201d\n\nProblem:\n\nOverlap with 19o: some thought m and o the same; others thought verbal abuse was only one form of disrespect, which might include ignoring the teacher, tearing up one\u2019s exam in front of her, etc. One thought of name calling as verbal abuse but talking back to the teacher as an act of disrespect.\n\nQuestion 19n:\n\nWidespread disorder in classrooms\n\nRecommendation:\n\nReplace wording with \u201cTeachers not in control of their classes\u201d or \u201closing the attention of the entire class\u201d if that is the intent of the question.\n\nProblem:\n\n\u201cWidespread disorder\u201d connoted utter chaos and reckless behavior. Participants thought this question might have been intended to ask about \u201closing control of the classroom,\u201d that is, deterioration of discipline, as opposed to general disorder, for instance, having students with messy desks. However to most it connoted dangerous acts in which students could hurt themselves and others: throwing objects or weapons, setting the room on fire, etc.\n\nQuestion 19o:\n\nStudent acts of disrespect for teachers\n\nProblem:\n\nOverlap with 19m.\n\nQuestion 19p:\n\nGang activities\n\nObservation:\n\nInterpretations differed, and included wearing provocative badges, gathering together to threaten or intimidate, and group violence or aggression on another group of students.\n\nQuestion 19 overall:\n\nRecommendation:\n\n(NOTE: It had been discussed at the December 31, 2002, meeting that this question is more suited for the Principals\u2019 Survey. UserWorks staff agrees that these questions should be moved.)\n\nIf obtaining respondents\u2019 impressions of the school\u2019s reputation or guesses based on what they hear from other teachers is sufficient, the instructions for 19 need not be modified, but note that teachers in affluent areas may have an unrealistically favorable impression of their students (not knowing their honor students smoke marijuana) while those in poorer districts may overestimate the problems based on salient incidents (an isolated shooting by an outsider or disgruntled student). The effect of guessing cannot be easily discounted as \u201cerror\u201d because there is no reason to assume in advance the distribution of responses will be unimodal, nor that the response frequencies in each of the five categories will approach anything like an ordinal normal distribution, since each of the categories describe different time ranges. Asking respondents to rate the\n\n\fProblem:\nObservation: Observation:\n\nAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-81\nconfidence of their answers, however, might help determine which answers are the more reliable, and obvious guesses could be excluded from the analysis. Alternatively, offering respondents the chance to say they do not know could discourage guessing. While an answer option \u201cdo not know\u201d might be overused in cases of minor uncertainty, the answer option \u201cno basis for judgment\u201d should discourage uninformed guessing.\nStaff suspects asking for subjective frequency ratings (\u201cextremely often, often, occasionally, hardly ever, never\u201d) might be easier for respondents, but the responses might not be comparable: one teacher may think a rare problem happens too often while another may think the same frequency of occurrence perfectly acceptable.\nMore accurate responses could be obtained by asking only about the teacher\u2019s own students (\u201cin your own classroom\u201d might be too restrictive, since many problems may occur in the halls or lunchroom but manifest themselves in the classroom.) While some teachers will have only well behaved or badly behaved classes, student behavior patterns may still be more randomly distributed across respondents than their impressions of what happens to other teacher\u2019s students and outside their own classrooms.\nTeachers simply do not know the answers. While a few participants seemed to be answering based only on their own classrooms, most recognized the question was asking about the school in general. Unfortunately, the \u201cbest of [their] knowledge\u201d of what goes on at their school outside their own classrooms is often minimal and, according to them, not to be relied on. For instance, if drugs, weapons, gang activities, etc. are forbidden in the school, students hide them, and teachers do not have much opportunity to see if they are actually present. One participant said he could not be expected to know what happens daily at a school of several thousand, nor know for certain that seemingly rare events never happen.\nSome feared that because they had to base most of their frequency judgments on what happened in their own classrooms, the Census Bureau might infer that EVERY problem that they marked as happening frequently at their school was actually occurring in their own classrooms.\nParticipants suggested adding the following subitems to 19:\n\u2022 parent disrespect for teachers; \u2022 parent abuse or neglect of students; \u2022 student or teacher sexual harassment or abuse of students; and \u2022 subversive activities (by outsiders or students) such as calling in bomb\nthreats.\n\n\fE-82 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nQuestion 20:\nQuestion 20a: Observation a1: Observation a2: Question 20b: Recommendation: Problem:\nObservation:\nQuestion 20c: Observation: Question 20d: Observation:\n\nTo what extent is each of the following a problem in this school? Indicate whether it is a serious problem, a moderate problem, a minor problem, or not a problem in this school.\n\n\u2022 Mark (X) one box on each line.\n\n(For each question, participant could select:)\n\nSerious problem Moderate problem\n\n__| __|\n\n__|\n\nMinor problem Not a problem __|\n\nTeacher absenteeism\n\nThis may be a serious problem not because morale or motivation among teachers is low but because there may be a teacher shortage, making it difficult to replace teachers on sick or maternity leave, recovering from an accident, etc.\n\nTeachers do not interact much with colleagues outside their own department, so their answers may not reflect the true situation. One participant said he based his judgment on reports of teacher absences from students who seemed to be cutting class.\n\nPregnancy\n\nSpecify whether teacher or student pregnancy is meant.\n\nInterpretation of who was pregnant varied depending on the age level of the teacher\u2019s students. Middle school teachers thus had the most difficulty deciding how to interpret the item. Some participants inferred students were being referred to since item 20a mentioned teachers and item b did not, but the mention of teachers in 20a also alerted some participants to an ambiguity they might not otherwise have noticed.\n\nOne participant suggested parent pregnancy might also be a problem in that it meant they would soon have less time to spend with the child in school.\n\nTeacher pregnancy did not seem to be as much of a problem as postdelivery teacher absenteeism owing to maternity leave. High school teachers suggested parental responsibilities of students, male or female, might be more of a problem for the teacher than pregnancy, though pregnancy and poor parenting might be more of a problem for students or their parents.\n\nStudents dropping out\n\nTeachers cannot always tell if students have dropped out, particularly if a parent tells them the truant is going off to school every day.\n\nStudent apathy\n\nOne participant guessed that \u201capathy\u201d meant \u201centhusiasm,\u201d with the result that the answer choice she marked was the opposite of what she intended. \u201cStudent\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-83\n\nQuestion 20e: Recommendation: Problem:\nObservation:\nQuestion 20f: Observation:\nQuestion 20g: Observation:\nQuestion 20h: Observation:\nOverall observation:\n\nindifference to learning\u201d or \u201cstudents\u2019 lack of motivation\u201d might have been clearer to her.\nLack of parental involvement\nIf distinction is significant, divide item into two: \u201cparental interest in student achievement\u201d and \u201cparental responsibility and support for student\u2019s learning.\u201d\nTwo sources of parental involvement make item difficult to evaluate. Participants suggest parents may be very interested in knowing how their children are doing and in taking responsibility for their behavior and attendance, but these same parents may not be interested in, capable of, or free enough in the evenings to help their students learn, either through helping them with homework or providing an intellectually stimulating environment at home.\nThree participants suggested parents can be overly involved, requesting special attention to their child even if it is not necessary, worrying about their children\u2019s safety since September 11, 2001, even going so far as to accompany their kids throughout field trips or coming to school to monitor the halls for snipers.\nPoverty\nParticipants differed as to whether they considered poverty a problem in itself (a financial drain on the school, a source of sensitivity and emotional trouble for students) or a potential cause for some other problems in item 20 (apathy, lack of parental involvement, unpreparedness, poor health).\nStudents come to school unprepared to learn\nParticipants differed as to how they interpreted \u201cunprepared to learn.\u201d Contributing factors included poor nourishment, low maturity level, poor prior academic preparation, unsupportive home environment, and no effort to bring supplies to class. A couple also mentioned overprivileged students.\n\u201cUnprepared to learn\u201d thus overlaps with poverty, lack of parent involvement, and student apathy.\nPoor student health\nThis was a minor problem for a participant not because poor health prevented a student from learning but because students with common colds came to school and got other students and teachers sick. This type of problem is probably not within the intended scope of the question.\nParticipants were not probed as to what considerations go into determining whether a problem is serious, moderate, minor, or nonexistent. Participants suggested something could be a problem for the teacher, for the student, for the theory of what education should be ideally, or for the reputation of the teaching profession once the survey is published. A teacher in a school for severely disabled students said that because certain problems are expected to be serious in her school, she might not think they are as serious as people outside might.\n\n\fE-84 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nThe same could be true of teachers who choose to work in schools with discipline problems. Seriousness may be relative to initial expectations.\nX. Participants\u2019 Final Observations and Recommendations\nThis section contains an overall discussion of the tables within the SASS public school teacher questionnaire.\nThroughout this section of the participants\u2019 reactions to the panel(s), UserWorks staff has highlighted specific instances where participants commented on the placement of tables, the layout of the tables, and the codes listed on the tables.\nRegarding the location of the tables, two participants mentioned that they preferred to have questions and tables colocated; that is, the table being referenced (e.g., table 2) and the question(s) (e.g., questions 10, 12) should be \u201cnext\u201d to each other on facing pages. Several participants remarked that they liked seeing the tables before the question (e.g., table 3 appears before questions 15\u201318) because it alerted them that the tables would be needed; a couple of participants actually perused the tables for a moment. In some cases, tables were \u201cbehind\u201d the questions, as opposed to being placed on the left. One participant suggested putting the codes (into answer 6b) and questions on the same page, while two more suggested that the tables be placed at the end of survey, with one negating her comment by saying that would cause even more page turning. Staff does not think these latter two suggestions would be helpful because it would require truncating codes for the teaching assignment in 6b and participants would have to do even more page turning to locate the correct page/table.\nRegarding the layout of the table, one participant volunteered that (s)he found the tables generally overwhelming. In a couple of cases, incorrect grade codes (e.g., K) were used in place of field codes (e.g., 101). When most participants were filling out grades taught (Question 9), they intuitively selected the correct grade without having to refer to the table. One participant, after being prompted, mentioned that (s)he did not even notice the table. Staff believes the revised layout of tables 1A and 1B will help future participants efficiently locate the codes, but there were not adequate numbers to test this against.\nWith regard to the codes, most complaints centered on the generalities participants felt when they were looking for a specific code (Choral Conducting) as opposed to a more general one (Music). Where possible, staff recommends reviewing the currency of the codes, and including new subitems. Also, this will help to alleviate participants\u2019 perceptions of \u201cmissing codes\u201d as well as \u201cmislabeled codes.\u201d In addition, one participant had a concern about recording her training (she worked in a kindergarten/daycare program) and there was no way to show that training.\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-85\n\nParticipants\u2019 final observations and recommendations, Panel A:\n\nObservation:\n\nThree remarked about question 14 (the number of the courses taken), saying the question is too broad because it seems to ask about ALL general education classes; plus, for teachers who have had long careers, this number will be very large. (One participant suggested doing away with \u201chow many?\u201d and another suggested asking how many hours, rather than number of classes.)\n\nObservation:\n\nOne participant remarked that his time in items 21\u201323 was hard to figure out because his time was so varied (indicates thinking of \u201caverage, typical\u201d week).\n\nObservation:\n\nWhen asked about what topics or questions should be included, participants offered these suggestions:\n\n\u2022 teacher aide, full- or part-time, to find out whether having an aide impacts extra time on teacher\u2019s part before and after school;\n\u2022 special needs, for example, speech, remediation, emotional/social/health/ educational needs;\n\u2022 teaching career, not just the current situation; \u2022 facilities and conditions; \u2022 questions in the special education section that ask about alternative\ntesting (e.g., SAT-9); \u2022 team teaching; \u2022 pay, monitoring staff, and the way teachers are treated; \u2022 issues related to working conditions (e.g., personal relationships,\nadministration, working climate, rate of pay, benefits), materials (school supplies, books, manipulatives), physical condition of the school building (leaks, deterioration, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning [HVAC]); \u2022 more questions about salary and level of satisfaction; \u2022 in asking about how many hours are spent on a topic, physical education, foreign languages, and technical education were missing; and \u2022 satisfaction with teaching, incentives for getting into teaching, perceptions before and after teaching experience.\n\nOne participant remarked that, in general, (s)he liked that the survey asked for opinions.\n\nObservation:\n\nThree participants remarked on the questions about certification, with regard to those who do not have certification or who have had certification problems; for example, one participant wanted to make sure that information about her education and certification would not be personally identifiable.\n\nObservation:\n\nAt least two participants consistently folded the survey in half, so they could not take full advantage of tables appearing on pages across from those containing questions.\n\n\fE-86 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nObservation:\n\nWith regard to having a survey overview:\n\n\u2022 Two participants mentioned explaining the purpose of the survey in the introduction.\n\u2022 Three participants agreed (after the question was raised) that instructions should be included at the beginning regarding suggestions for materials to have on hand, (e.g., transcripts and student records). However, one participant remarked that teachers would be less likely to fill out the sections survey if that were the case.\n\nObservation:\n\nWith regard to background information to complete the survey:\n\n\u2022 Two participants remarked that they liked the bolded main questions, with the answer choices in plain font underneath.\n\u2022 Four participants (two of them older teachers) noted that they do not like the gray background with the light gray apple points because it strains the eyes.\n\nObservation:\n\nWith regard to instructions in the survey:\n\n\u2022 One participant disliked the arrows and wanted to know if they were examples or instructions.\n\u2022 One participant remarked that the skip instructions should be more obvious and directed.\n\u2022 Participant wanted more \u201cdirection\u201d with tables\u2026 hard to find information, especially when their vocabulary differs (e.g., prereading is not included in the list).\n\nParticipants\u2019 final observations and recommendations, Panel B:\n\nRecommendation:\n\nIndent lettered items under numbered items; use a larger or different shaped font for numbered items.\n\nProblem:\n\nMinimal visual differentiation of hierarchical structure of question. Some participants noted that since main and subordinate questions are in the same size font and at the same margin, it is not immediately obvious that general instructions at the top of a section may apply to questions on an entire page and into the next page.\n\nObservation:\n\nSeveral participants mentioned liking the option of writing comments in the white space at the bottom of some pages. One participant, however, said the empty space made the survey look too long and would have discouraged him from finishing it.\n\nObservation:\n\nParticipants said it would help to refer to records for recalling courses they had taken, hours they had worked, and which students have which problems, but many do not keep such records.\n\n\fObservation: Observation: Observation:\n\nAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-87\nParticipants considered sensitive several items that might not be considered particularly personal:\n\u2022 Questions that if answered honestly reflect poorly on every school (19a through c);\n\u2022 Questions that seem designed to create the impression that the respondent is either lying or has a poor attitude (17k and 18e\u2013g);\n\u2022 Questions about alcohol, weapons, and drugs if the teacher is a user herself.\nParticipants offered the following as examples of the most difficult items:\n\u2022 figuring division of work hours; \u2022 conceiving of a typical or average week if you do not believe you have\none; \u2022 recalling courses from 3 years ago; and \u2022 deciding whether they agreed or disagreed when they did not have a\nstrong opinion either way.\nCertain participants felt questions on the following topics should have been included:\n\u2022 satisfaction with pay; \u2022 the need to pay for their own continuing education; \u2022 difficulties in obtaining certifications; \u2022 support from administrators for problems with regular students and\nparents, not just special education or LEP support; \u2022 support from administration on financial matters\u2014pay, budget for new\nmaterials, availability of materials and response to requests, etc.; \u2022 satisfaction with educational preparation for teaching, not just\nusefulness of in-service courses; \u2022 satisfaction with amount of planning time; \u2022 opinion of school board, school system; \u2022 opinion about the level of discipline in school specifically, not just\noverall \u201ckind of school\u201d; \u2022 more background demographics to let the Census Bureau know who is\nanswering the questions; \u2022 challenges of motivating students to learn; and \u2022 why people responded as they did to questions in 17 and 18.\nThey would also have liked to know the purpose of the survey, how it would be used, and have received assurances of confidentiality with regard to parents and colleagues as well as administrators.\n\n\fE-88 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nAttachment E-1.

Interview Protocol\nThank you for your time today. We will be evaluating the proposed teacher questionnaire, which is part of the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), by having you complete and comment on the questionnaire. We are going to use your comments to give feedback to the developers of the survey. Your comments and thoughts will help make changes to improve it. UserWorks did not develop the survey, so please do not feel like you have to hold back on your thoughts to be polite. Tell us both your positive and negative reactions. And remember, there are no right or wrong answers. We are not evaluating you but rather how well the questionnaire works.\nBefore we get started, I would like to tape this interview so I will not have to rely on my memory later. If that\u2019s all right with you, please sign this consent form. It also tells you about the confidentiality of the interview.\n>> Give consent form.\nWe use the tapes for purposes of analysis and to remind us of what occurred during a session. Any information you provide is confidential. Your name will not be associated with it. Only persons connected with the development project will have access to the tapes or other data that we collect. Clips from the tapes may be used in professional presentations about this work.\n>> Thank participant and remind them they can stop the session at any time for any reason.\nPurpose of the testing\nSay, \u201cWe will be evaluating a part of the SASS questionnaire that is under development.\u201d\nSay, \u201cWe are going to use your comments to give feedback to the developers of the survey. Your comments and thoughts will help make changes to improve it.\u201d\nQuestions teachers may ask\n\u2022 The cover page is blank; what goes there? Assume there will be a printed bar code, school name, and school address on the cover. This questionnaire is usually mailed with other questionnaires to the school.\n\u2022 What information should I use? Teachers should use their own information. The responses will not be used for survey purposes but provide an opportunity to help us think about what circumstances might come up so we can make sure the questions are appropriate.\n\u2022 Is there a specific private school teacher questionnaire? Why am I being asked to fill out a public school survey? The SASS is very similar to the PSS and Census thinks feedback from private school teachers on the public school questionnaire can directly apply to the private school one.\n>> Ask what words do not apply to a private school teacher during the course of the survey.\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-91\nProcedure\n\u2022 Hand the survey to the participant (be sure to have date and time written on cover page, as well as Participant #).\n\u2022 Make sure participant has pen or pencil to work with. \u2022 Have vignettes handy. \u2022 Start audiotape.\nSay, \u201cThis is NOT a test of your skills because we are evaluating the questionnaire. If you have problems do not feel bad; they do not reflect on you. Others are likely to have the same problems. Our goal is to try to identify and hopefully correct these problems. The questionnaire is not quite finished; it is a prototype.\u201d\nSay, \u201cPlease think aloud as you are completing the form\u2014tell us what you are doing, why you are making selections, things that are confusing, and suggestions for improvement.\u201d\nSay, \u201cIn some cases I will ask you to role play some situations. Please respond as best you can, given the information and your experience.\u201d\nSay, \u201cIn some cases I will ask you to complete a question or a series of questions before asking your comments. Please try to work through the questions as if I were not here, and please only ask for help if you are stuck.\u201d\n>> Give think-aloud demo, if needed.\nThink-aloud demo: Suppose you are an interviewer and you\u2019ve been asked to evaluate a questionnaire about your occupation. One of the questions is \u201cWhich occupational group do you interview most frequently?\u201d You have these three options:\nWhite Collar Executive or Clerical Blue Collar/Factory Workers Agricultural/Farm Workers\nSo you might think to yourself, \u201cGee I mostly interview people in retail stores and bars and restaurants, but I do not know if I\u2019d call them blue collar/factory workers. Maybe agricultural for the grocery stores. I\u2019m thinking maybe they want me to leave those out. Now I\u2019ve interviewed quite a few plumbers, carpenters, and electricians, but those are professional skilled contractors; they are blue collar but I do not know that I\u2019d call them factory workers. Now like today, I\u2019m interviewing teachers; they are white collar I guess, but they are not executive or clerical. They would probably want me to include them. I guess that\u2019s the only group that really fits so I\u2019d have to check white collar. I\u2019ve interviewed farm managers, too; I guess they are executives, not farm workers, so when you put it together that\u2019s a lot of white collar people, but I think some people might just skip this question....\u201d\nSay, \u201cAny questions before we start?\u201d\nProbing Questions\nProcess overview\nParticipants will complete the form in sections (based on admin direction) using their own information. Observe what they do. Remind them to think aloud. After they have completed a question or section, ask\n\n\fE-92 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nappropriate probes (listed below). In some cases it may be necessary or appropriate to ask a question during the process.\nGeneral probes to ask to keep participants from falling silent or if there is obvious confusion:\n\u2022 What are you thinking? \u2022 What are you looking at? \u2022 What are you reading/writing? \u2022 Can you tell me more about that?\nWhen ready to begin first task\nAs the participant begins to work on his or her answer to the question, remind them to think out loud.\nSay, \u201cOnce you have found the information you are looking for please state your answer aloud, for the benefit of the audiotape. For example, say, \u2018My answer is ---\u2019 or \u2018This is my final answer.\u2019\u201d\nNote if the participant reads the question or part of it aloud. What are they reading? Do they seem confused about the wording? Are they using the apple hints?\nIntroductory questions to ask participants\nTell me about your teaching experience. How long have you taught? What do you teach?\nHave you seen this questionnaire or one similar to it before? [If yes:] How does it normally come to you (e.g., interoffice mail, hand delivered, in your inbox)? In what form (e.g., with other school surveys)? Does it usually have your name on it? Do you return it to the office or mail it in yourself?\nNOTE: Do not tell the participant which question to continue with, just say, \u201cNow, let\u2019s continue\u201d because we do not want to tell them a skip pattern or influence the ordering of the questions they answer in case they prefer not to answer in order.\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-93\nAttachment E-4. Interview Questions for Panel A\nQuestion 1, \u201cIn what year did you begin teaching in THIS school?\u201d:\nObserve: Any confusion if they took a sabbatical, if there was a hiatus, etc.\nQuestion 3, \u201cIn which grades are the students you currently teach at THIS school?\u201d:\nProbe: What does this question mean in your own words?\nProbe (If not rushed for time, ask high school teachers): If you had advanced middle school students from other schools taking your classes here, would you include them?\nQuestion 4a, \u201cWhich statement best describes the way our classes (or sections) at this school are organized?\u201d:\nRemind Participant: Remind them to tell you what they are thinking.\nObserve: Do they even notice words in parenthesis after answer choices? How do they describe their own situation?\nPostpone Questions: Wait until they have read and followed the skip instructions in 4b before asking follow-up questions on 4a.\nQuestion 4b, \u201cWhich box did you mark in item 4a above?\u201d:\nObserve: Determine (and confirm orally on tape) where they go after reading question 4b, probe for reasoning ONLY IF they did NOT appear to follow instructions correctly: How did you decide to go to item 7/5 rather than item 5/7?\nSay: Thanks. I wanted to see where you would go next; I see you went to\u2026, but before we continue, I want to go back and ask you some things about this question (4a).\nFollow-up Probe (if they do not describe themselves): How did you arrive at your answer for 4a?\nFollow-up Probe (if not sure about parentheses): Describe in your own words what the terms in the parenthesis at the end of each answer choice for 4a mean. Let\u2019s start with Departmentalized Instruction\u2026\nObserve: Does their interpretation of the parenthetical labels correspond to the way the descriptions preceding them?\nFollow-up Probe: Are you familiar with other teaching arrangements that are not listed here?\nVignette 4b (HAND THEM A WRITTEN VERSION; use only if not pressed for time and they have not provided much insight into how their or other teacher\u2019s situations mesh with the answer categories): Suppose you and the other teachers in your elementary school have several learning stations in each classroom where a group of students can work together in groups and with a teacher\u2019s aide on a particular subject. Students are rotated among the learning stations every hour within one classroom throughout the day. The learning stations are roughly equivalent in every teacher\u2019s room. But because\n\n\fE-94 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\neach teacher has a specialty area of expertise, students are rotated between teachers every 4 weeks so they get the benefit of each teacher\u2019s knowledge. How would you answer 4a?\nQuestion 5, \u201cAt THIS school, what is the total number of students enrolled in the class (or section) you taught during your most recent FULL WEEK of teaching?\u201d:\nProbe: How did you arrive at your answer?\nObserve: Try to identify how many classes or sections they\u2019ve included in their answer. If they put down more than 40 students, they may have added classes together to get the total.\nProbe (particularly if answer appears totaled from multiple classes, not averaged): What does this question mean in your own words? What does \u201cMost recent full week\u201d mean? What do the words \u201cclass\u201d and \u201csection\u201d mean?\nQuestion 6a, \u201cDuring your most recent FULL WEEK of teaching, approximately how many hours did you spend teaching each of these subjects at THIS school?\u201d:\nObserve: For language arts teachers, attend to how they separate out reading instruction.\nSee if they put zero hours in the numbers box instead of or in addition to checking \u201cnone.\u201d See if they just leave blank what they do not teach instead of marking \u201cnone.\u201d\nSee if they put fractions or decimals points down.\nSee if they have trouble with interpreting \u201cmost recent full week.\u201d Wait till they complete the question before probing.\nFollow-up Probe: What did the question mean in your own words? (If needed:) What does the question mean by \u201cmost recent full week?\u201d\nFollow-up Probe: How did you arrive at your answer? Describe any difficulties you encountered.\nFollow-up Probe: Are there any missing categories?\nFollow-up Probe: Where would you put computers classes?\nFollow-up Probes: Do you ever use material on one topic to teach skills in another area? Was there any overlap among the hours you put down for each of the subject areas? (If so:) Where did this occur?\nExample: (Only if needed:) For instance, schools that teach \u201cApplications of Math\u201d might combine \u201carithmetic/mathematics\u201d and \u201cscience.\u201d Some elementary teachers may use history books to teach reading.\nVignette 6a-1: Your 5th and 6th grade students all know how to read, but you are encouraging them to read more and to read more challenging material by assigning writing assignments and book reports on books for teenagers and adults. It takes your students time to read these books, so you\u2019ve set aside a half hour a day when they can get started on their reading homework. Would you include any hours for reading or only for English/Language Arts?\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-95\nVignette 6a-2: (Low priority; only if session is running ahead of schedule, ask ONE of the following vignettes, HAND OUT WRITTEN COPY): You are an elementary school teacher. The county cannot afford specialty teachers for special subjects. You spend 2 hours a week teaching art and 2 hours a week teaching music in addition to teaching a period each of language arts, reading, math, social studies, and science. How would you complete this section?\nQuestion 6b, \u201cThis school year, what is your MAIN teaching assignment field at this school, that is, the field in which you teach the most classes?\u201d:\nObserve: See if they have trouble finding the table, and if they write their teaching assignment field in before checking the table to see what categories are available. If they write one that\u2019s not available in the table, see if they change their answer once they see the table.\nSee if they are less likely to write in something before checking the table than are teachers who answer question 8, where the blank to write out the subject appears before the code rather than after the code. This should help us determine in which order to place the fields.\nSee if they find it redundant or annoying to have to write both the code and the name of the field that the code corresponds to on the table.\nProbe: Did you think what you wrote in the \u201cmain teaching assignment field\u201d needed to correspond exactly to one of the fields listed on the table?\nQuestion 6c, \u201cGo to Section III \u2013 Educational Background on Page 9\u201d:\nObserve: See if they look on page 9 for the rest of question 6c and if they return to work on page 7, questions 7 through 9, after completing a portion of page 9.\nProbe: What is this question asking or telling you?\nQuestion 7, \u201cThis school year, what is your MAIN teaching assignment field at this school, that is, the field in which you teach the most classes?\u201d:\nRemind Participant: Please tell me what you are thinking while you are working on these questions.\nPostpone Questions: Wait until after question 9 has been completed before probing about questions 7 through 9.\n(Choose one of the following vignettes, A or B:)\nVignette 7-a: Suppose many of your students work or apprentice some mornings or afternoons so they can not take classes every day. You teach five classes of auto mechanics at this school twice a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays). What would your \u201cMOST RECENT FULL WEEK\u201d be? What would your number of classes be? What subject name and code would you use in question 7?\nVignette 7-b: Suppose you teach one junior band class every morning at Bonnacre Middle School. You then leave immediately for Fielin High, where you teach one section each of jazz band, concert band, madrigals, and chorus. Your principal at Bonnacre, knowing you are always in a rush to get to Fielin, has used interoffice mail to send a copy of this questionnaire to your office at Fielin, where you are now trying to complete it. What is meant by the phrase \u201cAT THIS SCHOOL?\u201d What number of classes (or sections) would you put down for question 8?\n\n\fE-96 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nObserve: How do they determine \u201cthis school?\u201d Would they use the label on the outside of the booklet?\n(B continued:) Suppose that instead of completing it at your Fielin office, you\u2019ve taken the questionnaire home and are now at home filling it out. What is meant by the phrase \u201cAT THIS SCHOOL?\u201d What number of classes (or sections) would you put down for question 7?\nQuestion 8, \u201cDuring Your MOST RECENT FULL WEEK of teaching, how many separate classes (or sections) did you teach AT THIS SCHOOL?\u201d:\nProbe: In your own words, what is this question asking?\nObserve: Try to determine if they think question 8 applies only to the main field they listed in question 7 (if they do not read the examples).\nQuestion 9, \u201cComplete a line of the table below for each class (or section) that you taught during your MOST RECENT FULL WEEK of teaching at this school.\u201d:\nObserve: DO THEY START WITHOUT THE TABLE? The order of the subject names and codes is designed to encourage users to write down the subject before looking for the code in the table. See if users write down a name that turns out not to have a code (e.g., Literature instead of English or Language Arts), or a name for which they can not find a code. See if they erase and change the name. See if they are confused when they find the presentation order of names and codes in question 8 does not match the order in the table.\nObserve: WHICH TABLE DO THEY USE? Note whether the reader folds the booklet in half or lays it flat with both left and right side facing up. Watch which table they go to first, table 1, which will probably appear on the left page facing the questions, or table 2, which will probably appear on the page after question 8 in the booklet. If they go to the wrong table, probe to understand what they were thinking that led them there.\nFollow-up Probe: Did you think what you wrote for subject names under \u201c9a\u201d needed to correspond exactly to one of the fields listed on the table?\nObserve: HOW DO THEY USE THE TABLE? How smoothly can one refer to the table while writing on a different page? IMPORTANT: How easily can they find information in the table? Where do they get stuck?\nProbe: Are there any subject areas missing from the table that you think should be included?\nProbe: How did you arrive at your answers for the number of students?\nObserve: Do elementary enrichment or pullout teachers need more rows for their answers?\n(Choose one of the following vignettes, A or B:)\nVignette 9-a: Suppose you teach two sections of 19th Century British Novel to 11th graders, with 20 students in each class, and two sections of Contemporary American Literature to 12th graders with 15 and 18 students in each class respectively.

Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-97\nVignette 9-b (which would not be influenced by the example \u201cEnglish\u201d): Suppose you teach two sections of American History 1900 to the Present to 11th graders with 25 and 30 students, respectively, and one section of American Revolution to the Civil War to 10th graders with 18 students in the class. How would you complete question 9?\n(Postpone: Use this vignette ONLY if we do not get enough data from teachers of preschool, kindergarten, and grades 1\u20139 on whether they find and enter the proper grade code\u2014PK, K, 01, etc. Otherwise use Vignette D instead:)\nVignette 9-c: You are an elementary school general science teacher and teach two first grade classes of 20 students each, two kindergarten classes with 15 and 18 students respectively and one nursery school class of 12 students. How would you complete questions 8 and 9?\nVignette 9-d: You teach five classes of 11th grade history. Owing to a recent wave of immigration, your school is overenrolled so all your classes have the maximum number of students allowed in your district, which is 38. How would you complete question 9?\nFollow-up Probe for D: Do you yourself teach the same course to the same grade level more than once a day? (If so observe whether they listed the same course more than once.)\nQuestion 10a, 12a, 13a, \u201cDo you have a ___ degree?\u201d:\nObserve: Do they correctly skip questions when they answer \u201cno?\u201d on 10a, 12a, 13a?\nQuestion 10b, \u201cIn what year did you receive your Bachelor\u2019s degree?\u201d:\nOptional Vignette 10b (if time): Suppose you have a B.A. in elementary education from a large state university. You received your diploma in 2000 but did not want to sit through what you felt were tedious graduation ceremonies. Later your grandparents wanted to see you graduate, so you attended the next semester\u2019s graduation in 2001. Since there were too many graduates to hand out diplomas, all the graduates stood and were applauded. How would you answer question 10b?\nQuestion 10c, 12c, \u201cWas this degree awarded by a department of education, college of education, or school of education?\u201d:\nProbe: What does this question mean in your own words?\nProbe: What interdisciplinary programs that award education degrees might not be covered here?\nQuestion 10d, \u201cWhat was your major field of study?\u201d:\nObserve: Do they put down \u201ceducation\u201d as major field for degrees granted by education programs or do they put the content specialization part of the degree or both? (The goal is for them to put content area so analysts can determine if they are \u201cqualified\u201d to teach what they are teaching.)\nContingent Probe [if interviewer is uncertain]: Is that an education degree?\n[If yes:] Do you also have a Bachelor\u2019s degree in a specialty field? [If yes again:] Why did you list the education degree rather than the specialty? If you had not read question 10c, would you have put down the specialty field degree instead?\n\n\fE-98 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n[If no:] Do you also have a Bachelor\u2019s in education? [If yes again:] Why did you list the subject area degree rather than the education major?\nQuestion 11a, \u201cWhat is the name of the college or university where you earned this degree?\u201d:\nOptional Vignette 11a (if time): You graduated from the India Institute of Technology in New Delhi, India. Later you got a second bachelor\u2019s degree from The University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland. How would you complete question 11a?\nQuestion 11b, \u201cIn what city and state is it located?\u201d:\nOptional Vignette 11b (if time): Suppose you did decide to go with the India Institute of Technology in New Delhi, India for 11a. How would you complete question 11b?\nQuestion 13 Overall:\nObserve: Do they do 13a, fill out the chart, and get to question 14 and wonder where 13b is (since it is a column header rather than a row header like 13a)?\nProbe if they select \u201cno\u201d for column \u201cb\u201d but still complete columns \u201cc\u201d and \u201cd\u201d or just \u201cc:\u201d Is this a degree you are working on now? [If they fill in column d for this degree with a future or current year:] Is that the year you expect to receive the degree? [If yes to either or both questions:] Is there a better way to suggest column c should only be completed for \u201cyes\u201d answers in column b? Do you think you would have completed column c for a \u201cNo\u201d answer in column b if \u201cNo\u201d were changed to \u201cNot Applicable?\u201d\nObserve: See if they list education under major field for vocational certificate.\nProbe: Describe to me the vocational certificates you\u2019ve received.\nOptional Vignette 13 (if time): You have received two certificates, one in 1993 that licenses you to do paralegal research and administrative work in a law office, the other in 1995 that allows you to do actuarial work (predicting survival rates) for an insurance company. You\u2019ve also received a teaching certificate in 1999, long after you completed college. How would you complete question 13? And please explain your thought process.\nOptional Probe (if time): Would it help if you were provided examples of vocational certificates? Should the instructions say not to include your teaching certificate if it should not be included?\nQuestion 13b:\nObserve: Do they feel they\u2019ve already answered question b in question a? Is it clear to them that \u201cb\u201d is actually asking whether each row describes the degree or one of the degrees that they said they completed in \u201ca\u201d?\nProbe: Would you include degrees received through courses taken online or through the mail? Are there any other degrees not listed here?\nQuestion 14:\nProbe: How did you arrive at your answer? Have you taken courses at various times in various programs? Were they taken to satisfy different goals? What were they?\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-99\nProbe: Would you include courses taken online or through the mail? Are you currently taking any courses in these areas, and did you include those in your total? Did you include courses you took for the degrees you listed in questions 10, 12, or 13? [If not:] Why not? Were none offered in your education program? Did you think the question referred only to courses taken outside of a degree or certification program?\nSection III Overall:\nVignette 14-a: You spent 5 years as an undergraduate and graduated with a double major in chemistry and environmental studies from the same university in the same year, 1988. Your education degree was at the master\u2019s level and was received in 1995. How would you complete question 10d?\nProbe (if they do not list both on the line): Why did you put this major and not the other? Would you put the other major under question 13?\n(Choose Vignette B or C):\nVignette 14-b: You took math courses at Snewty College, a very challenging and expensive liberal arts college in Bunk Haven, Rhode Island, but did not believe you could complete a math degree within 4 years. Your parents could not afford to pay tuition at Snewty beyond 4 years. So you graduated with a Bachelor\u2019s in English in 1986. The next year (1987), you returned home and completed a Bachelor\u2019s in math education at University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, where the math courses were easier and cheaper, crediting many of the courses you took at the liberal arts college towards this other degree. How would you complete questions 10 and 13?\nVignette 14-c: As a junior majoring in math, you left Snewty College in Bunk Haven, Rhode Island, in 1995 without completing your bachelor\u2019s degree to use your extensive technical and math skills to create the company Dotcom.com. Eventually you got bored creating computer programs and wanted to work with youngsters, but you felt you\u2019d learned more on the job than you could get finishing your bachelor\u2019s. So you returned to school and obtained a master\u2019s degree in secondary math education in 2002 at University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, and are now teaching without a bachelor\u2019s degree. How would you complete questions 10 through 13?\nQuestion 15b, \u201cWhat type of certificate is this?\u201d:\nProbe: Do the parenthetical descriptions correspond to the meanings you would assign to \u201cprobationary certificate,\u201d \u201ctemporary certificate,\u201d and \u201cemergency certificate or waiver?\u201d [If not]: How do they differ from what you understand these terms to mean?\nProbe: Are there types of teaching certificates that do not appear among answer choices 1 through 5?\nQuestion 15c, \u201cIn what content area is this certificate?\u201d:\nObserve: Do they use the correct table?\nProbe (when looking at the table): What are you thinking? What are you looking for?\nProbe (after answering): How did you determine what answer to choose?\n\n\fE-100 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nQuestions 15\u201318 overall:\nObserve: Adherence to skip pattern\nQuestion 19:\nObserve: Does anyone who has listed fewer than four certificates in questions 15 through 18 say \u201cyes\u201d to 19a? If so, this indicates the question is misunderstood.\nProbe after they\u2019ve completed 19a and b: How did you arrive at your answer? What does the question mean in your own words? [And if necessary:] What does \u201cANY ADDITIONAL\u201d mean in this question?\nFollow-up Probe (reality check for anyone who really claims to have more than 4 certificates): What kind of additional certificate(s) do you have? Do they fit the categories in the \u201cb\u201d section of questions 15 through 18?\nQuestion 20, \u201cHow did you earn your initial teaching certificate?\u201d:\nProbe: What does \u201cyour initial\u201d mean in this question? Which certificate are you thinking about in answering this question? Is the certificate you listed in 15b the one you obtained first? [If not]: Which certificate did you obtain first?\nObserve: Do they think a temporary or provisional certificate is an initial certificate, or only a \u201creal\u201d one?\nProbe (Probably difficult to answer; ask only if they are confused about \u201cinitial\u201d): If the questionnaire writers are actually asking about the certificate listed in 15b, would this question make more SENSE if placed right after 15b? Would it be EASIER to answer if placed there? What do you think you would have considered your initial certificate if you had not been asked to list all of them in questions 15 through 18 first?\nSection IV Overall:\nProbe: Did you see the title for this section, \u201cCertification and Training?\u201d What do you suppose they mean by \u201ctraining?\u201d [If they do not know:] Is it nonacademic professional development? Would you consider the education you received for your certification to be \u201ctraining?\u201d All of it or some of it? What other learning opportunities have you had that did not contribute to the certificates you listed?\nProbe: If you had brought a teaching certificate from another state to this state, would you include it in questions 15 through 18?\nVignette 20: You have a standard state teaching certificate from West Virginia but you no longer live there. West Virginia has a reciprocal agreement with your state of residence that allows you to teach in your state without getting recertified. You have not yet completed the formal paperwork to get a certificate from the state you live in. How would you answer question 15?\nQuestion 21, \u201cHow many total hours did you spend working on school-related activities for this school during your MOST RECENT FULL WEEK of teaching?\u201d:\nProbe: Please tell me what you are thinking as you work through this page.\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-101\nProbe (ask only after questions 21\u201323 have ALL been completed): How did you arrive at your answer? What does \u201cmost recent full week\u201d mean in this question?\nVignette 21 (present only after questions 21\u201323 have ALL been completed; ask as many subcases as you have time for; alternate subcases for different respondents): What would be your \u201cmost recent full week\u201d if you normally work 5-day weeks and\na) it was Friday afternoon when you were answering this question? b) it was Friday morning when you were answering this question? c) it is Tuesday, and last week students had Thanksgiving off. The week before that was a 5-day\nweek. d) it is Tuesday, and one day last week classes were delayed 2 hours owing to icy roads. All classes\nwere held but all periods were shortened accordingly. The week before that was a 5-day week. e) it is Tuesday, and one day last week school closed an hour early. The last period of the day had\nstarted to meet but was canceled. The week before that was a 5-day week.\nQuestion 22, \u201cDuring official school hours, how much time did you spend on the following schoolrelated activities during your MOST RECENT FULL WEEK of teaching at this school?\u201d:\nProbe (ask after question 21 probes and only after questions 21\u201323 have been completed): What does official school hours mean in your own words? Do you work the same schedule every week and every day of the week? [If not:] What varies? Is your schedule for your most recent full week typical of most weeks?\nQuestion 23, \u201cOutside of official school hours, how much time did you spend on the following school-related activities during your MOST RECENT FULL WEEK of teaching at this school?\u201d:\nProbe (ask after question 22 probes and after questions 21\u201323 have been completed): What does this question mean in your own words?\nVignette 23: Your school has added an hour to every student\u2019s day Monday through Thursday to permit school to close at noon every Friday, thereby giving teachers more planning time during the day and a chance to spend more time with their families. You generally use these Friday afternoons between noon and 4 p.m. to grade the week\u2019s papers and plan the next week\u2019s lessons. Would you include this Friday afternoon time in 23b or in 22b?\nSection IV/V Overall:\nProbe: Does the phrase \u201ctotal hours in the week\u201d used in questions 21\u201323 mean something different to you than \u201chours per week\u201d in question 6a?\nObserve: Do the hours for 22 and 23 add up to those listed for 21? Did they make use of the hints and examples to distinguish official and nonofficial hours?\nProbe: Are any of the hours you listed in question 21 not accounted for in questions 22 and 23? [If so:] What were your activities during those additional hours?\nProbe (If hours for 21 are fewer than for 22 plus 23): Which hours did you not think to include in 21? Why was it difficult to think of these?\nProbe: What if anything was confusing on this page? Would this page have been easier to complete if questions 22 and 23 had referred back to question 21? [If unclear:) For instance, \u201cHow many of the\n\n\fE-102 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nhours you listed in question 21 were spent during/outside of official school hours on the following activities?\u201d\nProbe: Is it clear where to put club sponsorships and coaching for which you do not receive additional compensation?\nGeneral Questions for the Questionnaire as a Whole:\nWhat was helpful and unhelpful about the way the questions were laid out on the page? What suggestions do you have for presenting the questions better?\n(Observe if they mention the apple icon as being inappropriate for instructions and directives.)\nWere there questions that were hard to answer without referring to your records? If at the beginning of this booklet we were to advise teachers on the materials it would be helpful to have on hand before starting the questionnaire, what materials should be included?\nWhat questions were most difficult to answer? Why?\nWhat questions might some people feel uncomfortable answering? Why? Are some questions of a sensitive or personal nature? What questions do you think teachers might refuse to answer, or do you think would discourage teachers from mentioning their concerns? What questions might they answer in a way that does not reflect their true beliefs? Why? (If any:) What could we do to help them feel more comfortable with the questions?\nWhat other questions do you wish we had asked about?\n\n\fAppendix E.

The semester before that you took two 3credit physics courses, Electricity & Magnetism and Optics & Waves. You\u2019d never been certified before. Since you received your certification, you\u2019ve been taking an evening course at the local community college on diversity in the classroom as well as a 4-credit chemistry lab course so you can eventually get certified to teach chemistry as well. How would you answer section 3b? What about 3a?\nVignettes (Choose two of the following three vignettes and alternate among participants):\nVignette 3-B1: If you teach half of your courses in Spanish, half in French, and are certified to teach both, which would you consider your main teaching assignment field?\nVignette 3-B2: If you were certified in secondary school geography and were originally hired to teach geography, but you actually teach most of your courses in earth science (geology, biology, environment), which would you consider your main teaching assignment field?\nVignette 3-B3: If you were hired to teach civics and government and you teach four civics sections, but you prefer to teach history, teach history whenever you get the chance, and pride yourself on and have received praise for the ancient history and advanced placement American history classes you started at this school, what would you consider your main teaching assignment field?

Is something useful something that leads to measurable improvement in student performance? To a better atmosphere in the classroom? To your confidence and comfort with the material? What sorts of benefits or detriments resulted from \u201cin-depth study\u201d of your content field? From professional development in computer instruction? From any training you may have received in reading instruction?

Do other teachers treat them as separate situations, interpreting question 5 as referring to tracking, where each class constitutes an achievement or ability group?\nProbe (after questions 5 and 6 have both been answered): What does question 5 mean in your own words? How about question 6? Would other phrasing better convey what you think question 5 means? [If needed:] Is this question just about tracking or about something else?\nVignette 5: Suppose that your school makes every effort to group students by ability level. You are a foreign language teacher who teaches one class each of French I, French II, Spanish I, Spanish II, German I, and German II. Since there are only enough students interested in each language to offer one class in each level of each language, and since people who stick with a language tend to be better students, your first year language students range from low to high ability and achievement, but your continuing second year language students are very able and consistently high achievers. Based on this information, how would you answer question 5?\nQuestion 7a, \u201cOf all the students you teach at this school, how many have an Individual Education Plan (IEP) because they have disabilities or are special education students?\u201d:\nProbe (after they answer 7a, before 7b): How did you arrive at your answer?

You feel you still got what you needed out of the course and have the notes on the portion you missed. Would you answer yes or no?\nQuestion 10, \u201cIn the last 3 years, have you had 8 hours or more of training or professional development on how to teach students with limited English proficiency?\u201d:\nProbe: You answer Yes/No because\u2026?\nObserve: Do they have difficulty recalling education from 3 years ago and estimating hours?\nVignette 10 (present only if not asked after question 8): Suppose within the last 3 years you attended two 4-hour training sessions on this topic but you could not stay until the end of one of them. You feel you still got what you needed out of the course and have the notes on the portion you missed. Would you answer yes or no?\nQuestion 11, \u201cDo you receive your students\u2019 scores on state or local achievement tests?\u201d:\nProbe: What students were you thinking about when you answered this question?\nObserve: Are they only considering the students with limited English?\nQuestion 12a, \u201cTo what extent do you use the information from your students\u2019 test scores to group students into different instructional groups by achievement or ability?\u201d:\nProbe: Are there privacy or confidentiality concerns or restrictions that might prevent teachers from using students\u2019 scores for assigning ability groups even though some might want to do so?\nObserve: Do they mention if they do not have the decision-making authority to assign ability groups? This might affect their answer for \u201cNot at all\u201d which could be \u201cNot within my scope/not my responsibility/not within my power.\u201d\nQuestion 12, \u201cTo what extent do you use the information from your students\u2019 test scores to\u2026\u201d\u2014 Overall Follow-up:\nProbe: Do a, b, and/or c include using test scores to determine what remedial instruction needs to be offered? Is a separate category needed for that?\nProbe: Do test scores help you identify language proficiency deficits? Would that go under a, b, and/or c, or would that be a separate issue?\nProbe: How do you distinguish teaching practice in b from curriculum in c? Is there an overlap?\n\n\fE-108 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nQuestion 13, \u201cTo what extent do you use state or district standards to guide your instructional practice in your main teaching field?\u201d:\nProbe: Are you happy with the state or district standards? Why [or] why not?\nQuestion 14, \u201cDuring your MOST RECENT FULL WEEK, how many total hours did you spend working on school-related activities for this school?\u201d:\nProbe: Please tell me what you are thinking as you work through this page.\nProbe (ask only after questions 14\u201316 have ALL been completed): How did you arrive at your answer? What does \u201cmost recent full week\u201d mean in this question?\nVignette 14 (present only after questions 14\u201316 have ALL been completed; ask as many subcases as you have time for; alternate subcases for different respondents): What would be your \u201cmost recent full week\u201d if you normally work 5-day weeks and,\na) it were Friday afternoon when you were answering this question? b) it were Friday afternoon when you were answering this question? c) it is Tuesday, and last week students had Thanksgiving off. The week before that was a 5-day\nweek. d) it is Tuesday, and one day last week classes were delayed 2 hours owing to icy roads. All classes\nwere held but all periods were shortened accordingly. The week before that was a 5-day week. e) it is Tuesday, and one day last week school closed an hour early. The last period of the day had\nstarted to meet but was canceled. The week before that was a 5-day week.\nQuestion 15, \u201cDuring official school hours, how much time did you spend on the following schoolrelated activities during your MOST RECENT FULL WEEK of teaching at this school?\u201d:\nProbe (ask after question 14 probes and only after questions 14\u201316 have been completed): What does official school hours mean in your own words? Do you work the same schedule every week and every day of the week? [If not:] What varies? Is your schedule for your most recent full week typical of most weeks?\nQuestion 16, \u201cOutside of official school hours, how much time did you spend on the following school-related activities during your MOST RECENT FULL WEEK of teaching at this school?\u201d:\nProbe (ask after question 15 probes and after questions 14\u201316 have been completed): What does this question mean in your own words?\nVignette 16: Your school has added an hour to every student\u2019s day Monday through Thursday to permit school to close at noon every Friday, thereby giving teachers more planning time during the day and a chance to spend more time with their families. You generally use these Friday afternoons between noon and 4 p.m. to grade the week\u2019s papers and plan the next week\u2019s lessons. Where would you include this Friday afternoon time?\nSection IV Overall:\nObserve: Do the hours for 15 and 16 add up to those listed for 14? Did they make use of the hints and examples to distinguish official and nonofficial hours?\n\n\fAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels E-109\nProbe: Are any of the hours you listed in question 14 not accounted for in questions 15 and 16? [If so:] What were your activities during those additional hours?\nProbe (If hours for 14 are fewer than for 25 plus 16): Which hours did you not think to include in 21? Why was it difficult to think of these?\nProbe: What if anything was confusing on this page? Would this page have been easier to complete if questions 15 and 16 had referred back to question 15? [If unclear:) For instance, \u201cHow many of the hours you listed in question 14 were spent during/outside of official school hours on the following activities?\u201d\nProbe: Where to put club sponsorships and coaching for which you do not receive additional compensation?\nQuestion 17, \u201cDo you agree or disagree with the following statements?\u201d:\na. Probe: What is meant by what kind of school?\nb. Probe: What is meant by cooperative effort?\nc. Probe: What does recognized mean in this context? [If needed:] Praise? Merit pay? Some other sort of one-time monetary bonus?\nd. Probe (if they somewhat or strongly disagree): Are other issues such as state funding more relevant to job security than test performance?\ne. Probe (may be sensitive): In your own words, what is this question asking? [If necessary:] Is it asking whether you are worried about the potential for students\u2019 low scores to affect your job security, or is it asking whether you are worried that your own students\u2019 actual performance on tests may affect your job security? Is it asking about potential or actual scores?\nf. Probe: What does positive influence mean? Can a positive influence be a significant detrimental effect or only an increase in the level of your satisfaction? [If needed:] Are the standards a major factor?\ng. Probe: Could you ever have a class size that was too SMALL (rather than too large) and be dissatisfied with that? [If so:] How?\nVignette 17: Your school is overenrolled, and the administration permits 45 students per class. Many of the classes in the school are this large, including all of your classes last year. You got lucky this year and none of your classes are over 15 students. What would you put for question g? Would it help if the question said what time period to consider?\nh. Probe: What is meant by support in this question? (Does the teacher have special needs students in class?) [If needed:] Does it include emotional support of colleagues, the principal? Staff support like teachers\u2019 aides, special ed teachers, librarians, guidance counselors, secretaries? Resources like copy machines, textbooks, library books, AV equipment? The general environment?\ni. Probe: What is meant by coordinate the content in this question? [If needed:] Does it include team teaching? Having a common curriculum? Would it include balancing strengths and weaknesses by having each teacher teach their specialty and handing students off to another teacher the next year?\n\n\fE-110 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nj. Probe: Suppose you have some students who must come to your class late because of jobs or from taking care of siblings. If this is your situation, you may have adjusted your lesson plans to take account of these problems, so they may not be as disturbing for you as for other teachers. How would you answer question j?\nk. Probe: Is doing your best as a teacher even an issue in your school? If teachers have low morale, get little support from parents, and have a low opinion of the students, they may be more concerned about keeping control of the classroom than about doing their best as a teacher. For such teachers, doing your best as a teacher might be considered not a waste of time but a stupid thing to be concerned about, even irresponsible. Is that your situation?\nl. Probe: Is there a librarian or media specialist in your school? What is the difference between librarian and media specialist?\nm. Probe: Is your answer determined relative to what you know about other schools you could be teaching at or relative to what you would like teaching to be like?\nQuestion 17 overall, \u201cDo you agree or disagree with each of the following statements?\u201d:\nEmpathy Probe: This is a list of issues we or the teachers we\u2019ve interviewed consider important, but you should feel free to mention any important issue not on the list.\nQuestion 18, \u201cPlease indicate the extent to which you agree or disagree with each of the following statements\u201d:\nObserve: Do they mention redundancy among items in 17 and those in 18?\n(Before probing on this page, allow respondent to complete the entire page (a through g))\na.

Are these two ways of asking the same question, or are they two different questions separated by a semicolon? [If 2 questions]: What is the difference between the two questions?\nc. Probe: What does \u201cthe way things are run\u201d mean to you? [If needed:] Is it policy set by the principal? How things evolve in the organization of the school?\nd. Probe: What is meant by a higher paying job in this question? [If needed:] Did you interpret the question as meaning a higher paying job in your subject area but not in teaching, or as meaning a higher paying job in school administration (principal, superintendent, school board worker)? Would your answer differ depending on your interpretation of the question?\ne. Probe: Would your answer depend on whether you could go to a completely different school district?\nQuestion 19, \u201cTo the best of your knowledge how often do the following types of problems occur at your school?\u201d:\n(Before probing on this page, allow respondent to complete the entire page (a through p).)\n\n\fAppendix E.

[Only if needed:] That parents do not help with homework? That last year\u2019s teachers or schools were no good? That students are illdisposed towards learning? That students are distracted from learning by concerns about home life? That they are not fed breakfast? Would you rate each question differently? Should these all be separate questions or should they be combined?\n\nSections V and VI Follow-up Probes:\n\nWere there situations where you really did not have a strong opinion either way, for instance in 20, neither agreeing nor disagreeing?

(The study is described in \u201cAppendix E. Report on SASS Cognitive Interviews of Teachers in Two Panels,\u201d of the Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey.) The study recommended significant revisions to the certification and preparation for teaching items. In order to test these revisions, a small-scale cognitive test was conducted in March 2003. This report documents the methodology and findings from the test on the revised items that were proposed for inclusion in the teacher questionnaires.\n\nKey Findings\n\nTesting identified the following cognitive issues with the proposed certification items:\n\n\u2022 Some respondents misunderstood the item on source of degree (i.e., \u201cWas this degree awarded by a university\u2019s College of Education or a college\u2019s School of Education?\u201d).\n\u2022 Table 1 did not contain adequate codes for respondents who earned an associate\u2019s degree in a general subject area.\n\u2022 Testing questions (\u201cHave you taken any of the following tests?\u201d) suffered from recall issues for older teachers and redundancy issues for other teachers (i.e., the same test was reported in multiple items).\n\u2022 The initial series on certification artificially distinguished between number of physical teaching certificates and number of areas in which a teacher is certified to teach. Additionally, the use of \u201cendorsements\u201d in this section confused many respondents.\n\nMethods\n\nCensus Bureau analysts conducted this research from March 21 to 26, 2003, following a calling procedure. Schools were contacted by phone and asked to nominate a teacher to participate in the study. A questionnaire was then faxed to the school and an appointment was set for the researcher to call the teacher directly. A concurrent interview was conducted by phone following a structured protocol (attachment F-1). The probing questions used by the interviewer are listed on this protocol but were not included on the fax that was sent to the school. The interviewer was free to deviate from the protocol as required. The initial proposed certification questions were administered to three respondents. Form 1 was revised based on these interviews and an additional six interviews were conducted with Form 2 (attachment F-2). Interviews lasted 15 to 25 minutes. Characteristics of the participants can be found in table F-1. Teachers were offered a copy of Schools and Staffing Survey, 1999\u20132000: Overview of the Data for Public, Private, Public Charter, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Elementary and Secondary Schools (NCES 2002-313) as an incentive for participating in the study.\n\nTable F-1.

Report on a Follow-up Cognitive Testing to the 2003\u201304 SASS Teacher Questionnaire F-3\nDetailed Findings and Recommendations\nItem 1c: Who Issued Degree\nThe majority of respondents understood this item. The most common explanation was \u201cdid I get my degree in education?\u201d\nRespondent 1 was confused by \u201cuniversity\u2019s college of education\u201d\u2014does this mean the department? She indicated that at the bachelor\u2019s level the degree comes from the college, not the department.\nRespondent 3 understood item \u201cdid I study in the college of education?\u201d However, respondent 5 said \u201cno\u201d but she had taken education methods classes as part of her bachelor\u2019s degree.\nRespondent 9 had some confusion about this item. Partially due to the \u201cor\u201d statement\u2014she thought it was asking if she got her degree from a college OR university in education. Despite this confusion she did answer correctly.\nRecommendation: Add department of education to question stem.\nItem 1d: Codes for Major Field of Study\nRespondent 4 did not find general social science on list, and ended up choosing political science since that was the subject matter of many of his classes.\nItem 3a: Additional Degrees\nFor three respondents (4, 6, and 9) the list did not have good matches for associate\u2019s degree (general education and (2) associate of arts).\nRecommendation: Add more general or other options for social science degrees.\nItem 4: Tests\nThe testing section was problematic for many respondents. In some cases the same test was reported twice. The older respondents had difficulty recalling the name or nature of tests that they have taken.\nRespondent 1 marked yes to state test (options a/b) because the Praxis was required by the state.\nRespondent 2 almost marked yes because he took some tests (to teach Advanced Placement classes and basic technology skills), then he thought the question was interested in a test new teachers are now required to take in his state.\nRespondent 3 took national teacher exam\u2014once to become a teacher and once to become a principal. Did not see this option listed. (This may have been Praxis.)\nRespondent 4 took a preprofessional basic skills test and a state subject matter test. Could not remember the names.\nRespondent 5 took a test in 1991 in college before graduating that was required of people who wanted to become teachers. Did not know name of test.\n\n\fF-4 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nRespondent 6 counted SAT as a test of basic skills in the state she is teaching in. She also had to take an aptitude test to continue in education program.\nRespondent 7 took a test developed by the university and Office of Public Instruction (Department of Education). Initially, she was going to count this test but then decided not to, because it said \u201cstate\u201d and the test was actually given by the university. She remembered taking the Praxis while in university and did not count this as the earlier test.\nRespondent 8 marked yes to \u201ca\u201d because she had to take a test in college to pass. She thinks this was the CAT test (sounded like a department requirement).\nRespondent 9 took a test senior year in college that she had to pass to go on to student teaching. The test was given by the university, but she thinks it was a state test.\nRecommendation: Move Praxis test first. Consider filtering out experienced teachers. Revise state test options to be clearer (developed by state or required by state).\nItem 6: Coursework for Initial Certification\nOnly one respondent had difficulty with this item.\nRespondent 3 initially marked \u201c-\u201d through enrollment in individual courses. He realized it was part of a degree program and changed his response.\nForm 1 Certification\nRespondents 1 and 2 both had one physical certificate that covers two areas. They each handled reporting differently. One listed each as a separate certificate, while the other listed it as one certificate with an endorsement. Respondent 3 also had one certificate with three certification areas. He wanted to list all three in item c and then count his college minor (driver\u2019s ed) as an endorsement. Both respondents who had a minor wanted to count that as an endorsement.\nRecommendation: Revise to include more lines for certification areas and fewer certifications.\nForm 2 Certification\nRespondent 4\u2014This form seemed to work well for this teacher. He has one certificate with many certifications. He mentioned that they have endorsements in Kansas but was not sure how they differ from certifications. He referred to his additional certifications as endorsements but listed them as certifications and said they were different from the endorsements we describe.\nRespondent 5 had similar issues with certification and endorsement\u2014at first she said that she would count English as an endorsement (it was her minor in college) but then as she thought about it, she considered the two equivalent. Essentially read question as\u2014\u201cwhat does it say on my certificate that I can teach?\u201d\nRespondent 7 thought that endorsement section was redundant\u2014she had already told us about her certification. In her mind (and other respondents) they are similar to certification.\n\n\fAppendix F. Report on a Follow-up Cognitive Testing to the 2003\u201304 SASS Teacher Questionnaire F-5\nRespondent 8 had similar issues with endorsement.\nRespondent 9 said she recently ran into problems because her endorsement did not enable her to teach certain levels because it was not the same as certification. However, she was unable to explain the difference.\nRecommendation: Many certificates are endorsed with the teaching areas. In some states the endorsement is required for a minor area (for example, special education or elementary on top of any early childhood certification). Continue to ask the initial question as worded in Form 2, but change follow up to ask \u201cin what content areas does this certificate enable you to teach.\u201d Remove the endorsement item and add entry boxes for reporting additional areas of certification. Ask for one additional physical certificate to handle situations where someone has a waiver or other type of certificate, in addition to their first certificate.

The purpose of the focus groups was to get respondent feedback on issues and the wording of questions that would be included in the Schools and Staffing Survey.\nThe specific tasks performed by ORC Macro under this contract with the Census Bureau included the following:\n\u2022 assisted Census Bureau in development of a screener; \u2022 recruited 48 respondents who met the requirements set out in the screener and were willing to\nparticipate in the groups (24 principals for two groups, majority from public schools, and 24 school employees who were knowledgeable about the school) for a \u201cshow rate\u201d of 8 to 10 participants per group; \u2022 assisted Census Bureau in development of a discussion guide; \u2022 provided an experienced moderator to run the groups; \u2022 conducted two groups at a focus group facility in Calverton, Maryland, and two groups at a facility in Towson, Maryland; \u2022 paid principals $150 and other knowledgeable respondents $100 for participation in the groups; and \u2022 provided an oral report and a top-line report that summarized the respondents\u2019 recommendations for revisions to the questionnaire.\nFollowing discussions between Census Bureau staff and ORC Macro project personnel, screeners were developed for both the Washington- and Baltimore-area groups to identify appropriate respondents. Participation was limited to public school principals and staff, and a mix of participants from different school districts was obtained. Copies of the screeners used for this project are provided in attachment G-1.\nRecruitment\nThe initial contract suggested that respondents be recruited by offering incentives of $50 per person. After a solid week of recruiting for both the Calverton and Towson sites, it was clear that full groups could not be recruited with such a low incentive. Thus, the incentive level needed be raised to the levels cited above. With the new incentive levels four groups were successfully recruited. (See attachment G-2.)\nUnfortunately, the greater Washington/Baltimore area was hit by one of the largest snowstorms in history February 16 and 17, 2003, requiring the groups that originally had been scheduled for February 18 and 20 to be postponed. The rescheduled Baltimore group fell victim to yet another snowstorm, so the groups were eventually held on March 4 and 5.\nDevelopment of the Discussion Guides\nThe discussion guides were developed by the moderator Michael Long with the input and assistance of the Census Bureau client Andy Zukerberg. Copies of the discussion guides are included with this report in attachment G-3.\n\n\fAppendix G. Report on SASS Focus Groups G-3\nComposition of the Focus Groups\nThe focus groups were held in the Washington, DC metropolitan area and the Baltimore metropolitan area. Participants in the focus groups included principals and other knowledgeable respondents (secretaries, administrative assistants, and one assistant to the principal) from the following school districts:\nWashington area \u2022 District of Columbia \u2022 Howard County \u2022 Montgomery County \u2022 Prince Georges County\nBaltimore area \u2022 Anne Arundel County \u2022 Baltimore City \u2022 Baltimore County \u2022 Carroll County\nTen principals participated in the focus groups in each city, for a total of 20 principal respondents. Eleven people participated in the other knowledgeable respondent group in the Washington area, while 6 participated in the Baltimore area group for that population, for a total of 17 other knowledgeable respondents. Thus, the total number of persons involved in the focus groups was 37.\nStrengths and Limitations of Qualitative Research\nFocus groups are a qualitative research method useful for gaining individual perceptions and ideas which are difficult to obtain through quantitative research. Focus groups generate discussion that can lead to the expression of ideas and opinions which might not be expressed using other research methods. The selection of focus group participants is not based upon randomization or other population representative methods. Focus groups are not intended to provide quantifiable data, nor can data from focus groups be generalized to the entire population. The findings only reflect the ideas and beliefs of the focus group participants.\nWithin this context, an important point to consider is that in Maryland more power lies at the district level than it does in many other states. Therefore, some of the findings that come out of these focus groups regarding the relationship between schools and their districts may not be completely generalizable to the country as a whole. For example, principals in these focus groups reported that they have little control over the incentives that are used to recruit teachers to their school. This might be less true in other states where less power is centralized at the school district level.\nFindings\nGaining Participation in the Survey\nParticipants in the \u201cother knowledgeable respondent\u201d sessions indicated that the most important information that they would consider in deciding whether to participate in the survey was the length of time it would require. Their second answer, which they said was nearly as important, was that they would want to know whether or not they were being required to do so by their district. Several participants were\n\n\fG-4 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nconfident that if their district did not require participation, their principals would not participate in the survey.\nOne participant indicated that she was more likely to participate in surveys in which some sort of incentive was provided. When asked how large the incentive would have to be, she commented that even a very small incentive would make her more likely to participate. Several other respondents agreed that even a small incentive would be an important gesture that showed that their time was valued.\nParticipants indicated that Mondays and Fridays were the days on which they and their principals would be least likely to be able to meet with a Census Bureau employee. Most also said, however, that their schedule was difficult to predict and that whether or not their principals would be available for a meeting depended on the events of that particular day.\nMost participants suggested that the best time for a Census Bureau employee to come to their school would be in the late morning between 10:00 and 11:30 a.m. Again, however, most indicated that this was only a general pattern and that their principal\u2019s availability was difficult to predict.\nRecommendations\nIf possible, try to garner support for the Schools and Staffing Survey at the district level; in many cases principals will be more likely to participate in the survey if they know that they are expected to do so by the district.\nTry to schedule meetings with school personnel on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays in the late morning. However, be prepared for principals to occasionally be unavailable for these meetings because of unforeseen events.\nProvide some sort of incentive (even one as small as a pen or pencil) for survey participants.\nTerminology\nWhen asked to define the word \u201cparaprofessional\u201d as it applies to a school setting, over half of respondents referred to someone who provides \u201csupport\u201d or \u201cassistance\u201d for teaching personnel. The second most common answer was that a paraprofessional was someone who lacks the necessary certification, training, or college degree to be considered a professional.\nTable G-1 shows participants\u2019 responses to a question that asked them to identify which school personnel were \u201cparaprofessionals.\u201d The personnel that principals identified as paraprofessionals most often were teachers\u2019 assistants (18 of 19 respondents), special education aides (18), lunch aides (15), and administrative assistants (9). Very few principals identified guidance counselors, teachers, nurses, or librarians as paraprofessionals.\n\n\fAppendix G. Report on SASS Focus Groups G-5\n\nTable G-1. Are the following school personnel \u201cparaprofessionals\u201d?\n\nStaff who answered \u201cyes\u201d\n\nSchool personnel\n\nPrincipals (n = 19)\n\nOther knowledgeable respondents (n = 17)\n\nGuidance counselors\n\n0\n\n2\n\nAdministrative assistants\n\n9\n\n8\n\nTeachers\u2019 assistants\n\n18\n\n16\n\nTeachers\n\n0\n\n1\n\nSpecial education aides\n\n18\n\n16\n\nSchool nurses\n\n2\n\n4\n\nLunch aides\n\n15\n\n8\n\nLibrarians\n\n0\n\n2\n\nSOURCE: Report on SASS Focus Groups, ORC Macro, 2003.\n\nIn the \u201cother knowledgeable respondent\u201d sessions, 16 of 17 participants identified teachers\u2019 assistants and special education aides as paraprofessionals. Eight identified administrative assistants and lunch aides as paraprofessionals, while four or fewer said the same of nurses (4), guidance counselors (2), librarians (2), or teachers (1).\n\nAll participants indicated that the Average Daily Attendance of their school is a figure that is readily available to them. Most indicated that they could easily access this information on a computer, and that it could be calculated by week, month, quarter, or year.\n\nRecommendations\n\nDo not use the term \u201cparaprofessionals\u201d in the school or principal questionnaires without clarifying what is meant by the term.\n\nContinue to ask about Average Daily Attendance in the school or principal questionnaires; participants will have little difficulty providing this information.\n\nOvercrowding\n\nWhen asked to brainstorm ways of measuring overcrowding in schools, the first method that was mentioned in all sessions was comparing school enrollment to building capacity. Some participants, however, warned that state and district officials have different methods of calculating building capacity.\n\nOther measures of overcrowding that were brainstormed by participants were the number of teachers without their own classroom (\u201cfloating teachers\u201d), the number of noninstructional areas that were used for instruction, the number of instructional areas that were used for instruction of a type other than what was intended (e.g., an art room used for a math class), the number of lunch periods in a day, student to teacher ratio, and average class size.\n\nMany participants, particularly principals, did not feel that it was appropriate to use a school\u2019s lunch schedule as a measure of overcrowding because too many other factors might dictate how the lunch schedule was structured. Principals disliked a proposed question that asked for an opinion as to whether a school was overcrowded; they felt that respondents to this question would be likely to overestimate overcrowding in the hope of securing more resources for their school.\n\nAfter brainstorming their own measures of overcrowding, participants were given a list of proposed items from the survey and asked how well these items would measure overcrowding in schools. Participants felt that the best questions were those that asked about the number of nonacademic areas that were used for\n\n\fG-6 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\ninstruction and the number of classroom spaces that were in portable facilities. They indicated that they would have no difficulty providing quantitative answers to these two questions.\nPrincipals in the second session were given a question that asked how many teachers in the school did not have their own classrooms. Most felt that this would be a good measure of overcrowding, but felt that a better phrasing of the question would be to ask, \u201cIn this school, how many floating teachers are there who would otherwise have a classroom?\u201d Principals indicated that \u201cfloating teacher\u201d was a common term that everyone who worked in schools would understand. However, in the group of \u201cother knowledgeable respondents\u201d there was confusion among secretaries over the definition of a \u201cfloating teacher\u201d; some thought that it referred to a substitute teacher that filled in for teachers who were sick.\nRecommendations\nWhen asking about overcrowding in schools, focus on questions that ask how many nonacademic areas are used for instruction, how many classroom spaces are in portable facilities, or how many teachers do not have their own classrooms.\nWhen asking for the number of nonacademic areas that are used for instruction, also give participants the chance to report academic areas that are used for a type of instruction other than what is intended (e.g., an art room that is used for a math class.)\nDo not attempt to infer information about overcrowding from data about the structure of lunch periods in a school.\nUse the phrase \u201cfloating teacher\u201d to refer to teachers that move from room to room. However, because this term is not understood by all school personnel, define it for respondents (e.g., \u201ca teacher with a fulltime course schedule who would normally have his or her own classroom but does not due to space limitations\u201d).\nTeacher Staffing\nPrincipals were shown question 21 from the principal survey and asked whether they felt that the available six choices covered all of the possible barriers to dismissing a teacher. Overwhelmingly, principals felt that the biggest barriers to dismissal were the time that it takes to go through the dismissal process (which several indicated is over a year long) and the effort necessary to gather the necessary documentation about teacher performance. They did not feel that these barriers were clearly reflected in the six available choices.\nA few principals felt that choice F (\u201cdismissal is too stressful and uncomfortable for those involved\u201d) was not a valid barrier to dismissal, since they believed that this stress and discomfort should never affect principals\u2019 decisions. More, however, believed that this choice could indeed pose a barrier in some cases. Principals interpreted choice F in two ways. Some focused on the discomfort that might arise when they were forced to tell a hard-working teacher that he or she was incompetent. Others, however, referred to the stress that the dismissal of a teacher might place on the relationship between an administrator and the rest of the faculty. These two interpretations were sufficiently different that option F could probably be split into two choices.\nPrincipals indicated that there were other factors that could constitute barriers to teacher dismissal that were not available as choices on question 21. One commented that a teacher shortage at a school might make it difficult to dismiss a teacher, while another suggested that teachers might have \u201cpolitical\n\n\fAppendix G. Report on SASS Focus Groups G-7\nconnections\u201d (e.g., with district officials) that would make them difficult to dismiss. Other principals mentioned that a teacher\u2019s popularity among the student or parent body could be a barrier to dismissal.\nWhen asked whether they would be able to answer questions about the incentives that were used to recruit teachers to their school, principals were divided. About half felt that because teacher contracts were handled at the district level, the district might use incentives of which they were unaware. Other principals were confident that they could identify all incentives that were being used by their district.\nPrincipals were also shown question 42b from the school questionnaire, which asked which methods their school had used to cover teaching vacancies for the present school year. Most principals felt that the eight available choices covered all of the possible ways of covering vacancies. One pointed out that teachers could voluntarily opt to teach classes in another subject, which is not an available option on this item. Another mentioned that an increasingly common practice was hiring previously retired teachers; she agreed, however, that this practice could fall under choice A (\u201chiring a fully-qualified teacher\u201d).\nWhen asked whether they could answer a question about how difficult or easy it was to fill vacancies in different fields, principals overwhelmingly agreed that they could answer the question as it applied to their own school.\nSecretaries who participated in the \u201cother knowledgeable respondent\u201d sessions were not able to answer very many questions about teacher staffing; for the most part they indicated that this was a part of school operations about which they did not know a great deal.\nRecommendations\nIn question 21 on the principal questionnaire add another option: \u201cTime and effort required to obtain necessary teacher assessment documentation.\u201d Remove option C, as this will be covered under this new choice.\nAlso in question 21, divide option F into two choices: \u201cPersonal discomfort with dismissing a teacher\u201d and \u201cResulting tension between principal and rest of faculty.\u201d\nAlso in question 21, add two more options: \u201cShortage of teachers at school\u201d and \u201cOpposition from student and/or parent bodies.\u201d\nAsk questions about incentives used to recruit teachers on the district questionnaire, not the principal or school questionnaires.\nDo not ask questions about teacher staffing on the school questionnaire; some of the personnel who are completing these questionnaires will not fully understand staffing issues.\nReword the stem for question 42b on the school questionnaire. The current stem defines a teaching vacancy as a position for which candidates are recruited or interviewed. However, principals in these groups indicated that their vacancies are often filled by teachers who are reassigned to them by the district. Since these teachers are neither recruited nor interviewed, none of these vacancies would be covered under the current wording of 42b.\nRemove option F from question 42b. This option is out-of-place here, because having teachers teach classes in another subject would not necessarily \u201cfill\u201d a vacancy (unless these teachers\u2019 courseloads were increased, which would be covered under option E.) The reason that option F is currently included, it seems, is to measure how often teachers are asked to teach outside of their specialty or area of\n\n\fG-8 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\ncertification. However, this could be better measured in a different series of questions that did not relate to teacher hiring.\nPrincipal Time Use\nWhen principals were shown question 11 from the principal survey, they indicated that they found it very difficult to break the time they spent performing their job into different categories using percentages. The reason for this, they felt, was that so many of their activities could fall into more than one category; for example, walking around the halls could be considered both interacting with students and maintaining school safety. Some suggested that the question would be more informative if principals were asked to indicate both how their time was currently spent and how they would ideally like to spend their time.\nBecause principals in the first session had so much difficulty answering question 11 from the principal survey, in the second session principals were asked to evaluate different items relating to time use. When asked how many hours they spent on all school-related activities in the last full week of school, principals indicated that this question needed more clarification. For example, principals were unsure whether time at school should be counted if teachers or students were not present, or if time spent at school functions on weekends should be included. Principals agreed, however, that if the question were more explicit they would be able to answer it accurately.\nMost principals were not able to answer a question that asked how many hours they were required to work to receive base pay; many indicated that no such figure was stipulated on their contract. Those principals that did answer the question calculated an answer by multiplying by five the number of benefit hours they receive for a sick or personal day. In general, however, principals indicated that this figure had no meaning for them.\nWhen shown questions that asked them to give data from the \u201clast full week of school,\u201d principals in both sessions commented that at many points during the school year they could go a month or more without having a full week of school. Most indicated that their answers to these questions would likely be based on a \u201ctypical\u201d week of school, rather than the last full week.\nPrincipals found it very difficult to estimate the number of hours that they spent interacting with students because they were unsure what types of interaction to include. The biggest source of confusion was whether \u201cinformal\u201d interaction, such as conversations that took place during lunch duty or in the halls, should be counted. Others remarked that because so many of their interactions with students last only one or two minutes (e.g., conversations in the halls) they found it difficult to aggregate these into a number of hours per week. However, principals agreed that it was important to include some measure of student interaction in the survey, and felt that if the question were clarified they would be able to answer fairly accurately.\nRecommendations\nDo not ask principals to estimate the percentage of their time they spend on different categories of activities, as was asked in the original question 11.\nIn order to get an estimate of the percentage of their work time that principals spend interacting with students, ask them (a) how many hours per week they spend on all school-related activities and (b) how many hours per week they spend interacting with students. However, provide further elaboration for both questions:\n\n\fAppendix G. Report on SASS Focus Groups G-9\n\u2022 In question (a) indicate that respondents should \u201cinclude time spent outside of the school building, as well as time spent outside of school hours and on weekends.\u201d\n\u2022 In question (b) indicate that respondents should \u201cinclude informal interactions with students, such as those that occur in the halls, during lunch periods, or at functions outside of normal school hours.\u201d\nDo not ask principals for the number of hours that they are required to work by contract; this figure seems to be meaningless to most principals.\nNational School Lunch Program and Title I\nParticipants in the other knowledgeable respondent sessions reported that the person who tracked the number of students who participated in the National School Lunch Program at their school was a cafeteria manager, an assistant principal, or a secretary. (In some cases, they reported that they kept these records themselves.) A large majority indicated that they could access this information easily, either from their computer system, a log, or by speaking to another person in the school.\nAlmost all participants reported that they would not be able to answer questions about how many students were eligible for free and reduced-price lunches. Most indicated that students\u2019 eligibility was determined at the district level, so school personnel would have no way of knowing the students that were eligible but had not applied. As a result, some secretaries in these sessions did not even understand what was meant by \u201celigibility\u201d for the lunch program; some suggested that all were eligible, since they could all fill out an application form.\nMost participants who worked in Title I schools indicated that the person who tracked Title I information was a school administrator, such as an assistant principal. Most reported that if they needed Title I information to fill out a survey, they would be able to get it without difficulty. Because they could not access it directly by themselves, however, some secretaries commented that getting this information would be more difficult and would take more time than getting information about free and reduced-price lunches. Less than half of participants who worked in Title I schools understood the difference between targeted assistance and schoolwide Title I assistance.\nRecommendations\nInclude on the school questionnaire questions about students who receive free or reduced-price lunches; the school personnel who will complete these questionnaires will have ready access to this information.\nDo not use the school questionnaire to ask questions about the number of students that are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches; because student eligibility is often determined at the district level, school personnel will be unable to answer these questions.\nAsk questions about Title I on the principal questionnaire rather than the school questionnaire; some personnel who fill out school questionnaires might not be knowledgeable about the program. In particular, at schools that receive schoolwide Title I services, administrative personnel who are not involved in school finances may not realize that the school is involved in the Title I program at all.\nTesting\nParticipants in all sessions were very confident that their district knew about every assessment that takes place in their school (aside from assessments associated with an individual teacher\u2019s class). In fact, most indicated that they received directions for how and when to conduct all assessments directly from their\n\n\fG-10 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\ndistrict offices. However, several principals in the second group commented that while district officials would know which kinds of testing were taking place, they would not be knowledgeable about how these assessments were impacting the school program; questions about this impact would best be directed to the school or the principal.\nRecommendations\nAsk questions about the types of testing that take place either on the school questionnaire or on the district questionnaire; both groups will be able to provide the same information.\nAsk questions about the effect of testing on school operations on the school questionnaire, rather than the district questionnaire.\n\n\fAppendix G.

Introduction of Topic\n\u201cThe purpose of this focus group is for you to provide information that will be used to fine-tune questions on a national survey of schools called the Schools and Staffing Survey. This survey is conducted every 4 years by the Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics. The survey gathers national data on teacher demand and shortages, teacher and administrator characteristics, school programs, and general conditions in schools.\nEach year that the survey is conducted, the questions it asks are reviewed and adjusted to make sure that they are relevant and appropriate. The information you give tonight will help the test designers as they go through that process.\nThere are several types of questionnaires that will be delivered to schools as part of the Schools and Staffing Survey. One of these is designed to be filled out by someone at the school who knows a great deal about the operations of the school. Often this person ends up being an administrative employee in the front office. For that reason, we\u2019re excited to get your perspective on these topics related to the survey.\u201d\n4. Participant Introductions\n\u201cBefore beginning our discussion, I\u2019d like to have you go around the table and introduce yourselves. Please give your first name only, and the school and district where you work.\u201d\n\n\fAppendix G. Report on SASS Focus Groups G-21\n5. Title I/School Lunch Program\n\u201cThe survey asks several questions about students that participate in the National School Lunch Program, which is the program through which students can get free and reduced price lunches.\u201d\n\u2022 Who at your school tracks data on how many students participate in this program? \u2022 How easily available to you is this data?\n\u201cThe survey also asks questions about students that receive Title I services. Title I is a federally funded program that provides educational services to children who live in areas with high concentrations of lowincome families.\u201d\n\u2022 Who at your school tracks data on how many students receive Title I services? \u2022 How easily available to you is this data?\n[Hand out Sheet 1: Questions on Free and Reduced-Price Lunches and Title I. This sheet would contain questions 55a\u2013d, 56, 57a\u2013b, 58a\u2013b from the school survey.]\n\u201cThese are the proposed questions for the survey that apply to these two programs.\u201d\n\u2022 How easily would you be able to answer these questions? \u2022 Are any of these questions unclear or confusing? \u2022 How clear to you is the distinction between students who are eligible for free or reduced-price\nlunches and those that are approved for these lunches?\n6. Overcrowding\n\u201cOne of the topics that this survey addresses is how crowded schools are.\u201d\n\u2022 How do you know if your school is overcrowded? \u2022 If you were trying to convince someone that your school was overcrowded, what evidence would\nyou use?\nProbe: How easy or difficult would it be for you to collect this evidence?\n[At this point, moderator will hand out Sheet 2: Proposed Questions about Overcrowding. This sheet will have on it questions 10a, 12, 13a\u2013c, and 14 from the school survey.]\n\u201cThe survey designers have been experimenting with different methods of measuring crowding in schools. Do you think that these questions would be good measures of overcrowding?\u201d\nProbe: Which of these methods do you think would work best? Would this information be easily available to you? How easy or difficult would these questions be for you to answer?\n7. Terminology: Average Daily Attendance\n[NOTE: Depending on the responses of participants to the pregroup questionnaire, this section possibly could be omitted.]\n\n\fG-22 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\u201cBefore this focus group began you all filled out a questionnaire. One of the questions asked you how you would measure the \u2018average daily attendance\u2019 of your school.\u201d\n\u2022 Is this figure readily available to you? \u2022 If not, how you would you calculate this figure?\n8. Hiring/Firing (if time is short, possibly skip to Section 9)\n\u201cThe Schools and Staffing Survey asks a number of questions about teacher staffing. Because of this, the sponsors of the survey are interested in learning in more detail about the process through which teachers are hired and fired.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s begin by walking through the process of hiring a teacher.\u201d\n\u2022 At what point in the year are openings for the next year identified? \u2022 How are candidates recruited? \u2022 On what criteria are candidates judged? Who determines these criteria? \u2022 Who is responsible for making hiring decisions? What role does the district have in these\ndecisions?\n\u201cNow I\u2019d like to walk through the process of dismissing a teacher. We are not interested in teachers who are dismissed because of budget cuts or declining enrollment, but those that are dismissed due to poor performance.\u201d\n\u2022 Who makes the first determination that a teacher should be dismissed? \u2022 On what information is this decision based? \u2022 After this decision is made, what steps must take place before the dismissal is finalized?\n9. Gaining Participation in the Survey\n\u201cFinally, I\u2019d like to ask you about the factors that would make you more or less likely to participate in the survey.\u201d\n\u2022 What information would you want to know before deciding to complete the survey and send it in?\n\u201cThe survey process will work in the following way: A Census Bureau employee will first call your school to make an appointment to come in. At the appointed time, the Census Bureau employee will then come to your school, meet with school personnel including the principal, and distribute the questionnaires.\u201d\n\u2022 On which days of the week would it be easiest for you to meet with the Census employee when he or she came in to collect the form and discuss the survey?\n\u2022 At what times in the day would it be easiest for you to meet with the Census employee when he or she came in to collect the form and discuss the survey?\n\u2022 On which days of the week would it be best for the Census employee to meet with the principal about the survey?\n\u2022 At what times in the day would it be best for the Census employee to meet with the principal about the survey?\n\n\fAppendix G.

This front of this sheet will contain question 21 from the principals\u2019 survey.]\n\u201cThis question would ask principals whether or not each of the options is a barrier to dismissing poor or incompetent teachers.\u201d\n\u2022 What barriers are missing from this list? \u2022 Are any of these options unclear or poorly phrased? \u2022 Are any of these options irrelevant or unnecessary?\n[On back of Sheet 3 will be question 23 from the district survey.]\n\u201cIf you look at the back of this sheet, you will see another proposed question for the survey. This question asks which types of pay incentives, if any, a district uses to recruit or retain teachers.\u201d\n\u2022 Are these types of incentives given at the school or district level? Are there incentives given by the district that you might not know about?\n[Hand out Sheet 4: More Proposed Questions on Teacher Staffing. This sheet will have on it a question about how open positions are filled.]\n\n\fAppendix G. Report on SASS Focus Groups G-31\n\u201cThis question asks principals to identify all the ways that teaching vacancies were filled at their school for the current school year.\u201d\n\u2022 Are there any methods of filling vacancies that should be included on this list but are not? \u2022 Are any of these choices unclear or difficult to understand?\n[On back of Sheet 4 will be a question about how difficult or easy it was to fill vacancies in different fields.]\n\u201cThis question asks principals to identify how difficult or easy it was to fill vacancies in different fields for the current school year.\u201d\n\u2022 Would you be able to answer this question? \u2022 Would your central district office be better able to answer this question than you?\n\u201cNow I\u2019d like you to walk through with me the process of begin by walking through the process of dismissing a teacher. We are not interested in teachers who are dismissed because of budget cuts or declining enrollment, but those that are dismissed due to poor performance.\u201d\n\u2022 Who makes the first determination that a teacher should be dismissed? \u2022 On what information is this decision based? \u2022 After this decision is made, what steps must take place before the dismissal is finalized?\n\u201cNow let\u2019s walk through the process of hiring a teacher.\u201d\n\u2022 At what point in the year are openings for the next year identified? \u2022 How are candidates recruited? \u2022 On what criteria are candidates judged? Who determines these criteria? \u2022 Who is responsible for making hiring decisions? What role does the district have in these\ndecisions?\n8. Testing\n\u201cThe next topic that I would like to discuss with you tonight is testing that takes place in your school.\u201d\n\u2022 Aside from tests and grades given by individual teachers to their own classes, what assessments are given in your school?\n\u2022 What is the role of the district in administering state and national tests? \u2022 Are there any assessments that take place in your school that the district does not know about?\n9. Gaining Participation in the Survey\n\u201cFinally, I\u2019d like to ask you about the factors that would make you more or less likely to participate in the survey.\u201d\n\u2022 What information would you want to know before deciding to complete the survey and send it in?\n\u201cThe survey process will work in the following way: A Census Bureau employee will first call your school to make an appointment to come in. At the appointed time, the Census Bureau employee will come\n\n\fG-32 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nto your school, have a brief meeting with school personnel including the principal, and distribute the questionnaires to be filled out at a later time.\u201d\n\u2022 On which days of the week would it be easiest for you to meet with the Census employee and receive your form?\n\u2022 At what times during the day would it be easiest for you to meet with the Census employee and receive your form?\n\u2022 At your school, who would be the most appropriate person to contact to set up this appointment?\n\n\fAppendix G.

Charter School Information...............................................................................................H-37\n\n\fH-2 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nBackground\nThis report reflects the evaluation by the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Center for Survey Methods Research (CSMR) of the 2003\u201304 Public School Questionnaire from the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). The purpose of this evaluation was to examine respondents\u2019 reactions to both the new and revised questions, their ability to follow skip patterns in the self-administered form, and their knowledge of the requested information.\nThis evaluation followed a series of focus groups that were conducted by a contractor and are reported separately. (See \u201cAppendix G. Report on SASS Focus Groups,\u201d of the Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey.) Several changes to the questions were incorporated based on results from the focus group. These and further changes were investigated through cognitive testing. The following key concepts were examined through questions in the structured protocol:\n\u2022 familiarity with the concept of Average Daily Attendance and ability to calculate; \u2022 understanding and clarity of definitions for transitional kindergarten, transitional first grade, and\nlibrary media center; \u2022 quality of data gathered by new overcrowding questions; \u2022 familiarity with special programs (e.g., International Baccalaureate and Specialized Career\nAcademy) and understanding of American Indian and Alaska Native coursework; \u2022 counts of substitute teachers as an indicator of teacher absenteeism; \u2022 clarity of questions on technology; \u2022 familiarity with the term Limited-English Proficiency; \u2022 clarity of Title I and free and reduced-price lunch counts; and \u2022 charter school identification.\nIn the next section, the methodology used to conduct the interviews is described. Following that, the results of the interviews are documented. The questions are presented in the order of their appearance in the questionnaire as it was tested.\nResearch Methods\nIn March and April of 2003, CSMR staff conducted cognitive interviews with 12 respondents in Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, and West Virginia. An incentive of $35 was provided.\nInterviews ranged in duration from 45 minutes to an hour and a half and were audiotaped after gaining respondents\u2019 consent. Since the form is self-administered, respondents were instructed to read aloud as well as think aloud while completing the questions. After each section, respondents were asked to stop and revisit earlier questions with the interviewer. Structured, as well as unstructured, probes were administered retrospectively, after each section. There were five sections, which ranged from 5 to 17 questions each. The interview was conducted in this manner to minimize disrupting the flow of the selfadministered form while still gathering information on respondents\u2019 answering techniques soon after the questions were answered.\nA few questions were omitted from the cognitive test due to the fact that time was limited and these items were time-consuming and gathered administrative data. These were the counts of students and teachers by race and Hispanic origin and staffing counts. These questions have been used in the past and were not changed substantially (only formatting and the order of the questions had been changed at the time of the cognitive test) for the 2003\u201304 SASS. Respondents were simply told to skip these items during the\n\n\fAppendix H. Results of the Cognitive Pretest on SASS Public School Questions H-3\ncognitive test. In the question-by-question review, the omitted questions are noted as missing items where they would have appeared.\nA few questions in the survey were skipped by most respondents, thus were not tested as rigorously as the other items. These cases are noted. After discussing the concerns and recommendations with sponsors, some items were moved within the questionnaire or changed based on concerns that were out-of-scope for the cognitive test. These changes are not documented in this report because they were not a result of the cognitive testing.\nRespondent Characteristics\nRespondents from public schools in Maryland, the District of Columbia, Virginia, and West Virginia were interviewed. Six of the schools were elementary schools, four were middle schools, and two were high schools. One school was a public charter school; another was a magnet school. There was wide variety among the schools in terms of the student population, socioeconomic status, extent of English language fluency, number of students with Individual Education Plans (IEPs), and level of participation in the free or reduced-price lunch program.\nRecruiting was conducted through school board offices and by contacting schools directly, and the interviews were conducted in the school offices. Ten of the respondents were school principals. Two were assistant principals.\nGeneral Findings\nBoth principals and assistant principals had no problems completing the items due to lack of access to information requested in the questionnaire. None of the respondents reported thinking that any of the questions were too difficult or sensitive.\nOne notable general problem was that respondents had difficulty with the skip patterns in the form. One respondent always took the skip, whether or not her answer corresponded to the skip pattern (e.g., whenever she saw the indication that a skip was available, she read it and skipped to that question). Other respondents answered questions that they were instructed to skip. Many respondents went back and read the instruction to skip only after they came to a question that did not logically follow their answer to the previous question. For this reason, it was recommended that careful attention be paid to any edits to the data. In all cases, respondents answered the first question in the series correctly; when they went on to answer questions that they should not have, these answers sometimes provided misleading data.\nQuestion-by-Question Findings\nI. General Information About This School\n1. Which of the following grades are offered in this school? Mark (X) all that apply. (Response options Kindergarten through 12th and ungraded)\nConcerns: None\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\n\n\fH-4 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\n2a. Around the first of October, how many students in grades K\u201312 and comparable ungraded levels were enrolled in this school (e.g., in the grades checked above in item 1)? Do NOT include prekindergarten, postsecondary, or adult education students\n\n__ Students\n\nConcerns: None\n\nRecommendation: None\n\nResolution: No change\n\n2b. How many of these students were migrant students? (Migrant students are those who move from school to school because they are children of migrant agricultural workers, including migratory dairy workers and migratory fishers.)\n\n___ Migrant Students\n\nConcerns: None\n\nRecommendation: None\n\nResolution: Changed to make consistent with Items 1, 3, and 4. Added note not to include prekindergarten, postsecondary, or adult education. This question was reworded as follows:\n\nAround the first of October, how many migrant students attended this school? * Do NOT include prekindergarten, postsecondary, or adult education students. * Migrant students are those who move from school to school because they are children of migrant agricultural workers, including migratory dairy workers and migratory fishers.\n\n__ None\n\nOR\n\n/__/__/__/__/ Migrant students\n\n3. Around the first of October, how many MALE students attended this school? * Do NOT include prekindergarten, postsecondary, or adult education students.\n\n____ Male Students\n\nConcerns: None\n\nRecommendation: None\n\nResolution: No change\n\nItem 4 was not tested.\n\n5. For this school year (2003\u20132004), what is the Average Daily Attendance (ADA) at this school?\n\n_____ Students\n\nConcern: Most respondents had these data available as a percentage. They had to convert them back into number of students. Some respondents did this, but others simply reported the percentage in the response\n\n\fAppendix H. Results of the Cognitive Pretest on SASS Public School Questions H-5\nboxes (e.g., 94, 94.6). This resulted in extremely low ADAs in some cases, and a higher number of students attending than enrolled in others (because one of these schools had 600 students and the other had only 88).\nRecommendation: For this school year (2003\u201304), what is the percentage of Average Daily Attendance (ADA) at this school?\nResolution: The question was changed as follows to request percentages rather than numbers:\nFor this school year (2003\u20132004), what is the Average Daily Attendance (ADA) at this school? (expressed to the nearest whole percent)?\n_ _ % Students\n6. How long is the school day for students in this school?* Report BOTH hours and minutes, e.g., 6 hours and 0 minutes, 5 hours and 45 minutes, etc. If the length of day varies by grade level, record the longest day.\n__ Hours AND __Minutes\nConcerns: None\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\n7a. Does this school have a kindergarten, transitional kindergarten, or transitional first grade? *Transitional (or readiness) kindergarten is an extra year of school for kindergarten-age children who are judged not ready for kindergarten. * Transitional first (or prefirst) grade is an extra year of school for children who have attended kindergarten but have been judged not ready for first grade.\n__ Yes __ No \u00c6 GO TO Item 8.\nConcern: There is concern that kindergarten is being underreported, since the emphasis on transitional grades is very heavy. Several elementary school respondents, after reading the descriptions of transitional kindergarten and first grade marked \u201cno,\u201d even though they have kindergarten. They had forgotten that regular kindergarten is also included in the question.\nRecommendation: These questions should be separated.\nResolution: This question was reworded as follows:\nDoes this school have a kindergarten? *Include regular kindergarten as well as transitional kindergarten and transitional first grade.\n\n\fH-6 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n7b. How long is the school day for a kindergarten, transitional kindergarten, or transitional first grade student? * Mark (X) only one box.\n__ Full day (4 hours or more per day) __ Half day (less than 4 hours per day) __ Both offered\nConcerns: None\nRecommendation: Make consistent with 7a.\nResolution: The question was revised to be consistent with 7a as follows:\nHow long is the school day for a kindergarten student?\n7c. How many days per week does a kindergarten, transitional kindergarten, or transitional first grade student attend? * If the number of days per week varies (e.g., some students attend 3 days per week and some attend 5 days per week), record the most days that a student would attend in a week.\n__Days per week\nConcerns: None\nRecommendation: Make consistent with 7a.\nResolution: The question was revised to be consistent with 7a as follows:\nHow many days per week does a kindergarten student attend?\n8. When this school was built (and, if applicable, most recently renovated) for how many students was it designed? * Do not count temporary buildings.\n__Students\nConcern: This question asks for the building capacity when the school was built. Several respondents noted that the capacity had changed over time, even though the building itself had not changed. They reported receiving information from the facilities\u2019 manager, the board office, or other staff. Sometimes it was based on square footage, student/teacher ratios, or other factors. There are guidelines for determining building capacity that are subject to change.\nRecommendation: Since this question invokes a possibly different aspect of capacity (e.g., historical capacity), this question should be revised. Given that there is a number for capacity that respondents can look up, it was decided to ask for the current capacity with the understanding that it may change from year to year.\nResolution: The question was revised to ask for current capacity as follows:\nWhat is the current capacity of this school? * Do not count capacity of temporary buildings.\n\n\fAppendix H. Results of the Cognitive Pretest on SASS Public School Questions H-7\n9a. Does this school have one or more temporary buildings?\n__ No \u00c6 GO TO Item 10. __ Yes\nConcern: This seems to be a good measure of overcrowding; however, it does not ask if the temporary buildings are currently being used for students. One school which had been overcrowded prior to redistricting still had a temporary building that was used for storage. The respondent reported this and gave a capacity for item 9b even though no students are housed there, and he stated that he is under capacity.\nRecommendation: Does this school have one or more temporary buildings that are used as classrooms or office space?\nResolution: No change. This question does provide an indication of capacity. Temporary buildings, despite how they may be used, provide additional capacity for the school.\n9b. For how many students (was this/were these) temporary building(s) designed?\n__ Students\nConcern: Respondents almost always reported a typical class size (or the number of desks in the classroom) as the capacity for the temporary buildings. One respondent could not give an answer at all because one of the buildings is used for offices, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, gifted, tech support, art and music, so students come and go but no students are housed there.\nRecommendation: How many classrooms are located in the temporary buildings?\nResolution: Made the current question consistent with question 8. It is of interest how many students could be housed in the temporary buildings, not how many are currently housed there. This deals with giving an estimate of possible capacity to compare to enrollment. Revised question as follows:\nWhat is the current capacity of the temporary building(s)?\n10. Does this school use common areas such as the cafeteria, gymnasium, or other nonacademic areas for instructional purposes to accommodate for an overflow of students?\n__ Yes __ No\nConcerns: None. This new question performed well. Respondents were able to discriminate between areas that were used intentionally and those that were used due to lack of space.\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\n11. Do you have any teachers who do not have their own classrooms due to a lack of space?\n__ Yes __ No\n\n\fH-8 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nConcern: This seemed to work pretty well. There was some disagreement among respondents as to whether special teachers and part-time teachers counted. However, it did work well to discriminate those schools with no overcrowding versus those schools with substantial overcrowding.\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\n12. Does this school have a library or library media center? (A library media center is an organized collection of printed and/or audiovisual and/or computer resources which is administered as a unit, is located in a designated place or places, and makes resources and services available to students, teachers, and administrators.) (A library media center may be called a library, media center, resource center, information center, instructional materials center, learning resource center, or some other name.)\n__ Yes __ No\nConcern: Very few of the respondents read the notes, because they felt comfortable answering without reading them. The one person who did read it thought that some of the terms (e.g., resource center, learning resource center) were specific to special education, rather than regular education.\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\nII. Admissions, Programs, and Performance\n13. What type of school is this? * Mark (X) the box that best describes this school.\n__ REGULAR elementary or secondary\n__ Elementary or secondary with a SPECIAL PROGRAM EMPHASIS (such as a science/math school, performing arts school, talented/gifted school, foreign language immersion school, etc.)\n__ SPECIAL EDUCATION - primarily serves students with disabilities\n__ VOCATIONAL/TECHNICAL - primarily serves students being trained for occupations\n__ ALTERNATIVE - offers a curriculum designed to provide alternative or nontraditional education; does not specifically fall into the categories of regular, special program, special education, or vocational school - Please describe.\nConcern: The one charter school respondent did not know there were later questions about charter schools, and he wanted to note here that he was a charter school. He answered \u201calternative\u201d and wrote in \u201cpublic charter.\u201d\nRecommendation: Either add an alternative for charter schools or instruct respondent how to answer (e.g., give an example where it is intended).\n\n\fAppendix H. Results of the Cognitive Pretest on SASS Public School Questions H-9\nResolution: Schools can be charter schools and vary along these dimensions. The screener question for charter schools (62) will be inserted after this question to allow charter schools to express their uniqueness. It will still be asked again as a screener prior to the other charter school items.\nIn an effort to make the question more specific, the question was reworded as follows:\nWhich of the following best describes this school\u2019s major program emphasis? *Mark (X) one box.\n14. Is this ENTIRE SCHOOL specifically for students who have been suspended or expelled, who have dropped out, or who have been referred for behavioral or adjustment problems?\n__ Yes __ No\nConcerns: None\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\n15a. Does this school have a magnet program? (A magnet program offers enhancements such as special curricular themes or methods of instruction to attract students from outside their normal attendance area.)\n__ Yes __ No \u00c6 GO TO item 16 on page --.\nConcern: One respondent thought that, by nature, charter schools offer special programs and should be included.\nRecommendation: Instruct charter schools how to answer.\nResolution: See resolution to item 13. Charter schools are given the opportunity prior to this question to express their special programs.\n15b. Is this a school-wide magnet program in which all students in this school participate in the program?\n__ Yes __ No\nConcerns: None\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\n\n\fH-10 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n15c. Is this magnet program intended to encourage students of different racial or ethnic backgrounds to enroll in this school for the purposes of creating racial balance or reducing racial isolation?\n__ Yes __ No\nConcerns: None\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\n16. Does this school have any special requirements for admission other than proof of immunization, age, or residence?\n__ Yes __ No \u00c6 GO TO item 18 on page --.\nConcerns: None\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\n17. Does this school use the following requirements for admission?\na. Admission test\n__ Yes __ No\nb. Standardized achievement test\n__ Yes __ No\nc. Academic record\n__ Yes __ No\nd. Special student needs (e.g., students \u201cat risk\u201d or with disabilities)\n__ Yes __ No\ne. Special student aptitudes, skills, or talents\n__ Yes __ No\n\n\fAppendix H. Results of the Cognitive Pretest on SASS Public School Questions H-11\nf. Personal interview\n__ Yes __ No\ng. Recommendations\n__ Yes __ No\nConcern: Not all respondents skipped correctly after item 16. Some consequently had difficulty with this item. For example, schools without admissions requirements had difficulty answering questions about using academic records and personal interviews\u2014which they do use as part of the admissions procedure, just not as a criterion. Do edits correct for the wrongly answered items?\nRecommendation: Ensure that edits erase data for item 17 if item 16 is marked \u201cno.\u201d\nResolution: The National Center for Education Statistics is going to evaluate this.\n18. Does this school receive performance reports from the district that cover such things as students\u2019 scores on achievement tests or graduation rates?\n__ Yes \u00c6 GO TO item 20. __ No \u00c6 GO TO item 19.\nConcerns: All respondents marked yes to this item. They receive performance reports from the district, region, and/or state.\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\n19. Regardless of source, does your school have performance reports? __ Yes \u00c6 GO TO item 20. __ No \u00c6 GO TO item 21.\nConcern: Almost everyone in the test skipped this item.\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\n20. Does this school use these performance reports to -\na. Evaluate the progress of students in this school?\n__ Yes __ No\n\n\fH-12 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nConcern: A few respondents mentioned that they were not sure how to interpret this question. One indicated that performance reports do not determine the child\u2019s progression to or retention in a grade level, but he still answered affirmatively. Another respondent said no because teachers, not the school, evaluate the progress of the students. Recommendation: None Resolution: No change\nb. Determine the next year\u2019s instructional focus? __ Yes __ No\nConcerns: None Recommendation: None Resolution: No change\nc. Realign the curriculum, such as with content standards and/or other indicator criteria? __ Yes __ No\nConcerns: None Recommendation: None Resolution: No change\nd. Inform parents and the community of the school\u2019s progress? __ Yes __ No\nConcerns: None Recommendation: None Resolution: No change\ne. Prompt school-level initiatives for improvement? __ Yes __ No\nConcern: Several respondents mentioned that they thought this was a repeat of a previously asked item (b or c). Recommendation: Evaluate meaning and whether other questions gather the same data.\n\n\fAppendix H. Results of the Cognitive Pretest on SASS Public School Questions H-13\nResolution: No change\n21. Does this school offer the following programs?\na. Programs with special instructional approaches (e.g., Montessori, self-paced instruction, open education, ungraded classrooms, etc.)\n__ Yes __ No\nConcern: This question was interpreted very broadly by respondents. There were \u201cyes\u201d answers for a multi-age (1st and 2nd grade) classroom, reading recovery, special education (use self-paced instruction).\nRecommendation: Evaluate meaning of this question. \u201cSpecial instructional approaches\u201d is very broad.\nResolution: No change. It was determined that respondents could use their own judgment in how to interpret this.\nb. Talented/gifted program (Designed for students with specifically identified talents or exceptional academic achievement)\n__ Yes __ No\nConcern: For high school, respondents wanted to know if honors or advanced placement (AP) classes counted, because that is their alternative for talented and gifted. Respondents were unsure whether a gifted resource teacher was sufficient to answer affirmatively.\nRecommendation: Specify whether honors courses are included.\nResolution: These classes should be included. Revised wording to the following:\nTalented/gifted program or honors courses\nc. Immersion in a foreign language program (Curriculum is offered in a foreign language instead of English or in addition to English)\n__ Yes __ No\nConcern: Respondents from high schools counted their regular foreign language program as immersion (Spanish I\u2013IV, etc.). An elementary school respondent marked \u201cyes\u201d because they use a video program that is in Spanish and teaches students a few words of Spanish. This is not immersion!\nRecommendation: Program in which curriculum is taught in a foreign language.\nResolution: Changed wording to be more specific about what is intended, as follows:\nProgram in which at least half of the core subjects is taught in a foreign language\n\n\fH-14 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nd. Advanced placement (AP) courses for college credit\n__ Yes __ No\nConcerns: None\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\ne. International Baccalaureate (IB) (An international curriculum certified by the International Baccalaureate Organization)\n__ Yes __ No\nConcerns: None\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\nf. Specialized career academy (Curriculum that integrates academic and vocational courses, organized around broad career areas)\n__ Yes __ No\nConcern: This may also over count. Schools with career programs sometimes marked yes, even though they did not have this type of academy.\nRecommendation: In note, specify minimum requirements for a \u201cprogram,\u201d for example, how many courses or semesters, etc.\nResolution: This question was revised to be more specific about the fact that specialized career academies last over a period of years:\nSpecialized career academy (Multi-year curriculum that integrates academic and vocational courses, organized around broad career areas)\n22a. Does this school offer any course(s) on American Indian or Alaska Native topics?\n__ Yes __ No \u00c6 GO TO item 23.\nConcern: This item performed as intended. Respondents focused on entire courses offered in these topics. No one responded affirmatively, which is what was expected in the area under review.\nRecommendation: None\n\n\fAppendix H. Results of the Cognitive Pretest on SASS Public School Questions H-15\nResolution: No change\n22b. Which of the following courses are offered at this school?\na. American Indian or Alaska Native history\n__ Yes __ No\nb. American Indian or Alaska Native language\n__ Yes __ No\nc. American Indian or Alaska Native culture\n__ Yes __ No\nd. American Indian or Alaska Native arts and crafts\n__ Yes __ No\ne. American Indian tribal government or Alaska Native village government\n__ Yes __ No\nConcern: All respondents skipped this item.\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\n23. Are the following programs or services currently available AT THIS SCHOOL for students in any of grades K\u201312 or comparable ungraded levels, regardless of funding source?\na. A program for students with discipline or adjustment problems\n__ Yes __ No\nConcern: Respondents interpreted the term \u201cprogram\u201d with different levels of formality. Some states have a special education program for students with behavior and/or emotional disorders. Some respondents reported these programs here, and one did not (but mentioned it here). Other respondents were unsure whether a regular discipline program should be included.\nRecommendation: Specify wording to reflect intended meaning.\nResolution: Changed wording to indicate that a very formal program is intended by the question:\n\n\fH-16 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nA separate, self-contained program for students with discipline problems\nb. Medical health care services (Services provided by trained professionals to diagnose and treat health problems of students)\n__ Yes __ No\nConcern: This question was interpreted very differently by respondents, especially with respect to whether or not a school nurse counts. Seven respondents explicitly included school nurses and four explicitly excluded them. Several respondents noted that nurses do not really diagnose.\nRecommendation: Add a note as to whether school nurses should be included or excluded (or criteria for inclusion).\nResolution: Changed the wording to reflect that only services beyond what is provided by a school nurse should be reported:\nMedical health care services beyond those provided by a school nurse (Services to diagnose and/or treat health problems of students)\nc. Extended day or before-school or after-school day care programs\n__ Yes __ No\nConcern: This seems to ask about two different programs. Extended day was interpreted by respondents as instructional time beyond the normal school day, presumably for students who are falling behind or are at risk. After or before school day care is for child care and not instruction.\nRecommendation: Separate this into two questions.\nResolution: Separated into two questions as follows:\nc. Extended day program providing instruction beyond the normal school day for students needing academic assistance\nd. Before or after school day care programs.\n24a. Does this school currently have a drug, alcohol, or tobacco use prevention program?\n__ Yes __ No \u00c6 GO TO Item 25a.\nConcern: The term \u201cprogram\u201d in this question seems to have a different meaning than in previous questions. It can include much more informal activities. Respondents were inconsistent in whether or not they included guidance counselors or health classes that deal with drug abuse.\nRecommendation: Specify what type of program is desired.\n\n\fAppendix H. Results of the Cognitive Pretest on SASS Public School Questions H-17\nResolution: Moved to the principal questionnaire, near the school crime section. No change to question. Allowed respondents to use their own judgment.\n24b. Is there a formal procedure in place to assess the effectiveness of this prevention program?\n__ Yes __ No\nConcerns: None\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: Moved to the principal questionnaire, near the school crime section. No change to question.\n25a. Does this school currently have a violence prevention program?\n__ Yes __ No \u00c6 GO TO Section III on page --.\nConcerns: The same issues occurred here as with question 24a. Respondents were inconsistent as to whether they should include guidance counselors that deal with violence prevention. Similarly they did not know whether to include peer mediation or bullying programs for violence prevention.\nRecommendation: Specify what type of program is desired.\nResolution: Moved to the principal questionnaire, near the school crime section. No change to question. Allow respondents to use their own judgment.\n25b. Is there a formal procedure in place to assess the effectiveness of this prevention program?\n__ Yes __ No\nConcerns: None\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: Moved to the principal questionnaire, near the school crime section. No change to question.\nIII. Students and Class Organization\n26. Does this school use the following methods to organize classes or student groups?\nConcern: Respondents did not know what the reference period was for this question. Whether they were to report if these methods had ever been used or if they were current practices would sometimes make a difference in their answers.\nRecommendation: Add a reference period.\nResolution: Revised the question to add a reference period as follows:\n\n\fH-18 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nThis school year (2003\u20132004), does this school use the following methods to organize classes or student groups?\na. Traditional grades or academic discipline-based departments\n__ Yes __ No\nConcerns: None\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\nb. Grades subdivided into small groups such as \u201chouses\u201d or \u201cfamilies\u201d\n__ Yes __ No\nConcern: Several people mentioned teams, and answered affirmatively. Teams were used in middle and high schools for the core teachers of a grade and their students. For example, in one school the sixth grade is comprised two teams. Each team consists of four core teachers (English, Math, Social Studies, and Science) and the half of the sixth grade students.\nRecommendation: Specify whether teams should be included, or, if not, be clearer about what houses and families mean and why teams would not fit here.\nResolution: Teams are appropriately included, and need not be mentioned in the item. No change.\nc. Student groups that remain two or more years with the same teacher (e.g., looping)\n__ Yes __ No\nConcerns: None\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\nd. Interdisciplinary teaching (e.g., two or more teachers with different academic specializations collaborate to teach an interdisciplinary program to the same group of students)\n__ Yes __ No\nConcerns: None\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\n\n\fAppendix H. Results of the Cognitive Pretest on SASS Public School Questions H-19\ne. Paired or team teaching (e.g., two or more teachers are jointly responsible for teaching a single group of students)\n__ Yes __ No\nConcern: This was sometimes misunderstood as the same thing as interdisciplinary teaching.\nRecommendation: Revise wording to increase differentiation from interdisciplinary teaching.\nResolution: Revised wording as follows:\nPaired or team teaching (e.g., two or more teachers in the same class at the same time are jointly responsible for teaching a single group of students)\n27a. Are academic intersessions or summer school activities provided at this school for students who need extra assistance to meet academic expectations?\n__ Yes \u00c6 GO TO item 28a. __ No\nConcerns/Recommendation/Resolution: See next item.\n27b. Are these programs offered for students enrolled in this school at another public school location?\n__ Yes __ No\nConcern: Many of the schools that were contacted have summer school at a central location for the school district each summer. The location rotates and is sometimes at the respondent\u2019s school and sometimes not, regardless of how many of their students will be attending. So, answers to items a and b will depend on the year they are asked and not on anything about the school itself. Respondents had a hard time with the skips here and many skipped b although they should have answered it and would, indeed, have answered it affirmatively.\nOne respondent got confused about the meaning of academic intersessions and interpreted it as including any instruction provided beyond the normal school day.\nRecommendation: By combining the two questions and concentrating on the existence of these activities rather than their location, more accurate data should be gathered. Respondents all knew whether or not their students could attend summer school, and this was not always conveyed in the questionnaire due to inadvertently skipping item b (or generalizing item a to include other locations).\nBecause summer school is the more common of the two, the order should be switched.\nResolution: Revised the question wording to specify a reference period. Listed summer school activities first, and deleted reference to the location of the activities. Replaced the second question in the series with one that asks about the location of the activities. Moved this question and question 28a and b at the end of Section II near other questions about school programs. The series is as follows:\n\n\fH-20 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n27a. For the last school year and last summer (2002\u20132003), were summer school activities or academic intersessions provided for students enrolled in this school needing academic assistance?\n27b. (IF YES) Are these activities provided . . . 1) At this school 2) At another school 3) At both this school and another school\n28a. Are academic intersessions or summer school activities provided at this school for students who seek academic advancement or acceleration?\n__ Yes \u00c6 GO TO item 29. __ No\nConcerns/Recommendation/Resolution: See next item.\n28b. Are these programs offered for students enrolled in this school at another public school location?\n__ Yes __ No\nConcern: This question had similar issues to item 27a, and the form should be consistent.\nAnother issue here was that by academic advancement or acceleration it was sometimes understood that a student could earn course credits or skip a grade by taking summer school. It was not clear to all respondents that activities for enrichment should be included.\nRecommendation: Make this item consistent with item 27 and replace \u201cacceleration\u201d with \u201cenrichment.\u201d\nResolution: Revised questions to be consistent with revisions to item 27. Also, replaced \u201cacceleration\u201d with \u201cenrichment.\u201d The series is as follows:\n28a. For the last school year and last summer (2002\u20132003), were summer school activities or academic intersessions provided for students enrolled in this school seeking academic advancement or enrichment?\n28b. (IF YES) Are these activities provided . . . 1) At this school 2) At another school 3) At both this school and another school\n29. Are class periods scheduled to create extended instructional blocks of time at this school? (e.g., block scheduling)\n__ Yes __ No\nConcern: This seems to be only for middle and high schools; however, an elementary principal marked yes. It is unclear what this would mean in an elementary setting, although some respondents mentioned a 90-minute block for reading, which is not the intent of the question.\n\n\fAppendix H. Results of the Cognitive Pretest on SASS Public School Questions H-21\nRecommendation: Use edit for elementary schools that disregards these data.\nResolution: No change\n30. Does this school use a calendar where number of days for students exceeds mandatory days per year?\n__ Yes __ No\nConcern: Respondents differed on how they answered this question pertaining to built in days for snow. When a school system, like DC, schedules a few extra days just in case there are snow days, respondents were unsure how to answer. Most respondents in this situation answered affirmatively.\nRecommendation: Make this item clearer.\nResolution: Since the intent of the question is to identify schools with longer school calendars not counting snow days, added a note as follows:\n*Do not consider days built in for weather-related closings.\n31a. Does this school use a year-round calendar to distribute school days across twelve months?\n__ Yes __ No \u00c6 GO TO Item 32.\nConcerns: None\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\n31b. Do all students attend on the same cycle?\n__ Yes __ No\nConcerns: None. All respondents skipped this item.\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\n32. Are the following opportunities available for students in this school?\nConcern: Items a\u2013d are of primary interest in the high school setting, but other respondents tried to interpret them in ways relevant to their own setting.\nResolution: Added a filter prior to items 32 and 33 asking if the school offers grades 9, 10, 11, or 12. Moved item e, revised the question wording, and allowed everyone to answer it.\n\n\fH-22 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\na. College credits offered through community colleges, colleges, or distance learning providers\n__ Yes __ No\nConcerns: None\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\nb. Work-based learning or internships, in which students earn COURSE CREDITS for supervised learning activities that occur in paid or unpaid workplace assignments\n__ Yes __ No\nConcerns: None\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change\nc. Career learning, as a course or part of a course in which students learn about possible careers\n__ Yes __ No\nConcern: Respondents were inconsistent in whether they included providing a career day as career learning.\nRecommendation: Specify how detailed the program should be. Rather than using the term course (which is usually for middle or high school), use the term curriculum (as a course or part of the curriculum). Resolution: This is only of interest in schools that offer 9th\u201312th grades. The filter will eliminate the problem in elementary schools.\nd. Job shadowing, in which students learn about a job by following the schedule of a person who holds that job\n__ Yes __ No\nConcerns: There is some concern about respondents reporting \u201cyes\u201d to this item if they have one day per year where students do job shadowing.\nRecommendation: None\nResolution: No change. This is less likely in a high school setting.\n\n\fAppendix H. Results of the Cognitive Pretest on SASS Public School Questions H-23\ne. Distance learning, in which a course is taught primarily via television, satellite, Internet, or e-mail __ Yes __ No\nConcern: This item could apply to any age group. Resolution: This item will be moved to Section II and reworded as follows:\nDoes this school offer any distance learning course(s), in which a course is primarily taught via television, satellite, Internet, or e-mail? 33a.

On the most recent school day, how many SHORT-TERM substitute teachers were teaching at this school?\n\nFull-time /__/__/ __ None\n\nPart-time /_/_/ __ None\n\nConcern: The number of substitutes reported most often corresponded to number of teachers absent. Some respondents thought about the current school day in answering this question, and others referred to the last school day; however, no problems were anticipated. Most respondents indicated that a full-time substitute would be a substitute for a full-time teacher and a part-time substitute would substitute for a part-time teacher.\n\nRecommendation: None\n\nResolution: No change\n\n38a.

It is also a more likely solution than some of the other options.\n\n39. How difficult or easy was it to fill the vacancies for this school year in each of the following fields?

Vocational or technical education\n\nCould not Somewhat Very fill the difficult difficult vacancy\n\nConcern: Most respondents did not discriminate correctly between \u201cNot applicable\u201d and \u201cNo vacancy.\u201d Many used \u201cNot applicable\u201d for all positions they did not fill this year, even when they had those positions.\n\n\fAppendix H. Results of the Cognitive Pretest on SASS Public School Questions H-27\nESL teachers are not always hired at the school level. Sometimes the ESL teacher serves several schools in the district.\nRecommendation: Combine \u201cNot applicable\u201d and \u201cNo vacancy.\u201d\nResolution: Reordered questions 38 and 39 to cue respondents to think of all possible vacancies prior to asking how they were filled. Revised the wording of the question stem to be consistent with the response categories, as follows:\nHow easy or difficult was it to fill the vacancies for this school year in each of the following fields?\nRevised the \u201cNot applicable at this school\u201d heading as follows:\nNo positions at this school.\nV.

This was a difficult question for most respondents. It was especially difficult to make this calculation because the percentages contained in the definitions are opposite of the wording contained in the categories. The percentages reflect time spent outside the regular classroom; the category wording reflects time spent inside the regular classroom.

Since there is no reference period in the question, this caused confusion for several respondents. Some respondents thought they should respond affirmatively if the district provided these services, others did not think this counted.\nThere is a possibility that schools without LEP students could offer these services to LEP parents. This question is not in the path of a respondent who does not have LEP students.\nRecommendation: Does this school have the resources to provide the following services for parents with limited English skills? OR Does this school currently provide . . .\nAsk this question of all respondents.\nResolution: No change in question wording. Respondents should use their own judgment. However, this question will be moved to follow question 54 and asked of all respondents. In the question stem, PARENTS will be capped to stress that this question is not asking about services provided to students.\n54.

I-7\n\n\fI-2 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nBackground\n\nThis research was conducted in order to test modifications to items on the Principal Questionnaire that were made based on previous research. The research included items on time use, professional development, and state and district performance standards.\n\nKey Findings\n\n\u2022 Instruction to include time away from school in calculation of hours worked needs to be more apparent.\n\u2022 Respondents are including nonprofessional development activities when answering about methods for providing time for professional development.\n\u2022 Respondents were able to understand and answer the items on state/district standards.\n\nMethods\n\nResearchers from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Demographic Surveys Division conducted this study on March 31, 2003, and April 1, 2003. Low and high performing schools were identified through state and district internet sites. The definition of low and high performing varied by state. Principals were contacted by phone and asked if they would be willing to participate in a brief telephone interview. Four principals participated in this study and made arrangements to speak with an interviewer. Information about the respondents can be found in table I-1. The study questions were faxed to the principals in advance of the interview. At the scheduled times, the interviewer contacted the principals and asked them to read aloud and think aloud as they answered each question. The interviewer probed following a protocol. A copy of the items can be found in the Attachment. Principals were sent a copy of the 1999\u20132000 SASS overview as an incentive for participating in the study. This is a small-scale qualitative study and caution should be used in interpreting the findings.\n\nTable I-1.

When probed she added in additional time.\n\n\fAppendix I. Report on a Follow-up Cognitive Testing to Select 2003\u201304 SASS Principal Items I-3\nRespondent 2 did not include work (contract) hours. She missed the note to include this time in the instruction. The note should be emphasized or incorporated into the item. She also included only time spent at work (although she indicated that she tries to avoid working from home).\nRespondent 3 estimated her usual day, which is 11 hours, and then multiplied by 5 days a week and added time for the weekends to give her answer.\nRespondent 4 underreported because he did not include time spent working at home.\nRecommendation: Add instruction that respondents should include both time spent at school and time away from school.\nInteracting with Students\nThis item captured formal and informal interactions with students as well as positive and negative (discipline) interactions. No changes are required for this item.\nRespondent 1 included formal and informal time.\nRespondent 2 included discipline problems, walking the hallways, lunch, and dismissal.\nRespondent 3 included formal and informal: walking hallways, lunch duty, time in/out of classrooms, and discipline.\nRespondent 4 included formal and informal: lunchroom, hallway, activities, running into kids, having kids come down to his office.\nRecommendation: Use item as tested.\nContract Year\nRespondents reported a variety of contract years. However, in a couple of cases this contract did not fully represent the number of months a principal works at a school.\nRespondent 1 reported an 11-month contract, but when probed, reported working a full 12-month year.\nRespondent 2 reported 10\u00bd months for this item, but included a contract for summer school in the calculation which should not be counted here.\nRespondent 3 reported a 10\u00bd month contract but said that since this is her first year as a principal at this school, she expected to work a full 12 months getting ready for the upcoming year.\nRespondent 4 reported working 12 months.\nRecommendation: Clarify objective of this item\u2014will it be used to calculate salary or time spent working at the school?\n\n\fI-4 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nItems on Professional Development\nDoes Your School Have Its Own Budget...\nRespondent 2 included funding from Title I and the district, which did not appear to be a specific professional development budget.\nAre the Following Used to Provide Teachers in This School....\nCommon planning time for teachers?\nRespondent 1 answered for school policies in general, not specifically thinking about time for professional development.\nRespondent 2 included professional development activities here (long-term planning, vertical planning, etc.).\nReduced teacher workload\nRespondent 1 was not thinking specifically about professional development. She answered for coaching and department head, not for general professional development activities.\nRecommendation: Emphasize that each item needs to be directly related to professional development.\nItems on Barriers to Dismissal\nRespondent 1 seemed to understand this item well. She indicated that some items (a/f; c/d) sounded familiar, however, was still able to understand that each item was approaching the issue from a different angle.\nRespondent 4 thought about these as considerations but not barriers. The respondent indicated that the only barrier is having enough paperwork that will stand up in court.\nPersonnel Policies\nRespondent 3 initially indicated that she was not sure what this item was asking. When probed further she said \u201cdistrict policies.\u201d\nRecommendation: Use item as tested.\nItems on Teacher and School Performance\nAre These Standards Aligned With State Content Standards?\nRespondent 1 answered \u201cyes\u201d because her district originally developed the standards, and then the state copied them for use statewide. It was not clear that there was a connection between content standards and the performance standards.\nRespondent 2 asked if state and district performance standards are the same. She was not sure of the difference in her state.\n\n\fAppendix I. Report on a Follow-up Cognitive Testing to Select 2003\u201304 SASS Principal Items I-5\nRespondent 3 indicated that state academic standards and the test that assesses the standards are aligned. Three tests are used to satisfy the requirements: State, District, and Stanford 9 (national).\nRespondent 4 interpreted the question as \u201cDo we have a strategic plan for the district and then an individual plan for the school, and they all align with the state?\u201d and indicated that this was the case.\nRecommendation: Use item as tested.\nWhich of the Following Best Describes This School\u2019s Performance Last School Year?\nRespondent 2 chose b (passed most district and state performance standards) because the math requirement was not reached for certain minority groups. However, because this is the first year they are required to follow the standards, they have not been penalized or rewarded yet.\nRespondent 4 indicated that in his state there are 12 standards. The score on the standards falls into three levels: accredited with distinction (11\u201312 standards met), accredited (7\u201310 met), and unacceptable (less than 7 met).\nRecommendation: Use item as tested.\nAs a Result of Meeting These Goals Last School Year...\na. Receive cash bonus\nRespondent 3\u2019s school received cash for meeting the standards. Monies come from the state but are distributed by the school based on goals set by a school-site council.\nAs a Result of Not Meeting Standards Were You...\na. Required to write a school improvement plan\nRespondent 2 answered \u201cyes\u201d but indicated that a written plan is required of the school for reasons unrelated to performance.\nb. Put on an evaluation cycle\nRespondent 1 indicated that all schools in her school\u2019s city are required to be audited every 2 years. Even though this is not performance related, she answered \u201cyes.\u201d\nc. Provided with additional resources...\nRespondent 2 answered \u201cyes,\u201d but these resources came from Title I and federal grant administered through the state\u201421st century grant.\nRecommendation: Use item as tested.\n\n\fI-6 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nDo You Use Any of the Following to Assess the School\u2019s Progress on This Plan? a.

The test covered some items from the 1999\u2013 2000 School Library Media Center questionnaire as well as new items.\n\nKey Findings\n\nTesting identified the following cognitive issues with the proposed items:\n\n\u2022 Some respondents misunderstood the term \u201cinformation literacy.\u201d \u2022 All respondents had trouble answering budget questions for computer hardware and audio-visual\nequipment. \u2022 Most respondents confused specific questions about information literacy in standardized testing\nwith general standardized testing. \u2022 Some items in the scheduling table were either not applicable or needed clarification.\n\nMethods\n\nResearchers from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Demographic Surveys Division conducted this research from March 20 to March 25, 2003. Schools were contacted by phone and asked if their librarian would participate in the study. When contact was established with the school librarians, they were asked the following questions:\n\n\u2022 Are you familiar with the term information literacy? \u2022 What does information literacy mean to you?\n\nA questionnaire was then faxed to the school and an appointment was set for the researcher to call the librarian directly. A concurrent interview was conducted by phone following a structured protocol. (See attachment.) The interviewer was free to deviate from the protocol as required. Interviews lasted 25 to 98 minutes. Librarians were offered a copy of the 1999\u20132000 Overview of the Schools and Staffing Survey as an incentive for participation.\n\nTable J-1.

Results of the Cognitive Pretest on SASS Library Media Center Questions J-3\nDetailed Findings and Recommendations\nItem 1a\u2013c: Full- and Part-Time Paid Positions\nIn three states (West Virginia, Washington, North Dakota), the respondents reported that the state does not certify Library Media Specialists. Instead the librarians reported that they have a teaching certificate and an endorsement from the American Library Association. These respondents marked \u201cyes\u201d to being full time. Respondent 6 stated that there is not a college that grants a degree in library science or a related field. The colleges do offer classes in library science and it is possible to obtain a minor in library science. (This respondent has a minor in library science.)\nRecommendation: Clarify \u201cstate certified in library media\u201d or question if the state has a certification process specific to library media.\nItem 2: Skip Instruction\nRespondents 1 and 7 both had trouble interpreting the skip instruction. They were unsure if both 1a and 1b had to be marked in order to skip.\nRecommendation: Capitalize and bold \u201cAND.\u201d\nItem 3: Education Level\nRespondent 6 marked associate\u2019s degree as his highest degree even though he actually had a bachelor of arts degree in English because he thought the question wanted to know about degrees in a library related field. His minor was library science, and he felt that the credits he had accumulated in library studies were the equivalent of an associate\u2019s degree. He also commented that the word \u201cparticular\u201d in the instructions was a bad wording choice that led him to believe that the question referred to library specific degrees. Respondent 4 commented that there should be a category for a master\u2019s + degree. Respondent 5 kept emphasizing that she almost had a master\u2019s degree as her highest degree, but she did check bachelor\u2019s as her highest degree. She seemed very concerned that we know that she was close to achieving the master\u2019s degree.\nRecommendation: Eliminate the bullet \u201cIf no paid professional staff have a particular degree as their highest degree mark the \u2018None\u2019 box for that degree.\u201d It is confusing and it seems that a respondent would not fill out an item that did not apply to them. Consider adding categories that account for degrees plus credits such as masters + 30.\nItem 4: Earned a Master\u2019s Degree in Library-Related Field\nRespondents 3 and 1 thought this item was redundant and commented that they had already answered this in item 3. Respondents 4 and 7 answered that they had one paid professional staff member with a master\u2019s in a library-related field even though they had master\u2019s degrees in communications and English, respectively. In some states this degree does not exist (North Dakota and possibly others).\nRecommendation: Change wording to, \u201cNow thinking about all of the paid professional library media staff, how many have earned a master\u2019s degree in a library-related education field?\u201d or clarify example list.\n\n\fJ-4 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nItem 5a&b: Computer Workstations\nAll respondents reported computer workstations in the physical library with Internet access. Item seems to be reliable.\nItem 6a: Computer Hardware Budget\nAll seven respondents reported that the school library media center did not have a budget for computer hardware. Many received a budget per pupil but this money generally went toward books. They all said the school or the school district has a technology budget in which they can put in requests for more computer equipment but that it is no guarantee of receiving the equipment.\nRecommendation: Review the last Private School Universe Survey for reporting of this item. Consider changing the wording and adding a screener question such as: Does this library media center have a budget? What is included in this budget? A. Audio-visual, yes/no, how much? B. Computer hardware, yes/no, how much?, etc.\nThe current question may not result in responses that adequately reflect the expenditure on computer hardware. It may make sense to delete the question entirely.\nItem 7a&b: Audio-Visual Budget\nAll seven respondents had the same comments for this question as they did for item 6a above. In all cases the library has a budget that could be used for whatever the librarian deemed necessary. Much of the audio-visual equipment received came from the technology budget for the school or school district. Respondent 5 commented that she was on the technology committee and is able to have more influence in getting audio-visual equipment for the library.\nRecommendation: See comments for item 6a above.\nItems 8a\u2013f: Scheduling\nRespondents 5, 2, and 4 were unsure if the question had to do with hours the library is open, daily schedule (lunch, etc.), or the usage of library space. Respondent 4 suggested trimming the wording in item f to \u201cclassroom teacher.\u201d There were questions among all of the respondents as to what was meant by item f, was it teachers scheduling classes in the library, librarians teaching a class to a specific teacher\u2019s class, or teachers letting children use the library for projects? Respondents 1, 5, and 4 did not understand what was meant by a site-based management team (item 8c).\nRecommendations: Clarify stem to read, \u201cHow much influence do you think each group or person has on scheduling space in the library media center?\u201d Change item f to \u201cclassroom teachers.\u201d\nWe have removed school site council from some of the principal questions and probably should remove school site council from this questionnaire.\nMany schools do not have unions. Consider substituting teacher union or association (as we have on other surveys). Also, respondent 6 recommends changing it to teacher union.\nAdd a \u201cNot Applicable\u201d column because respondents were hesitant to check off any of the categories if the item did not apply.\n\n\fAppendix J. Results of the Cognitive Pretest on SASS Library Media Center Questions J-5\nRespondents suggested adding parents, guidance staff, and public.\nItem 9: Formal Literacy Training to Librarians\nSix of the respondents said that formal literacy training was not supplied by the school, state, or district. Respondent 3 said that in-techs (training classes) are supplied, but he had not attended any in the last 12 months. Respondent 7 received some formal training sponsored by an association. Respondent 6 said that he is required to get formal training for his certification but must find it on his own.\nRecommendation: Consider adding \u201clibrary association\u201d to the stem.\nItem 10: Formal Literacy Training to Teachers\nSix of the respondents answered \u201cno\u201d to this question. Respondent 1 commented that she gives her own informal version of information literacy training to teachers. Respondent 4 answered \u201cyes\u201d to this question. Respondent 4 seems to have misinterpreted what was meant by information literacy because she said that she helps kids in poverty with their vocabulary and showed the teachers how to use a digital camera.\nRecommendation: Consider adding \u201clibrary association\u201d to the stem.\nItem 11: Content Standards in Information Literacy\nRespondents 5 and 7 were not sure if the school follows content standards. Respondent 3 follows state standards, one American Library Association information power, respondent 1 follows the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) standards.\nRecommendations: None. The question seems reliable.\nItem 12: Information Literacy Curriculum\nRespondents 1 and 3 said that information literacy is part of the curriculum as a whole. Respondent 1 commented that the schools in his state teach to the test because they are evaluated on the results of standardized tests. Respondent 3 had a similar comment to respondent 1 about the state tests, and he further said that the curriculum is developed to create lifelong learners. Respondent 6 was not sure what information literacy meant but said that the school does follow a library curriculum that teaches the students how to use the systems and look information up on the computer. Respondent 2 checked \u201cno\u201d and said that there is no formal curriculum, rather teachers and librarians collaborate.\nRecommendation: Question seems to work; however, it may be better to phrase it in the following way: Is information literacy part of this school\u2019s curriculum?\nItem 13: Information Literacy in Standardized Testing\nSix of the seven respondents answered \u201cyes\u201d and all that answered yes seemed to focus on standardized testing in general and commented that there may be a few questions on the test pertaining to library reference.\n\n\fJ-6 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nRecommendation: Since most of the respondents focused specifically on standardized testing it may be better to break the question into two parts: 1. Are students required to take standardized tests? 2. Do these standardized tests include questions or a section on information literacy skills?\nItem 14: Feedback on Information Literacy in Standardized Testing\nFive of the seven respondents answered \u201cyes.\u201d They all had the same general comments that they did not specifically get feedback but that anyone had access to this information if they wanted it. Respondent 3 answered \u201cno\u201d and said that he received verbal feedback from teachers. Respondent 5 said as the librarian she received very little feedback on anything.\nRecommendations: None. The question seems reliable.\nItem 15: Library/Teacher Collaboration\nRespondent 5 answered 10 percent and said that last year she taught library skills classes but all were cut out of this year\u2019s budget. Respondent 1 answered typically 50 percent, respondent 6 answered none, and respondent 2 answered 95 percent. Respondent 7 answered 25 percent and commented that library media skills are considered adjunct at best. Respondent 4 answered 75 percent and commented that all teachers bring classes to her to teach library skills. Respondent 3 answered 50 percent and commented that he usually goes to the teachers to see if he can help.\nRecommendations: None. Question seems to work.\nRespondents were asked to define information literacy before taking the survey.\nRespondents 4 and 6 said they were not familiar with the term.\nInformation Literacy Definitions\nThe respondents defined \u201cinformation literacy\u201d in the following ways:\n\u2022 \u201cAccess to databases, print, online materials, being able to access whatever resources you can\u201d (respondent 5).\n\u2022 \u201cBeing able to access information quickly and easily\u201d (respondent 2). \u2022 \u201cKnowing how to access, comprehend, use, and understand what you read. Being literate about\ninformation\u201d (respondent 1). \u2022 \u201cBeing able to gather information, knowing where, when, and how to gather information\u201d\n(respondent 3). \u2022 \u201cEverything I do all day long\u201d (respondent 7).\n\n\fAppendix J.

The first topic discussed below is the decision to change from using the administrative definition of a public school to one based on the school\u2019s physical location. The second issue involves the school sample allocation methodology for public and private schools. The third presents the research done to determine the sample sort order implemented to select public and private schools for the SASS sample. Fourth, a discussion of the methodology for controlling the overlap between SASS and the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) is presented. Finally, research into the school district variances is discussed that investigates whether all districts should be sampled from particular states.\nUsing a Physical Location Definition for Schools\nIn an effort to maximize the quality of SASS data a new step was added to the public school frame building process that was intended to more accurately reflect the public schools\u2019 physical realities as defined by SASS. SASS has used the Common Core of Data (CCD) definition of a public school since 1990\u201391 (the administrative reality as reported by the state) and specified this in the collection process. In most states, the physical reality of the school\u2014the students, teachers, and administrators operating within a building as a single school\u2014matched the administrative reality, but there were schools in a number of states where the data were inconsistent. Where this mismatch existed, there was a growing disparity between the respondents\u2019 reported teacher and student counts and the CCD numbers because respondents often reported for more grades than were listed on CCD. The difference between the physical and administrative realities in the problematic states1 significantly and negatively impacted the collection, processing, and measurement of SASS items. Changing the SASS frame to a physical reality would not negatively impact teacher and student counts in the states where there was little difference between the two, but would dramatically improve the quality of the data in the problem states.\nThis section of the appendix describes the problems resulting from using the CCD definition of schools as the basis for collecting SASS data from a number of perspectives, explains the approach used to collapse schools, and then discusses how this new approach impacted the 2003\u201304 SASS sample.\nThe Problem: Physical Reality vs. Administrative Reality\nThe problem can be understood most readily by highlighting the different definitions of \u201cpublic school.\u201d Schools are the primary sampling unit for SASS. In SASS, a public school is defined as having at least one teacher and serving at least one grade between 1 and 12. Schools that only teach kindergarten, prekindergarten, or adult education are not included in the sample. The SASS principal and teacher surveys administered in conjunction with the school survey ask principals and teachers a number of important questions that relate to the school environment. Responses from the school surveys provide important student and teacher counts, measures of programs and services, as well as a number of other measures of the school\u2019s environment. These questions focus on the school\u2014the building, students, and staff\u2014as the respondents understand and experience its physical reality.\nSince the 1990\u201391 administration, SASS has used CCD as the sampling frame. CCD is the Department of Education\u2019s primary database on public elementary and secondary schools in the United States. CCD defines a public school as one that \u201cprovides educational services to students, has an assigned administrator, receives public funds as its primary support, and is operated by an educational agency\u201d (Hoffman 2002, p. 24). Information is gathered annually on public schools through surveys sent to state\n1 The list of \u201cproblematic states\u201d varies with each administration as the operational definition of \u201cproblematic state\u201d has varied. There were 10 problem states in the 1990\u201391 administration, 6 in the 1993\u201394, and 16 in the 1999\u20132000 administration. Many of the same states are included on all three lists.\n\n\fAppendix K. Details of SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures K-3\neducation departments. This information is largely based on administrative records maintained by state education agencies and reflects the school\u2019s administrative reality.\nIn most states, a school\u2019s physical reality matches its administrative reality. Some states, however, assign multiple administrative units to one physical location or have two principals operating within a single building. For example, a state may classify schools by elementary and secondary levels and report Smalltown High School and Smalltown Elementary School. In fact, the school that operates in Smalltown may be Smalltown K\u201312. Because CCD defines schools according to their administrative unit, the cover of the survey will say either Smalltown High School or Smalltown Elementary School. It is this mismatch between the administrative reality and physical reality that is responsible for a number of problems in the data collected from the school survey.\nThe three primary consequences of the mismatch between the physical and administrative definition of a school were visible in student enrollment and teacher overcounts, respondent error, and extensive data processing/editing of the raw data. The overcounting of students and teachers was identified as a problem when SASS estimates were compared to CCD estimates. Even after editing was completed, SASS estimates varied significantly from CCD numbers in several states. A more telling indicator, though, is the discrepancy between SASS estimates and CCD after it was adjusted to include only those schools meeting the SASS definition of school. SASS estimates should closely track those of its sampling frame. Diverging estimates point to recurring errors that can be addressed, at least in part, by better aligning the physical and administrative realities of schools.\nDifferences between SASS and CCD Numbers\nFor all administrations of the survey the SASS estimates have differed from CCD. Differences at the national level suggest that student counts were measured most accurately by SASS in 1987\u201388. The differences at the national level masked more dramatic variation occurring at the state level. For the most recent three administrations of SASS, the SASS estimates have been compared to the CCD numbers at the state level. As can be seen below, there are recurring problems in a number of states. The differences noted below remained after extensive editing of the responses.\n1999\u20132000 SASS \u2022 For four states, the SASS final estimate for teachers was more than 105 percent of the CCD number: Alabama, Massachusetts, Montana, and Pennsylvania. There were no states with estimates larger than 110 percent of CCD. \u2022 For two states, the enrollment count exceeded the CCD number by more than 105 percent: Pennsylvania and South Dakota.\n1993\u201394 SASS \u2022 For 17 states, the CCD number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers exceeded one standard error of the SASS estimate. Two of those states, Montana and Wyoming, were identified as problem states for that administration. A total of eight states appeared on the list of the problem states in the 1999\u20132000 SASS: Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. \u2022 For eight states, the enrollment number on CCD was not within one standard error of the SASS estimate. These states included California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, and Rhode Island.\n\n\fK-4 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n1990\u201391 SASS \u2022 For 16 states, the number of FTE teachers on CCD was not within one standard error of the SASS estimate. Three of these states, Montana, South Dakota, and Wisconsin, were considered problem states during this administration of SASS. A total of eight states were problem states again in the 1999\u20132000 SASS: Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. \u2022 For four states, the student enrollment number on CCD was not within one standard error of the SASS estimate: New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, and South Dakota.\nDifferences between SASS and the Adjusted CCD Frame\nIn most states, benchmarking SASS estimates with CCD counts does make sense and is a useful way to evaluate the data. However, it is worth noting that there are reasons to expect SASS estimates to diverge from CCD estimates and for this reason SASS is not poststratified to match CCD. While SASS uses CCD as a sampling frame, the CCD frame is changed in a number of ways before drawing the SASS sample. Schools on the CCD frame that are excluded from SASS because they do not meet the SASS definition include: schools that are closed (they stay on CCD for a year after closing), schools not offering at least 1st grade, and homeschools. In addition, there are frame building activities in California and Pennsylvania where previous administrations have identified a number of administrative units that are operating as schools according to the SASS definition but are not included on the CCD frame. Consequently, the classification of specialized districts followed in CCD is disaggregated for SASS. Finally, the purpose of SASS also distinguishes it from CCD. SASS is designed to provide data about the school\u2019s functional reality, or its environment, while CCD focuses on administrative units and imposes this uniform definition of school from state to state. The notion that SASS should match CCD fails to acknowledge these differences.\nThe differences between the enrollment and teacher counts from CCD and from the adjusted CCD, as illustrated in table K-1, are the result of changes in the definition of public school as used for CCD. However, the final SASS estimates still deviated significantly from the adjusted frame in several states. In the 1999\u20132000 SASS, the extensive editing process to which the data were subjected did bring student counts much closer to the adjusted CCD counts\u2014only one state had an enrollment count that was more than 10 percent of the adjusted CCD. However, the gap between the adjusted CCD and final SASS estimates for the number of teachers increased. In 10 states the final SASS weighted estimates of teachers exceeded the adjusted CCD counts by more than 15 percent. These states were: District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Virginia. An additional 16 states had edited weighted estimates of teachers that exceeded the adjusted CCD counts by more than 10 percent.\nNotably, the SASS estimates were closer to CCD than they were to the sampling frame. It is expected that the CCD numbers and SASS estimates would differ because of the changes that were made to the CCD before schools were sampled from it. It is reasonable to expect, though, that the SASS estimates should be close to the sampling frame\u2019s counts. For several states, this expectation was not met. One cause of this error was the continuing mismatch in definition of a public school used by SASS and the sampling frame.\n\n\fAppendix K.

Typically, teachers and students were overcounted because the schools reported on all grades served, rather than the specific range of grades assigned to them by the sampling frame. Consider the example of Smalltown School, a school operating as a K\u201312 school in a problem state. CCD would list Smalltown Elementary and Smalltown High School as separate schools on the sampling frame. In many instances such as this, one of these two administrative units is sampled. When Smalltown K\u201312 receives the SASS school survey, the respondent might fill out the school survey reporting on Smalltown K\u201312 regardless of whether the survey is addressed to Smalltown Elementary or\n\n\fK-6 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nSmalltown High School. The respondent error is identified when the student and teacher counts for a school differ significantly from the expected enrollment and teacher counts as reported on the frame.\nIn the 1999\u20132000 administration, there were nine states with unedited weighted teacher counts that were more than 115 percent of the adjusted CCD count for the state. These estimates ranged from 117.8 percent in Arkansas to 202.9 percent in Virginia.2 An additional nine states had counts that were between 110 and 115 percent of the adjusted frame. Three states had unedited weighted student counts that were greater than 115 percent of the adjusted CCD counts and an additional five states had enrollment counts that were between 107 and 115 percent of the adjusted CCD. Census Bureau staff indicated that the evidence suggested that schools were reporting for the physical reality of the school rather than the administrative reality of the school or, in some instances, reporting the district counts rather than the school counts.\nThere is less detailed documentation of the pre-edit counts of teachers and students by state from earlier administrations, but there is documentation of similar problems.\n1993\u201394 SASS \u2022 Six hundred and sixty-two public school records, or 7.3 percent of the sample, were rejected because the number of teachers reported was at least 25 percent greater than expected. \u2022 Three hundred and ninety-eight public school records, or 4.4 percent of the sample, were rejected because the number of students reported was at least 20 percent greater than expected. \u2022 Five states and the District of Columbia had high edit rejection rates (the percentage of records rejected within each state is in parentheses): Montana (20.6 percent of records); New Jersey (8.2 percent of records); North Dakota (29.2 percent of records); South Dakota (25.7 percent of records); Wyoming (32.4 percent of records); District of Columbia (35.6 percent of records).\n1990\u201391 SASS \u2022 Nine states had full-time-equivalent teacher counts that were at least 15 percent greater than those reported on CCD: Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. \u2022 Three hundred schools from 10 states were edited for consistency with CCD, including the nine states listed above plus Arizona. Thus, 16.2 percent of the sample from these 10 states were edited to match CCD.\n1987\u201388 SASS \u2022 There were significant overcounts for students and teachers. \u2022 Respondents erroneously reported for physical reality of school rather than administrative reality and for districts rather than schools. \u2022 Recollection of some data and significant editing resulted in processing delays.\nProcessing/Editing Burden\nThe failure of respondents to provide answers consistent with the CCD\u2019s definition of the school resulted in a lengthy editing process. These edits included some that were relatively straightforward and made corrections based upon frame information, which identified respondent \u201cmistakes.\u201d These corrections, however, required consistency edits to variables when reasonable assumptions could be made and, finally,\n2 The discrepancy in Virginia was also attributable to the fact that the population count of teachers was based on an imputed count from CCD. (Virginia did not reported its teacher counts to CCD for many years.) However, the next highest discrepancies were 141.7 percent in South Dakota and 140.5 in Montana.\n\n\fAppendix K. Details of SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures K-7\nedits to variables when the evidence was vague or ambiguous. Each SASS administration has required significant editing efforts to address problems related to this issue. The details of the 1999\u20132000 SASS processing operation are outlined below.\nSchools that reported grade ranges inconsistent with CCD and that had teacher or student counts that varied by more than 30 percent from the frame were sent through a pre-editing process. Each of these cases was evaluated individually. The grade range of these schools was compared to the frame. If a school reported grade levels inconsistent with CCD, then those \u201cextra\u201d grade levels were deleted from the SASS file. Subsequently, teachers in those grades that were no longer considered a part of the school were reclassified as out-of-scope. The number of students and teachers was reduced proportionally based upon the appropriate grades listed on the frame. These two counts were the variables for which Census had accurate frame information.\nThe problem with the teacher count was magnified when there was a physical/administrative reality mismatch because of the way teachers were counted in SASS. If the actual school contained more grades than the sampled school, respondents to the Teacher Listing Form were asked to count teachers teaching part time within the expected grade range and part time outside the expected grade range as part-time teachers. Respondents often reported these full-time teachers at the physical school as full-time teachers at the administrative school. This process inflated the number of full-time teachers, especially in small schools.\nAfter resolving the student and teacher counts on these first two items, Census staff then evaluated every other variable on the school file that included a teacher or student count and adjusted them as necessary. For teacher or student ethnicity, for example, the total would be altered to match the appropriate total and the entry for each category would be adjusted to the initial proportion for the new total. Other variables with counts required corrections that were not as transparent. The counts for limited-English-proficient students and the National Student Lunch Program did not have references to the grades served. If the reported numbers exceeded the adjusted enrollment, the counts were reduced proportionally based upon the proportion of students in the sampled school compared to the reported enrollment. If the reported numbers were less than the enrollment, a judgment needed to be made with respect to whether the count required a proportional reduction. Moving beyond the teacher and student count variables, attempts were made to make consistency edits when possible. For example, if the sampled school was an elementary school that erroneously reported for K\u201312, edits were made to make program offerings consistent with the appropriate grade range\u2014an elementary school was not likely to offer Advanced Placement. These edits became somewhat subjective and called into question the validity of the remaining responses for these schools.\nOnce this pre-editing was complete, all surveys were processed through the edits, final interview status recode (ISR), imputation, final edits, and weighting. Consequently, the discrepancy between the school unit sampled from the frame and the actual school as experienced by respondents led to significant data problems in a number of states. After the pre-edit processing was complete, 17 states in the 1999\u20132000 SASS had an edit rejection rate3 of at least 25 percent\u2014amounting to 1,083 cases, or schools. These states included Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. In addition, 17 states had at least 6 percent of their sampled public schools, totaling 476 cases,\n3 The edit rejection rate is the proportion of public schools failing one or more of the criteria outlined in the edit specifications and is specific to the grade range problem.\n\n\fK-8 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nedited for corrections.4 These states included Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

Some of these changes were based upon strong empirical evidence as to what the appropriate response should have been, while others required or made assumptions for which the evidence was sparse or nonexistent. The complexity, burden, and imprecision of this process argued for changing the sampling frame to better reflect the physical reality of the school.\n\nResults of Using a Physical Location Definition for Schools in 2003\u201304 SASS\n\nIn implementing the collapsing of CCD records to reflect the physical reality, a replicable standard was implemented to the collapsing process. This collapsing process relied on software currently used for updating the Private School Universe Survey (PSS) list frame, modified to adhere to the standards described below. In general, this software matched records on certain criteria, including address, and\n\n4 The edit correction rate is the proportion of public schools where data were corrected as a result of the edit process due to the grade range problem. This rate is substantially lower than the edit rejection rate because many records fail initially, but further inspection reveals that the records cannot be classified as definite misreporting.\n\n\fAppendix K. Details of SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures K-9\nresulted in a list of records matching on the defined criteria. This list of matches was reviewed clerically to verify the match status of the identified cases.\nCollapsing Rules\nRestricted Rules. Potential candidates for collapsing had to match on ZIP code, school type, public charter school flag, address, and phone number. Candidates had contiguous nonoverlapping grade ranges, meaning that there was no more than one grade overlapping or missing from the resulting grade range.\nRelaxed Rules. Potential candidates for collapsing had to match on ZIP code, school type, public charter school flag, and two of the following three: phone number, address, and name of school. Candidates had contiguous nonoverlapping grade ranges, meaning there was no more than one grade overlapping or missing from the resulting grade range.\nAddress Matching\nThe software standardized addresses, parsing address fields into component parts such as street number, street name, directional suffix, street type, and ZIP code. Abbreviations were standardized and spacing was set consistently. The components were subsequently matched one by one. If all of the address components matched, the address was considered a match.\nIn collapsing CCD records, Census Bureau staff matched on standardized location address if the location address was available. In a few states, it was observed that physical address was not provided on CCD records, so matching on a standardized mailing address was used as an alternative.\nCriteria Application to CCD Collapsing\nThe matching program used by Census Bureau staff was designed to identify collapsing records on standardized address, telephone number, school type, and public charter school status. Records matching on all of these criteria were output, with the output sorted on ZIP code for ease of review. The output was clerically reviewed to verify that grade ranges (rather than enrollment by grade) were either nonoverlapping or overlapping by no more than one grade and were consecutive. For example, K\u20136 could collapse with 6\u20138, however K\u20136 could not collapse with 9\u201312, and K\u20136 could not collapse with 4\u20138. Schools matching on all criteria were collapsed.\nIn certain states (e.g., Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma), it was known from past experience that these criteria failed to identify all schools that viewed themselves as one physical entity. This was due to variations in address and telephone number reporting. In these states, an alternative standard was applied, whereby schools had to match on at least two of the following three: standardized address, telephone number, or keyword in the school\u2019s name. Keyword was defined as whatever remained after stripping off the word \u201cschool,\u201d \u201cacademy,\u201d etc. and any school grade level descriptors (e.g., elementary, high, senior, junior, middle, primary, upper, lower, intermediate). In the interest of time, this keyword standard was applied clerically. The school type, public charter school status, and grade range criteria also applied to the schools collapsed via the alternative standard.\nCollapsing the Records\nOnce it was determined which records to collapse, the SASS sampling frame had one record per collapsed set of CCD records. Teacher counts, enrollment, and grade range were summed from the collapsed set of CCD records. The address and phone number of the first record in the set were arbitrarily chosen. Names\n\n\fK-10 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nwere generalized to avoid grade range descriptors. For example, \u201cSpring Valley Elementary\u201d and \u201cSpring Valley Jr/Sr High\u201d were collapsed to \u201cSpring Valley School.\u201d As a first step after sampling, field representatives contacted sampled schools to verify name and address, so if incorrect assumptions were made, they were corrected as a first step in the field data collection.\nApplication of Collapsing Rules to States\nThe relaxed collapsing rules were applied in nine states:\n1. Nebraska; 2. Montana; 3. Oklahoma; 4. North Dakota; 5. South Dakota; 6. Arkansas; 7. Iowa; 8. Missouri; and 9. Minnesota.\nThree states were excluded from the collapsing process:\n1. New York; 2. Pennsylvania; and 3. New Jersey.\nCensus Bureau staff made the determination that the collapsing rules did not work well in these three states. It appeared the schools in these states did not need to collapse. The details of how this determination was made are provided in the following section.\nThe restricted rules were applied in all other states.\nJustification\nIn determining what collapsing rules were optimum for a particular state, three pieces of information were considered: 1) results of calling some of the larger collapsed schools; 2) the amount of collapsing that would occur under the restricted and relaxed rules and the size distribution of these resulting schools; and 3) the results from the 1999\u20132000 SASS pre-edit review regarding schools that reported for the wrong grade range.\nFirst, the Census Bureau called a total of 21 schools: 10 in New York, 5 in Pennsylvania, and 6 in Wisconsin. Of the 21 schools, 17 had a final collapsed enrollment of greater than 1,000 and 4 had a final collapsed enrollment of 750 to 999. Of the 21 collapsed schools, 20 had grade levels with separate administrators and thus should not have been collapsed, and one school was legitimately collapsed. Of the 15 schools in New York and Pennsylvania, all had appeared to collapse under the restricted rules (i.e., phone and address). In all cases the schools resided on one campus but were in separate buildings or separate wings. Phone numbers given on CCD were for either an automated menu system or for the district office. In Wisconsin, the six schools had been collapsed under the relaxed but not the restricted rules.\nSecond, the conclusion from the calling operation was that schools with a larger enrollment generally should not be collapsed. However, since the amount of calling was limited, it could not be determined\n\n\fAppendix K.

Details of SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures K-13\nWeighted estimates of schools from table K-3 provide an estimate of the expected amount of collapsing. This was compared to table K-4 to determine which set of rules most closely reflected the expected amount of collapsing. Generally, it was determined that the relaxed rules provided a more accurate prediction of which schools were likely to need collapsing.\nFor the states in table K-5, no comparison to 1999\u20132000 SASS edit rejects was produced. Census Bureau staff simply compared the amount of collapsing with the size distribution to judge whether collapsing was likely to improve CCD as a sampling frame.\nA comparison of tables K-3 and K-4 shows that application of the relaxed collapsing rules had a clear benefit in Montana, Oklahoma, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Arkansas, Iowa, and Missouri. Additionally, in Minnesota, the expected \u201cimprovement\u201d based on 1999\u20132000 SASS results was greater than the expected deterioration (i.e., the number of larger schools collapsing). Consequently, it was recommended to apply the relaxed rules to Minnesota as well. In Wisconsin, the expected deterioration was substantial and the expected improvement was minimal, so it was recommended to apply the restricted rules.\nA review of table K-5 shows that more than half of the collapsed records in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania had a student enrollment of 750 or more, so it was believed that they should not legitimately be collapsed. Since more than half were large schools, the expected amount of deterioration exceeded the expected amount of improvement, so no collapsing was implemented in these states. In several other states, the collapsing appeared to have been of dubious value, but the volume of collapsing was so small that the potential deterioration was minimal. As a result, it was recommended to apply the restricted rules to these states.\nCollapsing Results from the 2003\u201304 Sampling Frame\nOf the 2,344 collapsed schools remaining on the sampling frame, 576 were selected for sample. All sampled schools were asked about the grade range they provided. Using the check on grade range as a measure of whether the collapsing succeeded in correctly creating a school entity for which the respondent would recognize and report, it appeared the collapsing succeeded in 460 sampled schools and failed in 116 (79.9 percent success rate). In addition, there appeared to be 28 sampled schools that should have been collapsed but were not.\nSchools where the collapsing was applied incorrectly were split into their component schools, as they appeared on CCD originally, and one component school was selected randomly to be the sampled school. The inverse of the probability of selection (base weight) was adjusted appropriately to reflect this subsampling. Schools that should have been collapsed but were not were allowed to report as they perceived themselves and their weights were adjusted for their multiple chances of selection.\nA preliminary analysis of the 116 schools that should not have been collapsed revealed no clear pattern or cause for the collapsing failure. In some states where the relaxed rules for collapsing were applied, it appeared that the more restricted rules should have been applied. In most cases it appeared that the phone number match should have been a requirement. A detailed breakdown of the collapsing results by state is presented in table K-6.\n\n\fK-14 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable K-6.

Details of SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures K-15\n2003\u201304 SASS School Allocation Procedure\nThis section discusses how the school sample was allocated to public and private school strata in SASS. Generally the allocation is done in a way that provides reasonable precision for all components of SASS while meeting a variety of estimation goals for each component. The estimation goals are described in chapter 1.\nPublic Schools\nThe public school allocation was done according to the following priorities:\n1. The total public school sample size in the 2003\u201304 SASS contained 9,374 regular schools, 166 Bureau of Indian Affairs-funded schools, 450 high American Indian or Alaska Native enrollment schools, and 300 public charter schools.\n2. There were 450 sampled schools allocated to the high American Indian or Alaska Native enrollment schools and 300 sample schools allocated to public charter schools proportional to the sum of the square root of the number of teachers per strata. Additional requirements of 150 elementary and secondary schools with high American Indian or Alaska Native enrollment and at least 80 public charter schools per grade level were imposed.\n3. The remaining 9,374 schools were allocated to the regular schools in two different ways. This was done because of the increased number of combined schools in the sampling frame due to the collapsing procedure outlined in the section on defining public schools by their physical location in this appendix. The two methods used are listed below: \u2022 Proportional to the 1999\u20132000 SASS unit standard error for the number of schools in each stratum by state. This allocation method would achieve optimum results for national estimates. \u2022 Proportional to the sum of the square root of the number of teachers per strata. This allocation method allowed for an increase in the number of sampled combined schools to match the increase in the number of combined schools in the frame.\n4. The following adjustments were made to the results of both allocation methods: \u2022 increased the combined school sample size in Alaska to approximate the sampling rate for schools with high American Indian or Alaska Native enrollment; \u2022 increased the combined sample size to approximate the overall state sampling rate; \u2022 compared the adjusted sample sizes against the minimums of 80 sampled schools for elementary and secondary and 20 for combined, and replaced the sample size with the minimum if necessary; and \u2022 compared the adjusted sample sizes against the total number of schools per strata. If the sample was more than 60 percent of the total, then it was adjusted down to 60 percent of the total.\n5. Many of the original sample sizes were adjusted in the above steps; the ones that were not adjusted were reallocated according to the original allocation method.\n6. The final results of the allocation methods were then compared and if there were major discrepancies between the two in a specific stratum, the average was determined and assigned as the final sample size.\n\n\fK-16 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nPrivate Schools\nThe private school sample size selected from the list frame was 3,443 schools. The goal was to select an overall sample of 3,420 private sample schools from the list frame. The allocation process consisted of the steps below:\n1. First, the sample was allocated at the affiliation level. The overall sample of 3,420 schools was allocated among 17 private school affiliations, proportional to the measure of size equal to the square root of the total number of teachers as the initial sample sizes. (NOTE: The 2003\u201304 SASS included 17 groups rather than the 20 used in the 1999\u20132000 administration, as described in chapter 4.)\n2. Next, a sample size of 100 was assigned to all affiliations that were assigned an initial sample size less than 100, and the remaining sample was redistributed proportionally among the remaining affiliations.\n3. Next, the sample was allocated at the stratum level. Within affiliation, the sample size was allocated at the stratum level proportional to the measure of size.\n4. Finally, a sample size of two was assigned to all strata with initial sample sizes less than two, and the remaining sample was redistributed proportionally among the remaining strata.\nDocumentation of the Sort Selection for the 2003\u201304 SASS Public and Private School Sampling\nAs part of the 2003\u201304 SASS sample design process, it was determined that the current sample sort order for both public and private schools should be evaluated and possibly improved.\nMethodology\nBootstrap variance programs developed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) (discussed in greater detail in chapter 9) were used to generate the total covariance and finite population correction (FPC) factors of a particular sample using a specified sort order. The 1999\u20132000 SASS sample sort (sort #1) was used as a standard in both the public and private results. The 1999\u20132000 SASS sample sort with a serpentine sort in the enrollment portion for both the public and private schools (sort #2) was also tried. In theory, this serpentine sort should reduce the number of extreme covariances as well as the maximum FPC, since it should provide better control over the size distribution of the schools selected for the sample. The locally random FPC, which is the FPC computed across small increments of the sample, can be larger than one. As a result, it is important to design a survey in which this is not a problem with respect to the variance estimates, since this condition could result in the computation of negative variances. The following sample sort orders were tried:\nFor public schools\u2014\n1. stratum, state, urbanicity, ZIP code, LEA ID, descending high grade, percent minority, and descending enrollment;\n2. stratum, state, urbanicity, ZIP code, LEA ID, descending high grade, percent minority, and enrollment in serpentine sort;\n3. stratum, urbanicity, LEA ID, descending high grade, percent minority, and descending enrollment;\n\n\fAppendix K. Details of SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures K-17\n\n4. stratum, ZIP code, urbanicity, descending high grade, and descending enrollment; and 5. stratum, descending high grade, urbanicity, enrollment in serpentine sort, school ID.\n\nFor private schools\u2014\n\n1. stratum, state, descending high grade, urbanicity, ZIP code, descending enrollment, and school ID.\n2. stratum, state, descending high grade, urbanicity, ZIP code, serpentine enrollment, and school ID. 3. stratum, typology, state, descending high grade, urbanicity, ZIP code, descending enrollment, and\nschool ID. and 4. stratum, religious orientation, state, descending high grade, urbanicity, ZIP code, descending\nenrollment, and school ID.\n\nResults\n\nThe various sorts were evaluated by determining a sample sort order that produced the smallest number of extreme positive and negative covariances and the lowest maximum FPC. Since the variance estimator for SASS assumes that the relative covariance is zero, a large positive covariance will considerably underestimate the variance, while a large negative covariance will overestimate it. These extremes also result in more unreliable estimates. The results shown in tables K-7 and K-8 were used in the determination of the 2003\u201304 SASS sample sort.\n\nTable K-7.

For example, public school sorts #1 and #2 seemed to be almost identical, but there were certain states (Delaware and Hawaii) that had very large positive covariances using the first sort. The second sort reduced these covariances slightly without changing the overall effect. The last three public school sorts clearly produced much worse results than sort #2. The slightly larger maximum FPC produced by sort #2 was accepted in return for smaller covariances in Delaware and Hawaii.\n\nTable K-8.

The third sort also generated reasonable results but since it used an outdated definition of typology as one of the sort keys, it was discarded.\n\nControlling the School Overlap with ELS\n\nThis section of the appendix describes how the original 2003\u201304 SASS selection probabilities were adjusted so that the expected number of schools overlapping between the 2003\u201304 SASS and the 2003\u201304 follow-up of ELS:2002 was minimized without changing a school\u2019s overall selection probability for the 2003\u201304 SASS. To do this required knowledge of the 2003\u201304 SASS and ELS selection probabilities for all schools in the frame. The 2003\u201304 SASS school sampling selection was dependent upon ELS.\n\nThe details of this process are described below. The required terminology and sets of schools are defined first. Next, the various conditional selection probabilities are presented.

Upon investigation, it was decided that in three states the school sampling procedure should be altered to force all districts in the state to fall into sample. These three states were Delaware, Nevada, and West Virginia. Based on the results of the 1999\u20132000 SASS, the school district variance investigation was repeated.\nMethodology\nThe bootstrap variance estimation software as developed by NCES (as discussed in more detail in chapter 9) was used to generate variance estimates for a select group of states assuming the current school district sampling methodology as applied to all states excluding the three states mentioned above. Comparisons of these variances to simple random sample variances were made to try to determine how well each state performed as compared to the other states. From this, design effects could be calculated and comparisons of coefficients of variation (unadjusted for the finite population correction) were made.\nThe states examined were Alaska, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Utah, and Wyoming.\nDelaware, Nevada, West Virginia, Illinois, and Vermont were used as benchmark states. Delaware, Nevada, and West Virginia were already part of the special sampling operation, and their results helped to identify other states with high district sampling variances. Illinois and Vermont were chosen as benchmark states because they had many school districts and reasonable variances.\nVariances were generated for estimates of the total number of districts in the state and the total enrollment in the state.\nResults\nWest Virginia had the highest sampling variances for the examined estimates, with Delaware and Nevada a distant second and third. Maryland and Florida had only slightly lower variances than these three states. One of the benchmark states, Illinois, performed only slightly better than these five states. The other states of interest performed better than Illinois.\nAs a result, it was decided to continue the special sampling operation for Delaware, Nevada, and West Virginia and to add Florida and Maryland to the special sampling operation.\nReferences\nHoffman, L.M.

Report on Results of Special Contact Districts\nBackground\nSchool districts can approve or reject the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) on behalf of the schools that they control. Therefore, securing the approval of these districts is essential to the success of SASS. In past years, many districts indicated that formal approval from the district was required before they would allow schools to participate in SASS. Often this approval process required months to complete, making it difficult to obtain approval during the SASS data collection period.\nFor the 2003\u201304 administration of SASS, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and Education Statistics Services Institute (ESSI) attempted to identify and contact districts with a formal approval process well ahead of data collection in order to secure this approval. NCES and ESSI identified 77 sampled districts that required prior approval to conduct surveys with schools in their district based on past administrations of SASS and other NCES sponsored surveys. The districts were referred to as \u201cspecial contact districts\u201d for this administration of SASS. Thirty-one special contact districts were also deemed \u201ccritical\u201d districts because they had a disproportionate impact on state-level estimates. Without participation from schools in these districts, state-level estimates would be in jeopardy. The 77 districts included a total of 850 schools that were considered in-scope for SASS.\nMethods\nNCES and ESSI began contacting districts in February 2003. The purpose of the initial contact was to identify a contact person at the district and to determine what requirements needed to be satisfied before the district would approve administration of SASS. Generally, districts required either research applications or research proposals. Often these applications requested background on the study, information on the sampling plan, instruments to be administered, school resources required, and a plan for protecting the confidentiality of data. For districts that had research requirements, applications and proposals were prepared by NCES and ESSI staff based on information obtained during the initial contact with the district. The applications were submitted directly to the district by NCES and ESSI.\nNCES and ESSI staff developed a tracking sheet that listed each of the special contact districts and provided a description of their research requirements, contact names, and the initial and final outcome of contact with the district. This spreadsheet was updated and sent regularly to the Census Bureau to inform the field-based operation. When the SASS data collection began, field representatives did not attempt to contact schools within those special contact districts that had not yet agreed to participate in SASS. On October 16, 2003, NCES turned responsibility for gaining approval of the remaining 41 special contact districts to Census Bureau Regional Office staff. Since Regional Office staff members are physically closer to the districts, it was felt that they could attempt to meet with district staff in person and gain participation in SASS. For nonresponding districts, field representatives attempted to contact schools directly.\nFindings\nForty-three of the special contact districts required a formal application in order to approve research at their schools. Among the remaining districts that did not have a formal application, most required a written proposal to the superintendent. These proposals generally needed to include the same information as the formal applications.\n\n\fL-2 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nBy October 16, 2003, some 29 districts approved their participation in SASS, 7 districts did not grant permission to conduct the survey, and the remaining 41 districts neither approved nor denied participation. Census Bureau Regional Office staff and field representatives began contacting the districts after this date. Staff utilized various resources including a Partnership Specialist (Regional Office staff trained to work with community leaders and researchers), letters from the Regional Census Director, and personal contacts to obtain permission for SASS in the special contact districts. By the end of the field period, only two special contact districts had no complete Teacher Listing Forms or complete public school questionnaires from sampled schools in their district. Neither of the refusal districts were critical districts, meaning that their nonresponse would not have a disproportionate impact on state estimates. Out of the 850 schools in special contact districts, 673 completed Teacher Listing Forms and 588 completed school questionnaires.\n\nThe response rate of schools in the special contact districts was lower than the overall public school response rate for the Teacher Listing Form and school questionnaire. This may be attributed to two factors:\n\n\u2022 Field work on these cases began in late October rather than early October as it did for regular cases.\n\u2022 Many of these districts were difficult responders during previous SASS administrations.\n\nThe response rate comparison in shown in table L-1.\n\nTable L-1.

Working Through Establishment Gatekeepers\nAuthors: Andy Zukerberg, Randy Parmer, Andrew Soderborg, Toni Warner, Steven Tourkin1 U.S. Bureau of the Census\nAbstract\nIn establishment surveys, gatekeepers often prevent interviewers from reaching the sampled person. Many surveys have developed methods to get around gatekeepers or enlist them as agents in the survey process. Often these efforts target an individual. For the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), school districts function as gatekeepers for the schools under them. Three scenarios were anticipated for the 2003\u201304 SASS: (1) if a district was contacted before the school and gave permission to conduct SASS, it could increase overall response rates; (2) if a district was contacted before the school and refused to participate, it could lower overall response rates; and (3) if districts were not contacted before the school, schools could request district permission to participate, delaying completion of the survey and increasing costs. In order to determine the best way to handle district contacts, an experiment was conducted in three Census Bureau Regional Offices. Approximately half of the school districts in each office were contacted by phone several months before the survey was conducted to discuss the survey and any information they would need before approving the survey. If information or formal application was required, it was prepared and sent to the district shortly after the call. In the other half of districts, a standard prenotice letter was sent to the district at the start of data collection. This paper reports on the impact on school response under those scenarios and makes recommendations for handling establishment gatekeepers.\nBackground\nThe Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) is the nation\u2019s largest sample survey of K\u201312 schools. It is sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. SASS is unique in that it collects data from public and private schools, principals, and teachers as well as public school districts and libraries. SASS links these units, allowing researchers to gain a complete picture of K\u201312 education in the United States. Previous SASS surveys were conducted during the 1987\u201388, 1990\u201391, 1993\u201394, and 1999\u20132000 school years. In each of these years, SASS followed a relatively traditional mixed mode approach. Sampled schools and districts were sent a prenotice letter, followed by questionnaires. Nonresponders received reminder postcards and a second questionnaire. Next Census Bureau staff attempted to interview nonrespondents by telephone. Finally, field representatives were sent to interview any remaining nonresponders. The 2003\u201304 SASS consisted of nine selfadministered questionnaires (School District Questionnaire, School Library Media Center Questionnaire, Principal Questionnaire, Private School Principal Questionnaire, School Questionnaire, Private School Questionnaire, Unified School Questionnaire, Teacher Questionnaire, and Private School Teacher Questionnaire) and one interviewer-administered questionnaire (Combined School Screener/Teacher Listing instrument).\n1 The authors wish to thank Kerry Gruber and Lynn Zhao at the National Center for Education Statistics and Deanna Lyter and Greg Strizek at the Education Statistics Services Institute for their assistance in this research.

School District Experiment Findings M-3\nSchool districts (Local Education Agencies) are critical to conducting SASS in public schools. Since districts typically have more than one school in SASS, a refusal at the district level can affect multiple school, principal, teacher, and library media center questionnaires as well as the district questionnaire response rate. In past SASS administrations, the district was informed about SASS by mail at the same time the schools were asked to participate. This had the unintended consequence of allowing schools to participate before the district refused or schools refusing before the district had a chance to support administration of the survey. In order to reduce the time required to collect and process SASS data, it was decided to pursue a field-based methodology for the 2003\u201304 collection of the school-level questionnaires. This methodology utilized field representatives to drop off and pick up the selfadministered questionnaires rather than relying on a postal mailout. In addition, the Teacher Listing Form (used to collect the sample frame of teachers) was converted from a paper self-administered questionnaire to an interviewer-administered instrument. The district questionnaire remained a mailout/mailback questionnaire with in-person nonresponse follow-up. In switching to a field-based methodology, there were two concerns for district participation in SASS:\n\u2022 impact on school participation; and \u2022 response rate to the district questionnaire.\nThree potential outcomes were anticipated as a result of switching to a field-based methodology:\n\u2022 If a district was contacted before the school and gave permission to conduct SASS, it could increase overall response rates.\n\u2022 If a district was contacted before the school and refused to participate, it could lower overall response rates.\n\u2022 If districts were not contacted before the school, schools could request district permission to participate, delaying completion of the survey and increasing costs.\nThe primary goal of switching to a field-based methodology was to shorten the time required to conduct SASS. Given this goal, there was concern about the impact of districts giving schools approval to participate in SASS on the schedule and response rate. In order to understand the impact of precontacting districts on response rates, an experiment was conducted with a subsample of schools and districts during the 2003\u201304 SASS.\nMethods\nThree Census Bureau Regional Offices (Seattle, Chicago, and Boston) were selected to participate in this experiment. All of the districts in these offices, except those with known processes for survey approval, were assigned to either the test or control group. Table M-1 shows the number of districts and schools in each of the groups. Those in the test group were referred to as \u201cTest Group Districts.\u201d These districts were called during July 2003 from the Census Bureau\u2019s Hagerstown Telephone Center. The telephone interviewers were provided background information on SASS but were not told the nature of the experiment. Telephone interviewers called the districts and followed a script (attachment M-1) to determine if they had any research requirements or paperwork that had to be completed before a field representative visited their schools. If the districts indicated that they had research requirements, they were asked for specific information regarding the type of requirement. NCES and its contractor, the Education Statistics Services Institute, prepared a package to address the requirements. Generally, this package contained blank SASS questionnaires, detailed information on the survey including sample design, methodology, and sample reports. At the end of the call, districts were asked for the name of a contact person to whom the district questionnaire should be addressed. The districts assigned to the control group were called by the Hagerstown Telephone Center during August 2003. These districts were\n\n\fM-4 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nasked only for the name of a contact person for the district questionnaire. (Attachment M-2 is a sample interview script.)\n\nTable M-1. Unweighted counts of schools and districts, by group: 2003\u201304\n\nGroup\n\nDistrict sample size\n\nControl\n\n665\n\nTreatment\n\n667\n\nSOURCE: School District Experiment Findings, U.S. Census Bureau, 2005.\n\nSchool sample size 1,164 1,122\n\nIn October 2003, districts were sent a prenotice letter regarding SASS. Test districts received a letter letting them know that data collection was starting. (See attachment M-3.) Districts in the control group (as well as those not in the experiment) received a prenotice letter informing them about SASS. (See attachment M-4.) At the same time, each of the sample schools received a standard prenotice letter. (See attachment M-5.)\n\nAll field representatives were told that the districts had been notified about SASS and in cases where the districts explicitly approved SASS, they were provided with the letter of approval from the district. Field representatives from Regional Offices participating in the study were instructed to keep a log (attachment M-6) of each contact with a sampled school related to the Teacher Listing instrument, School Questionnaire, and Private School Questionnaire. Even though the research questions related only to public schools, the field representatives were instructed to keep logs for public and private schools in order to keep the study \u201cblind.\u201d Field representatives were told that these logs would be used to look at the number and type of contacts required to complete SASS and that individual performance would not be evaluated based on the logs.\n\nThe 2003\u201304 SASS used a mixed mode approach to obtain information from schools. First, field representatives contacted schools by telephone and, utilizing a computerized instrument, administered a series of screening questions to verify that they had reached the correct institution and that the institution met the SASS criteria for a school. Once this information was verified, the interviewer followed a script to identify a contact person at the school and set up an appointment to visit the school. At this appointment, the field representative used the computerized instrument to enter a list of all teachers at the school. The instrument then selected a sample of teachers to complete the teacher questionnaire. At this time, the field representative distributed the remaining SASS questionnaires (school, teacher, and principal). The field representative\u2019s log was used to monitor all contact with the school needed to complete both the computerized Teacher Listing instrument and the school questionnaire.\n\nThe final total weighted response rates for the treatment and control groups were calculated at the end of data collection. The formula used to calculate the weighted response rates (r) was:\n\n\u2211 interviews * basic weight\n\n.\n\n\u2211 total number of respondents eligible for interview * basic weight\n\nThe variance associated with these response rates was calculated using the following formula:\n\n\u2211 1\nn\n\nn i =1\n\n(ri\n\n\u2212\n\nr)2 ,\n\nwhere\n\nri\n\nis the\n\nreplicate\n\nweighted\n\nresponse\n\nrate.\n\nThe replicates were formed using a bootstrap variance methodology. Also, two more estimates were computed for the treatment and control groups, as well as the interviews and noninterviews: the weighted\n\n\fAppendix M. School District Experiment Findings M-5\n\naverage number of visits and the weighted average time spent with each school. The variances associated with these estimates were calculated using the same basic formula as for the response rate variance with the appropriate averages and replicates used. The response rates, the average number of visits, and average time estimates for the treatment and control groups were compared against each other and tested at the 5 percent significance level.\n\nFindings\n\nOf the 667 districts in the treatment group, 3 refused any contact with the Census Bureau representative during the calling operation, and 2 districts could not be contacted. (These 2 were likely closed for the summer.) Four hundred fifty-six districts requested some type of follow-up prior to granting permission to conduct SASS in their schools. Of these, more than half (255) requested a formal proposal or detailed overview of the research. A smaller number (110) requested a brief description of the research. The remaining districts indicated that a representative from the Census Bureau need only contact them a couple of days before an interviewer visited schools in their district. NCES and Education Statistics Services Institute staff followed up with those districts requesting more information by sending a proposal to 255 districts, and a long letter describing SASS to 110 districts. The remaining districts received a standard prenotice letter that thanked them for agreeing to participate in SASS and provided a brief overview of the survey. After receiving the follow-up materials, eight districts responded to Census with a formal approval to conduct SASS in their schools. (This approval came in the form of a fax, letter, or email.) Thirty-three districts did not approve SASS, and 415 districts did not respond to the materials that were sent.\n\nDoes Precontacting the District Impact Response to the District Questionnaire?\n\nTable M-2 shows that efforts to precontact the district had no impact on the final response rate for the district questionnaire.\n\nTable M-2.

Not surprisingly, districts that approved schools under them participating in SASS were more likely to complete the district questionnaire than the districts that denied the request to conduct SASS. The response rates of the districts that approved SASS participation (80.2 percent) and those that did not respond to the request (76.9 percent) were significantly higher than those of the districts that denied participation (36.6 percent). NOTE: Districts that did not formally respond were treated as having approved participation in the follow-up materials.\n\nTable M-4.

However, table M-5 shows that there was no significant difference between the treatment and control groups on initial response rate.\n\nTable M-5.

The school response rate was only significantly lower for schools in districts that requested a proposal compared to those that had no follow-up required.\n\n\fAppendix M.

Compliance with this procedure was generally low. For schools in the experiment, 69.9 percent had logs. Many of the logs contained missing data on time and type of contact (phone vs. in\n\n\fM-8 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nperson). Analysis reported below is based on the schools from which contact logs were received.

Where both contact type and time were missing (4 percent of cases), average contact time across both contact types was imputed.\n\nTable M-9 shows that the number of contacts required to complete the two school-level forms was not impacted by precontacting an individual school\u2019s district office.\n\nTable M-9.

Schools often cite district policies and research procedures as a reason not to participate in SASS. In this study we looked at the relative impact of providing more information to districts prior to the start of the survey. Our hope was that this would facilitate data collection by allowing field representatives to allay school respondent\u2019s concerns on their first contact. At the same time, we were concerned that increasing our contact with the districts would increase their opportunities to refuse the survey on behalf of their schools. Results of the study indicate that additional contacts had no impact on the overall response rates of schools or districts to the survey. At the same time, precontacting the districts and providing the additional information they requested required significant resources in time and money. A number of factors may explain the inability of this contact to change response patterns. During the call to district offices, the telephone interviewer asked to speak with someone who was knowledgeable about the district\u2019s research policies. It is possible that the person they spoke with was not the decisionmaker. This is supported by the fact that some districts that refused on the telephone completed the SASS questionnaire when it was mailed to the district office. Additionally, in many of the districts that reported having formal research requirements, the request had to be approved by a committee rather than an individual.\n\nThere were indications from the research that schools function somewhat autonomously from their districts. Schools will still make their own decision about participating even when the district refuses. Forty-nine schools in districts that denied our request to participate in SASS completed the questionnaire.\n\n\fAppendix M. School District Experiment Findings M-9\nA total of 415 schools completed SASS in districts that refused to complete the district questionnaire. In past SASS surveys, the requirements for district approval were often given over the telephone. It is possible that this was a delaying tactic used by the school-level gatekeeper. However, it may be possible that when the interviewer was present at the school, this reason was no longer viable. Out of the entire SASS survey (across all Regional Offices) only 60 Teacher Listing Form cases were coded out as a district refusal. Of these, just over half (33) occurred in Regional Offices that were not part of the experiment. Only 18 of the district refusals came from the three regions involved in the study. This would seem to indicate that a school-level gatekeeper exerts more influence on the decision to participate than the school district. To more fully understand the role of the school gatekeeper, we will be conducting a study that focuses efforts on them. During the fall of 2005, Census Bureau staff will test the effectiveness of procedures to convert school-level gatekeepers into survey coordinators using incentives and other conversion techniques.\n\n\fM-10 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nAttachment M-1.

The long-term goals of the QC reinterview were to identify the causes of falsification, to determine its impact on data quality, and to prevent it in the future. The QC reinterview sought to identify instances when\n\u2022 the field representative purposefully misclassified a valid case as out-of-scope to avoid doing work;\n\u2022 the field representative knowingly keyed fewer teachers into the computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) instrument than were listed on the paper Teacher Listing Form in order to reduce keying workload; and\n\u2022 the field representative completed a form that he/she never dropped off at the school or returned to pick up to avoid a low response rate (falsification).\nA total of 150 field representatives, 94 experienced and 56 inexperienced, were checked in the QC reinterview. There were no cases of confirmed falsification.\nQuality Assurance Design\nThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and Census Bureau staff decided that 10 percent of experienced field representatives (1 or more years employment) and all inexperienced field representatives (less than 1 year of employment) would be selected for the QC reinterview. The Regional Offices trained 1,030 experienced and 109 inexperienced field representatives for the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). The plan was designed such that if eight cases were checked for a field representative, there was a 58.8 percent chance of detecting falsification if the field representative falsified at a 10 percent rate. If the field representative falsified at a higher rate, there was a greater chance of detection. If the field representative falsified at a lower rate, there was a lesser chance of detection.\nNCES wanted each selected field representative\u2019s work monitored throughout the interview period. Therefore, the QC reinterview was done in two distinct phases. The first phase started on September 25, 2003, and ended on December 1, 2003. The second phase started on December 1, 2003, and finished May 28, 2004. Selected field representatives were to be checked in both Phase I and II.\nThere were four different strategies to check for field representative falsification, one to meet each of the following areas of potential falsification:\n\u2022 validation of out-of-scope original cases; \u2022 comparison of the number of teachers listed on the paper Teacher Listing Form to the number of\nteachers the field representative keyed into the CAPI instrument (Teacher Listing Form versus roster keyed); \u2022 validation of completed teacher, school, principal, and school library media center questionnaires; and \u2022 monitoring of field representatives not in the QC reinterview.\nThe Regional Offices prepared a Weekly QC Summary Report for the field representatives in reinterview and e-mailed a copy of that report to Census Bureau headquarters staff every Tuesday beginning on October 1, 2003. An example of the Weekly QC Summary Report is included as attachment N-1.\n\n\fAppendix N. Results From the Quality Control Reinterview of the 2003\u201304 SASS N-3\nOut-of-Scope Cases\nAll out-of-scope cases for all field representatives were sent for Regional Office supervisory review. Using the appropriate out-of-scope telephone script (included in attachment N-2), the supervisor was to contact the respondent to verify that the school, principal, library, or teacher was out-of-scope. Valid outof-scope situations were possible for all four types of respondents\u2014schools, principals, school library media centers, and teachers. Definitions for out-of-scope situations can be found in attachment N-3. If the supervisor determined that the respondent was in-scope, the case was restarted. A field representative who had a case that was incorrectly classified as out-of-scope would be suspected of falsification.\nTeacher Listing Forms Versus Roster Keyed\nDuring each phase of the reinterview, the roster and corresponding Teacher Listing Form for one school with 20 or more teachers was to be checked for field representatives selected for the QC reinterview. The number of teachers keyed into the CAPI instrument was compared to the number of teachers on the Teacher Listing Form. If less than 80 percent of the number of teachers listed on the paper Teacher Listing Form were keyed into the CAPI instrument, then falsification was suspected.\nCompleted Questionnaires\nDuring each phase of reinterview, one completed school, principal, teacher, and school library media center questionnaire was to be checked from each of the field representatives selected for the QC reinterview. Using the completed questionnaire telephone script (Form SASS FRCQ-5, included as attachment N-4), the respondent was called to verify (s)he had completed the questionnaire.\nField Representatives Not in the QC Reinterview\nField representatives not selected for the QC Reinterview were also monitored for suspicious behavior. A field representative\u2019s behavior was considered suspicious if\n\u2022 the field representative did not send any Teacher Listing Forms back to the Regional Office; or \u2022 the field representative keyed less than 65 percent of the expected number of teachers at a school\nfor more than 50 percent of the schools that he or she was assigned. Only schools with 20 or more teachers were included. For most schools, the expected number of teachers was obtained from administrative data. However, for some schools the expected number of teachers was estimated.\nThe 35 percent tolerance level here is the same level that was used in the original CAPI instrument. When fewer teachers than the tolerance limit were keyed in the original CAPI instrument, the field representatives were prompted to explain why there were fewer teachers entered than expected.\nIf either of the above conditions were true, then falsification was suspected.\n\n\fN-4 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nDetailed Findings\nA total of 150 field representatives were checked for the QC reinterview. None were found to have falsified.\nOut-of-Scope Cases\nThis report only includes the out-of-scope cases for field representatives selected for the QC reinterview. There were 88 occurrences of out-of-scope cases. None of the cases were confirmed of falsification. The Boston Regional Office did not report any cases as being out-of-scope for their selected field representatives. The majority of the out-of-scope cases came from two Regional Offices. Denver had 41 percent (36 cases) and Detroit had 25 percent (22 cases) of the out-of-scope cases.\nTeacher Listing Form Versus Roster Keyed\nIn the QC reinterview, counts obtained from 302 Teacher Listing Forms were compared to counts from the CAPI instrument. Fourteen cases were found to have less than 80 percent of the names listed on the Teacher Listing Form keyed into the CAPI instrument. These cases were examined by their respective Regional Office and each was confirmed legitimate.\nAttachment N-5 contains a comparison by Regional Office of the number of teachers listed on the Teacher Listing Form to the number keyed in the CAPI instrument.\nCompleted Questionnaires\nIn the QC reinterview, the Regional Offices attempted to contact 705 respondents nationally to ensure that the respondent completed the questionnaire. The Regional Offices contacted 678 respondents. The number of questionnaires checked by each type included\n\u2022 148 school library media center questionnaires; \u2022 183 principal questionnaires; \u2022 179 school questionnaires; and \u2022 168 teacher questionnaires.\nThere were no cases of confirmed falsification. However, it should be noted that the number of questionnaires checked was much lower than what the QC plan specified. Three hundred forms of each questionnaire type should have been checked. However, the volume of the workflow (discussed in the next section, \u201cProblems in Original Survey That Impacted Reinterview\u201d) and unclear procedures caused the low counts. The Charlotte Regional Office did not check any school library media center or school questionnaires. The Los Angeles Regional Office did not check any teacher questionnaires.\nNon-QC Field Representatives\nOne field representative from the Boston Regional Office was flagged for possible falsification. Of that field representative\u2019s eligible cases, all five had less than 65 percent of the expected number of teachers keyed. Further investigation showed these were probably cases where the field representative re-opened the roster to add new names. What was believed to be an updated roster only included the new names. Thus the differences were attributable to a glitch in the software. (See the next section, \u201cProblems in Original Survey That Impacted Reinterview.\u201d)\n\n\fAppendix N. Results From the Quality Control Reinterview of the 2003\u201304 SASS N-5\nAttachment N-6 contains detailed QC results by Regional Office for each of the above items.\nProblems in Original Survey That Impacted Reinterview\n\u2022 The Regional Offices were supposed to check eight questionnaires from each selected field representative [four questionnaires (one of each type) during each phase]. However, this did not happen during production. Some field representatives did not have some types of questionnaires returned during Phase I and therefore did not have certain questionnaire types eligible for Phase I. Conversely, some field representatives did not have some types of questionnaires returned during Phase II and therefore did not have certain questionnaire types eligible for Phase II. This decreased the chances of detecting falsification.\n\u2022 Completion of the paper Teacher Listing Form for each school was not required. Comparison of the Teacher Listing Form count to the CAPI instrument count could not be made if a paper Teacher Listing Form or school printout of teachers was not available. Of the schools with more than 20 teachers, 14 cases were excluded from the analysis for this reason.\n\u2022 A problem with the CAPI instrument was identified and corrected during production. If a field representative re-opened the teacher roster to add or correct names, the CAPI instrument overwrote the original roster with only the new or corrected names.\nRecommendations and Suggestions for Future Quality Control Reinterviews\n\u2022 The QC reinterview for completed questionnaires could be incorporated into the response error questionnaire. The three questions in the Form SASS FRCQ-5 script can be added to the front of the response error questionnaire. This would also make the monitoring easier and lessen the burden on the Regional Offices. The sampling method would have to be changed if the response error and QC questionnaires were combined.\n\u2022 Another option for future evaluations would be to use a focused reinterview approach. This approach targets cases for reinterview based on certain characteristics and not a preselected random sample of field representatives. This may be the preferred option since there was not one case of confirmed falsification using random reinterview.\n\u2022 Modify the summary reports. The Weekly QC Summary report should be simplified by splitting it into two distinct reports. One report would be for the roster check, and the second report would for the completed questionnaires. A summary report for out-of-scope cases should also be used to monitor progress.\n\u2022 Investigate whether or not the Teacher Listing Form and roster counts can be evaluated at Census Bureau headquarters.\n\u2022 The responses on the four out-of-scope scripts should be keyed at the Regional Offices or the National Processing Center in Jeffersonville, Indiana. For the 2003\u201304 SASS, these scripts were keyed at Census Bureau headquarters.\n\n\fN-6 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nAttachment N-1.

An overview of the data keying operations is provided in chapter 7, and the mailout procedures are covered in chapter 5. \u201cData keying\u201d is the method by which the SASS data are captured and converted from paper to electronic format. The \u201cmailout operations\u201d include all procedures necessary for preparing SASS packages for distribution to respondents, including printing of all forms (such as letters, questionnaires, postcards, etc.), label imaging, assembly of packages for schools, training kits for the field representatives, and assembly of questionnaire packets and booklets.\nThe first section of this appendix describes the data capture operation procedures used by keying staff, and explains why different data capture procedures were used for the SASS teacher questionnaires. The second section describes the detailed procedures used for quality assurance and verification of the SASS questionnaire data capture. The third section provides results of the verification of the SASS questionnaire data capture. The fourth section describes the detailed procedures for quality assurance of the mailout operations (except for SASS reinterview questionnaires) and provides the results. The final section describes the detailed procedures for the quality assurance of the reinterview questionnaire mailout operations and provides the results.\nData Capture Operations\nThe 2003\u201304 SASS data were captured (converted from paper to electronic format) using a combination of manual data keying and imaging technology. Manual data keying, used for most of the SASS questionnaires, was accomplished using a Key from Paper (KFP) data capture system. The KFP system is programmed to present screens of questionnaire items to data keying staff, who page through each questionnaire and key any entries into the appropriate fields on the screens. The KFP system performs various edits as the data are keyed. Imaging technology differs from KFP by first capturing an electronic image of each questionnaire page. Along with the image capture, data can be captured using Optical Mark Recognition (OMR), which recognizes the marked box (next to precoded items) or the written alphanumerical entry, and enters the appropriate data into the OMR database for that questionnaire. Alternatively, the images can be presented to data keying staff, who capture the data by keying any entries into the appropriate fields on the screens (similar to the KFP process).\nAll of the SASS questionnaires except for the public and private teacher questionnaires (including all SASS reinterview questionnaires) were captured utilizing the KFP system.1 Prior to keying, KFP programs were developed for each questionnaire. Images of these forms were captured after data entry was completed. The image files were used during subsequent steps of data processing to view the actual questionnaires online. All KFP entries were 100 percent verified by the keying staff, meaning that each field was keyed twice, and the results were compared automatically for discrepancies, and subsequently verified. The verification during this operation allowed up to a 1 percent error on a field-to-field basis. Unacceptable batches of questionnaires (where there was more than a 1 percent error) were 100 percent verified a second time by keying staff.\nThe data from SASS teacher questionnaires were captured using imaging technology and a combination of OMR and Key from Image (KFI). The precoded items (all items where the respondent answered by marking a box) on the SASS public and private teacher questionnaires (SASS-4A and -4B) were captured using OMR. All write-in fields (e.g., open-ended, numeric, and character fields) for these questionnaires were captured by the KFI process. OMR and KFI are both methods used by the Workflow and Image Processing System, an automated data capture system.\n1 Teacher Listing Form data were captured using the SASS Teacher Listing instrument.\n\n\fAppendix O. Quality Assurance for Keying and Mailout Operations O-3\nThe first step of data capture for the SASS public and private teacher questionnaires was for members of keying staff to disassemble and scan each duplex booklet page. Electronic images of each duplex page were created along with a data response file. The data response file was processed through imaging recognition software at a 99 percent confidence level. If the recognition software was 99 percent certain that the response field contained a valid mark, the entry was copied to an output file. If the response fell outside the confidence level, the imaged response was presented to a keying operator to interpret and key from the image. All of the open-ended items also were presented to a member of the keying staff. All nonblank write-in KFI entries were 100 percent verified, meaning that each field was keyed twice, and the results were compared automatically for discrepancies and subsequently verified. The fields that were read as blank by the KFI system were verified at a 5 percent rate. That is, of the total number of write-in fields that were read as blanks for each item, 5 percent were examined a second time to verify that they were blank. The sample verification during this operation allowed a 1 percent error on a field-to-field basis. Unacceptable batches of questionnaires where there was more than a 1 percent error were 100 percent reverified by keying staff by referring back to the original survey.\nOnce data capture verification was complete for all batches of SASS teacher questionnaires, it was time for the final step in this process\u2014to identify any possible discrepancies within the data. This \u201cadjudication\u201d process was performed by a member of the Census Bureau QA staff. It entailed comparing the original dataset and the verification dataset to the dataset that was recorded by the data capture system. In cases where any of the fields did not match one another, QA staff looked at the data and determined what kind of error was occurring. If only one of the fields was incorrect, the error code assigned by the QA staff determined which piece of data to keep for that item. If both were incorrect, they were corrected in a separate module. Once this process was complete, the teacher dataset was ready to be released to Census analysts to begin the next step of data processing.\nThe automated OMR and KFI data capture methods were chosen for the teacher forms because of the large quantity of questionnaires, as compared to the other SASS forms. Generally, it takes more time to program the automated OMR and KFI programs than it takes to program the KFP method. But OMR captures data much faster than keying from paper, so the time savings from a large quantity of OMR data capture can offset the additional programming time for the operation.\nQuality Assurance and Verification Procedures for the Data Capture Operations\nThis section provides details on the quality assurance and verification procedures that were performed in conjunction with the SASS questionnaire data capture. The first subsection, \u201cGeneral Information on Quality Assurance Procedures,\u201d provides an overview of the procedures. The second subsection, \u201cDefinitions,\u201d provides definitions of terms. The next seven subsections provide the detailed procedures that were used. Following the procedures are a list of the error codes that were used (exhibit O-1) and, in the final subsection, a QA decision table (exhibit O-2).\nGeneral Information on Quality Assurance Procedures\n1. This QA plan provided a method of assuring the quality of the data capture operations for the 2003\u201304 SASS utilizing the Workflow and Image Processing System (WIPS) Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) and the Key From Paper (KFP) system (documentary purposes only). The method of data capture and the surveys and form types that were used with each method are as follows: a. OMR and KFI. Teacher Questionnaire (SASS-4A) and Private School Teacher Questionnaire (SASS-4B); and\n\n\fO-4 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nb. KFP. School District Questionnaire (SASS-1A), Principal Questionnaire (SASS-2A), Private School Principal Questionnaire (SASS-2B), Principal Reinterview Questionnaire (SASS2(R)), School Questionnaire (SASS-3A), Private School Questionnaire (SASS-3B), School Reinterview Questionnaire (SASS-3(R)), Unified School Questionnaire (SASS-3Y), Public Teacher Reinterview Questionnaire (SASS-4A(R)), Private Teacher Reinterview Questionnaire (SASS-4B(R)), and School Library Media Center Questionnaire (LS-1A).\n2. For the teacher questionnaires, data were captured utilizing the OMR data capture system to perform the automated data capture for the checkboxes and the KFI process for all other fields. Batches normally consisted of 10 documents. All nonblank data fields were 100 percent KFI verified. Batches were subject to having fields designated by the system as blank sample verified at a 5 percent rate. The sample verification during this operation had an acceptable quality level of a 1 percent on a field basis. Unacceptable (sample verified) batches were reverified on a 100 percent basis.\nFor all other SASS form types, data were captured utilizing the KFP Data Capture System. Batches were 100 percent verified (no QA plan required).\n3. Upon completion of data capture for OMR batches, copies of the images were sent for independent KFI verification.\n4. Upon completion of the independent verification for each batch, the original dataset and the verification dataset were matched. Any discrepancies were identified and adjudicated by the Quality Assurance Data Analysis Unit.\n5. Once adjudication was complete, accepted batches were released for subsequent transmission. Rejected batches underwent 100 percent reverification, were matched against the original dataset, adjudicated, and released.\n6. Keying staff in Jeffersonville, Indiana, completed keyboarding and procedural training prior to commencing production keying.\n7. Batch statistics were maintained by the system and utilized by the QA staff to generate summary reports. Reports were provided to the sponsor and data capture management regarding project quality and for feedback to data capture operators.\n8. Error codes for error classification are provided in the subsection, \u201cError Codes (Fields Only),\u201d of this QA plan.\nDefinitions\n1. A batch consisted of 10 SASS teacher questionnaire forms with a cover sheet for scanning and data capture purposes. All other form types were batched in convenient lots to be determined jointly by clerical staff. The size of the batch was the number of forms in the batch.\n2. A zone is synonymous with field and is the smallest denomination of defined captured data.\n3. An error is defined as any incorrectly captured or omitted data field.\n4. An error is assigned during the adjudication operation.\n\n\fAppendix O. Quality Assurance for Keying and Mailout Operations O-5\na. Charged errors are errors determined to be the fault of the keyer and were used to determine the keyer\u2019s error rate.\nb. Noncharged errors are keying errors that were not charged against the keyer. c. Some discrepancies were considered noncountable. These were classified as verifier errors\n(VE) and verifier adjustments (VA). They did not affect the keyer or batch status and were not counted against either the keyer or the batch.\n5. Eligible sampling unit is a field that was eligible to be selected for verification.\n6. A field is the smallest denomination of keyed data, as defined in the keying procedures.\n7. A blank field is a field where no data were detected by the system and a keyer did not see the field.\n8. Census Batch Number is a unique number created during the batching process.\n9. WIPS Batch Number is a unique eight-digit number created by the Workflow and Image Processing System (WIPS) during scanning.\n10. A field was considered to be defective if it contained one or more errors. This is synonymous with field in error.\n11. A discrepancy occurred when the verifier\u2019s entry for any field differed from its corresponding field in the original data capture process.\n12. Adjudication refers to the process of comparing the discrepancies to the data source to determine which entry was correct.\n13. Flagged fields are fields that were presented to the operator during the original data capture process.\n14. Unflagged fields are fields that were captured by the system and not presented to an operator during the original data capture process.\n15. Key From Image (KFI) is the process where an operator was NOT presented with the OMR interpretation of the captured data, and the operator entered the data using the snippet and/or fullpage image.\n16. A snippet is the image of a zone that was presented to the operator during the data capture process.\n17. The verifier is the operator who independently keyed the data for the match to the original data to subsequently determine the quality of the batch.\n18. Reverification is the term used for performing 100 percent verification of rejected batches.\n19. Excluded fields are fields that were captured but not eligible for verification. These surveys have no such fields.\n\n\fO-6 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nVerification\n1. KFI verification a. Upon completion of the initial data capture, independent KFI verification was performed. Eligible fields on the images were presented to a KFI operator for verification. b. For batches subjected to sample verification for blank fields, a 5 percent systematic sample utilizing a random start was drawn from the universe of fields where the system did not detect presence of data and the fields were not seen by a keyer. c. The verification was performed in the following manner: (1) independently keying all fields presented by the system using the snippet and full-page image; and (2) using the same keying rules as used in the initial data capture. d. All errors detected in the verification process were corrected. e. If, during data capture, an image was determined to be illegible due to scanning problems, the batch was suspended and subsequently deleted and re-scanned.\n2. KFP verification a. Upon completion of the initial data capture, independent KFP verification was performed. The verifier keyed all fields on the documents except for those designated as \u201cscan verify\u201d in the keying procedures. b. The same keying rules were used as in the initial data capture. c. All errors detected in the verification process were corrected.\nQuality Assurance Adjudication\n1. Upon completion of the verification, the original dataset and the verification dataset for each batch were matched by the data capture system. Any discrepancies were identified and adjudicated by the Quality Assurance Data Analysis Unit staff.\n2. If any fields within the batch did not match, the QA adjudicator determined if the productioncaptured data were in error. Assigned error codes determined the data field to be retained in the final dataset. If both fields were in error (error code 11), that field was routed to an OMR module for correction and returned to adjudication.\n3. Once adjudication was completed, accepted batches were released for subsequent transmission. Rejected batches underwent 100 percent KFI, were matched against the original dataset, adjudicated, and released.\nKeyer Control\n1. All keyers were placed in the qualified status. Each keyer became familiar with the format of the forms to be keyed.\n2. Keyers in the qualified stage did not make decisions. Batch decisions on blank fields only were made in this stage.\n3. Keyers were only removed based on an administrative decision (restricted stage\u2014keyer status = R). Restricted keyers were not eligible to perform verification.\n\n\fAppendix O. Quality Assurance for Keying and Mailout Operations O-7\nBatch Control\n1. Batch decisions for blank fields were sample verified and made.\n2. All rejected batches were 100 percent reverified (KFI), matched against the original dataset, adjudicated, and released.\n3. No batch decisions were made for nonblank data fields or KFP batches.\n4. The system checked the keyer status of each verifier before allowing the verifier to verify a batch.\nFeedback\nDiscrepancy listings were provided for all batches. Keyers were given feedback for all errors and all cases in which they had shown improvement.\nRejected Batches\n1. All rejected batches were set by the system to be reverified.\n2. Reverification of rejected batches occurred as soon as possible. This was considered part of the feedback to the keyer of the keying problems encountered.\n3. Reverification required the verifier to independently reverify the batch on a 100 percent basis.\nQuality Assurance Responsibilities\n1. The Quality Assurance Data Analysis Unit performed QA adjudication on all batches processed through the OMR and KFP operations.\n2. The Visual Basic system generated a discrepancy listing for each batch for feedback to the operators.\n3. The QA staff audited all discrepancies using the discrepancy listing and the source data.\n4. Batch statistics were maintained by the system and utilized to generate summary reports. The Quality Assurance Data Analysis Unit provided weekly summary reports of the results of the QA process.\n\n\fO-8 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nError Codes (Fields Only)\n\nExhibit O-1 provides a list of error codes and definitions.\n\nExhibit O-1.

All packages that were mailed to respondents and field representatives were mailed from Jeffersonville, Indiana, by the Census Bureau clerical processing staff.\nForms and questionnaires were printed by commercial vendors or custom produced on docuprint equipment. Commercial vendors produced blank questionnaires that subsequently went through a separate labeling process, or docuprinting, in Jeffersonville. All of the SASS questionnaires except the Private School Questionnaire, the Unified School Questionnaire, and the reinterview questionnaires were printed commercially.\nThe docuprint equipment allowed for printing labeled questionnaires in one operation. The system was loaded with images of each questionnaire page, and a file of variable data for each respondent. The system can be programmed to print variable data that is specific to that respondent on any page of the questionnaire. For the 2003\u201304 SASS, docuprint was used to print variable data\u2014the name and address of the school, the school\u2019s control number and associated barcode\u2014on the cover page of the Private School Questionnaire, the Unified School Questionnaire, and reinterview questionnaires. It also printed identification barcodes on each questionnaire page. All blank questionnaires, peel-off labels (used along with blank questionnaires by field representatives as replacement questionnaires), letters, postcards, and other custom forms, such as District Contact Sheets, also were produced using the docuprint equipment.\nFor questionnaire booklets, the docuprint equipment loaded one 17-inch by 11-inch sheet at a time. Four questionnaire pages (8.5 x 11, front and back) were printed onto this sheet. Once all sheets for a questionnaire booklet were completed, a sample of the work was examined to ensure that no errors occurred. When an error was found, an expanded inspection examined the questionnaires that were produced before and after the detected questionnaire to determine if a systematic error had taken place. Once the quality assurance of the printing was completed, the sheets went through a binding operation using Duplo Booklet Maker equipment. The Booklet Maker read the barcode to determine when the designated number of sheets for a particular questionnaire were loaded into the machine, and then folded and stapled it twice in the spine, and trimmed the right-side vertical edge of the booklet. Booklets were subjected to sample inspections and, when defects were detected, to expanded inspections. The docuprinting of all letters, questionnaires, postcards, labels, etc. and label imaging also were inspected for damage and incorrect presentation.\nCommercially printed blank questionnaires were loaded into an Ektajet high-speed printer for labeling. The variable data for each respondent was programmed into the machine, and printer heads labeled the front page of each questionnaire as it passed through the machine. Labeled questionnaires were subjected to sample inspections and, when defects were detected, to expanded inspections.\nThe assembly of packages for schools, training kits for field representatives, and questionnaire packets were all inspected to assure that nothing was damaged, missing, contained undisclosed information, or was incorrectly presented. The results of the mailout QA, including error remarks, for all initial mailout operations can be found in exhibits O-7 through O-12.

All packages that were mailed to respondents and field representatives were mailed from Jeffersonville, Indiana, by Census Bureau clerical processing staff. There were a number of details that were inspected for defects during the reinterview mailout phase of SASS. The printing of all forms (including letters, questionnaires, postcards, labels, etc.) was inspected for damage and incorrect presentation. The reinterview packages for schools were inspected to assure that nothing was damaged, missing, contained undisclosed information, or was incorrectly presented. Finally, the questionnaire booklets were inspected to assure that they were assembled and bound properly and were not damaged.\n\nThe results of the mailout quality assurance, including error remarks, for all reinterview mailout operations can be found in exhibits O-13 through O-15.\n\n\fO-24 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nExhibit O-13.

Weighting Adjustment Cells\n\nA detailed listing of the weighting classes, or cells, is contained in this appendix. Presented first are the public school, principal, and library media center level adjustments. Presented next are the public school district level adjustments, followed by the private school and principal level adjustments. The teacher level adjustments are presented last.

Response Variance in the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey S-3\nSummary\nThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) sponsors the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. SASS is an integrated set of surveys including principal, school, and teacher surveys. The Census Bureau first conducted SASS during the 1987\u20131988 school year. This report describes the results of the reinterview program for the 2003\u201304 SASS. The purpose of the reinterview was to measure response variance for certain questions that NCES and the Census Bureau considered critical to the survey or suspected were problematic. Previous reports contain the reinterview results from the 1987\u201388 (Newbrough 1989), 1990\u201391 (Royce 1994), 1993\u201394 (Bushery, Schreiner, and Sebron 1998), and 1999\u20132000 (Ennis and Miller 2004) school years.\nReinterview programs allow for detecting problems in the questions, but usually they can neither identify causes of response error nor correct the problems. High response variance indicates a problematic question, and moderate response variance suggests some problems with reliability.\nIt is useful to note which questions were the same or were modified in the current SASS (2003\u201304) and the previous SASS (1999\u20132000). The School Reinterview Questionnaire for the 2003\u201304 SASS was compared with the Private School Reinterview Questionnaire and the Public School Reinterview Questionnaire for the 1999\u20132000 SASS. The table with the listing of the questions for the schools can be found in the section \u201cQuestions in Both the 1999\u20132000 SASS and the 2003\u20132004 SASS\u2014School Reinterview Questionnaire.\u201d The Private Teacher Reinterview Questionnaire and the Public Teacher Reinterview Questionnaire for the 2003\u201304 SASS were compared with the Teacher Reinterview Questionnaire for the 1999\u20132000 SASS. The table with the listing of the questions for the teachers can be found in the section \u201cQuestions in Both the 1999\u20132000 SASS and the 2003\u201304 SASS\u2014Private Teacher and Public Teacher Reinterview Questionnaires.\u201d There is not a table for the principals, because there was no principal reinterview questionnaire for the 1999\u20132000 SASS.\nMajor Findings\nPrincipal Reinterview Questionnaire\u2014Private and Public School Principals\nThe response variance was evaluated in 17 questions for the private school principals, and 20 questions for the public school principals from the 2003\u201304 SASS Principal Reinterview Questionnaire. The questions were divided into five groups according to the question topic. Tables S-1 and S-2 summarize the levels of response variance for each group of questions for the private and public school principals, respectively. A copy of the Principal Reinterview Questionnaire can be found in Attachment S-1.\nThe numbers in the percent columns in tables S-1 through S-6 are the percentage of questions that fall in that type of variance (high, moderate, or low).\n\n\fS-4 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable S-1.

Response Variance in the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey S-7\n\nMethodology\n\nReinterview Procedures\n\nFor the original survey, questionnaires were delivered to respondents and were self-administered. The nonrespondents were contacted by Census Bureau field representatives for follow-up. Once the Census Bureau clerical staff received a completed original questionnaire from a respondent selected for reinterview, the staff then mailed out the proper reinterview questionnaire with a letter explaining the purpose of the reinterview to the respondent. The respondents would complete the reinterview questionnaires (self-administered) and then mail the questionnaires back to the Census Bureau clerical staff in the provided envelope. A second mailout was sent for people who did not respond by February 24, 2004.\n\nReinterview Sample Design\n\nSASS is an integrated set of surveys including school, principal, and teacher surveys. Public and private schools each have their own unique surveys. The reinterview sample for each of the SASS surveys is a random subsample of that survey\u2019s full sample.\n\nPrivate Schools and Principals Sampling\n\nThe final 2003\u201304 SASS private school sample (3,662) was used as the reinterview sample frame. With the 370 desired reinterviews there was a 90 percent certainty that a change of 5 percent in the respondents\u2019 answers between the original and reinterview could be detected. An oversample was taken to account for original survey and reinterview noninterviews. This brought the total number of cases selected for the private school sample to 686. The response rates were taken from the 1999\u20132000 SASS and its reinterview to calculate the reinterview sample. Exhibit S-1 documents how the private school reinterview sample size was computed.\n\nExhibit S-1.

With the 1,261 desired reinterviews there was a 90 percent certainty that a change of 5 percent in the respondents\u2019 answers between the original and reinterview could be detected. The sample was oversampled to account for original survey and reinterview noninterviews. That brought the total number of cases selected for the public school sample to 1,951. The response rates were taken from the 1999\u2013 2000 SASS and its reinterview to calculate the reinterview sample.

The public and private school teacher samples were chosen separately. For both the public and private school teacher desired reinterview samples there was a 90 percent certainty that a change of 5 percent in the respondents\u2019 answers between the original and reinterview could be detected. An oversample was taken to account for original survey and reinterview noninterviews. This brought the total number of cases selected for the teacher sample to 4,133.

The response error reinterview is considered as a simple random sub-sample drawn from the original sample.\n\nThe data were weighted to account for reinterview sampling. After the reinterview data were weighted, the data were then reweighted back to the reinterview sample size. The purpose of the weighting was to obtain the correct distribution of the reinterview cases across the population. The reweight process is used to re-adjust the inflated size back to the actual sample size in reinterview. Therefore, each case in the reinterview sample has a weight of:\n\n\u2211 worig i\n\n\u2211 RI\n\norig original\n\nw = w * i\n\ni\n\norig\n\nwi\n\nre int ervuew\n\nReinterview Model Assumptions\n\nThe response error reinterview model assumes the reinterview is an independent replication of the original interview.\n\nIndependence means that the response errors are not correlated between the original interview and the reinterview. If the respondents remembered their original answers and consciously repeated them in the reinterview, the independence assumption would be violated. Lack of independence generally results in underestimates of response variance.\n\nReplication means that the reinterview was conducted under the same conditions as the original interview. If the reinterview replicates the original interview, the distribution of the original and reinterview responses will be the same. With quantitative data, the means and variances of the original and reinterview responses will be equal. With categorical data, the difference between the original proportion in-category and the reinterview proportion in-category, the net difference rate (NDR), will be zero.\n\n\fAppendix S. Response Variance in the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey S-11\n\nMeasures Used to Estimate Response Variance1\n\nRandom errors of measurement in the survey process (nonsampling error) increase the mean square error (MSE) of the data collected. When the errors are not correlated with the answers or with each other, this variability is called \u201csimple response variance.\u201d\n\nThe index of inconsistency (index) and the gross difference rate (GDR) are the principal measures of response variance in categorical data. The index and GDR are estimated for each question category.\n\nOverall estimates of the index and the GDR for a question, the aggregate index and the aggregate GDR, apply to questions with three or more answer categories.\n\nThis report provides 90 percent confidence intervals for these measures. See the section on \u201cResponse Variance Formulas\u201d for the formulas used to calculate the reinterview measures and the confidence intervals.\n\nIndex of Inconsistency\n\nThe index of inconsistency estimates the ratio of simple response variance to total variance for a question answer. It is a relative measure of simple response variance.\n\nThe aggregate index is similar to the index of inconsistency, but it applies to the entire question rather than a specific answer category. It is an average index of inconsistency across all categories for the question. For questions with two categories (e.g., yes/no questions), the index of inconsistency and the aggregate index are equal.\n\nAn aggregate index of zero means responses were in perfect agreement, but an index of 100 does not mean that all of the respondents changed answers. Rather, this is what would be expected if there were no relationship between original and reinterview answers beyond chance agreement.\n\nUse this rule of thumb to interpret the index of inconsistency and the aggregate index.\n\nIndex value Less than 20 Between 20 and 50 Greater than 50\n\nResponse variance level Low Moderate High\n\nInterpretation Usually not a major problem Somewhat problematic Very problematic\n\nAny of these factors may cause high response variance:\n\n\u2022 The methods used to collect the data may need improvement or the question may be unclearly written.\n\u2022 The concept itself may not be measurable. \u2022 Respondents may not be able to provide reliable information to the level of detail asked.\n\n1 See the following references: Hansen, Hurwitz, and Marks (1951); Hansen, Hurwitz, and Madow (1953); Lessler and Kalsbeek (1992); and U.S. Bureau of the Census (n.d.).\n\n\fS-12 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nGross Difference Rate\n\nThe gross difference rate (GDR) is the percentage of responses that fall in a category in the original interview but not in the reinterview, or vice versa. For a single category, one-half the GDR estimates the simple response variance.\n\nThe aggregate GDR applies to an entire question rather than to a specific answer category. For questions with more than two categories, the aggregate GDR is the percentage of responses that change between the original interview and the reinterview.\n\nGDR is more difficult to interpret than the index of inconsistency. Large GDRs indicate serious response variance in the data. Unfortunately, a small GDR is no guarantee of good consistency. In a low-frequency category, even a small GDR can represent high response variance relative to total variance. If this is the case, the index of inconsistency will tell us.\n\nNet Difference Rate\n\nIn categorical data, the net difference rate (NDR) helps indicate how well the reinterview meets some of the model assumptions. A statistically significant NDR (i.e., statistically different from zero) suggests that the reinterview may not replicate the original survey conditions as well as desired.\n\nThe McNemar Test for the Yes/No questions tests whether the NDR is significant. The Hui-Walter Method is used to calculate the index for the Yes/No questions if the NDR is found to be significant. More information about this method is available in the section titled \u201cHui-Walter Method.\u201d\n\nThe Bowker Test is an extension of the McNemar Test and is used for the questions that have multiple categories.\n\nFor the quantitative questions, the mean difference between the paired responses was tested to see if it is significantly different from zero. This test provides information analogous to the NDR.\n\nCross-Tabulations\n\nFor a \u201cyes/no\u201d question, the cross-tabulation looks like this:\n\nReinterview response\nTotal Not applicable Subtotal Yes No\n\nOriginal response\n\nNot\n\nTotal applicable Subtotal\n\nYes\n\nn a + b c + d\n\na + c a c\n\nNo\nb + d b d\n\nwhere\n\nn = the number of respondents who answered the question in both the original and the reinterview;\na = the number of respondents who answered \u201cyes\u201d both times; b = the number of respondents whose answer changed from \u201cno\u201d in the original to \u201cyes\u201d in the\nreinterview;\n\n\fAppendix S. Response Variance in the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey S-13\nc = the number of respondents whose answer changed from \u201cyes\u201d in the original to \u201cno\u201d in the reinterview; and\nd = the number of respondents who answered \u201cno\u201d both times.\nOnly cases where respondents answered the question in both the original interview and reinterview were used to compute the response variance measures.\nIn multicategory questions, these cross-tabulations show the movement among answer categories between the original interview and the reinterview. Patterns in this movement can provide clues to the reasons for inconsistent reporting. In some cases, such movement may even suggest question revisions to reduce response variance.\nResponse Variance Measures for Rare Categories\nA rare characteristic is one that is not widely distributed among a population. From a response variance perspective a characteristic is called rare when a small percent of cases fall in the category represented by the characteristic. In this report, 5 percent is set as the cut-off point. The index of inconsistency may be substantially higher for rare categories when only a few individuals among the small number reporting the characteristic change their response (interview vs. reinterview). This may also be a problem for small sample sizes, even when they do not have rare characteristics.\nA category which represents a rare characteristic will have small total variance. This makes the ratio of the simple response variance to total variance seem larger in comparison to that ratio for more common characteristics. High indexes were observed for rare categories in a distribution even though the gross difference rate (the proportion of individuals in the sample changing their responses) may be small. The problem with rare characteristics is that the point estimate (index) is highly biased. If the GDR is greater than 5 percent then the question is problematic. If the GDR is less than 5 percent then the question is not problematic.\nLimitations\nAs is always a potential problem with response error reinterviews, not all reinterviews may have been independent, in that some respondents may have simply remembered and repeated their original answers. For some questions, the reinterview did not replicate the original interview. For the public school principals, private school teachers, and public school teachers, the proportion of questions in which the NDR was statistically significant was higher than the 10 percent that would be expected by chance. Specifically, 6.8 percent of the 59 response categories in questions evaluated for the private school principals, 22.7 percent of the 75 response categories in questions evaluated for the public school principals, 0 percent of the 24 response categories in questions evaluated for the private schools, 7.4 percent of the 54 response categories in questions evaluated for the public schools, 11.6 percent of the 86 response categories in questions evaluated for the private school teachers, and 15.4 percent of the 156 response categories in questions evaluated for the public school teachers were statistically significant for the Bowker Test or displayed statistically significant NDRs.\nOperational constraints often make it difficult to conduct the reinterview as an exact replication of the original. When a reinterview does not replicate the original interview perfectly, the differences in methodology may cause an overestimation or underestimation of the response variance.\nOne reason the reinterview did not replicate the original interview is that the reinterview contains only a subset of questions from the original interview questionnaire.\n\n\fS-14 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nDetailed Results\nFor ease in presentation, the questions were divided into groups based on content. In each group, the questions discussed are those that exhibited moderate response variance (indices between 20 and 50) or high response variance (indices greater than 50). The estimates of reliability are given with 90 percent confidence intervals. The questions were mentioned if the Bowker Test for symmetry or t test was found to be significant. The Yes/No questions are mentioned if the categories were found to be rare. Certain questions were not evaluated because there were not enough data. Questions where at least 138 respondents did not answer both the original interview and reinterview were not evaluated. The method used to find the sample size of 138 can be found in the section titled \u201cHow Many Responses Are Necessary for Analysis?\u201d A listing of all the question numbers and their response variance levels (indexes) can be found in the section titled \u201cSummary of Response Variance Levels by Question Number.\u201d\nUnless shown otherwise, categorical questions have \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d as possible responses. The \u201cmark all that applies\u201d questions were analyzed as individual \u201cYes or No\u201d questions.\nFor the questions with high indexes, logistic regression was used to test a model for inconsistency with explanatory variables gender, age, race, and ethnicity for the principals and teachers. Significant explanatory variables contributed to the inconsistency of the responses between the original interview and the reinterview. The odds ratios produced by logistic regression were reported if they were greater than 1.5. Logistic regression was only used on the questions where the model fit the data. The data were not distributed properly for logistic regression to be appropriate for the categorical questions. Logistic regression was used for the quantitative questions where the t test did not fail. The indexes and GDRs for the questions can be found in the final section, \u201cMeasures.\u201d\nPrincipal Reinterview Questionnaire\u2014Private and Public School Principals\nExperience, Training, and Working Conditions\nQuestion 1: What is the highest degree you have earned?\nMark (X) only one box.\n1 G Associate degree 2 G Bachelor\u2019s degree (B.A., B.S., B.E., etc.) 3 G Master\u2019s degree (M.A., M.A.T., M.B.A., M.Ed., M.S., etc.) 4 G Education specialist or professional diploma (at least one year beyond master\u2019s level) 5 G Doctorate or first professional degree (Ph.D., Ed.D., M.D., L.L.B., J.D., D.D.S.) 6 G Do not have a degree\nFor the public school principals, the question had a moderate response variance with an index of 32.09 (28.95, 35.91).

The question had a moderate response variance for the public school teachers with an index of 22.27 (19.67, 24.86). The index was evaluated using the Hui-Walter Method since the McNemar Test indicated that the NDR was statistically different from zero, suggesting the model assumptions were not met as well as desired.\nThe answer category \u201csecondary grades\u201d had a moderate response variance for the public school teachers with an index of 29.77 (25.47, 34.92), which implies that this question is somewhat problematic. Approximately 14.11 percent (12.10, 16.54) of the respondents changed their answers from the original interview to the reinterview.\nApproximately 5.11 percent (3.85, 6.76) of the respondents changed their answers from the original interview to the reinterview. The analysis of this question showed that the \u201cYes\u201d category was rare. Therefore, the index cannot be used to evaluate the question. However, the question is problematic since more than 5 percent of the respondents were inconsistent with their responses between the two interviews.\nQuestion 9c (part 1): If there is an additional content area that the certificate described above allows you to teach, please list it below. Otherwise, GO TO item 10a.\n\nCode\n\nContent Area\n\nThere were too many categories, and not enough data in each of the response categories, to evaluate this question. The collapsed categories can be found on table 3 on the questionnaires (attachments S-3 and S4). The response categories of this question were collapsed to the following 14 categories:\n\n\u2022 elementary education; \u2022 secondary education; \u2022 special education; \u2022 arts & music; \u2022 English and language arts; \u2022 English as a second language; \u2022 foreign languages;\n\n\fS-34 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\u2022 mathematics and computer science; \u2022 health education; \u2022 natural sciences; \u2022 social sciences; \u2022 vocational/technical education; \u2022 miscellaneous; and \u2022 other.\nThe question had a moderate response variance for the public school teachers with an index of 22.81 (18.98, 28.47). Approximately 20.41 percent (16.17, 24.64) of the respondents changed their answers from the original interview to the reinterview. The analysis of this question showed that the \u201carts and music,\u201d \u201cforeign languages,\u201d \u201chealth education,\u201d \u201cvocational/technical education,\u201d \u201cmiscellaneous,\u201d and \u201cother\u201d categories were rare. Also, the NDR for the \u201cnatural sciences\u201d category was statistically significant from zero. The Bowker Test for symmetry indicated that the original interview and the reinterview have the same distribution. Therefore the index can be used to evaluate this question. The moderate index indicates that the question is somewhat problematic.\nQuestion 9c (part 2): Which of the following grade ranges does this certificate apply to?\nMark (X) all that apply.\n1 G Elementary grades (including early childhood, preschool and kindergarten) 2 G Secondary grades (including middle school) 3 G Ungraded\nThe answer category \u201cElementary grades\u201d had a moderate response variance for the public school teachers with an index of 24.44 (18.43, 32.74), which implies that this question is somewhat problematic. Approximately 12.24 percent (9.31, 16.31) of the respondents changed their answers from the original interview to the reinterview.\nThe answer category \u201csecondary grades\u201d had a moderate response variance for the public school teachers with an index of 24.01 (17.23, 33.76), which implies that this question is somewhat problematic. Approximately 9.28 percent (6.55, 13.16) of the respondents changed their answers from the original interview to the reinterview.\nApproximately 5.51 percent (3.50, 8.66) of the respondents changed their answers from the original interview to the reinterview. The analysis of this question showed that the \u201cYes\u201d category was rare. Therefore, the index cannot be used to evaluate the question. However, the question is problematic since more than 5 percent of the respondents were inconsistent with their responses between the two interviews.\nNote: Question 10a was different for the Private and Public Teacher Questionnaires.\nQuestion 10a (Public School Teachers): Do you have another current teaching certificate from this state?\nThe question had a moderate response variance for the public teachers with an index of 47.27 (38.07, 58.90), which implies that this question is somewhat problematic. Approximately 7.63 percent (6.09, 9.55) of the respondents changed their answers from the original interview to the reinterview.\n\n\fAppendix S.

Approximately 7.38 percent (3.86, 10.91) of the respondents changed their answers from the original interview to the reinterview. The analysis of this question showed that categories \u201c2,\u201d \u201c3,\u201d \u201c4,\u201d and \u201c5\u201d were rare. The Bowker Test for symmetry indicated that the original interview and the reinterview have the same distribution. Therefore, the index can be used to evaluate this question. The moderate index indicates that the question is somewhat problematic.\nQuestion 11a (Only Private School Teachers): Do you have another current teaching certificate from this state?\nThe question had a high response variance for the private school teachers with an index of 52.56 (34.02, 82.10), which implies that this question is very problematic. Approximately 8.67 percent (5.51, 13.62) of the respondents changed their answers from the original interview to the reinterview.\nProfessional Development\nQuestion 12a (Private School Teachers) and Question 11a (Public School Teachers): In the past 12 months, have you participated in any professional development activities specific to and concentrating on the content of the subject(s) you teach?\nApproximately 24.57 percent (20.90, 29.17) of the private school teachers changed their answers from the original interview to the reinterview. The question had a high response variance for the private school teachers with an index of 54.66 (52.18, 57.13). The index was evaluated using the Hui-Walter Method since the McNemar Test indicated that the NDR was statistically different from zero, suggesting the model assumptions were not met as well as desired.\nApproximately 17.19 percent (15.08, 19.68) of the public school teachers changed their answers from the original interview to the reinterview. The question had a high response variance for the public school teachers with an index of 66.04 (62.04, 70.03).

Approximately 50.96 percent (44.39, 57.52) of the respondents changed their answers from the original interview to the reinterview. The Bowker Test for symmetry indicated that the original interview and the reinterview have the same distribution. Therefore the index can be used to evaluate this question. The high index indicates that the question is problematic, since many of the respondents changed their responses between the two interviews.\nThe question had a high response variance for the public school teachers with an index of 68.07 (63.77, 73.38). Approximately 50.56 percent (47.00, 54.12) of the respondents changed their answers from the original interview to the reinterview. The NDRs for the \u201c8 hours,\u201d \u201c17\u201332 hours,\u201d and \u201c33 hours or more\u201d categories were statistically different from zero.

The high index indicates that the question is problematic, since many of the respondents changed their responses between the two interviews.\nQuestion 12c (Private School Teachers) and Question 11c (Public School Teachers): Overall, how useful were these activities to you?\nMark (X) only one box.\n1 G Not useful 2 G Somewhat useful 3 G Useful 4 G Very useful\nThe question had a high response variance for the private school teachers with an index of 63.28 (55.39, 75.01). Approximately 41.77 percent (35.32, 48.23) of the respondents changed their answers from the original interview to the reinterview. The analysis of this question showed that the \u201cnot useful\u201d category was rare. The Bowker Test for symmetry indicated that the original interview and the reinterview have the same distribution. Therefore the index can be used to evaluate this question. The high index indicates that the question is problematic, since many of the respondents changed their responses between the two interviews.\nThe question had a high response variance for the public school teachers with an index of 56.29 (51.46, 62.31). Approximately 35.59 percent (32.18, 39.01) of the respondents changed their answers from the original interview to the reinterview. The analysis of this question showed that the \u201cnot useful\u201d category was rare. The Bowker Test for symmetry indicated that the original interview and the reinterview have the same distribution. Therefore the index can be used to evaluate this question. The high index indicates that the question is problematic, since many of the respondents changed their responses between the two interviews.\n\n\fAppendix S. Response Variance in the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey S-37\nThe four answer categories were collapsed into two categories. The three categories \u201csomewhat useful,\u201d \u201cuseful,\u201d and \u201cvery useful\u201d were combined into one category. The other category was \u201cnot useful.\u201d The question still had a high response variance for the private and public school teachers. However, the GDR was much lower for the private and public school teachers, which is not surprising since there are fewer categories to change an answer from the original interview to the reinterview.\nResources and Assessments of Students\nQuestion 13 (Private School Teachers) and Question 12 (Public School Teachers): Of all the students you teach at this school, how many have an Individual Education Plan (IEP) because they have disabilities or are special education students?\nIf none, please mark (X) the box.\n0 G None\nStudents\nThe question had a moderate response variance for the private school teachers with an index of 29.72 (8.78, 50.66), which implies that this question is somewhat problematic.\nFor the public school teachers, the t test indicated that there is a significant difference in the means of the original interview and the reinterview. Therefore, the index of inconsistency should not be used to evaluate this question.\nQuestion 14 (Private School Teachers) and Question 13 (Public School Teachers): Of all the students you teach at this school, how many are of limited-English proficiency?\n(Students of limited-English proficiency are those whose native or dominant language is other than English, and who have sufficient difficulty speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English language as to deny them the opportunity to learn successfully in an English-speaking only classroom.)\nIf none, please mark (X) the box.\n0 G None\nStudents\nThe question had a high response variance for the private school teachers with an index of 66.05 (57.34, 74.76), which implies that this question is very problematic. The gender and age of the private school teacher were found to be significant. The odds of being in the inconsistent group are 1.553 times more for a male private school teacher than for a female private school teacher. The odds of being in the inconsistent group are 1.892 times more for a private school teacher who is Asian than for a private school teacher who is White.\nThe question had a moderate response variance for the public school teachers with an index of 40.14 (31.53, 48.76), which implies that this question is somewhat problematic.\n\n\fS-38 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\nWorking Conditions\nQuestion 15 (Private School Teachers) and Question 14 (Public School Teachers): How many total hours do you spend on ALL teaching and other school-related activities during a typical FULL WEEK at this school?\nInclude hours spent working during the school day, before school, after school, and on weekends.\nTotal weekly hours\nThe question had a moderate response variance for the public school teachers with an index of 52.32 (31.53, 73.11), which implies that this question is somewhat problematic.\nQuestion 16 (Private School Teachers) and Question 15 (Public School Teachers): How many hours are you required to work to receive base pay during a typical FULL WEEK at this school?\n(This would be base contract hours, or the equivalent.)\nTotal weekly hours\nFor the public teachers, the t-test indicated that there is a significant difference in the means of the original interview and the reinterview. Therefore, the index of inconsistency should not be used to evaluate this question.\nQuestion 17 (Private School Teachers) and Question 16 (Public School Teachers): How many hours a week do you spend delivering instruction to a class of students?\nIf you are a pull-out teacher, please include the number of hours you instruct individual students or small groups of students.\nTotal weekly hours\nThe question had a moderate response variance for the private school teachers with an index of 33.73 (15.33, 52.13), which implies that this question is somewhat problematic.\nThe question had a high response variance for the public school teachers with an index of 65.64 (49.36, 81.92), which implies that this question is very problematic. The gender, age, races (Black or AfricanAmerican, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native) and ethnicity of the public school teacher were found to be significant. The odds of being in the inconsistent group are 1.751 times more for a female public school teacher than for a male public school teacher.

The formula is:\n\nPo = [(a + c)/n] \u00d7 100\n\u2022 Reinterview Percentage\u2014the percentage of reinterview responses in a specific answer category. The formula is:\n\nPr = [(a + b)/n] \u00d7 100\n\u2022 Net Difference Rate (NDR)\u2014the difference between the original percent in a specific answer category and the reinterview percent in that category. The net difference rate measures the net effect of responses changing into and out of that category. The formula is:\n\nNDR = Po - Pr = [[(a + c) - (a + b)]/n] \u00d7 100\n= [(c - b)/n] \u00d7 100\n\n\u2022 Gross Difference Rate (GDR)\u2014the percentage of the responses which change into or out of a specific answer category. The formula is:\n\nGDR = [(b + c)/n] \u00d7 100\n\n\u2022 Simple Response Variance\u2014the average variance of responses from the same units to the same question over repeated interviews.

The results of the Hui-Walter can be used to estimate the index of inconsistency from interview and reinterview data, generally when the assumption of independence for the response error reinterview is not met.\n\nThe Hui-Walter Method\n\nAssume that the population of interest is divided into multiple subpopulations index by the letter g. There will be two subpopulations for this discussion.\n\nLet \u03c0g be the prevalence rate of interest in the gth subpopulation. Assume that \u03c0g=1 \u2260 \u03c0g=2. The false positive and false negative error probabilities, denoted by \u03b1r,g and \u03b2r,g respectively, are given below:\n\u03b1r,g = Pr(Observation = In category|Truth = Not in category, r, group = g) and \u03b2r,g = Pr(Observation = Not in category|Truth = In category, r, group = g),\nwhere r = 1 for the original interview and r = 2 for the reinterview.\\\n\n\fAppendix S. Response Variance in the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey S-47\nIt is assumed that the reinterview is an independent replication of the original interview. It is also assumed that error probabilities are equal for both subgroups, but that \u03c0g=1 \u2260 \u03c0g=2.\nBased on the assumptions, \u03b2r,1 = \u03b2r,2 = \u03b2r and \u03b1r,1 = \u03b1r,2 = \u03b1r (r = 1, 2). The Hui-Walter method splits the observed table into four 2 \u00d7 2 tables: two groups, two tables for each group. Given that the two 2 \u00d7 2 tables in each group provide six degrees of freedom, estimation is possible.\nUsing the Results of the Hui-Walter Method to Estimate the Index of Inconsistency\nAfter using the Hui-Walter method, estimate the index as follows:\np = \u00bd{Pr(G = 1)[\u03c0g=1(1 - \u03b21) + (1 - \u03c01)\u03b11] + Pr(G = 2)[\u03c0g=2(1 - \u03b21) + (1 - \u03c02)\u03b11]} + \u00bd{Pr(G = 1)[\u03c0g=1(1 - \u03b22) + (1 - \u03c01)\u03b12] + Pr(G = 2)[\u03c0g=2(1 - \u03b22) + (1 - \u03c02)\u03b12]},\nGDR = Pr(G = 1)[\u03c0g=1(\u03b21 + \u03b21 - 2\u03b21\u03b22) + (1 - \u03c0g=1) (\u03b11 + \u03b11 - 2\u03b11\u03b12)] + Pr(G = 2)[\u03c0g=2(\u03b21 + \u03b21 - 2\u03b21\u03b22) + (1 - \u03c0g=2) (\u03b11 + \u03b11 - 2\u03b11\u03b12)],\nand\nIndex of inconsistency = (GDR/2)/[p(1 - p)].\nHow to Estimate the Hui-Walter Model Parameters\nShown below is how estimate the model parameters \u03c0g=1, \u03c0g=1, \u03b11, , \u03b12, \u03b21, and \u03b22 from the interview and reinterview data. The algorithm gives two sets of estimates, based on a determinant s = \u00b11. The most reasonable of the estimates was chosen. First the conventions are set as follows:\nI = 1 if the interview response is in category I = 2 if the interview response is not in category R = 1 if the reinterview response is in category R = 2 if the reinterview response is not in category nijk = # {G = i, i = j, R = k}\nNow define the following:\nni = # {G = i} = ni11 + ni12 + ni21 + ni22 (i = 1, 2) n = n1 + n2 pijk = Pr(I = j, R = k | G = k) = nijk/ni (i, i, k = 1, 2) pi\u00b7k = Pr(R = k | G = k) = pi1k + pi2k + pi3k+ pi4k (i, k = 1, 2) pij\u00b7 = Pr(I = j | G = k) = pij1 + pij2 + pij3 + pij4 (i, j = 1, 2) D = s[(p11\u00b7p2\u00b71 - p21\u00b7p1\u00b71 + p111 - p211)(p11\u00b7p2\u00b71 - p21\u00b7p1\u00b71 + p111 - p211) - 4(p11\u00b7 - p21\u00b7)(p111p2\u00b71 - p211p1\u00b71)] E1 = p2\u00b71 - p1\u00b71 E2 = p21\u00b7 - p11\u00b7\nFrom Hui,\n\u03c0g=1 = Pr(In category | G = 1) = \u00bd + [p11\u00b7(p1\u00b71 - p2\u00b71) + p1\u00b71(p11\u00b7 - p21\u00b7) + p211 - p111]/(2D) \u03c0g=2 = Pr(In category | G = 2) = \u00bd + [p21\u00b7(p1\u00b71 - p2\u00b71) + p2\u00b71(p11\u00b7 - p21\u00b7) + p211 - p111]/(2D)\n\n\fS-48 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nWith these definitions and conventions, Pr(G = i) = ni/n (i = 1, 2), and the false positive and false negative error probabilities are:\n\u03b11 = (p21\u00b7p1\u00b71 - p2\u00b71p11\u00b7 + p211 - p111 + D)/(2 E2) \u03b12 = (p11\u00b7p2\u00b71 - p1\u00b71p21\u00b7 + p211 - p111 + D)/(2 E1) \u03b21 = (p2\u00b72p12\u00b7. - p22\u00b7p1\u00b72 + p122 - p222 + D)/(2 E2) \u03b22 = (p1\u00b72p22\u00b7 - p12\u00b7p2\u00b72 + p122 - p222 + D)/(2 E1)\nHow Many Responses Are Necessary for Analysis?\nIn order to decide the sample size n, the reasonable values must be decided for e: marginal error, and \u03b1: the significant level. Both of them must satisfy the following equation:\n\nP(| y \u2212 yU |\u2264 e) = 1\u2212\u03b1 ,\n\nwhere y and yU are the mean of the estimate and the mean of population quantity respectively. \u03b1 = 0.1\nis usually used. The e has not been set yet so far. In this example, e = 0.07.\nFor a Simple Random Sample (SRS), e is calculated as follows:\n\ne = z\u03b1 / 2\n\nS n\n\n(1 \u2212 n ) . N\n\nSolve for n:\n\nn = n0 1+ n0\n\n, where\n\nn0\n\n=\n\nz\u03b12 / 2 S 2 e2\n\n.\n\nN\n\nFor large populations, S \u2245 p (1 - p) where p is the proportion of the in-category of the variable of the interest.\n\nS\n\nattains\n\nits\n\nmaximal\n\nvalue\n\nwhen\n\np\n\n=\n\n1/2.\n\nSo\n\nusing\n\nn0\n\n=\n\n1.652 4e 2\n\nwill result in 90 percent confidence\n\ninterval with width at most 2e.\n\nThe n that is acceptable to estimate the index of inconsistency is as follows:\nn0 = 1.652/(4 x 0.072) \u2245 138 observations.\nNote: Determine the value of e is up to the analysts, and sponsors. If e is set too tight (e.g., e = 0.05), then there will not be enough data to analyze for many of the questions.\n\n\fAppendix S.

Frame variables may or may not have been used for sampling. Selected variables from these sources were included on the restricted-use data files if they provided potentially valuable information to the user that was not available on the survey.\n\nCreated variables are based on survey variables, frame variables, other created variables, or a combination of these. These variables are frequently used in National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) publications and have been added to the files to facilitate data analysis.\n\nThe frame and created variables included on the 2003\u201304 SASS data files are listed below along with a brief description.

Those with only ungraded classes are categorized as elementary level teachers if their main assignment is Early childhood/Prekindergarten or elementary, or they teach either special education in a selfcontained classroom or an elementary enrichment class. All other teachers with ungraded classes are classified as secondary level. Among teachers with regularly graded classes, in general, elementary level teachers teach any of grades prekindergarten through 5th; report an Early childhood/Prekindergarten, Elementary, Self-contained special education, or Elementary enrichment main assignment; or teachers whose preponderance of grades taught are Kindergarten through 6th. In general, secondary level teachers instruct any of grades 7 through 12 but usually no grade lower than 5th. They also teach more of grades 7 through 12 than lower level grades.

If there is a blank in the variable\u2019s name for 1987\u201388, 1990\u201391, 1993\u201394, or 1999\u20132000, then that particular 2003\u201304 item did not have an equivalent item in earlier years. Variables from 1987\u201388, 1990\u201391, 1993\u201394, and 1999\u20132000 are graded for how closely they \u201cmatch\u201d the corresponding variable in the 2003\u201304 questionnaire:\n\u2022 Exact. The question wording and format are exactly the same. \u2022 Near. The question content is the same, but there have been minor changes to the question\nwording or format. \u2022 Content. The general content of or subject addressed by the item is the same, but the question\nwording or format has been changed significantly.\nIn addition, there are four crosswalks that compare similarities and differences across the 2003\u201304 SASS questionnaires given to each type of respondent (i.e., public school district, principal, school, or teacher). The first crosswalk presents items from the District Questionnaire that are also included on the Unified School or Private School Questionnaires (pages U-105 through U-110). The second crosswalk compares items that are found on the three school questionnaires: School Questionnaire, Unified School Questionnaire, and Private School Questionnaire (pages U-111 through U-114). The third crosswalk compares items found on the Principal and Private School Principal Questionnaires (pages U-115 through U-140), and the fourth crosswalk compares items found on the Teacher and Private School Teacher Questionnaires (pages U-141 through U-148). Comparisons are graded on how well the item matches across surveys on the same scale as described above. Items that are found on only one questionnaire within a respondent set are noted as being \u201cUnique.\u201d For example, an item that appears on the Private School Teacher Questionnaire but not on the Teacher Questionnaire is marked as being unique for private school teachers.\n\n\fU-2 Documentation for the 2003\u201304 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nSASS Variable Crosswalk\u2014School District Questionnaire (SASS-1A): 1987\u201388 through 2003\u201304\n\n2003\u201304\n\n1999\u20132000 (99)\n\n1993\u201394 (93)\n\n1990\u201391 (90)\n\n1987\u201388 (87)\n\nVariable Variable\n\nVariable\n\nVariable\n\nname name Match Comments name Match Comments name\n\nVariable Match Comments name Match Comments\n\nD0025\n\nD0026 D0451 Exact\n\nD0070 Content Options are EXISTS\n\nContent Options are\n\nmark all that\n\nmark all that\n\napply\n\napply\n\nD0027 D0452 Exact\n\nD0028 D0453 Exact\n\nD0065 Content Options are\n\nmark all that\n\napply\n\nD0029 D0455 Near\n\nD5029 D5455 Near\n\nD9001 D5455 Near\n\nD9002 D5455 Near\n\nD9003 D5455 Near\n\nD0035\n\nD0036\n\nD0037\n\nD0038\n\nD0039\n\nD0040\n\nD0041\n\nD0042\n\nD0043\n\nD0044\n\nD0045\n\nD0046\n\nD0047\n\nD0048\n\nD0049\n\nD0050 D0456 Exact\n\nD0051 D0457 Exact\n\nD0255 Near\n\nD0052 D0458 Near\n\nD0415 Near\n\nHISPDIST Near\n\nDSC151 Near\n\nD0053 D0459 Exact\n\nD0425 Near\n\nWHTDIST Near\n\nDSC153 Near\n\nD0054 D0460 Exact\n\nD0420 Near\n\nBLKDIST Near\n\nDSC152 Near\n\nD0055 D0462 Near\n\nD0410 Near\n\nASIADIST Near\n\nDSC150 Near\n\nD0056 D0461 Near\n\nD0405 Near\n\nAMINDIST Near\n\nDSC149 Near\n\nD0057 D0463 Exact\n\nD0058\n\nD0059\n\nD0060 D0467 Exact\n\nD1645 Exact\n\nD0061 D0468 Near\n\nD1655 Exact\n\nDSC148 Content Combines\n\ntwo\n\nquestions\n\ninto one\n\nD0062 D0469 Near\n\nD1660 Exact\n\nDSC148 Content Combines two\n\nquestions into one\n\nD0063 D0470 Exact\n\nD0465 Exact\n\nD0064 D0476 Exact\n\nD1010 Content Sum of\n\nTTOTK_12 Content Sum of DSC047 Content Sum of\n\nnumber of\n\nnumber of\n\nnumber of\n\nteachers for\n\nteachers for\n\nteachers for\n\neach grade\n\neach grade\n\neach grade\n\nD0065 D0471 Near\n\nD1085 Near\n\nTCHISPNC Near\n\nDSC156 Near\n\n\fAppendix U.

Main Teaching Assignment Variable\n\nIn the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) teacher questionnaires, teachers are asked to identify what classes or subjects they teach, including their main teaching assignment. To answer these items, teachers are referred to a table containing a list of teaching assignment codes to identify what subjects or classes they teach. In the 2003\u201304 SASS, changes were made to the organization of and categories contained in the table concerning teaching assignment and subject matter codes (i.e., table 1 in the Teacher Questionnaire and Private School Teacher Questionnaire). The changes to this table led to changes in the construction of the created variable that identifies the respondent\u2019s main teaching assignment. The main teaching assignment variable found on the 2003\u201304 SASS files is named ASSIGN03. It is named ASSIGN on the 1999\u20132000 SASS data files.
