[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition/processing techniques assess brain volumes to explore neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Objective: We examined the clinical utility of MSmetrix and investigated if automated MRI volumes could discriminate between groups covering the AD continuum and could be used as a predictor for clinical progression. Methods: The Belgian Dementia Council initiated a retrospective, multi-center study and analyzed whole brain (WB), grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), cortical GM (CGM) volumes, and WM hyperintensities (WMH) using MSmetrix in the AD continuum. Baseline (n = 887) and follow-up (FU, n = 95) T1-weighted brain MRIs and time-linked neuropsychological data were available. Results: The cohort consisted of cognitively healthy controls (HC, n = 93), subjective cognitive decline (n = 102), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 379), and AD dementia (n = 313). Baseline WB and GM volumes could accurately discriminate between clinical diagnostic groups and were significantly decreased with increasing cognitive impairment. MCI patients had a significantly larger change in WB, GM, and CGM volumes based on two MRIs (n = 95) compared to HC (FU>24months, p = 0.020). Linear regression models showed that baseline atrophy of WB, GM, CGM, and increased CSF volumes predicted cognitive impairment. Conclusion: WB and GM volumes extracted by MSmetrix could be used to define the clinical spectrum of AD accurately and along with CGM, they are able to predict cognitive impairment based on (decline in) MMSE scores. Therefore, MSmetrix can support clinicians in their diagnostic decisions, is able to detect clinical disease progression, and is of help to stratify populations for clinical trials."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the spread of neurodegeneration, and especially tau pathology and synapse loss, is the most important pathological substrate of clinical symptoms [1] . Biomarkers of neurodegeneration, including volumetric analyses of relevant brain regions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), correlate better with the degree of cognitive impairment in AD patients as compared to biomarkers of amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) deposition [1] [2] [3] . Volumetric brain imaging should include areas in which the neuropathological process of AD is prominent, such as the medial temporal lobe that includes the hippocampus. The atrophy can often be detected at the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Therefore, hippocampal volume has been proposed as a neuroimaging biomarker for early AD diagnosis in the revised diagnostic criteria of AD [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Other neuro-anatomical structures, such as the entorhinal cortex [7, 9, 21, 22] and cerebral cortex [23] are also prone to AD pathology. Their morphological characteristics such as volume, shape, and thickness can be used as biomarkers of the extent of neurodegeneration as well [24, 25] . Nevertheless, measuring brain atrophy has some limitations because evolution of disease-related regional atrophy does not necessarily follow the anatomical boundaries of structures. To overcome these limitations, the whole brain (WB) and the (whole) grey matter (GM) volumes have been used as neuroimaging biomarkers for AD diagnosis and evolution [3, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Since these anatomical structures are considerably larger than the hippocampus or cortex, the automated quantification of their volumes is, in general, less prone to measurement errors.\nTo date, different MRI acquisition and processing techniques have been developed to measure volumes of specific brain regions. However, their accuracy is still limited by a moderate sensitivity and a rather low specificity for AD [34] . Manual segmentation approaches, which are time consuming, have been widely used and are considered a standard approach by experts in neuroanatomy [35, 36] , though large-scale studies are limited [4, 37] . Semi-automated techniques are less time consuming, however a priori information such as user-defined landmarks is needed, which also limits their usefulness for large clinical studies [38] [39] [40] . To date, an increasing number of studies have investigated structural brain changes in AD populations with an automated image-based brain morphometry analysis, as this is less time consuming and does not suffer from large intra-and inter-observer variability compared to manual and semi-automated approaches. This trend relates to both the widespread availability of brain imaging equipment in clinical routine and research, and the concurrent development of image analysis software packages released over the past years [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . MSmetrix, is another fully automated and European Conformity (CE)-labelled and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared tool, specifically designed to measure atrophy in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and has been validated in these patients (we refer to Supplementary Material for more detailed information of the validation process) [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . As this method uses clinical brain MRI scans in contrast to many other tools that apply MRI scans from selected clinical trial/research cohorts, we decided to use the output of MSmetrix, which included WB, (whole) GM, white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), cortical GM (CGM) volumes, and WM hyperintensities (WMH), in a 'retrospective Belgian multi-center MRI biomarker study in dementia' (REMEMBER). We examined whether MSmetrix is an accurate and reproducible segmentation approach to differentiate between healthy controls and AD patients, covering the entire AD continuum, and thus is of clinical utility for the diagnostic work-up and for clinical trials. Therefore, we set up a study to assess the diagnostic value of automated volumetry using MSmetrix in a population comprising the entire AD continuum (AD, MCI, subjective cognitive decline (SCD)), as well as cognitively healthy elderly (primary objective). The secondary objective of this study was to investigate if automated volumetry using MSmetrix is an early diagnostic marker for AD and as a possible predictor for clinical progression."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design", "text": "The retrospective Belgian multi-center study cohort consists of participants who underwent a baseline brain MRI scan, in combination with a clinical neurological and neuropsychological evaluation for diagnostic purposes. A neuropsychological evaluation, at least consisting of a screening instrument such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test was sufficient to be included in the study.\nA subset of the population underwent a repeat brain MRI scan with or without a neuropsychological evaluation (time interval between baseline and follow-up investigations, for both MRI and neuropsychological evaluations, was at least three months).

The AD dementia group consisted of significantly more females than males. Age at baseline was significantly different between all groups (p = 0.001), except between cognitively healthy controls and SCD patients. AD dementia patients were the oldest patient group followed by MCI, SCD, and controls. Time between baseline MRI and neuropsychological examination was in most cases short (mean [interquartile range (IQR)] 2.7 [0.0-2.1] months). In total, 633 subjects were clinically followed-up with a mean total follow-up of 2.1 [IQR: 0.6-3.2] years ( Table 1 ). The time interval between baseline MRI scan and last clinical visit was only significantly different between MCI and AD dementia patients, which was shorter for AD dementia patients compared to the MCI group. In case an SCD subject developed MCI/AD dementia (n = 15/n = 2, 17%) or in case an MCI patient progressed to dementia (n = 101, 27%), the time between baseline MRI and diagnostic conversion was not different between those two groups (mean [IQR] 1.8 [0.9-2.4] years, p = 0.066). MMSE scores were significantly different between all groups, except between cognitively healthy controls and SCD patients, with the lowest scores in AD dementia patients and highest scores in the control and SCD subjects. Cognitively healthy controls and SCD patients were significantly more educated than MCI and AD dementia patients.\nIn total, 95 subjects had a follow-up MRI scan (Table 2) . Gender, time between scans, and time between baseline and last clinical follow-up/conversion were not significantly different between the clinical diagnostic groups. The MCI and AD dementia patients were significantly older compared to the HC-SCD subjects (respectively, p = 0.006 and p = 0.009). MMSE scores were significantly different between all clinical diagnostic groups (p = 0.001). Individuals with a follow-up MRI scan had higher MMSE scores compared to subjects without a follow-up scan, however this was only significantly different in the MCI patients (p = 0.004).

The patients were diagnosed by an experienced clinician in each center. Diagnosis of dementia due to AD was based on NIA-AA criteria [17, 19] . At baseline, MCI due to AD was diagnosed by applying the NIA-AA criteria [16] [17] [18] 20] . When sufficient neuropsychological data were available, MCI patients were divided into four subgroups. MCI patients were categorized in single-domain (sd) and multi-domain (md) MCI based on the neurocognitive domains scoring below 1.5 SD on their respective z-scores. Z-scores were used from population-based norms and were age-adjusted. In addition, MCI patients were also categorized as amnestic MCI (aMCI) and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI) based on z-scores below -1.5 SD per cognitive domain. In case the delayed memory domain was below a z-score of 1.5 SD, a patient was classified as aMCI, whereas naMCI was based on zscores from one of the other cognitive domains, such as immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional abilities, language or attention. SCD patients were diagnosed by the Jessen's et al. criteria in the same way as the MCI patients but without an objective cognitive impairment, so all neuropsychological subtests having a z-score above -1.5 [52] . All control subjects underwent at least a cognitive screening test to rule out cognitive impairment. The control subjects did not meet the Jessen's et al. criteria of SCD [52] .\nExclusion criteria for the total population consisted of brain tumors, large cerebral infarction/bleeding, strategic infarctions, other neurodegenerative diseases, severe head trauma, epilepsy, brain infections, severe depression, unregulated diabetes mellitus, untreated thyroid disorders, or any severe somatic co-morbidity that interferes with study participation."}, {"section_title": "Imaging", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Image acquisition", "text": "All MRI scans were obtained from respective Neuroimaging Departments, to which subjects were referred.

A FLAIR image was optional, with the same preferences as the above described T1-weighted image."}, {"section_title": "Image analyses", "text": "The MRI data were processed using the CElabelled and FDA-cleared software called MSmetrix, to extract WB, GM, WM, CSF (intra-and inter-ventricular CSF), CGM, and WMH volumes (MSmetrix-cross). Thereto, the T1-weighted MRI images were segmented into WM, GM, and CSF using a probabilistic model, including bias field correction. In case a FLAIR image was available, WMH were extracted using an outlier model and lesion filling of the T1-weighted image was performed prior to segmentation into WM, GM, and CSF [50] . Finally, WB was computed as WM and GM, while CGM was extracted from the GM segmentation based on prior knowledge of the shape and appearance of the cortical area. The duration was approximately less than 30 minutes per individual. This includes on average 22 minutes processing and 7 minutes QC per subject.\nIf a repeat brain MRI was available a longitudinal registration based approach was used, using the crosssectional segmentations as an input to extract brain atrophy and lesion changes (MSmetrix-long). This ensures a low measurement error of the brain atrophy measurements [47] and a more consistent evaluation of lesion changes [49] .\nAll extracted measures were corrected for head size, as a consequence only normalized measures were used in further analyses. Head size was normalized by scaling the measured volume of the image with the determinant of the affine transformation matrix that describes the transformation between the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) atlas and the image.\nA quality control (QC) of the extracted measurements was performed per center by E.N. and H.S. Moreover, a visual assessment of the segmentations was performed for all 'outlier' measurements. The 'outliers' included scans with volumes below the 10th and above the 90th percentile within the cohort of the center. Volumes that were not correctly segmented were completely rejected or approved with remarks. In detail, in case the segmentation approach completely failed, volumes were not trustworthy and values were excluded for further analyses. If the volumetric approach was in part correctly segmented and the WB volumetric analysis could be trusted, the scans were classified as approved with remarks. All other scans, with a correct segmentation were subdivided as approved. WMH underwent the same 'outlier QC' and were divided into two groups, namely approved or rejected. The QC of the scans was always dependent on the protocol used in each center. Therefore, scans were often rejected due to a low quality of the scans and/or large slice thickness (>3 mm) that led to missegmentation of the volumes."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "Distribution of categorical variables, such as gender, within subject groups were analyzed with a Chi-Square test, and percentages were reported.

Moreover, this study used this fully automated segmentation approach to further decrease the observer dependency as well as the time needed from the expert (<30 min/subject), and standardize the quantification of MRI readings. Thus, the fully automated procedure has reduced reliance on anatomical expertise and provide rapid results compatible with clinical practice. In addition, MSmetrix uses clinical brain MRI scans in contrast to many other tools that apply MRI scans from selected clinical trial/research cohorts. Another advance of MSmetrix is the use of Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format images, which are ideal to create a fast clinical workflow. Therefore, MSmetrix translates the volumetric measures from a research setting to routine clinical practice. Nevertheless, in differential dementia diagnosis the usefulness of these MRI measures is limited due to effect that atrophy is not AD-specific.\nBy applying this software in the AD continuum and cognitively healthy elderly, we found that the volumetric volumes were significantly smaller with increased cognitive impairment. In addition, WB and GM accurately discriminated between clinical diagnostic groups, whereas WM, CSF, and CGM were less accurate. For this reason, the output measures of MSmetrix are able to support the clinical diagnostic work-up of AD. The diagnostic accuracies of the volumetric measures are comparable or better compared to the current literature [3, 26, [53] [54] [55] . WMH were not significantly different between diagnostic groups. A higher degree of WMH is known to be associated with poorer cognitive function [56, 57] . However, the lack of significant differences could be explained by the reflection of low variability, as a trend was found in the expected direction with more WMH by more cognitive impairment (Table 1) .\nIn addition, the method failed to distinguish stable MCI patients from MCI patients that progressed to AD dementia as no significant differences were detected for baseline volumetric measurements. A possible explanation is that volume change of specific brain regions over time may be more indicative than a static cross-sectional assessment. Moreover, the brain is affected by normal aging and disease progression, and there is individual variation in brain anatomy, which makes it difficult to discriminate between groups. Especially the MCI subgroups are difficult to distinguish as they are in the same disease stage of the continuum. Longitudinal data could avoid the limitations of cross-sectional analyses [58] [59] [60] [61] , however in our cohort also no differences between the stable MCI patients and MCI converters were detected in the longitudinal analyses. Probably, this is due to a small sample size of available longitudinal MRI scans in MCI patients (n = 50, of which 9 converters). In general, brain volume changes over time correlate with and predict deterioration of cognitive performance [34] and seem more sensitive to AD-like brain atrophy features than CSF measures or \u2424-amyloid deposition measured with positron emission imaging (PET) [62] . Thus, longitudinal assessment of MSmetrix-long is relevant in the setting of chronic and progressive neurologic conditions, such as AD and MS. Another solution to differentiate the MCI subgroups is to consider analyzing specific brain regions, such as the hippocampus [13] [14] [15] . Nevertheless, our longitudinal data analyses (interval between MRI scans >24 months) showed a significant decrease in WB, GM, and CGM volumes in MCI patients compared to the HC-SCD patients. As the sample size of longitudinal data was small we should interpret the results with caution. However, these results are in line with ADNI data, however in those studies a significant difference after 12 months interval was also detected [63, 64] .\nThe primary objective of this study was to identify which atrophy measures accurately discriminate between groups by using MSmetrix. Our crosssectional data confirm that a high diagnostic accuracy was observed between AD dementia patients and cognitively healthy controls for the extracted volumes. However, when corrected for age and center, WB and GM were the most robust MRI biomarkers to distinguish between clinical groups. Those volumetric measures can support disease diagnosis and thus, may assist clinicians in their decisions. The secondary objective was to investigate MSmetrix as a possible predictor for clinical progression. The single variable linear regression models showed that increased CSF volumes and atrophy of WB, GM, and CGM predicted cognitive impairment, independent of age and baseline diagnosis, which is confirmed by other studies [65] [66] [67] . Next, the prediction of disease evolution based on the decline in MMSE score was also detected in WB, GM, and CGM where slow and fast MMSE decliners showed significant differences for those volumes, with smaller baseline volumes in the fast decliners, in line with the literature [3, [30] [31] [32] . In here, the volumetric measures are of help to the clinicians to track the clinical progression of the disease, as increased CSF volumes and brain atrophy correlate with clinical decline.\nThis study focused on the output measurements of MSmetrix, which are large volumes (WB, GM, WM, CSF, CGM) that can overcome the limitations of disease-related regional atrophy. Nevertheless, many groups investigated regional atrophy and especially medial temporal lobe, including hippocampal atrophy, as this is a sensitive AD biomarker [18, 34] . A potential benefit of these specific AD-pathological regions is that they possibly allow the discrimination between sd MCI and md MCI patients [13] [14] [15] 55] . This possible discrimination was not observed in the current study, as expected by the proposed models [18, 20] . Indeed, sd MCI patients and SCD subjects had comparable volumes and also no significant difference was found between md MCI and AD dementia patients. A possible explanation could be that the neuropsychological examinations showed inter-and intra-rater and/or center variability as the neuropsychological tests were administered in different centers by different neuropsychologists. To take this limitation into account a correction for center was applied in the statistical analyses.\nAnother limitation of this study was the significant difference in age for diagnostic groups at baseline, although we corrected the statistical analyses to overcome this problem. Next, few follow-up MRI scans were available which probably led to less significant differences in the longitudinal volumetric measurements. Lastly, analyzing the different volumes based on only T1 images versus T1 in combination with FLAIR sequences could be seen as another limitation of this study, as differences in results could be found in case larger WMH volumes were present. Those WMH volumes could be wrongly detected as GM volumes. Nevertheless, the WB volume is usually robust because WMH volumes are classified as CSF, as has been observed in the validation of MSmetrix in MS patients [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . Despite these disadvantages, the large amount of data included in this multi-center study, the short time between baseline measures, and the mean clinical follow-up time of 2.1 years [IQR: 0.6-3.2] are certainly strengths of this study. Even though we have used MRI scans that were acquired in routine clinical practice, and thus from different scanner types which could be seen as a limitation, only 15.9% of the scans were rejected, which demonstrates the clinical usefulness of this method. Moreover, MSmetrix can be integrated easily in the clinical workflow as it uses DICOM images from all scanner types without any restrictions of the image sequences and produces results in an accurate and rapid way.\nIn conclusion, volumes measured with a fully automated tool (MSmetrix) accurately discriminated between clinical diagnostic groups in an AD population, and thus can support clinicians in their decisions. Especially WB and GM, and CGM are MRI biomarkers that distinguished between clinical diagnostic groups and were possible predictors for clinical progression based on (decline in) MMSE scores. Those volumes could therefore be used to define the clinical spectrum of AD more accurately, are able to track clinical progression of disease, are of help to select appropriate populations for clinical trials and can be applied for assessment of the efficacy of (future disease-modifying) treatments."}]
