Structural analysis demonstrated that the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 bound with ~10 times advanced affinity to ACE-2 than that of SARS-CoV and in receptor unbound state, the S2 domain was more flexible [43] . Another notable change in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the presence of the S1/S2 furin-like rift spot that is absent in SARS-CoV. Several reports suggest that the presence of this proteolytic site increases the pathogenicity of the virus. Furin like rift spot is also reported to increase the tissue tropism of viruses [44, 45] . So far, SARS-CoV-2 was thought to infect upper respiratory tissue, surprisingly a recent report shows the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 to infect T-lymphocytes also through membrane fusion process [46] .\nSpike protein being the first contact site between viruses and cells is subjected to tremendous evolutionary pressure. Any changes in spike protein would have a profound effect on the infectivity and transmission of viruses. In the spike protein of the present pandemic SARS-CoV-2, changes acquired such as furin-like cleavage site, structural changes at the receptor binding sites are being correlated for the species jumping and efficient humanto-human transmission.

RBV is metabolized by adenosine kinase to its prodrug mono, di and triphosphate metabolites. The synthesis of viral mRNA polymerase is inhibited by the direct binding of RBV triphosphate (RTP) to the nucleotide-binding site of the enzyme which results in the reduction in the production of defective virions and decreases the viral load [87] . RBV also competitively inhibits host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) which further inhibits the guanine nucleotides synthesis. The decrease in guanosine triphosphate leads to the depletion of viral protein synthesis and halts the process of viral genome replication [88] . RBV also has an immunomodulatory effect on the host by promoting the production of cytokines which stimulates the humoral response and enhances immunity towards the virus. The mechanism of action of RBV that includes the inhibition of mRNA capping which results in induction of mutation in the viral replication is the main reason for considering RBV as a potential treatment approach to treat SARS-CoV-2 [89] . High doses of RBV are required for treatment . RBV, when given as a monotherapy, shows resistance against SARS and MERS and therefore it's given in combination with other antiviral drugs like lopinavir, chloroquine analogs and with interferon-\u03b1 [90] .

The DAA action is mainly because of the ability of the ARB to form interactions with amino acid residues.

Teicoplanin acts against coronavirus, by inhibiting the genome viral RNA release and thereby preventing the replication of the virus-cell cycle.
