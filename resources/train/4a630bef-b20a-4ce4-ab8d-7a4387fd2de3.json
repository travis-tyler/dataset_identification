The TM output imagery had a grid cell resolution of30x30 m, while the MSS was 80x80m. The coregistration ofthe November 1984 and November 1994 was satisfactory. There appeared to be a slight (approx. 1 pixel) east-west shift in the September 1984 and September 1995 that was noticeable at the land-water interface and occasionally along major road corridors. The coregistration of the MSS appeared adequate but was difficult to compare with the TM data due to its coarser spatial resolution. : 1984 to 1994/199 5 To try to correct for various scene to scene differences in brightness and spectral response (including atmospheric influences), I used an image-to-image empirical normalization procedure that compared invariant scene targets.

Approximately 15 (in total) dark (lakes), medium (urban features: parking lots, industrial areas) and bright (gravel pits, sand beach) toned targets were chosen that appeared to be reasonably unchanged in spectral responses between scenes.

The idea behind using an Urban Mask was to reduce the amount of commission error by reducing the amount of nondeveloped area (e.g., bare agricultural fields) being classified wrongly as developed. The pixels within the Urban Mask could potentially be classified as some sort of development (e.g., Ill or 112) or some nondeveloped category (e.g., 130 or 140). This Urban Mask was used to extract 3 bands of image data: Sept. Landsat TM Band 3 (Red); Sept. NDVI; and Sept. Band 5 (MIR). This 3 band spectral data set was evaluated in feature space and classification rules developed to separate the feature space into several spectral classes that corresponded to the following CCAP land cover categories: 111, 112, 131, 132, 141, 143. These initial spectral classes along with the ITU data were used in iteration to mask the 3 band Sept. Landsat TM image and further separate out spectral classes using unsupervised clustering (i.e. similar to cluster busting).

The red and near infrared bands ofthe TM scene were used to calculate a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI: (nir-red)/(nir-red)) ratio transform image. Thus areas ofhigh green leaf area/biomass have high NDVI values and vice versa. Unfortunately, ground data quantifYing green leaf area/biomass for selected sites at the time of the 1995 TM image acquisition were not available. Thus the development of a quantitative relationship between green leaf area/biomass and the NDVI values was not possible. The NJDEP Endangered & Nongame Species Program (ENSP) did collect some ground information on forest canopy closure that was made available for this project. As part of the Breeding Bird Survey data collection activities, ENSP investigators also recorded forest canopy closure categorized into 3 classes: Closed (>75% canopy closure), Open (50-75% canopy closure) and Sparse (25-50% canopy closure). These sites were not collected in any systematic or statistically random manner. In addition, most of these sites were made adjacent to roads making comparison with the Landsat TM NDVI values difficult to mixed road/forest pixels. The coordinate location of these sites are also somewhat suspect as most were based on dead reckoning on topographic base maps and not differentially corrected Global Positioning System surveying. In a number of cases, the field reference point locations fell on roads and not the adjacent forest; these data points were eliminated. The NDVI values for all the non-road reference sites were extracted and statistically compared to the ENSP forest canopy closure values. The relationship between the NDVI and canopy closure was extremely weak (R2 = 0.002) with a lot of scatter. This may be due to a number of factors: uncertainty in the location of the ground reference data; differences in scale between the ground observations and the TM field of view (30 x 30 meter); variability due to differences in the canopy closure estimation ability of individual field observers\u2022 difference between the reference data which estimates only the overstory canopy closure and th~ NDVI values which integrates both overstory and understory vegetation. This data was not used to develop the canopy closure model but reserved as an independent comparison data set. The NDVI image was classified into 3 canopy closure categories (Closed, Open, Sparse) to meet the ENSP information needs. Based on visual interpretation of the 1995 TM image and 1991 CIR 1:40,000 aerial photography and previous sites visits, candidate training areas for the three classes of canopy closure were delineated. Due to the differential relationship between canopy closure and forest cover type (e.g., pine vs. oak dominated), training areas were delineated separately for evergreen dominated, mixed and deciduous dominated forests (e.g., a training area for coniferdominated closed canopy forest, etc.). Closed canopy deciduous forests tend to have higher NDVI values than closed canopy coniferous forests. The mean and range in NDVI values were calculated for the 3 different canopy closure classes for the 3 different types of forest. This information was used to construct a simple model to map canopy closure based on the NDVI and the Habitat/Land Cover data sets as input. See Table 3 for the area estimates of forest by canopy closure type.

The Habitat/Land Cover map was recoded into a simple binary forest/non-forest map. All categories of upland and wetland forest were classed into the forest category. Due to the fragmenting impact of roads, major roads (i.e., Interstate, US, toll, state and county 500 & 600 level roads) from the I :24,000 NJ Department of Transportation digital roads file were included in the analysis as non-forest. A \"clump\" analysis was undertaken to create contiguous clumps or patches of forest. A 4-neighbor (e.g., horizontal and vertical but not diagonal) clump technique was used, thus ensuring that roads or other single pixel diagonal features would adequately serve to delineate individual tracts of forest (i.e., a forest clump can't span a major road). To eliminate small, comparatively insignificant patches of forest, all patches of forest less than 100 acres (approx. 40 ha) were dropped from further consideration. A 90 meter buffer from the edge of the remaining forest patches was then delineated and masked as \"edge\" leaving only \"interior\" forest.
