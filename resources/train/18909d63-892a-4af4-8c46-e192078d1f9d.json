[{"section_title": "", "text": "There are significant challenges for young and beginning farmers to start their businesses and develop successful and profitable operations. Young farmer groups often state that their most significant challenge is acquiring access to farmland. Most young and beginning farmers do not inherit their land, and, instead, purchase or lease farmland to start their businesses and grow over time. In today's record-breaking high land value and farmland rental markets, this is doubly challenging. While there are significant disagreements over many issues among policy makers in the U.S. congress in developing the most recent farm legislation, there is notable agreement over the continuation and enhancement of policies designed to support beginning farmers. To effectively implement these policies, there needs to be an improved understanding of the needs of these young and beginning farmers. Loans, grants, and technical advice are provided by USDA agencies, other federal funding options, the Farm Credit System, public and private organizations, programs offered by individual states, and private lenders.\nThe objective of this research is to provide a deeper understanding about how young and beginning farmers enter agriculture and how they accumulate capital and grow in the beginning years of operating their farms. Previous research has concentrated on snapshots of statistics in each time period, such as the proportion of farmers falling into each age group and the average owned and rented land for beginning versus established farmers. Using cross-sectional data, we know various statistics about beginning farmers, such as the proportion of beginning farmers versus retiring farmers and their current asset holdings. What is missing from the literature is a better understanding of the transition process. This study will examine the dynamics of farm growth in terms of the expansion and contraction patterns of land holdings. These dynamics over the farmer lifecycle (entering agriculture and asset accumulation) are explored in detail and several patterns of entry as well as operation expansion/contraction are provided for young versus beginning farmers. We calculate land holdings and changes for each farm in terms of acres owned, acres rented from others, acres rented to others, and total acres operated, and present the results along the entire farmer's age and experience distributions.\nIn light of the interest in supporting beginning farmers, the contribution of this research is to better identify and quantify farmland ownership and leasing dynamics so that capital positions and financing needs can be determined and appropriate government support policies and private sector lending practices can be developed. We accomplish this by using the Census of Agriculture data to track and link farms over time to examine the dynamics and changes in farm operations in terms of land ownership, leasing, and farm size. By using a linked-farms longitudinal approach, instead of repeated cross-sectional approach, we are able to show trends over time in farmland expansion and contraction. We characterize the entire distribution of farmer age and farmer experience instead of using young versus old and beginning versus established farmer categories. This allows us to identify the precise growth rates of land ownership and leasing based on the farmer lifecycle stages in terms of age and years of experience."}, {"section_title": "Overview of Beginning Farmer Trends", "text": "Unlike the general economy, the financial performance of the U.S. farm sector has remained strong. Even during the great recession, the farm sector experienced record sector incomes and farmland values. For 2013, net farm income is expected to increase 15 percent from 2012. This would be the highest inflation-adjusted amount since 1973. Increases in farm asset values are expected to continue to exceed increases in farm debt, leading to another new record high for farm equity and meaning that farm financial risk indicators are expected to continue at historically low levels. These types of financials would be expected to attract new entrants into agriculture. Indeed, as evidenced by anecdotal stories, though not yet confirmed by lagging data, there is a strong interest among potential entrants into farming.\nAside from the fact that the U.S. has a long history of intervention in agricultural markets, these statistics raise the question about why there is a policy interest in fostering new entrants into farming. Is the sector not performing well and free market forces would be expected to \"manage\" the creative destructive forces of entry and exit? Certainly the overriding source of policy interest comes from distributional issues. In particular, the concentration of production, the concentration of land and wealth, and the concentration of government subsidies have all continued to increase over time. More specifically, the 2007 Census of Agriculture reports that the largest 6% of farms in terms of gross farm sales account for 75% of sales, 32% of real estate assets, and 39% of government farm payments.\nConcomitant with these developments, there has been an increase in the share of farmers that are older and a declining share of young farmers. In 2011, the average age of principal farm operators was 58, and nearly one-third were 65 years old or more. Only 4% of principal farm operators were under 35 years old. Policy makers often refer to the aging farmer population as an indicator that policies are needed to foster entry into farming. While policies may be desirable, it is also important to recognize the many factors are affecting the farmer's age distribution. First, farmers are living longer similarly to the rest of the population. This may mean that, in the case where the farm operator's children will take over the farm, the adult children remain working off the farm until the elder generation is ready to retire and transfer the farm.\nMoreover, many farmers indicate that they intend to never retire from farming (Beginning Farmer Center, 2013) . This is possible because farmers can retire from the physically taxing chores of farming and still remain as lead managers and principal owners of their operations. It is also possible to never retire from farming because aging farmers can simply stop producing or significantly reduce production but easily be counted as a farm under the USDA's very inclusive definition of a farm. A place need only have $1000 in sales or the potential for $1000 in sales to be defined as a farm. That includes a farm enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program or one that has 2 cows or 2 acres of corn. A farm family has many reasons to prefer to continue farming, including nonpecuniary -the farm is a family home and preferred lifestyle -and pecuniary -there are strong tax motivations for continuing farming (Williamson, 2013) .\nAside from the increasing number and share of older farmers, there has been an absolute decline in the number of young farmers. Several factors explain the aging farmer population phenomenon. First, aspiring young farmers are now attending college at a rate equal to the general population. In 2011, 25% of all farmers attained a 4-year college degree compared to 28% for the general population. (In 1964, only 4% of farmers and 8% of the general population had a college degree.) Younger farmers are more likely to have college degrees. In addition, many young aspiring farmers choose to work in an off-farm job before entering farming to gain the experience or to save for the needed capital investments of farming, or most likely both. In short, there are several reasons to expect an aging farmer population.\nWhat policy makers attempt to address through various policies is to assist aspiring farmers by reducing the barriers to entry into farming. For the reasons discussed above, the aging farm population is a poor indicator of the need for these policies. Moreover, it is often erroneously assumed that all beginning farmers are young. In 2011, 37% of beginning farmers (with 10 years or less of experience) were 55 years or older. Only 14% were under 35.\nTherefore, many beginning farmers are starting their businesses later in life, with potentially different financing needs than those of younger farmers. A major difference in the developing farm bill from the previous one is the shift of a farm safety net based on direct payments to one based on crop insurance. The crop insurance provisions affecting beginning farmers are very similar between the 2013 House and Senate versions, but are expanded in important ways from the 2008 legislation. In particular, the developing farm bills include reduced administrative costs for beginning farmers, increased premium assistance for beginning farmers, and special consideration of the calculation of the \"Actual Production History\" for beginning farmers. In addition, both the House and Senate allow producers to \"buy up\" coverage in the noninsured crop assistance program (NAP). This will be beneficial for beginning farmers because they are more likely to produce commodities not traditionally covered by crop insurance. Additionally, there will be increased premium assistance for beginning farmers in NAP."}, {"section_title": "Current Policy on Beginning Farmers", "text": "In addition to the loan provisions of the farm bills, the Farm Credit System, a government sponsored enterprise, targets loans to young, small, and beginning farms. The Farm Credit System was established by Congress in 1916 and its current authority is the Farm Credit Act of 1971. In 2011, the System made nearly $10 billion in new farm loans to beginning farmers."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "There is an extensive literature on beginning farmers and ranchers. Ahearn and Newton (2009) and Ahearn (2013) provide an overview of beginning farmers, analyzing their characteristics and pointing out the declining number of beginning farmers. Beginning and young farmers have several challenges to entering agriculture, with the major ones being access to land and access to government programs Sureshwaran and Richie, 2011; Thilmany and Sureshwaran, 2011; Ahearn, 2011; Ahearn and Newton, 2011; . Not all beginning farmers are young, and research shows that farm entry, exit, and growth decisions follow the stages of the farm operator's lifecycle (Boehlje 1973; Gale 1994; Gale, 2003; Ahearn Korb, and Yee, 2009; and Whittaker and Ahearn, 1991) . Farm succession decisions are also shown to be significantly influenced by farmer's age showing the need for further research based on the farmer's lifecycle stages (Mishra, El-Osta, and Shaik, 2003) . Most small business owners report that they do not want to grow or innovate, but rather there are nonpecuniary benefits of small business ownerships that drive owners to start businesses and remain small (Hurst and Pugsley, 2011) .\nGovernment policy and government payments affect the financial performance of beginning farmers differently than performance for the rest of the farmers (Kropp and Katchova, 2011, Katchova, 2010) . Farmland holdings growth for beginning farmers is also influenced by the Aggie Bond program, in the states where it is available, possibly due to additional financing being available for beginning farmers (Williamson and Katchova, 2013) . These studies underscore the importance of financial performance, capital constraints, and government programs for the successful start-up of farm operations by beginning farmers.\nThe literature on farmland values, farmland ownership, and tenure arrangements is also extensive. Many studies have been conducted on farmland values and performance of farmland investments (for an overview, see Moss and Katchova, 2005) . The recent trends in U.S. farm values and ownership are analyzed in Nickerson et al. (2013) , pointing out that on average about 40% of the farmland is currently being rented with significant geographical differences.\nFarmland is increasingly being held by aging, older farmers which may also affect farmland values when land is transferred down to the next generation (Duffy, 2011) . Other studies examine the effects of wealth or debt on farmland ownership (Weber and Key, 2013 and Briggeman, 2011) .\nWhile there is an established literature on beginning farmers, farmland, and capital needs, there is a gap in the literature on the transition process of young and beginning farmers. In particular, there is a need for an improved understanding of the diversity in the transition process that can contribute to better informed policies. Our goal is to extend the literature by analyzing the dynamic paths of farm expansion, contraction, and changes in farm size for young and beginning farmers."}, {"section_title": "Approach and Methodology", "text": "The Census of Agriculture data are used for this study. The Census of Agriculture is conducted We use the Census data without aggregating them into age and experience categories as is typically done in other studies. Trends that cannot be seen from aggregate, categorical data (e.g. beginning versus established farmer categories, and young versus old farmer categories) are now determined considering the entire distribution of farmer age and farmer experience. This methodology allows for determining the farmer age and experience at which land ownership and leasing trends change in levels (cross-sectional comparisons among farmers) and differences (changes over time for the same farmers).\nThe typical approach is to use Census data as repeated cross-sectional data. However, with repeated cross-sectional data, the composition of the sample can change over time making it hard to observe valid trends and changes over time. Our approach involves tracking the same farms in all three Censuses using a farm id number assigned by USDA-NASS. Of the 2. For these cohorts of farms, we will track the expansion strategies of young and beginning farmers as well as the contraction strategies of retiring farmers as they prepare for farm transitions. We expect that younger farmers will expand rapidly through both purchasing and leasing farmland, while older farmers will continue owning their existing farmland while reducing the level of farmland leasing.\nIt is important to note that when the analysis is done for farms that are continuing Figure 1 shows the number of farms that have a primary operator of a particular age in the 1997, 2002, and 2007 Censuses. Data are not aggregated in age categories, but the entire age distribution is used. The results show that the farmers' age distribution is approximately bell-shaped or normal. The graph peaks between ages 50s and early 60s, which is consistent with the average age of farmers being 57 in 2007. When comparing age distributions from the three Censuses, there is also a noticeable shift of the age distribution to the right, which confirms that farmers are aging -there are fewer younger farmers and more farmers who are older than 50.\nThe age distributions of beginning farmers (with farming experience of 10 years or less) from the three Censuses are also depicted on the same graph. The distribution of all farmers and beginning farmers is identical for farmers younger than 28 as they are by definition beginning farmers. Beginning farmers' age distribution is also close to normal, but peaking a decade earlier (in the 40s) than the distribution for established farmers. It is interesting to note that beginning farmers are not entering agriculture either young or older after retirement, but at any age along the distribution. The age distribution for beginning farmers is also shifting to the right, which indicates that beginning farmers are aging too. Table 1 shows the average number of owned acres, acres rented from others, acres rented to others, and total operated acres for all farms in the three Censuses (1997 Censuses ( , 2002 Censuses ( , and 2007 Even for farmers in retirement age, the older farmers are, the more land they own. The number of rented acres is similar for younger farmers, while farmers older than 50 tend to rent fewer acres. Farmland rented to others (denoted with negative values in figure 2) is much smaller in magnitude when compared to owned or rented from others acres, and is only marginally higher for older farmers. Total operated acres are calculated as owned acres plus acres rented from others minus acres rented to others, and represent farm size. The total operated acres increase across the age distribution until the 50s (due to increasing land ownership with stable leasing) and then slightly decrease after that point since more land ownership is offset by less land leasing. When comparing cross-sectional data from the three Censuses, it is difficult to uncover any noticeable trends over time. (table 2) . On the other hand, older farmers had a reduction in their farm size -owned acres remained similar (0% growth), but rented acres declined by 3.1% annually leading to an annual reduction in operated acres by 1.2% between 1997 and 2007 (table   2) . By using linked-farms longitudinal data, we can now see strong trends over time and contrasting differences for younger versus older farmers that were not noticeable using repeated cross-sectional data. figure 3 (number of acres is the same over time). There is generally a decreasing growth rate for land ownership and leasing as farmers age -at some point the growth rates turn negative (the farm business expansion turns into a contraction). The growth rate in owned acres is decreasing and only turns slightly negative for farmers older than mid-60s."}, {"section_title": "Land Ownership and Leasing", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Analysis by Farmer Age -Young, Mid-Age, and Older Farmers", "text": "Rented acres turn from positive to negative growth rates for farmers in their mid-40s. Operated acres switch from positive to negative growth in the mid-50s (due to the offsetting effects of owned and rented acres). The use of longitudinal data and the entire age distribution allows us to determine growth rates based on farmer's age, and to pin point the lifecycle stages of farm business expansion and contraction of farmland.\nNext, the analysis is subset to include only farmers who were beginning farmers (with 10 years or less of experience) in 1997 (figure 5). The results for young farmers are identical because young farmers are also beginning farmers. The results for older farmers who are also beginning farmers are similar, but the difference is that their farm size is about half of the farm size for all old farmers and the contraction of the farm for older beginning farmers is not as strong as when all old farmers are considered. In other words, after older beginning farmers start their farm businesses, there is no further expansion as seen for young beginning farmers. These results imply that older beginning farmers may need capital to start their businesses at an \"optimal size\" but no further capital is needed for subsequent expansion of the farm business."}, {"section_title": "Analysis by Farmer Experience -Beginning Farmers versus Established Farmers", "text": "The same analysis for land ownership and leasing is repeated by years of experience instead of farmer's age. Figure 6 shows owned, rented, and operated acres by farmer's years of experience using cross-sectional data. Note that established farmers with more years of experience will be older, while beginning farmers with less experience will include all age groups: young, mid-age, and old farmers. The overall findings are similar, but there are more pronounced differences along the experience distribution than along the age distribution. This is because older farmers with significant farming experience operate larger farms than older farmers who are beginning farmers. Across the farming experience distribution, beginning farmers own less land and established farmers own more land. There is a pronounced \"peak\" in rented acres at about 30-35 years of farming experience. The operated acres increase across the experience distribution (driven by higher land ownership) and are more stable for farmers with more than 30 years of experience (since more land ownership is offset by less land leasing). It is again difficult to discern trends over time using repeated cross-sectional data.\nWhen using linked-farms longitudinal data, several trends can be noticed (figures 7 and 8). Beginning farmers with 10 years or less of experience, who can be of any age, expand their operations by both owning and leasing more farmland but their farm expansions are not as strong as for young farmers. For beginning farmers, annual growth rates were 3.0% for owned land, 2.6% for rented land, and 2.9% for operated land between 1997 and 2007 (table 2). Established farmers with more than 10 years of experience do not change the size of their operation as much -owned acres increased by 1.7% annually and rented acres declined by 0.7% annually leading to an overall increase in operated acres by 0.4%."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Policy Implications", "text": "This study used the Census of Agriculture data to show the land ownership and leasing positions and changes over time for young and beginning farmers. New insights are obtained about farmer behavior that cannot be seen in aggregate, categorical data but can be determined across the entire distribution of farmer age and experience.\nOur main findings are that after initial entry into agriculture, beginning farmers further expand their operations only if they are also young. It is common for young beginning farmers to rapidly expand their farm size by both owning more and renting more. Although we do not have any representative attitudinal data to support our conclusion, we suspect young farmers are motivated to expand to attain economies of size and/or generate an income that can support a family on a full-time farming occupation. Older beginning farmers enter at a farm size that subsequently changes little with time. It is likely that many of these older beginning farmers are entering farming for the lifestyle and investment opportunities after engaging in a successful nonfarm career, a view that is supported by their higher net worth. These differences in motivations for entering farming are recognized by the beginning farmer population as is evident from anecdotal concerns expressed by young farmers. For example, as part of its policy platform, the National Young Farmers Coalition has recommended that land with conservation easements be coupled with affordability and \"active farming\" requirements so as to discourage investment by those beginning farmers with an investment motivation that helps to bid up the price of farmland (National Young Farmers, 2013) .\nYoung and beginning farmers may start their farm businesses by purchasing or leasing farm real estate. There is substantial leasing among young and beginning farmers and as they get older they tend to purchase more and lease less farmland. Young farmers may not have the necessary capital to purchase farmland. On the other hand, they might want to rely on leasing because of the high cash flow requirement to purchase farmland, the added risk that comes with owning farmland, and the low returns on owned real estate. We show the prevalence of leasing farmland particularly among young farmers which is critical in the first few years to expand their farm operations.\nThese new results showing the entry positions of young and beginning farmers and the extent of farm expansions after entering agriculture have several policy implications.\nHistorically, farm bill policy has been supporting beginning farmers with 10 years or less of experience, regardless of their age. It is likely that this approach is nested in the assumption that all beginning farmers are young and motivated to expand their operations. However, it is not clear if policy makers recognize that many of the beneficiaries of the beginning farmer programs are older operators who may be entering farming for the lifestyle and/or financial benefits (e.g., for investment and tax management purposes), rather than to contribute significantly to agricultural production. On the other hand, older beginning farmers may be helping to revitalize rural communities.\nDepending on their age, we show that beginning farmers have different capital needs in terms of purchasing or leasing farmland and that they likely need different support programs to start their businesses. Young farmers may have similar needs to initially acquire farmland as older beginning farmers, but subsequently young farmers need additional capital for purchasing additional farmland to expand their operations. In addition, young farmers may be more risky in terms of loan repayment risk and thus may face more credit constraints to start their operations.
