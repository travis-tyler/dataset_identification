This report describes the rationale and original design of the trial and details extensive modifications that were required to respond to unanticipated findings that emerged from other studies during the course of the trial. Methods The trial was designed as a multi-center, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial for women 65 years of age or older with a family history of dementia. Recruitment from local sites was supplemented by centralized efforts to use names of Medicare beneficiaries. Inclusion criteria included good general health and intact memory functioning. Participants were randomized to HRT or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Assignment was stratified by hysterectomy status and site. The primary outcomes were incident AD and memory decline on neuropsychological testing. Results Enrollment began in March 1998. In response to the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) May 2002 report of increased incidence of heart disease, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and breast cancer among women randomized to HRT, participants were re-consented with a revised consent form. Procedural modifications, including discontinuation of study medication and a modification of the planned primary outcome based on a final enrollment below the target enrollment (N \u00bc 477), were enacted in response to the subsequent WHI Memory Study report of increased risk of dementia and poorer cognitive function with HRT. The mean length of treatment exposure prior to discontinuation was 2.14 years. Participants' mean age at baseline was 72.8; mean education was 14.2 years.

AD is the most common cause of dementia. Cognitive decline, and memory loss in particular, is of great concern to the aging public and enthusiasm to ameliorate deterioration has high relevance. Therefore, prevention strategies that would completely prevent or delay onset are a high priority.\nRationale for estrogen replacement for dementia prevention: historical perspective At the time of trial planning, compelling evidence from longitudinal and cross-sectional epidemiological studies, small clinical trials and laboratory research in model systems suggested that estrogen replacement therapy may reduce the risk of AD in women. Several prospective epidemiological studies and a systematic meta-analysis of observational studies indicated that estrogen use was associated with a reduced risk of dementia in general and AD specifically [2] [3] [4] . These reports were relatively consistent in showing approximately a 30% reduction in dementia risk associated with hormone replacement therapy use. Subsequent populationbased studies [5, 6] and a second meta-analysis [7] found similar associations. The most commonly used form of estrogen replacement included in these investigations was conjugated equine estrogens (CEE). In some observational studies estrogen appeared to help to maintain or improve cognitive abilities in postmenopausal women. For example, Resnick et al. [8] found better performance on a visual memory test in women using estrogen compared to those not receiving replacement in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. In a community-based sample in New York City, Jacobs et al. [9] observed preservation of verbal memory, abstract reasoning, and language skills among women reporting estrogen use during the postmenopausal period. Carlson et al. likewise observed a benefit over time among elderly women with past but not current estrogen exposure [10] .\nSeveral small, short-term clinical trials also demonstrated a benefit on cognitive outcomes with CEE and estradiol. Sherwin [11] found improved performance on tests of attention (digit span), abstract reasoning, clerical speed and accuracy, and immediate paragraph recall among women treated with IM estradiol valerate after hysterectomy. Similarly, in a later report, Phillips and Sherwin [12] demonstrated preservation of verbal paired-associate learning and improved immediate paragraph recall among surgically postmenopausal women treated with estradiol valerate. Shaywitz et al. [13] demonstrated a benefit of CEE in postmenopausal nondemented women with cognitive complaint. These same findings had provided the rationale for the WHIMS study, a cognitive add-on to the WHI, which was underway at the initiation of PREPARE, but no results were yet available.\nThe WHIMS [14] was an 'add-on' protocol to examine cognitive outcomes among participants in the WHI [15] . Initiated in 1992, WHI's primary goal was to examine the effect of estrogen replacement on coronary heart disease and breast cancer outcomes in an 8.5 year long trial. Treatment regimen for the combination hormone therapy was 0.625 mg/day CEE and 2.5 mg. of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) for women with a uterus and the CEE alone for those who had a hysterectomy. WHIMS began in May of 1996 and enrolled 92% of the eligible women (i.e., aged 65 or older and free of probable dementia at baseline), from the placebo controlled, randomized WHI trial. The 2-stage evaluation for WHIMS consisted of screening with a brief global measure of mental status, followed by a detailed clinical evaluation for those who scored below pre-set cut points. The primary outcome measures of this sub-study were incident dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) defined as performance at or below the 10th percentile in at least one area of cognitive function."}, {"section_title": "Enriched design with family history", "text": "The incidence of AD ranges from 0.25% at age 65 to 2% at age 80 [16] . Thus, one of the challenges of designing a prevention trial is to enroll enough subjects to test the hypothesis that incidence rate is lowered. One known strategy is to recruit an enriched cohort to increase statistical power and shorten study duration by decreasing the requisite follow-up interval prior to incident events. Known factors that increase the risk of AD include advanced age, head trauma, limited education, family history of AD, and the epsilon 4 (e4) allele of the apolipoprotein-E (APOE) gene. Although advancing age is a strong risk factor for AD, the 2-4% estimates of incidence through the 9th decade are low, and a cohort of that age would be difficult to recruit. Head trauma, another risk for dementia, is relatively uncommon, particularly among women. Low educational attainment as a risk factor would be difficult to identify within the US since the cohort over 60 has a mean of nearly 12 years of education. Family history of AD in a firstdegree relative increases the lifetime risk of AD for an individual by 3.5-fold [18] . The epsilon 4 (e4) allele of the apolipoprotein-E (APOE) gene has been shown to increase the risk of late-onset AD, however there are ethical concerns in using genotyping as a method to identify individuals at risk for AD. Hence, it was decided to use the report of family history in a first-degree relative (i.e., parent, sibling, child, or an extended family member if such information was unknown in a first-degree relative due to early death) was used to establish an 'at risk' population."}, {"section_title": "Selecting the estrogenic agent", "text": "The treatment regimen for the PREPARE Trial paralleled that of WHI (i.e., combination hormone therapy was 0.625 mg/day CEE and 2.5 mg. of MPA for women with a uterus and the CEE alone for those who had hysterectomy). While recent results from the WHI have raised questions about the selection of this specific form of estrogen it is worth noting that the strongest human data at the time the PREPARE study was designed were epidemiologic studies in which the most commonly used estrogen was (CEE). The use of progestins came into favor with the results of the PEPI trial, in which unopposed estrogen use was associated with endometrial hyperplasia [17] . CEE plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (CEE \u00fe MPA) became the only combination medication with FDA approval for hormone replacement in women with an intact uterus. As such, the information on safety was available for this regimen. Given that our outcome measures emphasize cognitive functioning, consideration was given to using an agent with greater CNS bioavailability (e.g., beta-estradiol), but to optimize the ecological validity of the results the current standard of care (i.e., CEE and CEE \u00fe MPA) was implemented. Thus, based on maximal information about safety, efficacy, and generalizability, CEE and CEE \u00fe MPA were selected as the hormone replacement agents of choice for the protocol."}, {"section_title": "Hypothesis testing", "text": "PREPARE hypothesized that oral estrogens (alone or in combination with progesterone) would significantly reduce the risk of AD among women with a family history of AD in a first-degree relative.

Overall incidence of dementia in those over 65 was estimated at 1-2% per year and family history was thought to increase this 3.5-fold [18] to a range of 3.5-7%. Thus, an overall rate of 5% per year was considered to be a reasonable point estimate within the range. Given the plan to use coprimary outcomes, the usual alpha level of 0.05 was adjusted to 0.025 for each primary outcome. The enthusiasm for estrogen use at the time of study initiation led to an estimation for both a drop-in rate (10-20%) and drop-out rate (20-30%). No interim analyses were planned. To estimate power and sample size, the Log Rank test was proposed for the primary efficacy analysis for incident dementia. Based on these assumptions it was estimated that a sample size of 900 would yield 80% power to see a 50% reduction (RR \u00bc 0.5) in incident dementia over a 3-year period. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were proposed to model change in the composite memory score over a 3-year period and a comparable sample size would yield 80% power to observe a difference between groups in memory decline of 2% per year.\nThe analytic plan to compare the active treatment groups to the placebo group included stratification for center and hysterectomy status. The point estimate and 95% confidence interval of the relative risk of treated subjects compared to placebo subjects was obtained using partial likelihood method from the Cox model. The a priori plan was to use analysis of variance or Chi-square tests, as appropriate. Other a priori variables to be considered in additional analyses include demographic variables (i.e., age, education, ethnicity), clinical history variables such as history of estrogen use or number of first degree relatives with AD, and biological markers. The plan was to examine them as predictors of the primary outcome and if significant to include them in the secondary statistical analysis. Time to the primary outcome estimates would be based on the survival curves generated from the Cox model. To assess safety, the prevalence of individual adverse reactions would be analyzed using Chi-square methods and Log Rank tests."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The protocol was initiated as described in the preceding sections. Enrollment began in the first quarter of 1998 with the first subject randomized on March 24, 1998 . Cumulative recruitment over time is shown in Figure 1 . However, several interceding events, detailed below, required modification of the trial. Table 2 summarizes modifications occurring throughout the trial. First, in May 2002, the WHI study arm examining the effects of combination therapy (CEE \u00fe MPA) was discontinued after 5.6 years due to a finding that this treatment regimen increased risk of heart disease, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and breast cancer [19] . The PREPARE DSMB reviewed the WHI results and conducted a re-analysis of the adverse events within the PREPARE study. Based on this review, the DSMB recommended (1) a new consent form that summarized the WHI findings and (2) re-consenting previously consented participants. No modifications to entry criteria or study implementation were recommended."}, {"section_title": "Event driven procedural modifications", "text": "Since participants were to be re-consented to inform them of the WHI findings, it was decided to simultaneously propose a lengthening of study treatment from 3 to 5 years in order to extend our observations and potentially increase power. Reconsenting and extending the treatment interval was met with high rates of retention (418 of 426). In re-estimating power, the criteria for 'trigger' were used as the outcome measure rather than incident dementia. The advantage of using 'trigger' is that it captures not only those participants meeting criteria for dementia, but also those potentially in a prodromal phase of dementia (i.e., relatively poor memory performance compared to peers and an absolute decline from baseline scores, but no functional impairment). The effect size estimate was also scaled down to a RR of 0.7. Finally the plan to split alpha for two relatively highly correlated outcomes seemed overly conservative and we re-estimated the power for each outcome at alpha \u00bc 0.05. These modifications yielded a comparable power of 81% for this longer protocol assuming the sample of 900 could be achieved.\nIn May 2003, results from the WHIMS revealed an increased risk of dementia and poorer cognitive function among participants randomized to CEE \u00fe MPA. In June 2004, a similar but nonsignificant trend was reported among those on CEE. These findings led the PREPARE DSMB to recommend the cessation of study treatment with incomplete enrollment. The mean length of treatment exposure prior to discontinuation was 2.14 years with a minimum of 0.56 years and a maximum of 3 years. The alternatives reviewed by the DSMB at this point were to discontinue the study, break the blind and inform subjects of their treatment, or continue collecting data on the assembled cohort and maintain the blind in the absence of continued treatment. While the relatively short treatment exposure that many participants experienced during the trial was less than ideal, it actually approximated use patterns in epidemiological surveys and this possible benefit was weighed together with the fact that informing of the treatment assignment was noninformative with respect to clinical care or management. Reestimates of power based on the available cohort at the time that treatment was halted (N \u00bc 477) and 5-year follow-up suggested very limited power for the outcome of trigger (power \u00bc 29%; alpha \u00bc 0.05; two-sided test relative risk \u00bc 0.7). Power for the memory composite score was 64% (alpha \u00bc 0.05; two-sided test; 1% change at end of 5 years) and the power to detect at least one significant difference (either trigger or composite score) was 74% (1 \u00c0 (1 \u00c0 0.29)(1 \u00c0 0.64)).

While the WHIMS was the first 'add-on' trial to assess dementia prevention, PREPARE was the first prospectively designed trial powered to prevent AD to be funded by the National Institute of Aging. Although interest in estrogen for prevention of dementia has waned in the wake of the WHI and WHIMS findings, the PREPARE cohort, methodology, and methods of adapting to new information remain of interest. First, the PREPARE cohort was pre-selected to have intact cognition whereas nearly 10% of participants in the WHI had cognitive screen scores below the cut-off at entry [20] . Second, at the point of discontinuation of study medication in the PREPARE trial, subjects had been exposed to a mean of 25 months of study drug. This length of exposure is relatively comparable to that reported in population-based studies of hormone replacement therapy which demonstrated benefit [2] [3] [4] [5] , although the point in time for use of estrogens differs in that many of the population based studies include perimenopausal and early post-menopausal exposure to estrogens while PREPARE use was many years post menopause. However, randomization will permit us to determine if any effect of active drug on these outcomes is more than coincidence. Additionally, mirroring epidemiological studies, much of the benefit of HRT has been observed in cohorts with postmenopausal exposure, albeit at an earlier age than those in this randomized trial, followed by subsequent discontinuation. While these features were not part of the original design, maintaining the follow-up and the blind permits us to model the observed epidemiological phenomena upon which the study was originally justified. Equally important in the post WHIMS era will be documenting the absence or presence of distal negative effects after this brief exposure since estrogen remains an effective treatment for menopausal symptoms and is often used only briefly. Knowing the long-term consequence on cognition could have significant impact on acceptance of hormone use for these other conditions.\nThe PREPARE cohort was selected based on a family history of dementia. The data presented here suggest that doing so increases the rates of having an APOE e4 allele 2-to 3-fold compared to population rates. Nonetheless, the majority of the PREPARE cohort is not positive for this allele. Positive family history may also be associated with a differential effect of hormone replacement on cognition and the continued follow-up of the cohort off study medication will permit an assessment of this effect.\nWhile the PREPARE design of selecting those with no evidence of memory deficit may lower the rate of cognitive decline and conversion to dementia, it insures a population with no evidence of a dementia at baseline. This will be particularly important for addressing future criticism that the neuropathology is likely to exist before treatment begins. However, there is no method currently to confirm the presence or absence of neuropathology prior to symptom onset.\nGreat effort and expense went into the use of the CMS records for recruitment and the result was a sample highly representative of the US population. Education and ethnicity are comparable to United States population based estimates as per the 2000 census [21] . Use of hormones and the frequency of hysterectomy are comparable to rates observed in other reports. Thus, the data gleaned from PREPARE will provide valuable information about the natural history of cognitive function over time that will be generalizable to the breadth of the US population of aging women."}, {"section_title": "Value of administrative structure", "text": "The strength of the DCC is critical to multi-center studies to insure centralized data collection and administration. In the original proposal, recruitment was proposed as a set of site specific activities. However, over time this activity was centralized for several reasons. First, it became clear that local strategies were insufficient to accomplish the large recruitment. Second, senior staff changes occurred at two study centers and this altered the ability of the center to maintain oversight for local large recruitment efforts. Finally, additional sites were recruited and this provided a wider geographic area from which to enroll, although the new sites did not all have comparable expertise in recruitment of healthy subjects. This led to further centralization of the CMS recruitment effort and allowed for staff at individual sites to be trained and supervised for calling potential subjects and directing those interested to local sites for participation.\nWhile these events may be study specific, staff changes are not uncommon, particularly in long trials, and insufficient recruitment resources are almost universal. Overall the experiences highlight the value of a single administrative coordinating center which offers the flexibility to make modifications as the need is identified."}, {"section_title": "Impact of trial modification", "text": "Modifications made during the course of the trial in response to emerging evidence from WHI and WHIMS made it necessary to shift the outcome from incident dementia to discrete measures of cognitive change and to focus on the continuous measures of memory performance to accommodate the smaller sample size and the truncated treatment interval. While these outcomes may not be as widely accepted as incident dementia, they remain important and consistent with recent interest in milder forms of cognitive deficit that may predict incident dementia. In fact, this new clarification allows us to add to the growing scientific and clinical interest in early cognitive changes and the identification of prodromal conditions such as MCI and cognitive impairment, not dementia (CIND). The particular advantage of this approach is that it permits detection of incident change rather than making the assumption of change based on normative data that are currently implicit in the MCI designation.\nThe decision to continue the blind after discontinuing treatment raised ethical issues. The modification permitted only modest power to see an effect on either the memory score or the change in cognition but this was balanced against the fact that notification of specific arm assignment could not direct any change in health behavior. The compromise position was to immediately remove all subjects from treatment, comprehensively inform subjects of the newly reported risks of estrogen, and to ask them to participate in the observational follow-up. This was met with high enthusiasm and participation, supporting the notion that the idea was in equipoise with community understanding of the situation and with the claim that many research participants do so because they perceive their participation as contributing to a research effort that has the potential to benefit society as a whole rather than as individuals, who might experience a benefit from having dementia prevented or delayed in them. It is also possible that this cohort with a family history of dementia was more motivated than the general public to assess long-term cognitive effects. Like many other trials, new information from other relevant ongoing studies required modification of study design and methods. This highlights the need to consider potential modifications a priori in order to maximize information from a trial. Clinical trials with other interventions [22] have reported findings in contradiction to prediction from basic science and epidemiologic studies. Designs which consider such paradoxical results and incorporate contingent procedural changes at the start may provide opportunities to maximize information."}]
