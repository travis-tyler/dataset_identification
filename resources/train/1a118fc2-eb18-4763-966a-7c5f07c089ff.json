[{"section_title": "HIGHLIGHTS FROM TIMSS 2011", "text": "The change in average score is calculated by subtracting the 2007 or 1995 estimate, respectively, from the 2011 estimate using unrounded numbers. 2 National Defined Population covers 90 percent to 95 percent of National Target Population for 2011 (see appendix A). 3 Met guidelines for sample participation rates only after replacement schools were included for 2011. 4 National Target Population does not include all of the International Target Population for 2011 (see appendix A). 5 Nearly satisfied guidelines for sample participation rates after replacement schools were included for 2011. 6 Exclusion rates for Azerbaijan and Georgia are slightly underestimated as some conflict zones were not covered and no official statistics were available for 2011. 7 The TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center has reservations about the reliability of the average achievement score because the percentage of students with achievement too low for estimation for 2011 exceeds 15 percent, though it is less than 25 percent. NOTE: Education systems are ordered by 2011 average scores. Italics indicate participants identified and counted in this report as an education system and not as a separate country. Data are not shown for some education systems because comparable data from previous cycles are not available. Participants that did not administer TIMSS at the target grade are not shown; see the international report for their results. All U.S. state data are based on public school students only. For 1995, Korea, Portugal, Ontario-CAN had National Defined Population covering 90 to 95 percent of National Target Population; England-GBR had National Defined Population that covered less than 90 percent of National Target Population (but at least 77 percent) and met guidelines for sample participation rates only after replacement schools were included; Netherlands, Australia, and Austria did not satisfy guidelines for sample participation rates. For 2007, the United States, Quebec-CAN, Ontario-CAN, and Alberta -CAN had National Defined Population covering 90 to 95 percent of National Target Population; the United States and Denmark met guidelines for sample participation rates only after replacement schools were included; the Netherlands and Dubai-UAE nearly satisfied guidelines for sample participation rates after replacement schools were included; Georgia had a National Target Population that did not include all of the International Target Population; Dubai-UAE tested the same cohort of students as other countries, but later in the assessment year at the beginning of the next school year.
