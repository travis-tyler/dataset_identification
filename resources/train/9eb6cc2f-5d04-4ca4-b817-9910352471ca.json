[{"section_title": "", "text": "The absence of U.S. natives creates openings for foreign students to fill. The swelling of foreign student enrollment in S&E constructed the argument that foreign students are now entering the programs that natives find too challenging; when in reality obtaining a Ph.D. does not pay. This thesis explored whether and how research universities are gaining additional expenditures by giving preference to foreign students over natives. Three regression analyses discovered foreign students were more \"efficient\" than their native counterparts. Annual reduction of R&D outlays of 14 million dollars was discovered. It is theorized the efficiencies are obtained due to visa restrictions placed on the foreign students as it guarantees that the training invested in the student is kept during the duration of the grant ensuring on-time delivery to the sponsor.  (Greenberg, 2001) predicting a shortfall of scientists and engineers by 675,000 (as stated in one of the several versions of the report). Greenberg (2001) outlines the \"shortfall\" number was obtained by constituting the median age of twenty-two to receive a bachelor's degree. Of those bachelor degree recipients only a minute amount would continue on to obtain a Ph.D.. Their age after the long process to obtain the Ph.D. was factored in. Using population statistics and conjecturing the \"baby bust\" from the early 1960s, the shortfall number of 675, 000 S&E graduates between 1986 and 2010 was born. Greenberg (2001) details the missing piece: Keyed to domestic birth statistics, the pipeline controversy virtually ignored the continuing abundance of foreign born personnel in the American research enterprise. The immigrant population, trained abroad or in the U.S., has durably accounted for a sizable portion of the nation's working scientists and engineers since World War II, and has demonstrated high \"stay rates,\" contrary to alarmist warnings of an impending exodus to the homelands. This balance for the baby bust was scarcely mentioned by the shortfall theorists; skeptics of their ominous forecasts were reluctant to hinge their doubts on the availability of foreign scientists and engineers. (p.117) The missing factor of foreign born personnel did not stop the division from making other predictions. The division predicted a sharp increase in Ph.D. salary from $52,000 in 1982 to approach $100,000 beyond 2000. To combat this \"problem\" the NSF called for increases in foreign student enrollment for national interest. The internal NSF/PRA study (as cited in Weinstein, n.d.) "}, {"section_title": "stated:", "text": "A growing influx of foreign PhD's into U.S. labor markets will hold down the level of PhD salaries to the extent that foreign students are attracted to U.S. doctoral programs as a way of immigrating to the U.S.. A related point is that for this group the PhD salary premium is much higher [than it is for Americans], because it is based on BS-level pay in students' home nations versus PhD-level pay in the U.S.. (The NSF's Real Shortage Study,\u00b611) To encourage foreign scientists into the United States the internal study had two ideas. One was to grant equal access of graduate student support funds through federal agencies. The second idea was to provide foreign students that completed a Ph.D. degree at U.S. institutions permanent resident status. Greenberg's (2001) analysis of the internal study concurs with Weinstein's: The prospect of intersectorial competition over an inadequate supply of science and engineering doctorates inspired a new argument for additional federal funds to produce them: restrained wages. Introducing a barrage of seemingly authoritative numbers, House and colleagues stated, \"The effect of expanded fellowship support of doctoral students in NS&E fields is expected to be highly favorable in terms of expanded supply of new doctorates and reduced salary inflation.\" By spending an annual average of $612 million on student support from 1989 to 2006, they asserted, the \"program would generate average annual salary savings estimated at $1.81 billion during the same period.\" Again, any numbers beat no numbers. If the government would spend a bit more, academe and industry would save a great amount on payroll, they argued. (p.124) The NSF got what they wanted -both methods transpired. As to the first, government grants & contracts compose up to 30% of revenue for public and private research universities in 2006 (Council on Government Relations [COGR], 2008) and federal funding supported 60% of universities and colleges research and development (R&D) expenditures in 2002, (Shackelford, 2004). North (1995) found \"\u2026 the further you are from U.S. citizenship the more likely you are to secure American funding\" (p.83). Bevis and Lucas (2007) cited that often-foreign students receive support through research assistantships. They explain: Financial resources for research assistantships were provided to universities by federal government agencies, industry, and other nonfederal sources in the form of research grants. During the same period when academic research expenditures were growing, the number of foreign doctoral students supported by university science and engineering departments was also increasing. (pp.190-191) The second NSF goal was achieved by the Immigration Act of 1990 which created a new visa type (H-1B) for immigrants with bachelor degrees or equivalent in their field. The link is explained by Matloff (2003): The universities had very strong incentives to back industry on the shortage and H-1B issues: universities hoped to get increased government funding for science and engineering programs to cope with the labor \"shortage\"; many university postgraduate programs are populated largely by foreign students who hope to later work as H-1Bs in the U.S.; and the universities are major employers of H-1Bs themselves. (p.10) What is the concern that world renowned universities in the United States provide opportunities for foreign students, often the \"best and the brightest\" to study? Borjas (2002) explained from a national perspective, \"\u2026the foreign student program does not seem to pay its way. The net gain from the employment of foreign students and foreign graduates may be around $1 billion, while the subsidy accruing to foreign students is more than twice as high\" (p.7). This subsidy provided to foreign students paves a path for them to obtain sensitive U.S. technologies that may be under export control to their own home countries. A Defense Security Service (DSS) 2009 report finds threats from East Asia and the pacific through suspicious contact reports (SCRs) stating \"growing reliance on collection methods that mask state-sponsored interest. Furthermore SCRs indicated regional entities continued to exploit non-traditional collectors, like graduate and postgraduate students applying for positions in Unites States defense industry, as a guise to acquire sensitive technologies\" (p.18). There is another concern that is just as important as export control: national security.  describes it was a student visa which allowed the Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad entrance into the United States for attendance to the University of Bridgeport; where he received $6,700 in grant money to cover his tuition. In 2000 he graduated working for a temporary staffing agency under Optional Practical Training status (OPT) moving to the H-1B visa in 2002 to work for Elizabeth Arden in a low level accounting position. In 2005 his U.S. citizen wife filed a green card petition paving the way for his green card approval in 2006. In 2008 he applied for citizenship and in April 2009 he was sworn in as a U.S. citizen. In May 2010 (13 months after gaining citizenship) he attempted to set off a bomb in Times Square. It is this immigration path the Immigration Act of 1990 provided. The foreign student program does not pay from a national perspective and it is a security concern. A review of literature chapter will describe supporting documentation to show foreign students are actually \"revenue enhancers\" to research universities by merely following IRS tax laws. A methods chapter will detail the qualitative institutional data collected and summarize the data from publicly available databases that were used for analysis. In this chapter an analytical techniques section explains how the data were analyzed followed by the results chapter containing the analysis.

A review of literature details the history of the NSF shortage report. It is explained that opportunity costs play a role in the increase, as well as the research universities' need to fill positions. Although it appears tuition revenue may be a source of income, often in science and engineering (S&E) it is waived through a mystical web of university accounting, which is why foreign students selected that field. Also investigated is how S&E students fund their education. To understand where the revenue enhancement is located, research university accounting is explained leading to where the money is: direct costs. Research microeconomics is described. To follow is a breakdown of the S&E glut. Finally, details of native students crowded out from research universities are explored."}, {"section_title": "Opportunity Costs", "text": "Why aren't natives choosing to obtain a Ph.D. in S&E? Rao (1995) described their opportunity costs are higher compared to foreign students. A U.S. native has an alternative: they can find a good full-time job, whereas foreign students by way of immigration restrictions cannot until they graduate. He explains \"Furthermore, the real wage for even a good job in the primary source countries in Asia is much lower than that for almost any job in the United States\" (p.279). This matches what the NSF had hoped. Freeman (2005) agrees that the foreign students have lower opportunity costs and highlights an important point: \"To many foreign born students or workers, obtaining an S&E education or job is their ticket to the US job market, a green card, and possible citizenship\" (pp.15-16). He later warns: If US economic growth and comparative advantage depend substantially on the work of scientific and engineering workers, relying so much on foreign born supplies could be risky. Any interruption or change in the flow of immigrant scientists and engineers would certainly harm US research and development. (pp.18-19) Bevis and Lucas (2007) found an interruption already occurring -competition with other countries, and sometimes the students' own home countries. Karen Hughes, Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, addressed 120 college leaders assembled in Washington. She acknowledged that competition for hosting international students had greatly intensified in recent years and (as cited by Bevis and Lucas, 2007) remarked: 'Not too many years ago,' she observed, 'the United States was not only the best place to go, it was also one of the only places to go for serious study at the university level.' She continued, 'Today, hundreds of thousands of international students have many more opportunities to study at home, at centers of academic achievement in their own countries\u2026. ' (p.288) The General Accountability Office's 2009 report has findings which agree there is an interruption. In 2009, the GAO investigated efforts made by other countries to attract foreign students. Their study found, \"While the United States continues to be the leading destination for international students, the U.S. share of international students worldwide dropped -from 26 to 20 percent -between 2000 and 2008\" (p.3). In summary, for many U.S. natives a Ph.D. does not pay. During the five to six years it takes to obtain a Ph.D. the student is foregoing the thousands of dollars they can make in industry. Ph.D. salaries are higher, but it never matches the lost wages that could be made in industry (Matloff, 2003). This is a problem for the research universities who need bodies to perform research and obtain the revenues from this source."}, {"section_title": "Filling Positions", "text": "Although the NSF's internal study investigated a shortage of S&E graduates in the mid to late 1980s the lack of demand for a Ph.D. degree has been going on for quite some time. Geiger (2004) summarizes how the market forces have been working over the past three decades: Since the late 1970s the supply of qualified students seeking doctoral education in the sciences and engineering has tended to be less than the number of places potentially available for them. Market forces, in other words, have favored the applicants, with evident consequences. One effect has been a substantial increase in the number of international students. Universities have thus enlarged and improved the supply of qualified applicants by substituting highly qualified international students for lower-ranked (or nonexistent) domestic ones [italics added]. The number of doctorates granted to foreign nationals tripled from the late 1970s to the early 1990s, exceeding 50 percent of graduates in engineering and 30 percent in natural sciences. A second development has been the gradual improvement of the support packages given to doctoral students. As they competed for better students, departments lengthened the time of guaranteed support and increased the value of stipends. (pp.18-19) Matloff (2006) construes why there are nonexistent domestic students: Note that universities are employers too. The graduate students receive a modest stipend for their work on university research projects. This stipend is too low to attract many American students, just as the NSF predicted. In other words, universities are just as addicted to cheap foreign labor as industry, not only for the low cost itself buts also for docility, \u2026\" (p. In the fields in which I am familiar, the large numbers of foreign postdoctorals simply reflects the fact that capacity for directing research, measured both in terms of faculty talent and government money exceeds the supply of American candidates. I should think that this is one of the more effective uses of United States funds if it were to be regarded as a type of foreign aid. (p.208) Borjas (2002) offers, from the perspective of the research universities, why they may elect to enlarge their labor supply: Consider the financial incentive faced by large research universities when they make their admission decisions. These universities need many workers to staff their physical science laboratories and teaching assistants to assign to large undergraduate classes, and they would obviously prefer to fill these positions at low salaries. The foreign student program provided an almost limitless supply of these willing workers. (p.4) To summarize, research universities do not have a demand for graduate degrees by domestic students as the stipend offered is too low to attract their interest. However, government money exceeds the supply of the domestic labor. To compensate, rather than increase the stipend amount, research universities elected to increase their labor supply by admitting foreign students."}, {"section_title": "Tuition Revenue", "text": "At first, one may think, since foreign born students are non US residents, they surely pay full tuition as claimed by the Institute of International Education (IIE). The IIE states that in 2007-2008 foreign students and their parents contributed 15.453 billion dollars to the economy. Borjas (2004) agreed that full tuition, if it exceeded the cost of providing the actual education, could generate revenues. He warned, \"But the pricing of higher education in the United States is highly distorted in both private and public institutions, with the typical tuition payment not being sufficiently large to cover the actual cost of an education\" (p.15). Even if foreign born students were paying full tuition, it is still a bargain. Donald M. Bishop, Minister-Counselor for Press and Cultural Affairs American Embassy in Beijing explained at the American Center for Educational Exchange in 2005 that in public universities tuition typically covers one-fourth the costs. The rest is subsidized by American tax payers. He elaborates further: \"Another way to look at this is that every student admitted to an American university receives an (unstated) scholarship, or perhaps a subsidy, from American society\" ( \u00b621). Geiger (2004) agrees: American higher education is subsidized in numerous ways. Public colleges and universities rely chiefly on state appropriations, but other forms of public support, including student financial aid, flow to both public and private institutions. Exemption from taxation is another implicit subsidy, predicated on a contribution to the public good. The capital costs of higher education constitute a huge sum that takes the form almost entirely of subsidy. (p.11) He later warns: \"But forms of coordination shaped by artificial prices will always be sensitive to fluctuations in the levels and conditions of subsidization\" (p.265). Vaughan (2007) explains, to obtain a student visa, foreign students must show they can support their education in order to qualify for the visa, but she cautioned \"Some foreign students cut costs by obtain [sic] in-state tuition by using the address of relatives, and some institutions allow this\" (Policy Implications, \u00b6 7). How can these students be considered \"cheap labor\" when they are paying full price (though a bargain) for the privilege? They are not paying for the science and engineering field, for which they are applying, as compared to other fields such as liberal arts. Why Science and Engineering? Noll and Rogerson (1997) detail that the science and engineering fields account for \"\u2026virtually all federal support for university research\" (p.28). S&E receives most of the research money and provides the best opportunity for a student to receive full funding (North, 1995). North reiterates reasons previously covered: Americans are not interested in graduate school due to the lost wages compared to entering industry, leaving vacancies for well-qualified foreign students. Moreover, the latter often see an American Ph.D. as a path to U. S. citizenship. He adds, \"U.S. science and engineering degrees (and the graduate education that they represent) are highly regarded world-wide\" (p.30). North explains a S&E degree is not a country specific discipline like a law degree or a medical degree. Immigration laws provide ample opportunities for a foreign S&E graduate to stay and work in the United States by way of an H-1B visa, unlike other occupations."}, {"section_title": "Graduate Student Funding", "text": "North's 1998 study found that only 10 percent of foreign student funding came from overseas. That percentage diminished as their graduate years passed. Bevis and Lucas (2007) agreed: Financial support available from academic research activities was a major factor in attracting foreign students to U.S. doctoral programs. More than 75 percent of the 10,000 foreign doctoral recipients at American universities in 1996 reported their universities as the primary source of support for their graduate trainingmost in the form of research assistantships. (p.190) Foreign students are not paying their way as claimed by the IIE. In fact the IIE's methodology should be questioned. North (1995) shows that the IIE is not surveying the foreign students themselves but instead obtains second-hand estimates from foreignstudent advisors, who may be motivated to understate the extent of federal subsidies. After all, if foreign students are not paying their own way, how can they obtain a student visa, given the requirement of financial self-support? Vaughan (personal communication, February 10, 2010) explained that financial means can include scholarships and stipends in addition to the student's own resources It will be difficult to conclude that foreign graduate students in S&E are \"cheap labor\" if their stipends as graduate research assistants (GRA) and teaching assistants (TA) are heavily subsidized by the American tax payer through federal research grants and tuition waivers. In S&E typical methods used to fund graduate education are employment as teaching assistants or research assistants, fellowships, and tuition waiving. Teaching Assistants North (1995) refers to TAs as \"Class C\". Often a modest salary is paid. They typically work part time and help the university keep their costs low by providing work that a higher paid faculty member is not doing. Since this salary is considered a \"payment involving services\" it is taxable to the student, (The George Washington University, 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Graduate Research Assistants", "text": "Referred to as \"Class D\" by North (1995), their roll is the most important in the university labor market as it is their work that keeps the flow of the lucrative federal research grants in operation. As with TAs Graduate Research Assistants (GRA) often receive a small salary. Hamel, Heiberger, and Vick (1994) explain \"Research assistants (RA) may be found in areas where large training grants from the federal government are available. These areas are usually in the sciences and engineering\u2026\" (p.12). They work longer hours than part time. \"Graduate research assistants under the oversight of the principle investigator likely perform much of the actual work for such projects\" (Geiger, 2004, p.191).

This salary can be charged to a federal grant as a \"direct cost\" (explained in more detail later)."}, {"section_title": "Fellowships", "text": "Fellowships are a type of scholarship awarded in S&E by a grant funding organization or the university itself. They are considered a type of scholarship, and though these fellowships may be paid like a salary, they are not (University of Texas at Austin, n.d.).

Hamel, Heiberger, and Vick (1994) clarifies fellowships \"are actual dollars paid beyond tuition scholarship. These monies are meant to support students by making money available to cover room, board, books, and supplies and are taxable as income\" (p. 9). Regardless of how the fellowship was awarded, a university is not required to report them to the IRS and is not required to withhold tax on them. It is the student's responsibility to report the money to the IRS, (The George Washington University, 2009)."}, {"section_title": "University Fellowships", "text": "Often universities will provide a tuition award to an outstanding student.

It is not taxable to the student, as it is often used to pay for \"qualified tuition and related expenses\" (Harvard University).

They are \"grants to participants to enable them to pursue programs of independent research, training, and original study, focusing on the experience to be gained by the recipient, rather than on the University's benefit\" (pp. 1-2, Harvard University, 2007).

Between the university and federal grant relationship tuition is a wage, or a \"payment involving services\". The university will then, in turn, take that money and \"award\" it to the student for \"qualified tuition and related expenses,\" where, for IRS tax purposes it is not taxable to the student. The George Washington University (2009) details: Individuals who engage in such teaching, research and/or similar activities shall not be paid for these efforts through a tuition credit on their student account or by being awarded a stipend, although their total support package may include a tuition award and/or stipend.

It is important to note that, in general for S&E, a tuition award is complete remission, referred to as \"tuition waving\". Likewise, fellowships are often not considered to be salaries, though they are referred to as stipends. The word stipend is often interchanged with salary, but there is a difference. Salaries are \"payments involving services\" and are wages. Stipends, although often paid like a salary for living expenses, are for training, but are not \"wages\" or \"payments involving services\". From the viewpoint of S&E graduate students, what they actually receive is normally a paycheck (their \"stipend\") from which taxes may or may not have been withheld; they rarely receive a tuition bill with an outstanding balance since that has been waived."}, {"section_title": "Research University Accounting", "text": "North (1995) remarks: Meanwhile, the low salaries of the RAs and postdocs, who are often foreign born, help perpetuate the universities' continuing ability to secure high overhead rates on government scientific and engineering research contracts; we have not seen this linkage suggested before, but it seems an obvious one. (p.127) Where can one find this linkage? It is not in the research university's so-called \"overhead costs\"; instead, the linkage is to be found in their \"direct costs\". Let's take a closer look at university accounting. These costs are often denoted \"overhead\" costs by the research universities. The University of Texas at Austin (n.d.) details what these costs are specifically:"}, {"section_title": "How Funding is Found", "text": "Facilities and Administrative (F&A) costs are sometimes called indirect costs (IDC) or overhead costs. These refer to those costs incurred by the university in support of the project that are not easily allocable as direct costs. These costs are usually associated with facility operation and maintenance, utilities and building and equipment depreciation, etc. Most sponsors recognize that universities that conduct research incur these costs in addition to those direct costs that are that are directly allocable and included in a project's budget. And, they have agreed that the portion of F&A costs identified with organized research is distributed by applying a cost rate(s) which is negotiated between the university and the federal government. This process allows the university to recover some portion of the costs associated with conducting research. (p.20, section 4.2.8) Noll and Rogerson (1997) remark that \"nearly a third of federal support takes the form of indirect cost recovery (overhead)\" (Abstract). To determine the negotiated rate an audit is conducted by the research university to justify their rate. This audit is reviewed by a funding organization to determine if the rate is correct (Ehrenberg and Mykula, 1999). The audit is administered according to Circular A-133 \"Audits of States, Local Government, and Non-Profit Organizations.\" The circular covers the rules grant agencies must follow when they audit the research universities. The negotiated rate is typically that of the main funding organization, for example, the National Institute of Health (NIH) or Office of Naval Research (ONR) (Noll and Rogerson, 1997). Ehrenberg and Mykula (1999) note \"Many faculty do not understand that a university is not permitted to overrecover its indirect costs and believe that, at the margin, their grant imposes no extra indirect costs on a university but generates indirect cost recovery for it\" (p.5). With large sums at stake, the intricacies of indirect-cost computation have spawned a subdivision of micro-accountancy with two branches: one, on the administrative side of universities, seeks to get as much as it can from the federal research agencies that support university science; the other, on the government side, is dedicated to minimizing the expenditures. Looking on, and aggrieved, are the scientists, convinced that \"their\" money is being squandered for nonscientific purposes. (pp.83-84)"}, {"section_title": "Direct Costs", "text": "Geiger 2004 They later explain that it is the PI's have very \"\u2026close control over direct costs, and have considerable latitude to the transfer expenditures among categories of direct costs, so that typically there is no large discrepancy between the amount awarded and the amount spent\" (pp.18-19). It is important to emphasize here that direct costs include specifically: faculty salaries, student salaries (such as graduate research assistants), university fellowship stipends (when specifically to provide training and approved by the sponsoring agency), tuition remission, fringe benefits, consultants, equipment (specifically for the project), publication costs, travel, computer time, and various others pertaining to the project, only as allowed by OMB Circular A-21, (University of Texas at Austin, n.d.). It is here that full reimbursement for the specific research is received.

Ehrenberg and Mykula (1999) agree with this opinion, explaining: Our major finding is that higher indirect cost rates are associated with higher levels of direct and indirect cost funding for institutions that initially are among the largest recipients of federal funding. In contrast, for universities initially in the lower tail of funding recipients, higher indirect cost rates are associated with lower levels of direct and indirect costs funding. AbstractTheir research disproved faculty concerns that the higher indirect cost rates were penalizing their funding awards. High indirect cost rates in fact signal to the funding organization that the research university has the infrastructure to provide the quality research the organization seeks. Ehrenberg and Mykula (1999) emphasize, \"If a decline in an institution's indirect cost rate is associated with a reduction in its research infrastructure, this may make its faculty members' grant applications less competitive\" (p.7). Geiger (2004) agrees stating the academic competitiveness \"of universities reflects the quality of the personnel and infrastructure at individual institutions\u2026\" (p.239)."}, {"section_title": "Where the Money Is: Direct Costs", "text": "Is it possible that, frustrated with their universities' high overhead cost, PIs attempt to decrease their direct costs (the only control they have) by reducing their labor costs (they believe) in the hope of winning more federal funding? North (1995) states: \"The overhead rates of academic institutions and other nonprofit organizations are often cloaked in complex accounting formulae and regulations, but in the end they, like profits in a for-profit context, are what the market will bear\" (p.126). How can foreign students be considered \"cheap labor\" when they are receiving the same stipends and tuition remission as natives? The answer is that they do not. Koryto (2006) on the Miller, Johnson, Snell & Cummiskey P.L.C. website interprets the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) tax codes for foreign students. It is explained that, due to their \"non-resident\" alien status, the students by law are considered to be engaged in trade or business and must report those activities as income on tax returns. Although foreign students must file income tax returns, U.S. income tax treaties offer some foreign students more take home pay than their native counterparts. Koryto (2006)  * also includes countries with tax treaties that give minimal or no benefits to their graduate students vis-a-is U.S. grad students. For example, the Thailand treaty gives Thai grad students in the U.S. a $3,000 deduction for income earned while studying, but they do not benefit from the $5,700 standard deduction that U.S.students get. Only treaties that give students at least a $5,000 deduction for campus jobs are included in the other tready countries category above. There are five main variables at work here: 1) the fact that these foreign students must file the 1040NR (nonresident) form that usually offers fewer tax breaks than the 1040; 2) the number of graduate students from various countries; 3) the right of only a minority of these students (notably those from India) to claim the standard deduction of $5,700 each; 4) the right of only a minority to claim exemptions for dependents, again India and ; 5) and the existence of, and the terms of, the various tax treaties. The net balance of all these considerations is estimated above. While the total percentage of graduate students from India and China (not shown above) is drawn from the Open Doors report of the Institute for International Education, the percentage estimates are those of David North. IRS Publication 901 U. S. Tax Treaties (rev. April 2009) was used to prepare this "}, {"section_title": "A Closer Look at Foreign Graduate Student Stipends", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Tax Treaties", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Relator v. University of California", "text": "The practice investigated was the University of California (UC) charging the federal government the non-resident tuition rate for foreign students for federal research projects. North (2000) explains the issue: Although the GAO does not say so, virtually all Ph.D. candidates in science and engineering have assistance packages that include waived tuition, with either research projects (usually federal) or the university picking up the tuition costs. While it is common for state universities to set higher tuition rates for out-of-state students than for state residents, most allow U.S. citizens and green card holders to move from out-of-state status after one year. The universities do not, however, make similar provisions for foreign students on temporary visas. ( \u00b63) On the surface this practice appears to be acceptable. Foreign students are not residents nor are they green card holders, why should the university alter their policies? One must not forget the fact emphasized earlier: foreign students (like most native graduate students) pay no tuition as it is typically waived. North (2000) estimates, \"the actual billings for the waived tuition and fees of graduate research assistants to the various federal buyers of scientific research run about twice as high as do those for citizens\" ( \u00b65). The judgment for the second case is as follows: based on the original case, the practice was brought to the government entities attention. Since nothing was done to stop the practice, they apparently have no problem with the practice and it must be allowedtherefore, there is no fraud (Benson, personal communication, February 24, 2010). Allowing the University of California to receive twice the billings for a foreign student as compared to a native is not fraudulent in the eyes of the federal government and the grant granting institutions. Let's investigate residency for tuition purposes and visa classifications in more detail."}, {"section_title": "Residency for Tuition Purposes", "text": "Residency for tuition purposes has become big business for colleges and universities. In the past decade most states have reduced their funding requiring the institutions to make up the revenue by charging individuals who are not residents of the state higher tuition as they do not pay local taxes. There is a difference between residency for the state and \"residency for tuition purposes\" (RTP). Though an individual may be considered a resident of the state, they may not necessarily be considered a resident for tuition purposes. Students who have not achieved RTP are referred to by the university as a \"nonresident\" student or an \"out-of-state\" student. It is more difficult to obtain RTP than it is to achieve state residency. To reach RTP often the student must maintain a domicile and show intent to make the state their home. A domicile can be a rented apartment or a home ownership. Merely owning property in the state is not considered a domicile. Intent frequently entails the student converting over their documentation (driver's license, voter's registration, car registration, etc.) to their new state as well as paying state income taxes. Typically such criteria must be established for one year. If a student is able to establish RTP the student is referenced as a \"resident\" student or an \"in-state\" student."}, {"section_title": "Visa Classifications", "text": "Students often enter the country on F-1 or J-1 visas.

Entering the country on an F-1 or J-1 visa often removes the student from RTP eligibility. By way of the visa type the student is ineligible to maintain a domicile and show intent.

The student is charged the nonresident tuition; however, a deduction is provided to their account paid by their department as the grant has reimbursed the tuition. The university captures the additional tuition money because as found previously public university tuition charged covers only a fraction of the costs as it is subsidized by American society. The university is happy because they have achieved additional revenue from the foreign student. The PI is also happy since visa restrictions guarantee that foreign research assistants are semi-captive employees. They cannot get a full time job and leave the university completely (Rao, 1995) taking the valuable training their professor provided them with. Though they can move their visa to another university they have already built a relationship with their current university and professor, to whom they tend to be loyal. In summary, graduate research assistants receive valuable training, which is potentially \"portable\" to another campus or to a job. If the graduate student in fact decamps with this training prior to graduation, it could be said that the university and the PI were unable to appropriate all the benefits of the training they provided -a situation that economists label an \"externality,\" a disincentive to using graduate students as research assistants.

A student is not considered key personnel so citizenship does not require a budgetary adjustment. A simple call by the PI to the university's support department reallocates that money slated for the nonresident tuition remission to another direct-cost line item such as equipment or travel. Future grant money is now reduced as the tuition remission is at the lower \"direct cost\" rate. Perhaps the native student decides that they are unable to pay their bills on the modest salary they were awarded.

It is a glut the NSF in the mid-to-late 1980s had hoped to create by increasing their labor supply through the admission of foreign students. Benderly 2010focuses on those that benefit from the science: The groups that benefit from the science labor glut include senior professors, who receive the great bulk of federal grant funding, and the research universities that employ them (and the graduate students and postdocs) while receiving overhead payments from the grants. \u00b647Greenberg (2001) points out: \"For decades, the reproductive urge in science and engineering was abetted by policies that sanctified and subsidized the training of doctoral students, with little or no regard to their employability, except as cheap labor in the academic research system\" (p.89). Indeed there is a detachment from the job market. Greenberg cites a 1995 Stanford Institute for Higher Education Research study, which concluded (as cited by Greenberg, 2001) that: the natural production rates of doctorates is driven by departmental needs [in universities] for research and teaching assistants, and that departmental doctoralstudent intake is limited by financial constraints rather than output market considerations\u2026.Faculty tend to believe that more scientifically-trained manpower is better than less, and that job opportunities will materialize somehow\u2026In any case, the department's shortrun requirements for inexpensive research and teaching labor, and the desire of faculty to replicate their own skills, is of stronger relevance to admissions decisions than the more abstract and distant concept of labor market balance. (p. 145) Benderly (2010) asks, \"So what can be done to rescue the American scientific labor market from self-destruction\" ( \u00b654)? She is pessimistic, but offers a solution: There has been relatively little attention given to possible solutions for the scientist glut -in no small part because the scientific establishment has been busy promoting the idea that the U.S. has a shortage of science students. The volume of money, however, is countable, and comprehensible to scientists, politicians, and the public. Understood by all is the necessity of money for the training and well-being of scientists and the nurturing and advance of science. In the politics of science, the golden ages of sciences are thus usually equated with money, not with discovery, though the underlying assumption is that more money will produce more science.

Borjas (2004) summarized a university's admission decisions: A university's decision to admit additional foreign students to its graduate program obviously depends on many factors, including the relative quality of the applications, the possibility that foreign students pay for a higher fraction of their education, the widespread adoption of the axiom that \"diversity\" is beneficial in a university setting, and the relative marginal products of the foreign and native students as employees of the university (since many graduate students typically work as research assistants or teaching assistants). Some of these factors may imply that, other things being equal, admission officers would prefer to admit a foreign student over a native-born applicant. (pp.3-4) It has been emphasized earlier foreign students are not paying a higher fraction of their education, but rather they are often receiving complete funding. The University of California is gaining twice the tuition remission from federal grants for a foreign student than a native. This led the North (2000) to ask, \"Does this cause the University of California to tilt toward admitting more foreign students\" ( \u00b65). Though Borjas (2004) did not mention this practice, he did find that \"The evidence presented in this paper documents a strong negative correlation between the enrollment of white native men in graduate programs and the enrollment of foreign students\" (p.14). Earlier he explained, \"After all, the greatest declines in the enrollment of white native men occurred at highquality institutions\" (p.14).

Perhaps the decline in visa issuances after the terrorist attacks created a delayed reaction causing the dip seen in Figure 6 from 2003-2006 as the trend line reflects total full-time enrollment and not first-time enrollment. Foreign students may have held back on enrollment into U.S. institutions after September 11 th as it was assumed the visa process would be more difficult whereas it had not been before.

Meeks (1997) documented in a NSF report the DOD accounted for 47% federal R&D obligations, which is a substantial piece of the federal R&D obligation pie. This percentage has gotten bigger. After the release of the GAO document was there a noticeable change in nonresident (foreign) student enrollment based on the concerns of research universities violating export controls? Since the report was released near 2007 and IPEDS only provides data to 2008, only a year's worth of enrollment data is available for analysis. Nonresident (foreign) student enrollment only grew three percent where an average increase of seven percent was experienced annually since 1980. During the same years (2007)(2008) native and resident enrollment increased 11% where an average of two percent was occurring annually. Perhaps the enrollment difference is due to the GAO report creating panic amongst research universities on concerns of export control violations. Maybe the enrollment increase happened due to an increased interest in graduate school by natives to enhance their career during economic recessions."}, {"section_title": "Recessions", "text": "Often when recessions occur, those jobless use the opportunity to go back to college and obtain additional training as it is assumed the new skills will make the individual more valuable in the job market.

These recessions occurred: \u2022 7/81 -11/82 16 months \u2022 7/90 -3/91 8 months \u2022 3/01 -11/01 8 months \u2022 12/07 -6/09 18 months  and third (2001)(2002) recessions experienced a six percent gain where on average the enrollment increase was two percent annually. As found previously, after the release of the GAO export control report a jump in total native and permanent resident enrollment did occur, however the document itself may not have created the increase as a recession was also in progress during this period of time; which may also be the reason behind the 11% gain from 2007 to 2008.

Regression 2 extends that log linear model to include the institutional data, adding the independent variables: enrollcap, rtpnative, rtpforeign, rschasstdoa and rshasstdoe. Based on the results from the second regression, the third model expands upon the first by changing the dependent variable from federal R&D expenditures only to all R&D expenditures. For all three regressions I tried a dummy variable for 2007 versus 2008, but there was no statistically-significant difference in the average log(federal R&D expenditures) between the two years. Each analysis is discussed further. The significance criterion is noted as follows: No asterisk: p > 0.10. *p<0.10. **p<0.05. ***p<0.01."}, {"section_title": "Regression 1", "text": "The R-squared for regression 1 is 0.4974, indicating that the independent variables jointly account for 50% of the total variation in the dependent variable.

Moreover, the robust LTS method revealed no egregious outliers. To explore the implications of this regression, consider a hypothetical but fairly Assuming that it does not impair the final research results, this adjustment in the mix of graduate students improves federal R&D efficiency. Like any linear model, mine is valid for marginal (incremental) changes in the independent variables but not for extrapolation far outside the range of the sample data. Pushed to its logical conclusion, the model implies that universities should admit only foreign graduate students to STEM fields. This is absurd since it ignores the economic \"law of diminishing returns,\" not to mention demographic and political constraints. My model tentatively quantifies the cost savings from the incremental replacement of native graduate students by their foreign counterparts, but it does not pinpoint the sources of those savings. The summary of this question's analysis will explore what these sources might be."}, {"section_title": "Regression 3", "text": "Can it be assumed foreign graduate students achieve efficiencies with respect to academic R&D outlays in general? Regression 3 replaces the dependent variable in regression 2 with Log(annual R&D expenditures) rather than federal R&D expenditures only. This method provides a broader measure of R&D expenditures which strengthens the argument that efficiencies may result when foreign graduate students replace their native counterparts. R-squared is 0.5381. Pursuing the thought experiment, consider a university with $387 million in total annual R&D expenditures (about the average in the sample) and an equal number of foreign and native graduate students. If again 10 percent of the native graduate students are replaced by an equal number of foreign graduate students, the annual reduction in R&D outlays is (-0.35)(0.10)($387 million) = -$13.5 million, which suggests that foreign graduate students produce general R&D efficiencies that may be similar in magnitude to the savings in federal R&D. As with regression 2, the assumption is that the adjustment in the mix of graduate students does not somehow impair the final research results."}, {"section_title": "Diminishing returns to graduate-student substitution", "text": "For a log-linear model Log(y) = a + bLog(x) + cLog(z), \u2202Log(y) / \u2202 x = (1/y)\u2202y/\u2202x = b/x so \u2202y/\u2202x = b(y/x). In the context of regression 2, the latter partial derivative is the rate of change of federal R&D expenditures with respect to the number of foreign graduate students, holding constant the total number of graduate students. Clearly \u2202y/\u2202x depends on the regression coefficient b and on y/x, the ratio of federal R&D expenditures per foreign graduate student in a real or hypothetical university. The second column of Table 6 shows that, in my data set, the partial derivative is -$52,242 for universities at the fifth percentile of federal R&D expenditures per foreign graduate student. However, the partial derivative is much larger for universities at higher percentiles like the median or the 95 th percentile. The third column of Table 6 shows the differential \u0394Fedrdexp = (\u2202Fedrdexp / \u2202Forgs) \u0394Forgs when \u0394Forgs = 100, that is when 100 foreign graduate students replace 100 native graduate students. As common sense suggests, the substitution of foreign for domestic graduate students is subject to diminishing returns: the cost saving is much larger for universities with a high level of federal R&D expenditures per foreign graduate students (e. g. the 95 th percentile) than for universities that have already reduced their federal R&D expenditures per foreign graduate student, possibly by substitutions (e. g. the 5 th percentile). So the replacement of native by foreign graduate students would be a self-limiting process that could not reasonably be pursued to an extreme degree. The relationship between a faculty advisor and a graduate student is a unique one. Regardless of the form of financial support (and even without support) students must maintain a professional relationship with both their advisor and their peers. Early departure from a program can result in substantial delays to the research including its delivery to the sponsor. (p.21) Rao (1995)  You are not allowed to work full-time on OPT until all coursework has been completed, even if an EAD card has been received. (p.10) If graduate students leave with their training prior to the completion of the research, then in the parlance of economics it is said that the university and the principal investigator were unable to appropriate all the benefits of the training they provided, imposing an \"externality cost\" on the university and the grant's sponsor. In general, labor economists use the term \"poaching\" when employees trained by one company are recruited by a rival firm that seeks to avoid the expense of training (Leuven, 2005). Poaching of graduate research assistants has some unique features. After all, universities typically encourage their newly produced Ph.D.s to start their careers on another campus; this policy promotes a faculty with diverse academic backgrounds and avoids \"inbreeding.\" Thus it is understood that graduate research assistants, regardless of citizenship, will normally graduate and leave their employer (the university), taking their training with them. Mohrenweiser, et al. (2010) cite Acemoglu and Pischke (1998): \"employment of apprenticeship graduates is not contractible since apprenticeships legally terminate at the day after the last exam (non-enforceable contract) \u2026\" (p.3). However, this does not diminish the stake that principal investigators have in protecting their research projects from poaching and externality costs. It remains an open question whether principal investigators consider the visa restrictions to which foreign graduate students are subject as a kind of insurance against externality costs. If so, does this account for a significant portion of the apparent cost savings that the regression analysis imputes to foreign graduate students? citizen and permanent resident Ph.D. production at private universities. The first in the early 1970s and the second in the mid 1990s. A gradual dip is found from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. The second peak at private universities never surpassed the 1970s peak. This is not true at public universities where the total earned doctorates peak in the mid 1990s did surpass the 1970s peak. Figure 14. Earned doctorates trend line for U.S. citizens and permanent residents at private and public institutions. Pubic institutions produce more earned doctorates. A noticeable dip that occurs at the turn of the decade does begin to recover yet never surpassing the first peak in the early 1970s. Interestingly despite the fact Ph.D. production was very high, this did not stop two deans in a 1969 book by the National This does not mean that there is no exploitation of the foreign postdoctoral. The dean at a Midwestern university said, 'It has been said that foreign postdoctoral appointees are a cheap source of labor. I am afraid that in some cases this is true.' The dean at another university was more explicit: \u2026I suspect that the particular mix between foreign postdoctorals and citizens of the United States depends upon the drawing power of a particular professor. He will normally pick the most promising men applying to work with him, although he may be influenced somewhat by his desire to be known and have influence in particular foreign countries. Some of the so-called foreign postdoctorals are simply hired hands and reflect the fact that some foreigners, often with not too great ability, are willing to do kinds of work which American postdoctorals or graduate students will not do. (p.208) Postdoctorals are the next career move in academia following receiving a Ph.D. Often working for a professor of their choice to continue learning. North (1995) explains they are a \"highly-educated junior professional\" (p.92). Foreign postdoctorals are willing to do what American postdoctorals will not do. Let's take a closer look at the temporary resident (foreign student) earned doctorate trend line."}, {"section_title": "Temporary Residents", "text": "For the most part since 1966 foreign earned doctorates have been on a steady rise in both institutional control types (Figure 15). An interesting peak is found in the early 1990s at public institutions. The cause for the peak is unknown. It is assumed The  Strangely the peak is not as evident at private institutions. A substantial rise is found in the late 1990s to present in earned doctorates of foreign students. Oliver (2007) finds the same: \"The number of foreign postdocs has increased by 53% since 1995\u2026(p.4)\" When viewing the trend lines together (both U.S. citizens and permanent residents and temporary residents) by institutional type (Figures 16 and 17) it is discovered the number of temporary resident (foreign) earned doctorates is quickly encroaching on the number of U.S. citizens and permanent resident doctorates at both institutional control types.    North (1998) found, only 10% of foreign-student funding came from overseas, and it is likely that they seldom pay the out-of-state tuition rate charged to the federal government. The latter procedure was deemed not to be fraudulent in the case Robert C. insight into what the colleges and universities were charging the federal government as a direct cost to their research grants. It was found foreign students and out-of-state students could obtain in-state tuition. For the most part the in-state tuition was received by the student becoming a graduate research assistant. Regarding foreign students 60% of very high research universities and 53% high research universities authorized in-state tuition. Eighty-nine percent of very high research universities allowed this and 85% high research universities practiced this policy for native students. Interestingly foreign students are found not to be more prepared for graduate school as compared to their native counterparts. Native students often have more education and longer work experience. The analysis did not determine whether if institutions choose to crowd-out foreign students or out-of-state students for in-state students is unknown. Borjas (2004) did find there is a crowding-out effect for white native males and that universities are giving priority to the admission of foreign students. Crowding-out is suggested in the graduate student enrollment trend line. Enrollment for native and resident students have only increased on average two percent annually where enrollment for nonresident (foreign) students has increased seven percent annually since 1980. Interpretation of the data suggests most natives choose not to continue for the Ph.D. and stay with a Master's degree only. This is found when the earned doctorate trend line is explored further. Crowding-out here is implied. For most of the past 40 years native and permanent resident student earned doctorates have fluctuated between 5000-7000 at public universities and 2000-3000 at private institutions. However, temporary (foreign) student earned doctorates have increased 464% at private institutions and 539% at public institutions since 1966. Three regression analyses discovered foreign students were more \"efficient\" than their native counterparts. It is theorized the efficiencies are obtained due to visa restrictions placed on the foreign students as it guarantees that the training invested in the student is kept during the duration of the grant ensuring on-time delivery to the sponsor. Principle investigators have a high stake in protecting their research projects from poaching and externality costs. It is incorrect to refer to foreign students as \"cheap labor.\" Foreign and native students receive about the same graduate research assistant salary. All graduate assistants are \"cheap labor\" by way of research universities increasing their labor supply through the recruitment of foreign students. Though tax treaties do afford some foreign students additional take home pay, the principle investigator does not benefit from this. They benefit from the immigration restrictions placed on the foreign students and the higher out-of-state tuition rate charged to the federal government as a direct cost."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Further Study", "text": "It was my goal to obtain restricted data from the NSF's SED.

It is not cost effective for a U.S. native to enter graduate school because the five or six years required to complete a Ph.D. imply an opportunity cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars in the form of employment in the private sector without the doctorate. On the other hand, research universities need graduate students to work in their laboratories and thereby generate federal grant revenue. Science and engineering (S&E) fields account for a majority of all federal support for university research. S&E receives most of the research money and provides the best opportunity for a student to receive full funding. The absence of U.S. natives creates openings for foreign students to fill. The swelling of foreign student enrollment in S&E constructed the argument that foreign students are now entering the programs that natives find too challenging; when in reality obtaining a Ph.D. does not pay. This thesis explores whether and how research universities are enhancing their revenues by giving preference to foreign students over natives. The Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) offered by the National Science Foundation (NSF) provides first-hand data of doctorate recipients receiving a research doctorate. The principal researcher is interested in institutional comparisons of the financial support packages (Question 1) they are providing their native and foreign born students independently in the science and engineering (S&E) fields.
