This thesis project assessed the feasibility of using AIS ship draft data to calculate under keel clearance and explore its utility as a factor to determine hydrographic survey priorities. The results proved under keel clearances calculated from AIS vary by port and can be quantitatively used to assign relative risks to ports using draft information. However, the attribute data from AIS must undergo significant quality control measures to remove a large amount of erroneous draft information input by the ships' crew. Because draft information in AIS messages is a static field, the reported draft carries a great deal of uncertainty; significant negative under keel clearance vessels were calculated during the study. With additional research into the nature of erroneous AIS draft entries and developing detailed, automated quality control measures, AIS data will ix have the opportunity to become a variable in a quantitative tool for planning future surveys by NOAA hydrographers."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION", "text": "The United States' ports and waterways are critical to the nation's economy. More than 80 percent of the United States' international trade by volume is conducted by maritime shipping. NOAA dedicates four large ocean-going vessels, one small research vessel, and six small craft from its research fleet to survey the coast year-round (NOAA Office of Coast Survey 2013b). Hydrographic contracts worth millions of dollars are also awarded annually to contribute to this effort, providing depth data from ships and support in the form of airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) shoreline detection, LiDAR depth and obstruction data, and remote tide gauge installations. Even with these dedicated resources, there is still an enormous amount of coastline that must be surveyed and constantly resurveyed to ensure accurate nautical charts. NOAA's Office of Coast Survey must prioritize the areas that need to be surveyed and carefully assign the surveys to the appropriate operational assets (NOAA Office of Coast Survey 2012). Depending on the size of the survey, its complexity, and the capabilities of the vessels and crew assigned to complete the survey, hydrographic survey projects can take a period of weeks to months. For example, survey number H08878, completed in 1966 in Hampton Roads, took 48 days for the NOAA Ship Whiting's hydrographers to complete using single beam sonar (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 1967). In comparison survey H12617 took 20 days for NOAA Ship Fairweather to complete using multibeam sonar (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2014). Although NOAA does not release typical cost estimates for surveys, normal expenses include crew salary (approximately 50 crew members), food for the crew, fuel for the vessels, and other expenses incurred for sailing a ship. Typical survey techniques and operations are discussed further in Chapter 2. The current annual hydrographic survey prioritization review and methodology is not well documented and uses many qualitative components. The prioritization process takes into account many different criteria, starting with the depth of the water. Areas of the seafloor are deemed 'navigationally significant' based on the depth of the water and the typical characteristics of the seafloor. Waters less than 600 feet deep are deemed significant in some parts of Alaska because of their rocky and unpredictable nature, while the flat seafloor of the Gulf of Mexico is significant for waters less than 120 feet deep. The navigationally significant areas are then assigned a priority level from Critical and Emerging Critical areas, through priority levels 1 through 4 (4 being the lowest survey priority). The age of the last survey, shipping trends, and tonnage, types of cargo, and requests from local mariners and port authorities are among some of the criteria that are analyzed to determine the next year's survey priorities (NOAA Office of Coast Survey 2012). Professional mariners and surveyors currently acquire hydrographic data and information necessary for the prioritization decision process, but mariners on commercial vessels also acquire useful data during daily operations that can help NOAA assign survey priorities. Crowdsourcing, the phenomenon that allows users and interested parties to volunteer geographic data to create a collaborative dataset and product, is a data source that saves resources while providing information about a vast area of the ocean (Goetz and Zipf 2013). Large commercial and passenger vessels transmit geographically referenced data about their voyage and their ships' characteristics from their required Automatic Identification System (AIS) instrumentation. These data messages, used mainly for navigational collision avoidance, are also collected by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) for law enforcement and traffic pattern assessment purposes (United States Coast Guard 2014a). If these volunteered data could provide information about vessel traffic patterns, ship characteristics, and risk assumed during transit to help set survey priorities and initiate a survey where ships are vulnerable to new seafloor obstructions, it could provide quantitative information used to improve NOAA's hydrographic survey efficiency and ensure resources are used on the highest priorities."}, {"section_title": "Thesis Purpose", "text": "This study examined the feasibility of using crowdsourced maritime data as one variable in a new quantitative approach for the NOAA Office of Coast Survey (OCS) to prioritize and initiate surveys in busy ports. Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) required onboard commercial vessels are important tools aboard ships that contribute to collision avoidance at sea. Along with a vessel's name and location, AIS messages also report characteristics about the vessel such as the vessel type, length, draft, and destination. By analyzing the vessel drafts with charted depths in United States ports and harbors, the under keel clearances experienced by ships during transits were calculated. Under keel clearance is the distance between the bottom of a vessel and the seafloor. This measure, shown in Figure 1, also describes many of the concepts that are used in the methodology and analysis throughout this thesis. Many ports have required minimum under clearances for ships to maintain when transiting into their waters. The percentage of vessels transiting through areas at or near their under keel clearance operational limits can be a valuable variable that can factor into how surveys are prioritized by the OCS each year. This thesis calculated the under keel clearances normalized by vessel draft and conducted a statistical analysis of the normalized under keel clearance values to prove that quantities derived from ship AIS draft data may be useful in future quantitative NOAA OCS survey priority analyses, but not before undergoing extensive quality control processes and further research into the uncertainties inherent to the ship draft inputs."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1 Graphic Representations of Draft, Under Keel Clearance, Charted and Corrected", "text": "Water Depth, and Tide Level"}, {"section_title": "Research Objectives and Methods", "text": "This research project was a first attempt to understand the nature of AIS draft data and how it can be used to quantify risks for United States ports by calculating and comparing under keel clearance values as a percentage of vessel draft for two ports. This was accomplished by applying quality control measures to vessel track lines derived from AIS data: horizontal position correction (GPS error and removing tracks intersecting the shore), and draft value filtering. The minimum charted depth was calculated and corrected for changing tidal conditions using verified observed tide levels. The corrected minimum depths were used in conjunction with the reported draft from each vessel to calculate the under keel clearance. Under keel clearance values were normalized by the reported draft of each vessel, resulting in the percentage of each ship's draft that was left as under keel clearance for the transit through the two case study areas. These draft percentages were then used to classify vessels into low, medium, and high risk categories. The percentages of vessels within these categories were compared and evaluated for their usability as a variable in a future quantitative survey prioritization model."}, {"section_title": "Thesis Organization", "text": "This thesis begins by providing background information on hydrographic surveys and charting in the United States, crowdsourcing as a means of data acquisition, and reviewing several crowdsourcing programs and studies that already exist in the maritime community.

"}, {"section_title": "Hydrographic Survey Priorities", "text": "NOAA's surveys are planned years in advance of data acquisition in order for survey platform logistics to be arranged, background data assembled, and reconnaissance to be performed. Before survey planning can begin, the survey areas must be prioritized (NOAA Office of Coast Survey 2012). Although most of the coastline has already been charted, much of the older survey data are considered to be inadequate; older hydrographic survey techniques such as lead line surveys or single beam sonar surveys inherently have data gaps that might not capture all hazards. Lead line surveys involved dipping a 10-pound weight into the water and measuring the amount of rope deployed when the weight reached the bottom. Similarly, single beam sonar does not provide full bottom coverage like the new multibeam sonar surveys (NOAA Office of Coast Survey 2014). Also, navigation and location technology have advanced in recent decades, leading to increased positional accuracy not achieved before Global Positioning Systems (GPS) was available. Survey prioritization is completed in areas that are deemed \"navigationally significant\", or areas in the EEZ with depths less than the following criteria: -120 ft depth: Atlantic and Pacific coasts, East Gulf of Mexico, North Slope Alaska, Caribbean, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico -300 ft depth: West Gulf of Mexico, West Alaska -600 ft depth: Pacific Islands, Alaska (except for West Alaska) The navigationally significant areas are then prioritized based on: --Shipping trends and tonnage --Age of the last survey --Technology used in the previous survey --Under keel clearance needed for vessels --Potential for previously unknown hazards --Requests from the local community and government agencies After compiling data for these requirements, the coastline is categorized into Critical and Emerging Critical Areas, and areas of Priority 1 through Priority 4. Critical and Emerging Critical are the highest priority, and Priority 4 is the lowest. The Critical and Emerging Critical areas are where high commercial traffic, hazardous cargo, and minimal under keel clearance (the bottom of the vessel is dangerously close to the seafloor) conditions exist. These areas contain the greatest risk factors for maritime incidents. As of 2012, approximately 28,000 square nautical miles were designated Critical areas. About 40% of the Critical and Emerging Critical Areas are located in Alaskan waters (NOAA Office of Coast Survey 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Survey Data Acquisition Resources and Methods", "text": "NOAA's survey fleet is comprised of four hydrographic research ships, one small research survey vessel, and six small navigation response teams. Four of the vessels are large commissioned vessels that sail with fifteen to fifty crewmembers, complete twenty-four hour operations, and sail eight months out of the year. Two of these vessels are shown below in Figure 3 (NOAA Office of Coast Survey 2013b). The small research and navigation response vessels have limited range and can only complete daytime operations, but they can be quickly deployed to areas of need in emergency situations (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2013b). Multibeam sonar can cover a wider swath of the sea floor than single beam sonar because multiple beams of sound energy are projected at once in a swath pattern underneath the survey vessel. Instead of receiving one sounding per sonar 'ping', some sonar can receive nearly 100 data points fanned out across the bottom, covering a much larger area of the sea floor in comparison with single beam techniques (NOAA Office of Coast Survey 2014). Instead of using range detection from sonar pulses to determine water depths, side scan sonar uses sound to detect objects and obstructions on the sea floor. The sonar is usually towed behind a vessel instead of being attached to its hull. The beams of energy are directed to the side of the sonar in order to hit the sea floor and any objects at a steep angle. The returned energy is interpreted as an image. Shadows can be seen in the imagery, indicating the sonar has detected an object protruding above the sea floor. This principle is demonstrated in Figure 5. Because the sonar is towed and the sonar beams are not angled straight down, depth information cannot be derived from a side scan sonar's data (NOAA Office of Coast Survey 2014). The project instructions that accompany each NOAA survey assignment specify how and where each survey method will be conducted in the survey area.

Crowdsourcing is a bottom-up approach to acquiring data on a subject instead of a top-down acquisition scheme (Aitamurto et al. 2011). Professionals and members of the general public create and contribute data based on their own measurements and experiences. OpenStreetMap is one example of a well-known geospatial crowdsourcing project. Informed users are able to add details to online maps, filling in data gaps that may exist in the information already available (Goodchild 2007).

Quality control of crowdsourced data is an evolving subject that can be viewed in several different ways. Elwood, Goodchild, and Sui (2013) explain that there are three main methodologies to approaching crowdsourced data quality: consensus, moderated, and geographic. The consensus approach verifies crowdsourced data by involving as many reviewers and contributors as possible. The more data points there are, the more likely there will be a consensus around the correct answer. The moderated approach relies on trusted sources to review and verify data. The geographic approach assesses quality based on the spatial relationships of whatever topic is being studied. This framework is used to assess quality of AIS derived draft and under keel clearance data in this study. reported drafts that were deeper than the length of the ship (Harati-Mokhtari et al. 2007).

Sampath and Parry's study revolved around using AIS point data to tease out meaningful information from the vast datasets they had available to draw conclusions about the types of vessels transiting through New Zealand waters. This study focused on ferries, passenger vessels, and high speed watercraft. These particular classifications were studied because their high rate of speed and ability to carry large numbers of passengers; these factors add an element of risk to any potential casualties at sea (Sampath and Parry 2013). Much like this proposed AIS draft study, Sampath and Parry first dealt with the data management aspect of working with AIS data. Since the AIS messages in the study were collected every minute, millions of points accumulated over a short period of time in a small area. The team separated the AIS raw data sets into smaller temporal data sets to make the file sizes manageable. The raw AIS messages were then decoded and checked for errors and duplicate messages. This step was not necessary in this thesis because data were provided by NOAA and the USCG and they were already decoded and available in shapefile, geodatabase, and tabular formats. The data sets chosen for this study were limited to a 2GB file size so ArcGIS could handle the analyses. Sampath and Perry's trajectory study used analytical tools in ArcGIS to calculate speed profiles for the different classes of vessels and study the characteristics of ships at anchor. The study concluded that movement patterns of vessels could be computed from spatial and temporal analyses, providing valuable insight into the patterns of vessel transits (Sampath and Parry 2013). This trajectory study encountered many of the same challenges that were experienced in this proposed AIS project, making it an excellent case to examine. A Finnish research team developed a method to monitor marine traffic exhaust emissions using AIS data (Jalkanen et al. 2009). According to the authors, the results of their study can be used as a tool to make health and emissions policy decisions. For example, aerosol emissions, usually sulphate particles, pose health risks to residents of highly trafficked coastal areas such as along the English Channel and along the East Coast of the United States. The team created the Ship Traffic Emission Assessment Model (STEAM) to assess ship emissions pollution in the Baltic Sea. Using this model, AIS data are used to determine the position of vessels, their identification, and the speed at which they are sailing. The model then can match vessels with a volunteered engine and emissions profile database. The speed of the vessels also contributes to the engine operation information, leading to an estimate of the emissions at certain speeds. Wave data are also used in the STEAM model to help estimate the amount of ship fuel consumption in different sea conditions. The limitations of the Jalkanen et al. study were mainly related to the ship and engine characteristics. Where possible, data regarding the engine and fuel were input into the database using parameters volunteered from the ship owner or from the Lloyd's database, which tracks information about commercial vessels. If these data were not available, assumptions were made about the engine based on the environmental conditions it faced at the time. The composition of the particulates at certain vessel speeds was an estimated value as well, although based on experiments on large commercial vessels. Although the STEAM model proved to have limitations and inherent uncertainty built in, the study successfully used AIS data to prove that monitoring commercial ship traffic pollution is possible using crowdsourced data. Due to the high frequency of position reports via AIS, the authors concluded that the temporal and spatial resolution of their study was satisfactory for studying shipping and emissions trends. Chinese researchers similarly studied real-time pollution from ship emissions and polluting discharge using AIS data (Qian et al. 2011). The group developed a real-time monitoring system that can track ships discharging hazardous waste such as oil, fuel, or other pollutants. The system can also display historical pollution data, perform statistical analyses, and run predictive models during events like oil spills to direct authorities to the most likely areas where cleanup and mitigation will be needed. The entire model is based on AIS data. AIS data are input and decoded, then fed into predictive models for pollution from vessels (atmospheric and hydrologic diffusion models) and how the pollution will move within individual harbors. Given all of this demonstrated value in AIS data, the NOAA Office of Coast Survey has already started to use AIS positional data to identify areas of heavy traffic in support of updating nautical charts. NOAA's Arctic Nautical Charting Plan, released in February of 2013, includes one example of the use of AIS data. The positional data derived from AIS provided information about the shipping and transit trends in remote locations in Alaska and the Arctic. NOAA scientists confirmed that most arctic shipping and travel occurs during the summer, mainly from June through August using AIS point data and ship track lines. Analysts proposed using these temporal and spatial trends to prioritize and update arctic nautical charts (NOAA Office of Coast Survey 2013a)."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Hydrographic survey prioritization takes many factors into account to plan the most efficient use of government resources, survey assets, and time to protect the life and property of sailors at sea and support international maritime commerce.

Los Angeles had 23 commercial vessel terminals while the Port of Norfolk in Hampton Roads had 8 terminals. Since Los Angeles had nearly three times the number of terminals of Norfolk and the added passenger vessel traffic to Catalina Island, the near six-fold difference in vessel traffic was expected.

Thus to take the possibility of positional inaccuracies into account, a polygon was created that buffered each track line horizontally by 5.0 meters (16.4 feet). Five meters was chosen as the buffer distance to capture the average accuracy of marine GPS units, while maintaining a conservative estimate of accuracy. By creating polygons that represent a buffered line with uncertainty, positional errors difficult to detect such as poor satellite geometry or temporary loss of signal are captured in assuming that a ship may not exist at a certain point, but instead in a circle of uncertainty at any given time in the study. Portions of the buffered track line polygons are displayed in Figure 15."}, {"section_title": "Figure 15 Hampton Roads and Los Angeles Buffered Vessel Track Line Polygons by Reported Draft", "text": "Finally, all retained track lines and buffered track line polygons, which represented lines with GPS uncertainty, were clipped to the extents of the available bathymetry so calculations of minimum water depth could be calculated. Segments of the lines and buffer polygons outside the bathymetric surface would not have a water depth for comparison and would report an inaccurate minimum water depth. These procedures addressed the horizontal accuracy of GPS receivers and prepared the track line data to be corrected for changes in the environment: tidal data creating positional errors in the vertical direction."}, {"section_title": "Water Level Correction", "text": "Additional data was needed to correct the position of the track lines in the vertical dimension because it could not be addressed by GPS uncertainty corrections made by the twodimensional surface created by buffered track line polygons. The height of the tides in both case studies constantly changes throughout the day. While the tidal level does not significantly impact the operations of vessels with shallow drafts, the tides can play a large role in the decision-making process of large vessels such as tankers and cargo vessels that operate near the depth limits of the port. The forecast tide levels determine how much cargo is loaded onto these vessels and when they can plan to enter and exit port. During the Hampton Roads study period, the minimum observed tide was 0.213 meters below the mean lower low water datum and the maximum was 1.402 meters above mean lower low water. In the Los Angeles/Long Beach study, the minimum tide level was 0.473 meters below mean lower low water and the maximum was 2.15 meters above the mean lower low tidal datum. The tidal corrections to the bathymetric data minimized the uncertainty associated with the natural cyclical daily change of the water levels, but could not address other environmental conditions such as ocean swell, which impacts each ship differently. Verified NOAA tides were used to correct the minimum water depth values that ships experienced during their transits through the case study ports. Because both the verified tide values and the bathymetric surfaces were referenced to the mean lower low tidal datum, the tide values could be added to the charted water depth to obtain the actual water depth values during ship transit. For any ship position within the study area, the tide correction values, determined by using the time of day the ship track line entered the study area, were added to the charted mean lower low water depths. The values in Table 3 demonstrate the majority of track lines in Hampton Roads that were removed were due to incorrect draft values, and not due to inaccurate positions. In Los Angeles the track lines removed for positional errors nearly equaled those removed for draft errors. Although AIS data are internationally mandated for commercial vessels, there is little oversight or regulation, resulting in a dataset that has noise and errors such as the ones removed in this quality control process.

The deep draft channels are dredged, and outside the channels the bathymetry is also flat and deep, with the exception of the terminal, channel marker, and breakwater structures.

This difference can be accounted for by the extra 5 meter buffer area on either side of the track line. When maneuvering in narrow channels, areas of rapidly changing depths, or near manmade structures, more vessels are likely to show shallower Zcor depths than from the original track lines alone.

The tanker category is similar to cargo, including hazardous classifications, future use, and tankers without other information.

Similar to the Hampton Roads cargo vessels, the tankers also displayed greater high-risk UKC% values than the entirety of vessels in the case study.

The buffered lines for cargo vessels only also reflected the results of the non-buffered lines, but minor differences were seen in this data set. This result was expected because a positional error of 5 meters can place a ship inside or outside of a navigational channel or into water depths too shallow for a vessel's draft. Cargo vessels generally operated in areas that did not have great seafloor slopes, so a 5 meter positional error did not have an significant effect on the Zcor values or UKC%.

The extra 5 meter horizontal position difference could have changed the depth of the Zcor, caused the UKC% to decrease, and increased the risk the vessel took during its transit.

The percentages of risk for tug and tow vessels are nearly the same in both ports, suggesting these vessels do not contribute significant risk to the ports and also may not as important as the larger vessels when studying hydrographic survey priorities. More ports will need to be added to the study to draw definite conclusions about the significance of this finding. research is necessary to understand the nature of the draft errors in order to correct them during the QC process and decrease the number of erroneous negative UKC% results.

Further research and understanding into the uncertainty of AIS draft data may help hydrographers determine how UKC% values contribute to a future quantitative survey prioritization model.

When the UKC% results were categorized by vessel type, 12% of cargo vessels, 15% of tankers, and 11% of tug and towing vessels had high risk UKC% values during their transits. These values are expected due to the nature of their operations and the gradual slope of the bathymetry in Hampton Roads. Most of the vessels entering this port operate within safe UKC% limits for their vessel drafts. These results were mirrored in the UKC% results for the Hampton Roads buffered track line polygons, which expanding the radius for Zcor data around the individual track lines to account for typical GPS uncertainty. There was a slight shift of UKC% percentages towards the higher risk categories because when transiting near sloping bathymetry or near the edge of a channel, shallower depths will be chosen to the Zcor values compared with the Zcor values directly beneath the vessel. The Los Angeles case study had different results in comparison with Hampton Roads. Los Angeles had significantly fewer vessels transiting with high risk UKC% values; only 1% of all vessels left 0-10% UKC% during the transit. Less than 2% of cargo vessels and only 4% of tanker vessels operated with high risk UKC% results. Tug and towing vessels also had very low values: less than 2% had UKC% percentages between 0 and 10%. The distribution of UKC% for the Los Angeles buffered track line polygons also mirrored the values of the original tracks, indicating that there were no significant advantages to performing the analysis for polygons in areas with gently sloping bathymetry. The additional track line analysis using Zcor values demonstrated that unless more information about the individual vessels, Zcor is a less valuable factor for determining survey priorities than UKC%. For it to be useful, Zcor data must be used in conjunction with large assumptions of ship dimensions, while AIS data does not need assumptions -only quality control and measures of uncertainty. The analytical techniques used in this chapter demonstrate that using AIS data in conjunction with bathymetry can provide additional information beyond traffic density analyses. The final chapter will discuss the challenges with using AIS data, suggestions for using UKC% derived from AIS and bathymetry, and possible future research."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 5: DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "AIS data are gaining traction in the scientific community as a means of studying vessel traffic patterns, aiding in environmental studies, and assessing operational risks of vessels. Despite the growing us of AIS for research, studies that use vessel data manually entered and volunteered by ship personnel must be used carefully. The AIS data reporting parameters derived from GPS have been studied and found to have high levels of accuracy (Januszewski 2014), but the human element incorporates a new level of uncertainty that is difficult to quantify and predict based on the nature of errors and the dynamic nature of ships. The uncertainty in ship draft data makes it necessary for extensive data quality control and corrections to be completed in order for the data to be useful and as accurate as possible for assessing hydrographic survey priorities. Chapter 5 discusses the inherent errors and uncertainty of the UKC% results for the case studies, suggests how AIS draft data should be used for setting hydrographic survey priorities, and makes recommendations for future research into crowdsourced AIS data for hydrographic purposes."}, {"section_title": "Data Errors and Verification", "text": "The most significant problem with using AIS data for hydrographic studies is the human factor. In most of the cases the GPS data can be trusted, as confirmed by the small number of track lines that were eliminated during the quality control process when vessel tracks intersected the charted shoreline. The vessel attribute information is a large source of errors. The reported values such as ship's draft and type of vessel are manually input by the crew of the vessel. In conversations held with professional mariners during the US Hydro 2015 conference, deck officers stated that these parameters were buried within menus in AIS units and were hardly ever changed during the standard operating procedures for their vessels when getting underway or entering port. In addition to the infrequency of updating vessel information in the AIS unit, it is easy for a mariner to enter incorrect information into the fields necessary for this study: draft and vessel/cargo type. Metric units are the international standard for draft, length, and beam information in AIS, but it is evident from the data that these standards and guidelines are not always followed. In the dataset studied in these two cases, multiple vessels were removed from the dataset from having unreasonably high drafts. Incorrect vessel characteristics can also be entered in error by pushing incorrect buttons. NOAA's LTJG Anthony Klemm explained that in many cases mariners enter their draft information using the incorrect units or attempt to enter a string of numbers that should include values after a decimal point. Since the AIS unit only allows whole number entries, these types of draft entries are much larger than reality (for example 1.2 meters would display as 12 meters). These errors are difficult to detect and correct because they are inconsistent and vary based on the individual ship. Draft data and vessel characteristics may be communicated by the ships' masters and mates directly to the harbormaster and pilots, the authorities responsible for ship routing and safe navigation into and out of ports. With the direct line of communication, there is less emphasis on the AIS draft information and ship crews may not see the importance in keeping these values in their AIS unites accurate or up to date as they change. Although the vessel type should not need to be changed during a cruise or while getting underway, the vessel type is also information that is directly input by ship crew, which allows the possibility for additional errors in AIS datasets. If the ship crew is not diligent or detail-oriented enough to input the correct category of vessel, they might not input the correct length or draft of the vessel either. The inconsistent nature of errors associated with the human component of crowdsourced AIS data makes a great deal of human intervention necessary to create a quality dataset; even a complex set of automated controls may not catch all possible errors. Verification is needed for the results calculated from the AIS and bathymetry datasets, but at present additional data and resources are not available to perform any quantitative validation. Not having any quality measures built into the AIS, it is impossible to verify the actual quality of the AIS attributes. Therefore, instead of employing a quantitative verification process for this project, it was necessary to rely on expert review to confirm the quality of the results, as suggested by Fonte (2015). The data ingested and produced, and the results generated were reviewed by two subject matter experts within the NOAA OCS: Lucy Hick and LTJG Anthony Klemm. In personal conversations, Ms. Hick and LTJG Klemm provided guidance during the planning, execution and review stages of the project. They confirmed that quantitative verification is not possible at this time and further study is needed (Hick 2015). LTJG Klemm indicated that the negative UKC and UKC% values are an inherent problem that needs to be addressed in the AIS draft data when NOAA moves forward to use AIS attribute data in operations and in studies such as those which might incorporate quantitative methods into the hydrographic survey prioritization process in the future (Klemm 2015). In Elwood, Sui, and Goodchild's (2013) crowdsourcing quality assurance framework, the geographic approach the one used here, as lines were removed and decisions were made based on geographic locations and spatial relationships."}, {"section_title": "Data Error Solutions", "text": "One possible solution for the need for strict, in-depth quality control is to determine if the harbormasters and USCG keep a detailed database of ship characteristics and add the correct draft values to the dataset using the ship MMSI numbers. This solution may be possible for larger ports where VTS exists and where pilots are mandatory for larger vessels. Data on smaller vessels may not exist. The original MMSI numbers would also be necessary for this solution: to protect the individual identities of ships, the USCG scrambled MMSI numbers used in this study. In addition to acquiring supplementary ship characteristics from sources other than AIS, additional education for mariners may help improve the quality of vessel attribute information in AIS. In the past AIS data has not been regularly used outside of the maritime industry. As it becomes more popular and useful for the scientific community and other industries, more entities will examine the data and create a greater need for accurate information. If international bodies such as the International Maritime Organization set stricter educational requirements for mariners, data quality may begin to improve over time. Removing the human element to crowdsourced AIS data is also a possible long-term solution. Adding sensors into the data stream to report the instantaneous draft would remove errors from the system. Such an initiative that would need discussion between electronics companies and the USCG, which helps set standards for AIS transmissions. By adding an additional field to the AIS message, the automatically collected draft could be added into the automatic transmission by reading in a simple NMEA string, a standard electronics message format from the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) from a ship's calibrated fathometer and report the actual draft or even the under keel clearance at the time of the message (National Marine Electronics Association 2015). This would eliminate a significant contributor to the calculated UKC% uncertainty."}, {"section_title": "Using AIS-derived UKC for Survey Prioritization", "text": "Despite the inherent errors and uncertainty associated with the vessel characteristics of AIS data, the dataset can still provide valuable information for hydrographers and can help quantify risk for setting hydrographic survey priorities. Using the number and percentages of vessels in negative, high, and moderate risk UKC% categories can help assign relative risk levels. As seen in this comparison between Hampton Roads and Los Angeles, two prominent deep draft vessel ports with VTS control, measurable differences in the numbers and percentages of risk level assumed by vessels can identified using the combination of traffic patterns and bathymetry. This comparison can be difficult to quantify using the previous prioritization approach that depends upon factors such the age of bathymetry and ship density. By including the ship draft information, even including errors the analysis can provide valuable information that can be included in the hydrographic survey planning decision process. As models are developed by NOAA to set survey priorities, the percentages of risk categories may be included to set the total operational risk of the port. Although UKC% is an important factor, because of the errors and uncertainty in data, it should be weighted accordingly, taking the uncertainty and importance of other factors into consideration. Similar to UKC%, Zcor data can be useful if it is properly broken down into specific categories of draft and vessel class. Understanding that the vessels conducting commerce and conveying passengers are at the most risk, these categories should be the main focus. The relative comparison of Zcor values of vessel categories may be included in the final hydrographic survey decisional model, but will be more difficult to use because draft must also be factored in to complete more extensive quality control. UKC% is a better variable to add into a model because the value and analysis already factors in the draft of vessels and is scaled to assess risk with the same criteria. Zcor values help establish trends, but when using this approach the track lines still require several extra steps of quality control and vessel/draft classification as compared with the UKC% analysis. Further study is needed to bring to light the human errors found in the AIS vessel attribute data and to determine how the UKC% and Zcor data can be incorporated into a quantitative model for NOAA OCS. Although studies have been conducted examining the error rates in crowdsourced AIS data variables, additional information is needed about the specific nature of the errors in AIS draft data to gain insight into how these errors may be identified and either filtered or corrected. One possible study could leverage the aid of harbormasters and USCG VTS in specific ports to query ships entering their ports for their MMSI number and actual draft at the time of port entry. Over a period of several months the reported draft data could be compared with the AIS draft and additional information about draft error may be determined. It is likely that draft errors vary from port-to-port and season-to-season based on the types of vessels that transit in and out of port and where the vessels are traveling. If the errors are found to be consistent, a correction factor may be discovered and use to correct the AIS draft data when it is used in a new survey prioritization model. As crowdsourced AIS data are used more regularly as a source of information for shorebased operations and studies, as opposed to collision avoidance at sea, the international maritime community is likely to respond to the uncertainties inherent in the volunteered data and help increase the accuracy and credibility through awareness and training. Draft data from AIS messages is valuable to the hydrographic survey community despite the errors that exist."}]
