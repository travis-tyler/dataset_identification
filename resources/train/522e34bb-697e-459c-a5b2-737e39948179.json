Without subsidies, the investment necessary for college is a \u2026xed amount across households. Even with subsidies, the outcomes generated by this large and uncertain investment are income streams that do not depend on initial wealth, but rather are of given absolute size. For standard preferences, this implies that poor households will be less willing to attempt college, all else equal, than their wealthier counterparts. In turn, such households will remain poorer over generations, making subsequent generations even less willing to take the risk. Therefore, cross-sectional inequality will be larger, and intergenerational incomes more persistent, than they would otherwise be.\nSubsidies reduce the cost of taking the risk of investing in human capital. In turn, collegiate investment becomes more acceptable, especially to low wealth households. More widespread college investment may improve allocations in several ways. First, there is strong evidence that college-educated parents have relatively better prepared children. For example, Ishitani and DesJardins (2002) , Warburton et. al. (2001) , Chen (2001) , and Nunez and Horn (2000) all document the presence of strong \"1-st generation\" (students whose parents did not complete college) e\u00a4ects, even after controlling for family income. Therefore, the e\u00a4ects of subsidies are likely to extend beyond the lifetime of an individual. Second, as Ljungqvist (1995) has argued, a high skill premium implies that collegiate outcomes can result in large changes in consumption and wealth accumulation. Subsidies can increase unskilled wages and lower skilled wages by encouraging more people to attend college, thereby compressing the skill premium and lowering the consequences of collegiate failure. Third, it is known from Aiyagari (1994) that stationary equilibria in environments with uninsurable risks display overinvestment in physical capital in the sense that the interest rate will be strictly below the rate of time preference. Education subsides lower this excess capital via two di\u00a4erent channels. First, subsidies decrease the private cost of education investment. Therefore, households do not have to save large amounts against the possibility of having college-ready children. Second, subsidies leave households better able to gamble on a college investment when children of uncertain ability arrive, thereby lowering the precautionary demand for assets. Lastly, a lower level of capital stock raises the rate of return on savings, which in turn improves consumption smoothing. However, the bene\u2026ts above require bearing two potentially large types of costs. First, subsidies generate adverse selection by encouraging progressively more poorly prepared students to attend. Second, subsidies must be \u2026nanced via taxation and when markets are incomplete, even lump-sum taxes are distortionary.\nIn this paper, we ask the following question. How does higher education subsidy policy a\u00a4ect welfare, the skill premium, inequality, output, and the dynamics of the intergener-ational earnings process? We \u2026nd that observed collegiate subsidies improve welfare sub stantially relative to the fully decentralized (zero subsidy) outcome. Subsidies help smooth consumption, lower skill premia, increase interest rates as precautionary savings fall, lower the inequality of both consumption and wealth, and increase intergenerational income mo bility. We \u2026nd also that mean consumption rises with subsidies even though physical capital shrinks. This occurs as the increase in human capital raises steady state output and average consumption. Our model thus quanti\u2026es the extent of underinvestment in risky human cap ital emerging from current and proposed subsidy rates. In our benchmark case, risky human capital accumulation falls well short of the welfare maximizing value. The risk of failure in college is by itself su\u00a2cient to explain subsidies to college education observed in the U.S. and other OECD countries. The largest welfare gains from subsidies occur at rates below 40%, with much smaller gains from further subsidization. This feature provides insight into why OECD countries simultaneously display both uniformly high subsidies as well as the absence of explicit private insurance against failure: additional insurance, private or public, is not very useful. An important feature of our study is that we focus on the role of subsidies in mitigating risk arising in the acquisition of human capital. We therefore shut down other sources of bene\u2026ts from subsidies, such as externalities and endogenous growth. We also do not impose credit constraints on student loans, as the U.S. government provides full loan guarantees on college loans via such programs as PLUS. Interestingly, despite removing most obstacles to \u2026nancing college, the government continues to subsidize it heavily.\nIn the U.S. and other OECD nations, college education is a risky investment. Using NLSY data, Altonji (1993) \u2026nds that of high school students intending to complete college in 1972, 90% did enroll, yet only 58.1% had completed seven years later. The risk of failure is also present for the seemingly well-prepared. For example, at colleges classi\u2026ed as \"Highly Selective\" by the ACT, the dropout rate averages roughly 19%. More striking is that even among those with both standardized test scores and family incomes in the top quintile, the drop-out rate does not fall to zero, but only to about 10% (NCES 1999) . In recent work, Chen (2001) \u2026nds that roughly 16% of 1997 high-school graduates with test scores in the top quartile did not even attempt college. Estimates of Willis (1986) and Card (1995) , for example, show the rate of return on college to be between 8% and 13%, a signi\u2026cantly higher rate than on \u2026nancial assets. Given the risks, it appears that a portion of this high rate of return is a risk premium, and Chen (2001) estimates the risk premium associated with a four-year college education to be one-fourth of the total return.\nCollege is also a lumpy investment. First, most students who fail to complete college do so only after spending a substantial amount of time enrolled. NCES data show that while the dropout rate exceeds 10% in the \u2026rst year, it is even higher at the end of the second year, and is still nontrivial, at over 5%, in the third and fourth years of college. 2 "}, {"section_title": "Stinebrickner and", "text": "Stinebrickner (2001) use a di\u00a4erent dataset and \u2026nd that the median time to dropping out is two years. Worse yet is that dropping out, even after several years in college, is typically very damaging. Hungerford and Solon (1987) , and Card and Kreuger (1992) both \u2026nd that returns are highest in the later years of college, and substantially greater than those obtained in the \u2026rst two years. The risky and lumpy nature of investment in college may therefore be dissuading even talented high-school completers from attempting college at all, implying systematic underinvestment in human capital. These individual-level risks are re \u2021ected in aggregate tertiary education failure rates in the OECD that exceed 30%. Data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) shows that for the U.S., the unconditional dropout rate was approximately 37% for the period 1993-1998. Given the lumpiness in collegiate investment, failure is very costly. With respect to size, in the U.S., for example, the median resource cost of college in tuition and fees, room, and board exceeds $60,000."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "Even beyond this large explicit cost of college, the opportunity cost of lost wages is large, at approximately $17,000 per full-time student annually in the U.S. 4 Also, the current wage premium for college education of 1.6 implies very large di\u00a4erences in mean lifetime income between those who complete college and those who do not.\nThere is typically only a narrow window of time available for college education, as the opportunity cost rises sharply with age, as households form and children are produced.\nFor example, Cameron and Heckman (2001) show that approximately 90% of college entry occurs, if at all, within two years of completing high school. It is also not easy to overcome an initial failure in college via re-enrollment at a later time, nor is it costless to delay entry. Ahlburg et al. (2002) \u2026nd that even after accounting for endogeneity in the decision to delay college entrance, the likelihood of dropout rises by 32% for high school graduates who postpone college entry. In such an environment, relatively poor families-even those with wellprepared children, may choose not to send them to invest in a risky college education, even if student loans are assumed to be comprehensive enough to allow all households to feasibly do so. Such outcomes exacerbate cross-sectional inequality and endogenous intergenerational persistence in income and wealth.\nIn addition to the risk faced by those trying acquire a college education, U.S. households appear to bear a considerable amount of uninsurable idiosyncratic labor income risk. The 2 Levhari and Weiss (1974) note that \"In fact, the length of schooling itself may be random, since the ability to complete a given schooling program is also to some extent unknown\" (footnote 1, p. 951). However, they do not model this source of uncertainty in their analysis, whereas this is a key aspect of our study.\n3 NCES (1999) . 4 National Center for Education Statistics (NCES, www.nces.ed.gov).\nempirical tests of Cochrane (1991) , Hayashi, Altonji, and Kotliko\u00a4 (1996), and Carroll (2000) all document strong departures from complete risk sharing, both between and even within families. The research of Levhari and Weiss (1974) and that of Eaton and Rosen (1980) , and Hamilton (1987) emphasizes the uncertainty in returns to human capital, and the associated di\u00a2culties in diversi\u2026cation of such risk. The long-run implications of uninsurable risk are explored in recent work by Castaneda et al. (1999) , Diaz-Jimenez, et al. (1997), and DiNardi (2000) . These authors show that the high income and wealth inequality observed in the U.S.\ncan be plausibly accounted for by parsimonious, incomplete market models, with exogenously speci\u2026ed earnings processes. One indirect contribution of this paper is that, in analyzing subsidies, we endogenize the mean of the household earnings processes by allowing household to choose skills in response to stochastic income shocks, educational risk, skill premia, and subsidies.\nThe environment we develop is most closely related to that of Caucutt and Kumar (2003) and Restuccia and Urrutia (2002) ."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "Caucutt and Kumar (2003) study a model with het erogeneity in ability, and \u2026nd that subsidies have modest e\u00a4ects on educational attainment and welfare. Restuccia and Urrutia (2002) study an environment that distinguishes between pre-college and college investment. Early investments are found to have the largest e\u00a4ects on intergenerational persistence, with college investments accounting for most of the ob served inequality in earnings. There are important di\u00a4erences between our work and both of the preceding papers. First, Caucutt and Kumar (2003) and Restuccia and Urrutia (2002) prohibit borrowing to \u2026nance education. Recent work of Cameron and Heckman (1999) , Heckman and Carneiro (2002) , and Keane and Wolpin (2001) \u2026nds that borrowing con straints do not appear to a\u00a4ect college enrollment decisions. Therefore, we always allow individuals to borrow to pay for college tuition, room, and board, even though households face (state-dependent) limits on their overall debt. Second, we follow Levhari and Weiss (1974) , Eaton and Rosen (1980) , Hamilton (1987) , Chen (2002) , and others in assuming that human capital, once acquired, produces uncertain returns. Furthermore, we limit income insurance possibilities to self-insurance via capital accumulation.

Section 3 de\u2026nes equilibrium and Section 4, the welfare measure. We parameterize the model in Section 5.\nWe discuss the results in Section 6, and conclude in Section 7.

Seshadri and Yuki (2001) examine both need-based transfers and educational transfers in a model of investment in a child's education when ability is not clearly known. 7 These include Jacobs and VanWijnbergen (2001), as well as Wigger and von Weizacker (2001) . Our approach is also indirectly related to a larger literature, including Becker and Tomes (1986) , Glomm and Ravikumar (1992) , Tomes (1981) , Loury (1981) , Banerjee and Newman (1991) , Galor and Zeira (1993 shock \u00b2 from the unconditional distribution of productivity.\nYoung agents are the representative decision makers for the family/dynasty."}, {"section_title": "10", "text": "Agents are young for only one period, and in subsequent periods are referred to as \"adults\".

Importantly, we follow Ljungqvist (1993), Caucutt and Kumar (2002), and Fernandez and Rogerson (1995) and assume that college education is a discrete, lumpy investment that cannot be done partially.\n8 See for example, www.ed.gov, for a description of the PLUS loan program, which explicitly allows parents to borrow to \u2026nance a dependent child's college education. These loans are not capped in amount. 9 The process of primary and high school education is not central here and children are modeled as arriving having completed high school. 10 Heuristically, the parents should be thought of living even after their high-school educated child arrives, as is realistic. However, because we are concerned here with the college education decision of the young agent, we abstract from parents solving another decision problem. 11 While it will allow a reduction in the size of the state vector for the household, the probabilistic arrival of children in the model will not play a substantive role in our results. While the production (arrival) of children may be deterministic, the production of college ready children (as in the model) is certainly not.\nNCES data show that over 30% of high-school completers are \"marginally\" quali\u2026ed or \"unquali\u2026ed\" for college. that students may supply positive hours of labor while also a full time student, we allow them to supply \u00c0 < 1 units of unskilled labor while in college."}, {"section_title": "Schooling and Information on Ability", "text": "Our environment features adverse selection as Young agents are di\u00a4erentially informed as to the likelihood of successfully completing college. At the beginning of the period, all young agents receive a signal I, drawn from a probability distribution \u00ba (I), which determines the information young agents have on their likelihood of success if they attempt college. The signal divides the population of young agents into three groups, denoted by I =fI s ; I f ; U Ig, and is i.i.d across households and over time. In reality, some high-school completers do not meet college admission standards, and so will not be able to attend college, and are therefore irrelevant to our study. Let I f denote the set of households who know they will fail in college with probability one. Conversely, we denote by I s the set of \"informed\" households who know that they will succeed with probability one. Thus, the I s and I f groups represent the right and left tails of the distribution of collegiate preparedness, respectively.\nThe remainder of households are \"uninformed\", denoted UI, and are those facing uncer tainty with respect to collegiate success.

In order to remain conservative in our approach strictly 12 Allowing greater heterogeneity in preparedness to enrich the representation of adverse selection is pos sible, but would result in more parameters than calibration targets. Furthermore, such a model would also contain a positive selection e\u00a4ect among well-prepared but poor non-1-st generation students. This latter e\u00a4ect will act as an o\u00a4setting force to adverse selection. We therefore restrict heterogeniety in ex-ante pre paredness to these four groups as our calibration will remain disciplined by observable dropout rates among groups well identi\u2026ed in the data.\nand avoid generating welfare gains by easing liquidity constraints via subsidies, we treat the probabilities of failure as primitive to the household, and unrelated to tuition levels. Empiri cal support for this restriction is found in Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2002) , who study a novel experiment whereby a 100% tuition subsidy was given to students at a Kentucky col lege. They found that even with full subsidization, failure di\u00a4erentials among income groups persisted, suggesting that \"home-environment\" e\u00a4ects are important. 13 Given that the skill premium strongly ties income di\u00a4erentials to education di\u00a4erentials, the law of motion for college preparedness is kept simple: U I children of skilled parents will be relatively better prepared, with \u00b8 = \u00b8s, with \u00b8s <\u00b8u.\n14 Adverse selection is generated in the model by the presence of less-prepared 1-st genera tion students enrolling in response to subsidies. The latter turn out to respond much more to changes in subsidies than rich non-1st generation students. In turn, overall dropout rates increase, especially among 1st-generation households. However, as the government must balance its budget, the cost of subsidy programs arising from adverse selection is explicitly accounted for in our framework."}, {"section_title": "The Timing of Failure", "text": "A critical issue is when the uncertainty regarding collegiate success or failure resolves itself.\nThat is, do college dropouts fail immediately and costlessly, or must they wait for a fairly long period in order to learn that they will not be able to successfully complete college? The former entails smaller costs for the individual and the government, relative to the latter. We denote by \u00b5\u00b0 2 [0; 1], the fraction of the total available time that is required for U I households to \u2026nd out whether they will succeed or fail. Note that the fraction \u00b5\u00b0 is equivalent to the fraction of the private cost of college that must be paid before uncertainty resolves. If \u00b5\u00b0 = 1, households must pay the entire private cost of college to learn whether they will fail or not.\nConversely, if \u00b5\u00b0 = 0, it is costless to learn about collegiate success, and there is no insurance role for subsidies. In the intermediate cases, for \u00b5\u00b0 2 (0; 1), there is a potentially nontrivial trade-o\u00a4. When \u00b5\u00b0 approaches 0, the insurance bene\u2026ts of subsidies fall, but so do the costs of \u2026nancing such programs via distortionary taxes. Conversely, when uncertainty resolves 13 Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2002) also contains additional references documenting incomedependent home-environment e\u00a4ects. They note however that college students from low-income families may still respond to sho cks to their families (perhaps parental sickness or unemployment) by returning home. Ex-ante, the risk of such events, to the extent that they lead to attrition from college, implies completion risk, just as failure for any other reason would. 14 For agents who are informed, \u00b8 is trivially pinned down. In the case of the informed young agent who will succeed for sure, i.e., I =I s , it is clear that \u00b8 = \u00b8u = \u00b8s = 0. Similarly, when an agent is sure to fail, i.e., I =I f , it is clear that \u00b8 = \u00b8u = \u00b8s = 1.

If enrolled, they become skilled in period t + 1.\nInformed agents who will fail with certainty (I = I f ) do not enroll in college, and remain unskilled for the rest of their life.\n(c) Uninformed (UI) agents decide whether or not to enroll in college.\nIf enrolled, they pay a fraction \u00b5\u00b0 of the cost of college, where \u00b5\u00b0 2 [0; 1], after which the uncertainty of \u2026nishing college education, \u00b4 is resolved.\n(d) If the agent is successful, she pays the remaining fraction 1 \u00a1 \u00b5\u00b0 of the private cost of college \u00b0;\nin period t+1, and becomes skilled. Otherwise, young agent drops out from college, and stays unskilled.\nvery slowly, with \u00b5\u00b0 approaching 1, the insurance bene\u2026ts of subsidies grow relatively large, but so do the distortions arising from the taxes needed to \u2026nance college.\nIf informed of success, young agents continue their college education by paying the rest of the college cost, (1 \u00a1 \u00b5\u00b0 )\u00b0. If informed of failure, young agents drop out of college and continue as an unskilled agent in the next period. The timing of payments for college among the uninformed (U I) is set to capture the idea that failing students will typically pay only a fraction of the total private cost of college, as they dropout before completing all coursework, as well as to separate the time before, and time after, information revelation without imposing a sub-period in the model.

Subsidies to college education improve welfare substantially relative to the fully decentralized allocation. Additionally, subsidies in excess of those observed in the U.S appear to be welfare improving, given plausi ble measures of failure risk, although the gains from subsidies beyond rates seen in the U.S.\nare only modest. We \u2026nd that increased subsidies lower skill premia, increase interest rates (as precautionary savings fall), lower the variability and inequality of both consumption and wealth, and increase intergenerational income mobility.\nOur \u2026ndings are robust with respect to the timing of the resolution of collegiate uncer tainty, \u00b5\u00b0 , and the process used for labor income risk. We study four cases for the resolution of uncertainty and \"lumpiness\" of college. In particular, we set \u00b5\u00b0 = f0:25; 0:375; 0:50; 0:75g, which represents 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 years of enrollment respectively before the outcome of col lege investment is learned. For each level of lumpiness, we study two substantially di\u00a4erent levels of income persistence, MP, and HP, with implied serial correlations of 0.5 and 0.9\nrespectively. In all cases, we vary subsidies from 0% to 100%. All tables and \u2026gures are located in the Appendix.\nIn Figures 2 and 3 , and in the associated tables, we display the welfare gains (losses) of changing the subsidy rate from the benchmark rate (40%) in the MP and HP cases respectively, for each of the four levels of \u00b5\u00b0 . These \u2026gures show that subsidies increase welfare substantially in all cases. For the benchmark case with \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:50, the loss in welfare amounts to 8.4% in consumption both in the HP and MP case when the subsidy rate is decreased from 40% to 0%. Additionally, for both HP and MP income shock processes, welfare is maximized at a subsidy rate of approximately 80%. The loss of being at the current subsidy rate of 40%, rather than at 80% is however, only 0.8% of consumption in the HP case and 0.7% in the MP case. A robust feature of our model is that we observe large gains from subsidies between 0% and 40%, but with very little gain or loss beyond 40%.\nThe preceding point provides an explanation for the absence of explicit private insurance contracts against college failure. The gains from trade in such contracts, given observed subsidies, are simply very small.\nThe welfare gains from subsidies come from three sources. First, subsidies increase un skilled wages and lower skilled wages as more people attend college, narrowing the skill premium and lowering the consequences of collegiate failure. Second, increased subsidies improve e\u00a2ciency in production by causing the reallocation of investment towards human capital, raising both total output and the interest rate. In fact, for low subsidy rates, output rises even though the physical capital stock falls. A lower capital stock pushes up the return on savings, further aiding consumption smoothing, exactly as in Aiyagari and McGrattan (1998) ."}, {"section_title": "28", "text": "The fall in the steady-state stock of physical capital occurs because households 28 In all cases considered in this paper, our results understate the true gains from increasing subsidies from zero to the welfare-maximizing level, as there are welfare gains along the transition path, as agents consume capital.\nshift their investment to human capital, and because with high subsidy rates (i.e. lower pri vate cost of education), less savings in capital stock is needed to \u2026nance college education, or insure against failure in it. Third, subsidies generate an increase in the proportion of \"non-1st generation\" students, implying lower average collegiate risk in the economy. The narrowing of the skill premium provides insurance exactly as in Ljungqvist (1995) . Tables 1 and 2 report skill premia for the HP and MP case with di\u00a4erent levels of \u00b5\u00b0 . In the HP case with \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:50, the skill premium goes up from 1.600 in the benchmark economy to 1.946 when subsidies are eliminated, and from 1.600 to 1.896 in the MP case. This corresponds to an increase of more than 21% in skill premium in the HP case, and a 19% increase in the MP case. Note that these changes originate in part from a decrease in the unskilled wage rate, from 0.451 to 0.412, corresponding to a decrease of 9.5% in the HP case, with a 7.7% fall in the MP case."}, {"section_title": "29", "text": "Interestingly, the skill premium as a function of subsidy rates has a shape similar to the welfare function; it is steep for low rates of subsidy, and becomes \u2021at for higher rates.

The results are recorded in Tables 1 and 2. In the HP case, consumption volatility, as measured by the coe\u00a2cient of variation, goes up from 0.34 in the benchmark to 0.43 in the 0% subsidy case (an increase of 27%); and goes up from 0.32 to 0.40 (an increase of 24%) in the MP case. Beyond a subsidy rate of 40% however, consumption smoothing does not improve in either the HP or the MP cases. 30 29 Note that the drops in unskilled wage rate are exacerbated by the unavailability of insurance contracts against income shocks. 30 Consumption volatility drops monotonically with higher subsidy rates in the MP case. However, the magnitude of change decreases substantially for higher rates of subsidy."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment and Dropout Rates", "text": "When we examine the behavior of enrollment as a response to di\u00a4erent subsidies we obtain a better understanding of the welfare response to subsidies. As subsidies are introduced into the fully decentralized economy, enrollment and welfare increase. Speci\u2026cally, as we move from 0% subsidies to 40% in the HP case with \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:5, enrollment rates increase from 54.86% to 64.23%. Such a substantial response of enrollments is re \u2021ected in large welfare gains. However, as subsidy rates rise beyond 40%, agents do not attend college at a higher rate. Thus, subsidies are not very e\u00a4ective beyond a rate of 40%, and consequently, equilibrium allocations and welfare do not change very much.\nAs \u00b5\u00b0 is increased, we observe that the enrollment e\u00a4ects of subsidies grow stronger. From Tables 3 and 4 , we see that when \u00b5\u00b0 is increased from 0.25 to 0.375, and then to 0.5 and 0.75, there is a systematic increase in the response of enrollment to subsidies. Under MP income shocks, when subsidies are increased from 0 to 40%, enrollment rises from 62.11% to 64.43% when \u00b5\u00b0 =0.25, from 58.54% to 64.43% when \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:375, from 53.99% to 64.43% when \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:50, and from 42.98% to 64.43% when \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:75. Furthermore, as \u00b5\u00b0 increases, the initial enrollment rate with a subsidy rate of 0% falls sharply, from 64.43 % when \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:25 to just 42.98% when \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:75, a 33% drop. In turn, the skill premium under a subsidy rate of 0% is much higher when uncertainty is resolved in later years. Therefore, subsidies not only make the risk of college palatable, but in so doing cause the skill premium to fall more rapidly in response to subsidies the lumpier is college investment. Welfare, in turn, responds more for a given change in subsidy rates in these cases.\nWith respect to 1-st generation status, we \u2026nd that the model performs well in terms of generating the right levels of 1-st generation enrollment. Under MP income shocks and for \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:50, the 1st-generation enrollment under the benchmark 40% subsidy rate of 62.41% is quite close to the observed rate of 59%. The match is close for other values of \u00b5\u00b0 . For non 1-st generation students, the model produces fewer dropouts than observed. This is due to the assumption that all agents informed of success complete college with certainty, while in the data, failure rates remain above zero for all groups. As seen in Tables 3 and 4, this feature is robust to income shock persistence as well.\nThe change in enrollment documented above reveals clearly that 1st generation households are the principal bene\u2026ciaries from subsidy programs. Their enrollment rates rise rapidly with subsidies, while the enrollment rate of non-1st generation households responds minimally. Non 1-st generation households are richer on average, and therefore better able to tolerate collegiate uncertainty. For example, under MP income shocks, when \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:50, we see that 1-st generation enrollment rises by nearly 15 percentage points, from 47.58% under 0% subsidies, to 62.41% under 40% subsidies, while non-1st generation enrollment rises by 1.3% percentage points from 66.43% to 67.65%. Thus, ex-post, it appears that the direct subsidies o\u00a4ered to lower tuition rates bene\u2026t some at the expense of others. However, in an ex-ante sense, this insurance o\u00a4ered by subsidies still clearly implies a welfare gain for all households, given failure risk.\nIn terms of success in college, we \u2026nd that while enrollment rates rise with subsidies, so do dropout rates. As argued above, adverse selection occurs as subsidies encourage UI agents, particularly 1-st generation students, to invest in risky college education. This change in incentives is possibly welfare reducing, if the change in drop out rates among the U I, was very large. It is not. The results are given in Tables 5 and 6 . Overall dropout rates rise marginally, in the benchmark MP, \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:50, case, from 31.66% to 34.18.% as subsidies rise from 0% to 100%.

In contrast, for \u2026rst generation students, dropout rates for this case rise from 17.09% to just 18.22%. The model also does a very good job matching the data on the 45% dropout rate of 1-st generation students in the MP, \u00b5\u00b0 =0.50 case. However, the model underestimates the dropout rate of 24% among non-1st generation students, as it had underestimated the very high 83% enrollment rate among this group. Thus, there appear to be additional incentives to attend college among poorly prepared rich children."}, {"section_title": "32", "text": "These features are seen to be robust across levels of \u00b5\u00b0 ."}, {"section_title": "Intergenerational Persistence", "text": "We \u2026nd that in all cases, income mobility is enhanced by subsidies, often in a quantitatively important way. We measure intergenerational mobility by the correlation of the lifetime incomes of adjacent generations. The model con\u2026rms the widely held view that subsidies can play a useful role in mitigating persistence in incomes across generations.\nIn the MP, \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:25 case, as subsidies are increased from 0% to 100%, we see from Table   7 that the correlation of lifetime income across adjacent generations falls very slightly from 0.039 to 0.036. The correlations themselves are very small in this case. Why? First, recall that income shocks are drawn from the unconditional distribution when an new generation arrives. Second, when \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:25, the educational risk is of little consequence, and income risk 31 Note that for overinvestment to occur, failure rates would have to be exceptionally high, given the small cost of college relative to the large di\u00a4erence in mean lifetime income between skilled and unskilled households. 32 Assortative matching is one possibility.\nis e\u00a4ectively smoothed away. Therefore, when \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:25, intergenerational income smoothing does not depend importantly on subsidies, as seen in Tables 7 and 8 . This result highlights the fact that the model's internal dynamics are driven by educational lumpiness and uncertainty.\nAs \u00b5\u00b0 rises, the role of subsidies becomes more important for intergenerational mobility. When \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:50, the intergenerational earnings correlation is 0.185 under a subsidy rate of 0%. This correlation quickly falls as subsidy rates rise; with a subsidy rate of 40%, the correlation decreases to 0.100. This e\u00a4ect is even more pronounced when \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:75, with the correlation falling from 0.242 to 0.0870. Interestingly, our model still substantially understates the income persistence of approximately 0.400 found by Zimmerman (1992) , and Solon (1992) in U.S. data. Indeed our results are closer to the estimates of income persistence of the earlier literature, approximately 0.20 (see for example, Becker and Tomes (1986) )."}, {"section_title": "33", "text": "Interestingly, we \u2026nd that as income shock persistence rises, to the HP case, lifetime earnings persistence is almost always lower than in the MP case. This occurs because with each new generation, shocks are drawn from the unconditional distribution of income shocks.\nThese shocks are, by construction, uncorrelated with those of the previous period. In turn, a highly persistent process has shocks at all dates that are not highly correlated with shocks of the previous generation. Thus, higher shock persistence implies lower correlation of income across generations. Nevertheless, subsidies further lower lifetime income correlations across generations. Relatedly, under HP income shocks, we see from Table 8 that mobility is less dependent on the time to failure, \u00b5\u00b0 , than in the MP case. In the latter, under 0% subsidies, mobility rises from 0.039 to 0.242, as \u00b5\u00b0 goes from 0.25 to 0.75, while in the HP case persistence rises from 0.014 to 0.155. Thus, subsidies are more e\u00a4ective in the MP case.\nWealth persistence does not change dramatically with subsidies, but appears to weakly increase, for given persistence in the shock process. This occurs because precautionary savings fall with increased subsidies, as households will be less a\u00a4ected by the shock of having a U I child, relative to an I s (or I f ) child. That is, holding \u00b5\u00b0 and income persistence \u2026xed, the similar expected labor income of households (given parental skill levels), along with subsidies, prevent generations from growing \"too di\u00a4erent\". Therefore, the correlation of wealth across generations (which is also the correlation of lifetime wealth across households at a point in time) rises. The details are presented in Tables 7 and 8 . In contrast, holding subsidy rates \u2026xed, we see that wealth persistence falls appreciably, as we move from the MP case to the HP case. This occurs for the same reason that lifetime earnings correlations 33 Assortative matching in college may also further stratify college graduates from high school graduates. If so, the risk of failure in college is even greater than documented here, as it may also mean a lower likelihood of \u2026nding a college-educated spouse with whom to produce well-prepared children. That is, subsidies, by encouraging young households to take the risk of college, may be even more bene\u2026cial in increasing mobility than they are in the present model. across generations falls with persistence. Given that the initial income shock when young is drawn unconditionally, lifetime wealth accumulation, which depends on inherited wealth, but also on lifetime income, becomes less correlated with that of the previous generation as shocks become more persistent."}, {"section_title": "The Timing of the Resolution of Collegiate Uncertainty", "text": "We now assess the robustness of the results to the resolution of uncertainty in collegiate success, by altering \u00b5\u00b0 . As mentioned earlier, beyond the benchmark \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:50 case, we compute the equilibria of three additional cases, whereby \u00b5\u00b0 = f0:25; 0:375; 0:75g. Figures   2 and 3 reveal that the later the resolution of uncertainty (i.e. a larger \u00b5\u00b0 ), the greater is the welfare gain from moving from very low subsidy rates to high ones. The timing of the resolution of uncertainty in collegiate investment strongly a\u00a4ects the gains from moving away from the observed subsidy rate. When it takes three years to learn about success for uninformed households, (i.e. \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:75), the loss relative to current subsidies of eliminating all subsidies is very large, at approximately 22% of annual median income in the MP case, or $10000 per household, and 10% in the HP case, or $5000. What is notable is that even when success or failure can be determined in one year, (\u00b5\u00b0 = 0:25), we \u2026nd the welfare response to increased subsidies to be strictly positive and nontrivial for low subsidy rates. In the MP case with \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:25, we see a nearly 3% gain in consumption, or $1260 per household, as we move from 0% subsidies to 40%, and gain of 1.74%, or $700 per household, for the same change in the HP case. The preceding shows that failure risk remains a dominant force in the welfare e\u00a4ects of subsidies, even when collegiate uncertainty resolves itself failry early.\nAs \u00b5\u00b0 shrinks, so does the distinction in welfare losses between the HP and MP cases arising from eliminating subsidies altogether. These welfare losses from eliminating subsidies are also order of magnitude smaller than the large losses occurring when \u00b5\u00b0 = 0:75, which are 22% and 12% respectively. We next observe that as income persistence is nearly doubled, from the MP case to the HP case, that the maximal gains for subsidies, for \u00b5\u00b0 given, are generally larger in the MP case. That is, subsidies are more bene\u2026cial for income smoothing than they are in the HP case.\nTo assess the importance of information regarding collegiate success, consider the follow ing exercise. For a \u2026xed subsidy rate, how much do households gain by learning the outcome of college earlier? For the HP case with a subsidy rate of 40%, the gain in consumption is 3.6% if \u00b5\u00b0 decreases from 0.5 to 0.25 (i.e. from 2 years to 1 year). The gain is 0.4% for the MP case. These results also indirectly provide an economic evaluation of the signi\u2026cance of shorter tertiary education programs, such as 2-year programs o\u00a4ered by community colleges, and vocational programs."}, {"section_title": "Subsidy Policy", "text": "Perhaps the most interesting \u2026nding in this paper is that the optimal subsidy rate is still relatively stable across experiments when it takes longer to \u2026nd out the outcome of college education. As \u00b5\u00b0 approaches 1, the cost of failure grows, thereby increasing the value of a given subsidy rate. However, as \u00b5\u00b0 approaches 1, the cost of a given subsidy program also rises, and demands higher levels of distorting taxes. As a quantitative matter, these e\u00a4ects seem broadly o\u00a4setting. That is, optimal subsidy rates do not move much, but the gains from subsidies grow much larger as college education becomes more uncertain and lumpy. In spite of this insensitivity, the gains from moving to the optimal subsidy rate depend crucially on how early the uncertainty of college investment is resolved.\nOur model suggests precisely that it is the gains from increasing subsidies from 0% to 40%\nthat are greatest, with welfare gains \u2021attening out sharply afterwards. That is, employing much higher subsidy rates than 40% appears unlikely to do much damage, while being too stringent with subsidies entails much larger welfare losses. Our results thus help reconcile the observations that subsidy rates vary a great deal across OECD nations, and are typically in excess of 40%. Furthermore, the shape of the welfare function provides insight into why, in the OECD, with its uniformly high subsidies, explicit private insurance against failure appears unavailable: it is unnecessary. It should also be noted that even though the gains from insurance are large under 0% subsidies, adverse selection is likely to impede private provision of such insurance. In particular, highly prepared students will not participate in private insurance programs (a population of 13.8% in our model), while less prepared students (e.g 1-st generation students) will. A subsidy program, by contrast, forces the participation of all groups."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we investigated the e\u00a4ect of current tertiary education subsidy policy, espe cially with respect to its role in encouraging students to invest in risky and lumpy college education. Our results are striking, and easily summarized. We \u2026nd that not only do existing higher education subsidies improve welfare substantially relative to the fully decentralized equilibrium, but even higher subsidy rates than observed in the U.S. are bene\u2026cial. Our results therefore suggest that moderate collegiate subsidies can be justi\u2026ed by appeal to failure risk alone. With respect to prices, quantities, and distribution, we \u2026nd that increased subsidies lower skill premia, increase interest rates as precautionary savings fall, lower the variability and inequality of both consumption and wealth, and increase intergenerational income mobility.\nOur results obtain despite fairly conservative assumptions on the bene\u2026ts of subsidies and their costs. First, with respect to modeling the bene\u2026ts of subsidies, as NCES data show, even highly prepared students still fail to complete college at nonzero rates. Rather than allowing such households to face this risk, we posit that they succeed with certainty. Second, by construction no household is credit constrained with respect to \u2026nancing college education. Third, human capital in our model produces no externalities or growth e\u00a4ects, but rather has only level e\u00a4ects. With respect to the costs of subsidies, our environment is one where subsidies do lower the average quality of student, and where subsidies are required to be \u2026nanced via distortionary taxation."}, {"section_title": "Appendix: Computation", "text": "We compute the stationary equilibrium for the benchmark case as follows.

We then check the government's budget constraint, and iterate on tax rates until this constraint is satis\u2026ed. We continue until we converge to a vector (r \u00a4 ; \u00bf c \u00a4 ; \u00bf l \u00a4 ) of interest rates and tax rates respectively such that capital markets clear and the government budget constraint is satis\u2026ed. Lastly, we check to see if we have a \u2026xed point in T , \u00b2 s 0 , and \u00b2 u 0 , and if not, update our guesses.\nOutside the benchmark case, we cannot take wages and the skill composition as facts to be matched, but rather must derive them as endogenously determined outcomes. Therefore, Given that this market is cleared, we know that the unskilled labor demand is satis\u2026ed, and by construction, that the unskilled wage is the competitive one, given the interest rate. We next iterate on the interest rate until the capital market clears. Finally, we iterate on the tax rate, and then the time endowment in order to satisfy the government budget constraint. 34 We use series of length 30,000. 35 As dicussed in Section 6, this calibration is disciplined by observable bounds on non-completion rates in the data. 36 Equilibrium unskilled labor demand is just \"Time\" less skilled labor hours, where \"Time\" is aggregate labor hours adjusted for the part-time labor supply of students in college.
