[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "We studied a previously reported association between the IGF2 gene's ApaI polymorphism and obesity in 500 healthy men and women (19 -90 y). We hypothesized that individuals homozygous for the IGF2 A allele (A=A) would exhibit lower body mass, BMI and DEXA-measured fat mass compared to G=G homozygotes. Subjects were categorized as exhibiting the G=G (n \u00bc 241), G=A (n \u00bc 197) or A=A (n \u00bc 62) genotype. Contrary to our hypothesis, no difference was observed in body mass, body mass index (BMI) or fat mass between the G=G and A=A genotype groups in the entire cohort. Surprisingly, Caucasian A=A individuals (n \u00bc 427) exhibited significantly higher fat mass compared to Caucasian G=G individuals (P < 0.05). In summary, individuals homozygous for the IGF2 G allele do not exhibit higher body mass, BMI or fat mass compared to A=A individuals; however, Caucasians with the A=A genotype exhibit higher fat mass than G=G individuals."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "O'Dell et al 1, 2 have reported that Caucasian men homozygous for the IGF2 gene's ApaI G allele exhibit significantly greater body mass and BMI (body mass index) compared to A=A individuals. Although insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) is a growth factor with effects on fetal skeletal muscle growth and development, IGF-II has a known insulin-like action that might contribute to obesity risk in adults. 3 In this context, O'Dell et al 1 reported significantly lower levels of serum IGF-II in a subgroup of G=G compared to A=A men. Recent analyses have implicated the IGF2 gene in influencing fat deposition in pigs. 4, 5 Because O'Dell et al 1,2 studied only middle-aged men originating from the UK, issues of population origin and gender have yet to be resolved in confirming this association. We examined the association of IGF2 genotype with body composition in American men and women across the adult age span. We hypothesized that individuals homozygous for the IGF2 G allele would exhibit higher body mass, BMI and fat mass than A=A individuals."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Healthy volunteers (257 men and 243 women; 19 -90 y) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) 6 participated in the study, including 427 Caucasians, 59 African-Americans, and 14 individuals of other races. Experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, the University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Maryland, and all subjects gave their written informed consent.\nBody mass and height were measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.5 cm, respectively, and BMI was calculated (kg=m 2 ). Fat mass was measured in 435 subjects using DEXA as described previously.\n7 Serum IGF-II levels were determined in 90 men from the same cohort as outlined previously. 8 Genomic DNA was extracted 9 and the IGF2 ApaI genotype (G=G, G=A or A=A) was determined. 10 The IGF2 gene appears to be imprinted in humans. 11 Given no available parental genotypes for this cohort, we performed all comparisons between the G=G and A=A groups as well as among all three genotype groups. Phenotype measures were used as response variables in analysis of covariance models, with age, gender and=or height included as covariates (height not included for BMI analyses). An analysis of statistical power revealed $ 80% power to detect differences of 4 kg in body mass, 1 kg=m 2 in BMI, and 2 kg in fat mass between groups. Data are reported as least squares means AE s.e., with statistical significance accepted at P < 0.05."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Of the 500 total subjects ( 2 . In Caucasians only, A=A individuals exhibited significantly higher fat mass (but not body mass or BMI) compared to both G=A and G=G genotype groups (P < 0.05; Figure 1 ). No significant differences were observed when gender-specific analyses were performed, although A=A men tended to have a higher fat mass compared to G=A men (P \u00bc 0.07). No significant differences were observed between G=G and A=A genotypes for either body mass or BMI in Caucasians.\nSerum IGF-II levels were available for 90 male subjects (47 -89 y; 48 G=G, 32 G=A and 10 A=A) from the larger cohort. No significant differences in IGF-II were observed between the A=A and G=G genotype groups (G=G \u00bc 348.1 AE 19.7 ng=ml; A=A \u00bc 281.3 AE 43.0 ng=ml)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Overall, we found no evidence of association between IGF2 genotype and body mass, BMI, fat mass or serum IGF-II levels (n \u00bc 90) in this American cohort; however, among 427 Caucasians, individuals exhibiting the A=A genotype exhibited significantly greater fat mass compared to both G=A and G=G individuals. These results are surprising, given the earlier work by O'Dell and colleagues 1,2 who reported higher body mass and BMI in G=G compared to A=A Caucasian men. Thus, the present results contradict those of O'Dell et al 1, 12 and suggest that the IGF2 ApaI polymorphism's role in body composition is influenced by other genes and=or environmental influences associated with population subdivision.\nIn several reports, O'Dell and colleagues 1,2,12 have reported significantly higher body mass and=or BMI in G=G compared to A=A middle-aged Caucasian men originating from throughout the UK. In none of the reports were covariates used in the statistical comparison of IGF2 ApaI genotype groups 1, 2, 12 as was done in the present study, although their most recent work 2 included an analysis of other sequence variants in the IGF2 gene that were associated independently with BMI. The present results in 2 The current cohort was recruited as part of the ongoing Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), with the majority of volunteers recruited from Maryland and the District of Columbia. 6 The possible association of the new IGF2 sequence variants observed by Gaunt et al, 2 in addition to the ApaI site, with BMI or body fat will need to be examined in other large cohorts.\nIn conclusion, individuals homozygous for the IGF2 ApaI G allele do not exhibit higher body mass, BMI or fat mass compared to A=A individuals in this American cohort. Contrary to previous research, however, Caucasian individuals with the A=A genotype exhibit higher fat mass than G=G individuals in the present study."}]
