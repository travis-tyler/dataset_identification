[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is one of the most prevalent methods to investigate 30 the micro-and macrostructure of the human brain in vivo. Prior to any group analysis, dMRI data are 31 generally processed to alleviate adverse effects of known artefacts such as signal drift, data noise and 32 outliers, subject motion, and geometric distortions. These dMRI data processing steps are often 33 combined in automated pipelines, such as the one of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). While 34 improving the performance of processing tools has clearly shown its benefits at each individual step 35 along the pipeline, it remains unclear whether -and to what degree -choices for specific user-36 defined parameter settings can affect the final outcome of group analyses. In this work, we 37 demonstrate how making such a choice for a particular processing step of the pipeline drives the final 38 outcome of a group study. More specifically, we performed a dMRI group analysis on gender using 39 HCP data sets and compared the results obtained with two diffusion tensor imaging estimation 40 methods: the widely used ordinary linear least squares (OLLS) and the more reliable iterative 41 weighted linear least squares (IWLLS). Our results show that the effect sizes for group analyses are 42 significantly smaller with IWLLS than with OLLS. While previous literature has demonstrated 43 higher estimation reliability with IWLLS than with OLLS using simulations, this work now also 44 shows how OLLS can produce a larger number of false positives than IWLLS in a typical group 45 study. We therefore highly recommend using the IWLLS method. By raising awareness of how the 46 choice of estimator can artificially inflate effect size and thus alter the final outcome, this work may 47"}, {"section_title": "", "text": ". Assuming that data outliers have been identified and removed, a specific 92 version of the WLLS, iterative WLLS (IWLLS), shows high performance characteristics in terms of 93 accuracy and precision and may even be preferred over advanced NLLS estimation methods (Veraart 94 et al., 2013b ). Yet, OLLS is still the most widely used estimation method and often defined as the 95 default in common software tools (e.g., FSL - (Jenkinson et al., 2012) ). 96\nSimilar to the other dMRI processing steps, one can also question the relevance of choosing a 97 particular diffusion estimation approach. Does it really matter which estimator is used for the final 98 outcome of a group study? In this work, we address this concern. More specifically, we performed a 99 dMRI group analysis using Human Connectome Project (HCP) data sets and compared the results 100 obtained with OLLS and IWLLS. To this end, and without loss of generality, we investigated gender 101 proven to be more efficient in producing fewer false positives than parametric methods (Eklund et al., 136 2016) . Significance was determined at p corr < 0.05 using family-wise error rate (FWER) adjustment 137 to correct for multiple comparisons after applying threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) (Smith 138 and Nichols, 2009).

Accordingly, we used Cohen's d, a frequently applied effect size 169 estimator. Furthermore, because Cohen's d is not a robust effect size measure to outliers, skewness, 170 heavy-tails and the combinations of these factors, the shape differences between the voxelwise 171 distributions of FA values were studied via the shift function (Rousselet et al., 2017) . The 95% 172 percentile confidence intervals for the decile differences were estimated with a bootstrap estimation 173 (1000 samples), using the Harrell-Davis estimator (Wilcox, 2012) , as implemented in the Matlab 174 results. In addition, the lack of overlap is not indicative of a difference in outcome between the OLLS 209 and IWLLS results. At this stage, the results merely illustrate that there is general agreement in 210 spatial overlap of the regions that were deemed significant in terms of FA based gender differences. 211 FA OLLS ratios ( Fig. 6 c) ), it can be readily seen that FA m increased more than FA f when changing the 244 estimator from IWLLS to OLLS. The FA m -FA f difference is plotted for each decile with the 245 bootstrapped confidence intervals as a function of male deciles, indicating that the increase in FA m 246 was systematically larger than the increase in FA f by 0.5-2% due to this change ( Fig. 6 d) ). Note that 247 if a confidence interval does not include zero, one may also conclude that said difference is 248 significant between the changes of these ratios. for OLLS: Cohen's d increased from 0.19 to 0.27. Fig. 8 c) shows the FA IWLLS / FA OLLS ratios per 271 gender, indicating that FA f increased more than FA m when changing the estimator from IWLLS to 272 OLLS. Fig. 8 d) shows the shift function. The FA m -FA f difference is plotted for each decile with the 273 bootstrapped confidence intervals as a function of male deciles, indicating that the increase in FA f 274 over FA m was larger with 1-2%, except in the highest decile, where FA increased nearly at the same 275 rate. Note that if a confidence interval does not include zero, one may also conclude that said 276 difference is significant between the changes of these ratios. Males have a smaller area where FA m > FA f , therefore the area where estimators could have any 292 effect is also smaller compared to females. The area of investigation is located where \u0394FA m > \u0394FA f 293 is significant, as shown in Fig. 4 , but within that region it is limited to voxels where FA m > FA f . Fig.  294 9 shows the differences of the effect sizes as a function of IWLLS-based effect sizes. For the sake of 295 simplicity, the spatial distribution of the voxels in MNI space is not shown.

More specifically, we performed a voxel-based 314 analysis, comparing FA values between males and females using HCP data, and revealed that a 315 higher effect size was obtained with the OLLS diffusion tensor estimator than with its IWLLS 316 counterpart. If we consider that the IWLLS estimator has a higher accuracy, we can conclude that 317 OLLS overestimates the observed FA based gender differences. With the majority of published DTI 318 studies having used the OLLS estimator, it is not hard to imagine that the lack of general agreement 319 in findings for several research topics (both in neuroscience and clinical applications) could also be 320 partly attributed to the higher number false positives introduced by the OLLS estimator as compared 321 with the IWLLS estimator. In the following paragraphs, we will discuss how our findings relate with 322 what is known in functional MRI (fMRI) and we will place our results in the context of other dMRI 323 studies. 324\nThe term 'blobology' (Poldrack, 2012) corresponds to the colorful patches, the 'blobs', of fMRI 325 brain studies, summarizing the localization of the results after processing and statistical thresholding. 326\nThe phrase reflects an inherent frustration within the neuroimaging community, partly due to the lack 327 of effect size reports. In dMRI studies, unfortunately, effect sizes are rarely reported. Researchers 328 often spend most of their efforts on reporting statistically significant results from the data, while the 329 extent of these effects, which is highly complementary, is hardly considered. the detection of small effects, which otherwise could not be identified (Smith and Nichols, 2018) . But 334 even for group studies based on these cohorts, not properly processing the data according to best 335 practices may still result in biases that will affect the reliability of the final outcome measures. 336 Thompson et al. (Thompson et al., 2016 ) reached a similar conclusion in relation to the genome-337 connectome association in the ENIGMA project: \"\u2026 Clearly, the ability to pursue such an approach 338 on a large scale, within ENIGMA, depends on several factors: a working group, ENIGMA-DTI, was 339 set up to assess its feasibility. First, unless diffusion-weighted MRI measures show greater genetic 340 effect sizes than other traits assessed so far, there must be tens of thousands of DTI scans available 341 from people with GWAS for such a study to be well powered \u2026\". According to the ENIGMA-DTI processing protocol (ENIGMA DTI protocol, 2018), the OLLS estimator is used via the FSL toolbox 343 dtifit. In all of the aforementioned large-scale cohorts (ADNI, HCP, UK BioBank, Whitehall study), 344 OLLS is also used which, in light of our findings, may adversely affect the reliability of the final 345 outcome in a group study. Generally, lower-quality dMRI data in terms of effective SNR or CNR 346 benefit more from using an estimator with better performance characteristics such as the IWLLS 347 approach (Veraart et al., 2013a (Veraart et al., , 2013b . In this work, we used HCP data, which are among the 348 highest quality data available in current large-scale cohorts (Bastiani et al., 2019) . Given the lower 349 number of DWIs, the lower SNR and CNR, and the higher amount of physiological artifacts in more 350 conventional neuroimaging studies, especially in a clinical setting, one can expect even more inflated 351 effect sizes by using the OLLS estimator than those observed in this work. 352\nIn this work, we carried out the voxelwise analysis with the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) 353 toolbox (Penny et al., 2007) , rather than with another common approach, i.e. tract-based spatial 354 statistics (TBSS) (Smith et al., 2006) . While our results in this manuscript would be conceptually the 355 same when using TBSS, confounds may arise from the skeletonization step, which may be different 356 between the OLLS and the IWLLS. Differences in their local FA maxima could then affect statistical 357 analysis and may further complicate interpretation of the outcome (Bach et al., 2014) . Assuming the 358 same skeleton could be provided for both datasets, e.g., via the overlap and the fusion of the 359 skeletons, there is no reason to consider that the results presented in this work would be significantly 360"}, {"section_title": "different. 361", "text": "Researchers often justify the choices made for specific processing steps in their data processing 362 pipeline by referring to previously peer-reviewed studies, which used the same settings or 363 algorithms, despite the availability of more reliable alternatives. In addition, as OLLS generates 364 an artificially higher effect size than IWLLS, it stimulates the positive bias in publications 365 (Rothstein et al., 2006 ) and contributes to \"the natural selection of bad science\" (Smaldino and 366 McElreath, 2016). To some extent, following the implementation of \"registered reports\" may 367 mitigate this concern as the processing pipeline can be reviewed and scrutinized before starting 368 the actual analysis (Nosek and Lakens, 2014). 369\nIn a recent review paper by Poldrack et al. (Poldrack et al., 2017) the lack of common consensus in 370 processing and analysis was showcased for fMRI. With common fMRI software packages, it was 371 shown that the number of possible analysis workflows can be as much as 69,120. For DTI, it is not 372 hard to achieve the same order of magnitude for this number of workflows given the vast amount of options and parameter settings one can think of. In this work, we specifically investigated the effect 374 of choosing between the OLLS and the IWLLS estimator on the outcome of the analysis, as using a 375 diffusion tensor estimator is mandatory. Other processing steps, such as denoising and correcting for 376 artifacts are not per se necessary (although highly recommended, of course) to continue with 377 performing an actual group study. In this context, there may be several aspects of a typical processing 378 or analysis workflow for DTI that may result in much larger effects than shown in this work. 379\nEklund et al. (Eklund et al., 2016) used resting-state fMRI to obtain \"null data\", i.e., truly negative 380 data, to test the false-positive ratios for task fMRI. Unfortunately, for DTI, such an experimental 381 testing setup to evaluate statistical inferences related to methodological factors is not trivial. 382\nHowever, without loss of generality, in this work, we performed a standard group study on gender as 383 the framework to evaluate the effect of using different diffusion tensor estimation approaches. We 384 used HCP data because of the excellent data quality and the large number of subjects with proper 385 male-female balance, thereby eliminating issues related to small sample size and low power during 386 statistical inference (Button et al., 2013) . 387\nIn this work, we did not opt for analyzing the \"statistical\" significance (i.e., p-values) of our findings, 388 but rather considered the difference in effect sizes that can be observed. In a similar context, shifting 389 the focus from p-values to effect sizes was also recently presented by Ritchie et al. (Ritchie et al., 390 2018) . They compared volumes and DTI based metrics of cortical, subcortical, and WM regions 391 between females and males from the UK BioBank for more than 5000 participants. The comparison 392 of the right CST revealed that males have larger FA values than females, with a p-value of 4\u00d710 -65 393 using Cohen's d = 0.54. After adjusting for total brain volume, the values changed to 8\u00d710 -12 with 394\nCohen's d = 0.22. While these p-values are indeed very significant, they do not contain any useful 395 information. On the other hand, the effect size measures provide more practical information. That is, 396 adding another 5000 or more participants to the analysis will not result in any meaningful change in 397 terms of the effect size, as this investigation is already statistically well-powered, while the p-value 398 would decrease further. For the same reason, i.e., avoiding under-powered study design, we used 399 HCP data for our group comparison, allowing us to focus on the performance of the DTI estimators. 400\nDespite the efforts of optimizing the dMRI processing pipeline, it is often not clear what the benefits 401 are of new developments for group-based studies. In this work, however, we showed that the 402 application of IWLLS should be preferred over the OLLS for diffusion tensor estimation. The current 403 framework can be easily extended to examine effects of modifying other processing elements, but also to investigate choices in algorithms and settings for specific analysis strategies, like tractography 405 and connectomics, further improving the reliability and validity of future dMRI group studies. 406"}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "Conflict of Interest 407\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial 408 relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. 409"}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "Funding 410 Nir, T.M., Jahanshad, N., Villalon-Reina, J.E., Toga, A.W., Jack, C.R., Weiner, M.W., Thompson Nosek, B.A., Lakens, D., 2014.
