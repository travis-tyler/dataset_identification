[{"section_title": "Table of Contents", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "On June 17-18 th , 2004, the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) sponsored a workshop at the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) to discuss emerging issues, research, and current practices related to financial support for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The meeting, which was attended by 101 graduate students, postdocs, faculty from science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, graduate deans, labor economists, and representatives from federal agencies was one in a series of events designed to examine and provide recommendations that will enhance our knowledge and improve practices and policies associated with graduate and postdoctoral education and research training. The specific goal of this workshop was to consider the role and impact that student financial support plays in encouraging U.S. citizens to pursue and complete doctoral and postdoctoral studies in STEM fields. The research and resulting discussions highlighted elements of the graduate student and postdoctoral support packages including mode, duration, amount of stipend, health care and other benefits; and indicators of student progress such as completion rate and time to first professional position. The workshop deliberations set the stage for developing best practices and outlining a research agenda on these topics, as well as building a community of researchers, educators, and stakeholders to maintain an ongoing dialogue in this critical area. The particular topic for this meeting was driven by the recent dramatic changes in NSF stipend policy. Over the last 5 years, the stipends awarded by the premier NSF programs for supporting graduate students have doubled, from $15,000/year to $30,000/year. Although the increase in the NSF stipend level has a direct effect on a relatively small fraction of the total population of STEM graduate students throughout the country (about 2%, or 5,000 students), the change has elicited ripple effects throughout both the graduate and postdoctoral enterprises. In some cases, the policy changes have resulted in stipend levels for graduate students that exceed salaries of postdocs. Considering the greater likelihood that new PhD graduates in STEM fields will accept at least one postdoctoral position coupled with the increasing length of the postdoctoral research position, the workshop addressed the challenges and needs of both populations. Labor economists made several presentations on the topic of quantity versus quality. The preliminary findings indicated that among those who complete the doctoral degree, financial support in the form of stipends helped to reduce time-to-degree (TTD), and that the average quality of doctoral students (as measured by GRE scores) declines as the availability of awards per applicant increases. An important observation was that for many of today's scientists, the time spent in graduate school and postdoctoral research represents approximately \u00bc of a scientist's career (6 years of grad school + 4 years of postdoc = 10 years of 40 year career). It was noted that uncertainty in obtaining autonomous positions may differentially affect minorities and females, and it was recommended that the whole pipeline be examined, including the postdoctoral years. If the goal that national science workforce policy seeks or needs to maximize is to produce high quality researchers as quickly and cheaply as possible, stipends are an important tool, but we must also improve career attractiveness. Freeman suggests that we consider alternatives to current funding models, particularly the distribution of funds during the course of a graduate career and the time to first professional position. (He suggested, for example, guaranteeing five years of graduate support to the PhD). Support Workshop 6-04 Other research sessions noted that generally speaking, doctoral students in science and engineering fields received more than one mode or type of support throughout their graduate career. On average, students received 2.5 types of support ranging from fellowships, to teaching or research assistantships, to selfsupport. Research assistantships were the most frequent type of support and were common in four of the top five combinations of financial support. A panel consisting of a group of representatives from a series of stakeholder focus group meetings was held to lay issues on the table. The focus groups were held with members of the National Postdoc Association, the Council of Scientific Society Presidents (CSSP), a group of graduate students, a group of AAAS fellows (representing recent graduates), and from a group of graduate deans. A number of concerns about the current state of affairs were voiced during the session, as were a few suggestions and possible courses of action. Two of the most prominent points among the panelists were the need for support packages that provide at least basic subsistence and the need for health care coverage. The focus groups that represented greater numbers of junior members of the research community cited the uncertainty of obtaining a professional position at the end of extensive graduate and postdoctoral periods as the most critical problem. The workshop agenda also focused on university and national issues related to stipend level vs. cost-ofeducation (COE) allowance. A number of graduate deans questioned the government's priorities in raising stipends, but not COE allowances. Economists in the audience insisted increasing stipends is the only meaningful tool of enticing citizens into otherwise not particularly attractive science careers. Federal agency representatives pointed out that the political reality is that it was not a choice between stipends or COE; it was higher stipends or nothing. Nevertheless, it was clear that COE allowances that are insufficient to cover tuition, fees and benefits put a great strain on universities. The final day of the workshop included a set of breakout groups focusing on a potential research agenda, best practices for universities, and variables for setting stipend policy. Joan Lorden, reporting for the focus group on creating a research agenda, again noted the poor measures for graduate students, stating, \"We don't know who's coming to graduate school and why. We don't know very much about the experiences of students\u2026while they're in graduate school, and we don't know where they go when they leave.\" The group studying stipend policy re-iterated the theme that stipend level wasn't as useful a focus as considering support packages. In reporting from the group discussing university practices, Les Sims noted, \"The communication and clear understanding of expectations (between faculty and research assistants) was a very strong point in the discussion.\""}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The workshop participants concluded that money does, in fact, matter. However, the relationship between financial policy and outcomes is not straightforward. To those in the process, while stipends are important, career prospects are of equal or greater importance.

Furthermore, evaluating either time-to-degree or length of postdoctoral appointment independently is not as important as investigating the time to first professional position. The effect of stipend policy can be asymmetric. Most felt that while slightly higher stipends may not necessarily attract students, poor stipend policies could certainly drive many away.

More information, including copies of all presentations, handouts, and transcripts, as well as participant information, can be found at: http://www.ehr.nsf.gov/dge/support_workshop.html Support Workshop 6-04\nSeveral themes emerged over the course of the workshop: \u2022 Current measures for graduate student quality are poor, which distorts any meaningful effort to determine impact of financial policy. Development of better indicators and more tracking of student success and careers are a necessity. \u2022 While it is not clear how attractive stipends make graduate/postdoc science careers, it is clear that inadequate support can be a barrier. The provision of adequate health care coverage is an essential part of the decision to pursue a STEM graduate/postdoc career. \u2022 A policy of supporting students end-to-end would be a good best practice. Collaboration is necessary between federal agencies and universities to develop a best practice policy (e.g. universities offer graduate students five years of support where 2-3 years are provided by a federal fellowship with the remaining years funded through university guaranteed research and teaching assistantships.) \u2022 The most important single topic to those currently affected, that is, graduate students, postdocs and recent postdocs, is that of uncertainty. The principal uncertainty is that of finding a suitable professional position after a lengthy time spent in graduate and postdoctoral work. The secondary uncertainty was the amount of time to this first professional job. The time to degree, within this overall time, was relatively unimportant. \u2022 The economists at the meeting said that paying higher stipends induces better-qualified students into STEM fields. The economists also said that providing a larger number of traineeships and assistantships lowered the average quality (as measured by GRE score) of the overall pool of STEM students. \u2022 The graduate deans at the workshop were generally pleased at the recent increase in stipends. They were concerned about inequities, real or perceived, with similar graduate students being paid various amounts. It was noted several times that the pay inequities are more readily accepted for graduate fellows, which are perceived as being awarded on the basis of individual merit through national competition. Traineeships, on the other hand, are not perceived in the same way, and there may be more resentment in this case. \u2022 The graduate deans are concerned about financial support for their institutions and, in this setting, that took the form of their wanting the cost of education paid to institutions for fellows and trainees to increase. On both of these issues, most participants recognized that the number of people involved in federal traineeships and fellowships is small (about 20% of the total graduate students supported by NSF) and so is important primarily as an example. The workshop participants concluded that money does, in fact, matter. However, the relationship between financial policy and outcomes is not straightforward. To those in the process, while stipends are important, career prospects are of equal or greater importance. Relevant measures include the attractiveness of early career positions and the time it takes to secure a permanent position. Furthermore, evaluating either time-to-degree or length of postdoctoral appointment independently is not as important as investigating the time to first professional position. The effect of stipend policy can be asymmetric. Most felt that while slightly higher stipends may not necessarily attract students, poor stipend policies could certainly drive many away. Stipend policy must account for no less than, and preferably better than, a minimum level of subsistence, of which health care is a mandatory aspect, particularly as graduate and postdoctoral appointments become longer. A recommendation of the workshop is that support be examined as a total package. Few students use a single mode of support, so understanding the efficacy of any particular mode (fellowship, research assistantship, etc) is difficult and almost irrelevant. An option was discussed to create federal-university partnerships, where students are offered 5-year packages comprised of federal fellowship support along with institutionally funded research and teaching support for the duration of the graduate degree program. Selected NSF Graduate Research Fellowships were suggested as possible sources of funding for a pilot project. A recommendation, or challenge, of the workshop was that in our roles as educators, we need to know more about graduate education, from successful models to the needs of modern graduate students and postdocs. NSF has already begun to implement this recommendation through the addition of a specific call for proposals to study graduate education as part of the ROLE (Research on Learning and Education) program. The sense of the workshop co-chairs was that the single most important message from the workshop was that the attractiveness of early careers in the sciences must be systemically addressed. Long apprenticeships with poor compensation, but of known duration and career outcome are the hallmark of the medical disciplines, and seldom are seen as discouraging students from entering, or resulting in attrition. Law and business students spend shorter periods in training, but receive no financial support during the process, and this is not a deterrent. The two large differences between these professional careers and the sciences are that the career at the end has a high probability of being rewarding, and the period of training is for a well-defined duration. These careers achieve success where STEM doctoral education fails, and the success is achieved without any attention to student financial support policies. The co-chairs feel strongly that as long as the career path for scientists and engineers with PhDs is poorly defined and not clearly rewarding at its conclusion, problems of attracting and retaining sufficiently many STEM graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will persist. While financial support policy can be used to partially compensate for these costs, it is likely that the compensation levels required to fully remediate these factors would exceed what national policy permits. The co-chairs further feel that STEM graduate education, and therefore stipend policy, suffers from contradictions of purpose. While the graduate education community views graduate education and, to a lesser degree postdoctoral training as a workforce development problem, the fact remains that graduate students and postdocs are the workhorses of the scientific research enterprise. The relationship between graduate students and postdocs with faculty is both a labor-management relationship and a student teacher one. It is important to recognize that any change in stipend policy has large ramifications in the cost of producing scientific research. As Richard Freeman pointed out, the ever-lengthening postdoc phenomenon is perhaps largely the result of an attempt to build a stable, cheap labor force for science. Structural changes in the normal operation of the research enterprise are likely needed to remedy this problem, probably in the form of permanent staff scientist ranks supplanting long-term postdocs. Clear graduate support policies require clear policy goals. The tension between the two goals of producing affordable high quality research while simultaneously producing a science workforce will continue to make national policy difficult. This tension exceeded the scope of this workshop on financial support of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers and would comprise a worthy topic for a future workshop. There is considerable discussion and disagreement about whether there are too many or too few STEM graduates for national needs*. The answer is 'yes' to both possibilities. There are too many STEM graduates so narrowly trained that their expertise cannot be applied in a variety of venues (cf. the COSEPUP report on broadening the Ph.D. In the end, the Task Force did not feel that there was sufficient data linking both the national data and NSF support data to make recommendations for major revisions in the mix of NSF funding. In February 1996 the NSB Task Force delivered its report. The report noted that there were major institutional and disciplinary variation in time to degree, and that shorter time-to-degree occurred for students who were supported than for those who were not. The report recommended: \u2022 Limited studies should be conducted on alternative modes of graduate support with defined goals and assessment criteria. \u2022 SRS and/or SBE (Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences) should support data collection and/or research on funding mechanisms and various aspects of graduate student education and employment \u2022 Special attention should be paid to the role of foreign students in the STEM enterprise."}, {"section_title": "Workshop Report", "text": "On June 17-18 th , 2004, the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) sponsored a workshop at the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) to discuss emerging issues, research, and current practices related to financial support for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.

CSSP plans to work with the CGS on a systematic study of people who have obtained science degrees to learn about their experiences as a guide to future national policy. Specifically, they raised the following issues: \u2022 CSSP recognizes that research in the American academy and across the nation is dependent upon the highest quality graduate and postdoctoral education. o CSSP will participate in any venues thought likely to advance the number and quality of U.S. graduate students completing science and mathematics degrees. The Postdoc focus group recommended limiting the number of Ph.D.s in those fields that are marketsaturated. The postdocs wanted mutually agreed upon conditions for their positions and also a greater emphasis on training rather than only producing research for their supervisors. The postdocs took the radical stand that a reduction in the number of awards to support postdocs would be acceptable in exchange for addressing the concerns of the remaining ones. Specific opinions and recommendations of this group are below: \u2022 Is money a factor in the decision making process when choosing schools and postdoctoral positions? o The general consensus of the focus group was that anyone who values money will likely opt out of an advanced science degree either during their undergraduate studies or before the completion of their dissertation. It should be noted that this is anecdotal evidence. \u2022 What are the largest problems with the current system from a postdoc's viewpoint? o Lack of training. Since the emphasis is focused on production, learning other skills that would benefit a future scientist is deemphasized. o Substandard compensation and benefits. The low cost of postdocs is good from a societal viewpoint in the short term but may result in long-term disincentives. o Time to independence. Longer postdoctoral positions result in an increase in the age at which independence is reached. o The large amount of risk aversion by the funding agencies towards young scientists. o The requirement to choose between career and family life, especially for women who seek academic positions. o Postdocs have been forced to engage in an arms race where training has been neglected in favor of production. This is brought about by the reliance upon publication number as an indicator of skill/accomplishment. The report from graduate students actually was a summary from several groups of students, including a convening of student at the annual meeting of the Conference of Southern Graduate Schools, and several convenings of graduate students in Florida. Kelly Browning, President of the Graduate and Professional Student Organization at the University of South Florida, reported on the following main themes: \u2022 Health Care: Providing health care is essential, and is the single largest financial factor for graduate students (e.g. even if stipends aren't that high, if health care is covered it's much less of a problem). Several students observed that the demographics of graduate school are shifting; students tend to be older and/or married, and less likely to have coverage through their parents, even when getting an MS. The change in demographics makes health care an even higher priority. \u2022 Funds for Professional Participation: Surprisingly, many students stressed, that to them, adequate funding to actively participate in their professions through travel to professional meetings was a higher priority to them than additional salary. They would prefer fellowship awards to include a research or travel allowance rather than additional stipend. \u2022 Career Uncertainty: The students attending the meeting felt that stipends didn't play a huge role in their decision to pursue an advanced degree, and even less so in what field they chose. However, while passion for the subject matter was the guiding role in their choice of field, a major concern was the ability to have a stable career once graduate school was completed. Many were not optimistic about their future options for staying in the field of their choice after graduate school. Similar themes were echoed on the report from the AAAS Fellows focus group. The AAAS Fellows attending the focus group were a mix of recent PhD graduates, people recently completing postdoctoral appointments, and those in mid-career, many of whom had chosen to leave academia for other career paths. After a presentation by NIH and NSF panelists, the fellows were asked to respond on a range of issues, including ranking there priorities on financial issues. An hour of spirited discussion followed. Three major themes emerged: \u2022 Stipends can only have a negative, not positive effect on career decisions. No one felt another couple of thousand dollars in grad school stipends would have influenced their career decisions so long as a minimum standard of living could be maintained. So, while too little money would drive them away, a little more would not attract them. \u2022 Health Care is part of a minimum standard of living. Some decisions were predicated on health care concerns (both career and family decisions) \u2022 The biggest factor in deciding to pursue advanced study, or to stay in science and engineering, was not a financial factor relating to grad school, but rather uncertainty about future careers. This uncertainty manifested in two main ways: o Uncertainty about requirements to complete the PhD; this often seemed like a murky road, with no clear understanding of what had to be done to reach the end of it, and this was discouraging. Support Workshop 6-04 o Uncertainty about future career options. In many cases, they knew that once they graduated, there might be one or multiple postdocs for an indefinite number of years; followed by a job hunt, which may or may not lead to a job, which may or may not provide financial security. Many had friends who left for law, business, or medical school to find a clearer path. The biggest financial issue was early career finance, not grad school finance, as long as minimum standards were met. The graduate deans report was based on a focus group breakfast held at the CGS annual meeting in December 2003. Dean Howard Jackson of the University of Cincinnati reported on the issue from the perspective of the deans. Unsurprisingly the list of issues included: Other issues that were in some sense a subset of these overarching issues included: questions concerning doctoral mentoring and time to degree; the availability of support from university communities of women, of minorities, and of international students; special concerns of married students; and special concerns for first year graduate students. Stipends level concerns included the issue of support for first year students who are rarely on research assistantships. If graduate students are supported on fellowships (either NSF or internal university fellowships), the group expressed some concern about integration into the departmental culture. Questions of how the transition from higher stipend fellowships to normal RA and TA funding takes place were also raised. The stipend level concerns also are embedded in the larger issue of the size of NSF or NIH grants, which are not rising, with the suggested increases of graduate student stipends. This is hardly a new issue, but it is not being addressed in any imaginative way at this time. A corollary to this concern is the support of postdocs. As the graduate student stipend rises, are fewer graduate students being supported and more postdocs? Graduate deans discussed the need for a more holistic view of the costs of graduate education. They emphasized that support is more than just stipends; the integration of students into their programs and how stipend and tuition support in various forms can be used to facilitate this integration is a key issue. Different forms of support may be more critical at different times in a student's career, and different students may have different needs. Support should be structured to lead to desired outcomesindependent scholars, well prepared teachers, researchers able to work in interdisciplinary environments, etc. Although time to degree was a significant concern, the group also was interested in professional development opportunities including some teaching experience for all graduate students. One suggestion to address the time to degree was to provide \"last year\" support to graduate students. As in all the other focus groups, support for health insurance was regarded as a key factor. At one university, which supports health insurance at the 50% level, a survey indicated that the single most important factor in their losing students to other programs was the \"insufficient\" health insurance support. Support Workshop 6-04 The health care and early career themes were the most repeated topics throughout the panel and all of the focus group meetings throughout the year."}, {"section_title": "Cost-of-Education Allowance", "text": "Once the wish lists, provided by the focus groups, were out on the table, the workshop agenda focused on university and national issues related to stipend level vs. cost-of-education (COE) allowance. While stipends have increased in the past few years, COE allowance has remained constant. Particularly at NSF, while the fellowship stipend level has doubled since 1998, the COE remains unchanged during that time period. Over a longer time period, tuition increases have significantly outpaced COE increases, and the recent spike in tuition cost nationwide has exacerbated the problem. This has resulted in a subtle policy shift. While for decades, the COE allowance actually subsidized universities hosting fellows and trainees, in recent years the allowance often results in a substantial shortfall. Jeff Reimer, the Associate Dean of the Graduate School at UC-Berkeley, provided background on the situation and discussed how the shortfall was being managed at Berkeley. Walter Schaffer of the National Institutes of Health presented the process by which the NIH arrived at their formula for computing cost of education. The NIH approach was predicated on the assumption that training was a shared responsibility of the university and the agency. As a result, the NIH provides allowances for some costs, such as travel and health care, and a graduated scale for providing tuition, with only a percentage of tuition beyond a certain cap paid. A number of graduate deans questioned the government's priorities in raising stipends, but not COE allowances. Economists in the audience insisted increasing stipends is the only meaningful tool of enticing citizens into otherwise not particularly attractive science careers. Federal agency representatives pointed out that the political reality is that it was not a choice between stipends or COE; it was higher stipends or nothing. Advocacy of the COE issue is not usefully directed at the agencies, but rather at federal political units. It was also noted that COE allowances are applicable only to a select few traineeship and fellowship programs, effecting less than 20% of federally supported graduate students, and a very small fraction of the total STEM graduate student population. Nevertheless, it was clear that COE allowances that are insufficient to cover tuition, fees and benefits are putting a great strain on many institutions. While issues of support for underrepresented students were present, to varying degrees, in each of the workshop sessions, Margaret Daniels Tyler and Anthony Rene provided additional targeted information. They discussed strategic financial considerations in enhancing the minority presence in STEM graduate cohorts. Dr. Tyler made the key observation that \"relationship building is the corner stone.\" Dr. Rene outlined specific NIH programs available for minority students. The second day of the workshop began with a series of observations about STEM trends from Alan Leshner. According to Dr. Leshner, a tension exists among the needs, types, and levels of available support for graduate and postdoctoral researchers. Assistantships serve multiple functions and must prepare trainees, graduate students, and postdocs for a wider range of places to work. He also notes that two of the most rapidly changing trends in science and its conduct are the roles of industry and technology. Industry is providing a greater share of support for research and researchers, and is similarly performing a greater share of the research. Where science once drove changes and developments in technology, the reverse is quickly emerging as the stronger truth. Another point is that as \"big science\", that is, larger team science, continues to grow, multidisciplinary training is essential. Dr. Leshner concluded with two questions regarding the future of our research agenda -first, are our training approaches appropriate for the science enterprise of the future? Second, are we financing training in appropriate ways? Richard Freeman continued the discussion of the research agenda by questioning what science workforce policy seeks or needs to maximize. His initial response was that our national agenda must change and that we need to produce high quality researchers as quickly and cheaply as possible. In order to increase the number of U.S. citizens completing the doctoral degree in STEM fields, stipends are an important tool, but we must also improve career attractiveness. He suggests that we consider alternatives to current funding models, particularly the distribution of funds during the course of a graduate career and the time to first professional position. (He suggested, for example, guaranteeing five years of graduate support to the Ph.D., essentially the same suggestion as was made by Dean David Chapman during the Dean's Focus Group and the CGS annual meeting in December 2003.) Dr. Freeman's closing, \"radical thoughts:\" the costs of spending money for stipend payments in order to increase the supply of quality researchers are minute compared to other government expenditures, yet the benefits are potentially enormous for the economic and research agenda."}, {"section_title": "Breakout Groups and Workshop Summary", "text": "The final day of the workshop included a set of breakout groups focusing on a potential research agenda, best practices for universities, and variables for setting stipend policy. Joan Lorden, Provost of UNC-Charlotte, provided the report for the breakout group focusing on research agenda. The strongest theme sounded was our poor understanding of graduate education stating, \"We don't know who's coming to graduate school and why. We don't know very much about the experiences of students\u2026while they're in graduate school, and we don't know where they go when they leave.\" It was noted that there exist only very poor measures of quality on both the input and output sides. It was also noted that while there have been fellowship/traineeship studies; little work has been done to examine students on research assistantships. Les Sims of the Council of Graduate Schools reported on universities' \"best ideas\" on the financial issues for STEM graduate students and postdocs. Chief among these ideas was that university leadership should be involved in public policy decisions on these issues. After the policies have been established, universities should do their best for their students including holding harmless the students from undesirable consequences, as well as help the STEM education mission for the Nation. There was interest in the idea of assuring first and fifth (last) year Ph.D. support for graduate students. This has the corollary of suggesting federal agencies provide temporal flexibility in the relevant awards. Finally, it was noted, \"the communication and clear understanding of expectations (between faculty and research assistants) was a very strong point in the discussion.\" Support Workshop 6-04 Walter Goldschmidts of the National Institutes of Health reported from the breakout group discussing important variables for determining stipend policies. The central conclusion is that STEM training is a partnership activity, not solely the responsibility of either the universities or the federal agencies. Another point, which echoed themes from throughout the workshop, was that the topic of stipends is better transcended by the more inclusive notion of packages. The number one issue for federal agencies is to fulfill the purposes of their programs, which may not be in line with university goals. Agencies emphasize outcomes, which include aspects of accountability, equity and quality. Judith Ramaley, the Assistant Director for Education and Human Resources from the National Science Foundation, closed the meeting by providing a summation and forward steps. Dr. Ramaley posed several questions that the workshop raised that remain challenges for federal policy: \u2022 What is the proper role for the federal government? o Note that federal government provides 20% of the support, universities 40% and selfsupport 40%. o Should the federal government play a leading or following role in packaging support and shaping university priorities? \u2022 What are appropriate policy goals for investing in graduate education? \u2022 What are we learning about the effects of federal stipends, institutional support and tuition changes et al.? Dr. Ramaley went on to say that modern graduate/postdoc study does not fit the patterns of the past and that all of the partners, the federal agencies, universities and others, should take this into account, and remember that graduate education is a partnership."}, {"section_title": "MPS Conference", "text": "The Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate (MPS) planned and hosted a conference in June 1995 on education and employment patterns of graduates in the physical sciences. The participants discussed many of the same issues raised in the COSEPUP report but concentrated on the physical and mathematical sciences. A report on the conference \"Graduate Education and Postdoctoral Training in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences: Workshop Report\" (NSF 96-21) was released some time after the workshop. The report made the following recommendations: 1) Mechanisms should be found to encourage a broadening of the training and educational experience of MPS graduate students. 2) Mechanisms should be examined for shortening the average time to the Ph.D. degree in the MPS fields. Support Workshop 6-04 3) The use of off-campus experiences, such as industrial internships, should be increased. 4) Efforts should be made to decrease gradually the proportion of graduate students funded as research assistants and to increase gradually the proportion funded by other mechanisms, including traineeships and fellowships, as well as novel, collective modes of support. NSF's Women & Science Conference \"The Women & Science: Celebrating Achievements, Charting Challenges\" conference was held in December 1995. It was a joint effort of the seven NSF Directorates. The purpose of the conference was to take stock of the achievements that women have made, assess what works best in the classroom and workplace, and to begin to chart a new course to address the challenges that remain. Due to the background of conference participants, much of the focus was on women in academia. Graduate education was one of many issues addressed. (Conference report at http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1997/nsf9775/) Engineering Workforce Project The Engineering Workforce project also commenced during this period. The project explored the way engineering education-at all levels, not just the Ph.D.-related to career activities and outcomes. A major objective was to develop an engineering workforce profile examining such issues as: engineering education, careers, and occupational activities; engineers as managers; engineers in industry and government; engineering and computer-related operations; and engineers in the defense industry. SBE participated in the project both by providing funding along with ENG, CISE, and EHR and by providing staff oversight and guidance on use of SRS data.

The Group delivered an internal report on May 15, 1996. The report outlined a portfolio of innovative activities to enrich U.S. graduate education and postdoctoral training that had been developed through both NSF-wide programs and discipline/Directorate-based programs. Despite all the ongoing activities, the Group indicated that it believed the Foundation could and should do more. It suggested a set of pilot projects that would fine-tune and selectively expand the existing NSF portfolio, rather than encourage radical reinvention. A new inter-Directorate group was established to begin developing an integrated graduate education and researchtraining program for the Foundation."}, {"section_title": "Working Group on Graduate Education Data", "text": "In mid-April, 1996, a second Working Group, the Data Group on Graduate Education, was established (including two SRS representatives) and asked to develop, structure, and outline plans for the NSF in three areas: \u2022 The Group's internal report, \"Data for Monitoring and Analyzing Graduate Education,\" was presented to the Data Needs Committee of SMIG, consisting of Susan Cozzens (Office of Policy Support (OPS)), Cora Marrett (SBE), and Luther Williams (EHR) in July 1996 and then transmitted to the entire SMIG in August 1996. The main conclusions of the Working Group Report were that NSF currently collects very little information on the graduate students it supports, except for those applying to the Graduate Fellowship program, and that linkages between NSF internal data bases and national data bases are almost non-existent. The report's main recommendations were: decide how much career tracking of NSF supported graduate students is warranted; ensure that NSF can know how many graduate student fellows, trainees, and research assistants it supports in any given year, whether or not they are full-time students, and some indication of the extent of its support; formulate studies on a number of important issues such as relationship of graduate school experience to careers, dimensions of graduate school experience, and the differential impacts of mechanisms of support on time to degree."}, {"section_title": "Former SRS Division Director Ken Brown's Paper on Graduate Data", "text": "At the same time the Data Group was drafting its report, Ken Brown (former Division Director of SRS) was asked by Cora Marrett (AD of SBE) to prepare a paper independently recommending actions by the Foundation that would help meet its needs for information on graduate education. Brown's July draft internal report, \"Meeting the Foundation's Needs for Information on Graduate Education,\" recognized that acquisition of data is often expensive and was therefore cautious about recommending expensive new initiatives and focused more strongly on how to ensure that data are truly useful. Among his report's conclusions are: the NSF, NSB, and others will have a continuing need for data, not just on support mechanisms for graduate education, but well beyond; although NSF should always look for data to illuminate decisions, it should recognize that many questions are not quantifiable; the search for information should not be limited to NSF-generated data, and must extend beyond the Foundation's resources into other Federal agencies and information-collecting organizations. The report recommended that: SRS should take a more active role in advising users of its data and deducing from their needs the specific changes to be made in its surveys; and NSF should have better access to external expertise on graduate education, either by setting up an external mechanism to get advice on the key issues of graduate education or by setting up internal groups to bring in experts and draft short pieces on future issues and corresponding data needs."}, {"section_title": "NSF Reports Redesign Group", "text": "At the same time, the NSF Reports Redesign Group, in existence for a little over a year, had been developing new electronic interim and final reports modules (for FastLane) that principal investigators would be expected to fill out on an annual basis. One of the sections considered for inclusion in these reports was a \"participants\" section that would collect the names of all participants in the project, including graduate students. For those graduate students that had significant participation in the project, additional demographic and tracking information would be requested including social security number and date of birth. Acquiring such information would permit career tracking of graduate students receiving NSF support and would ultimately be useful for evaluation of NSF programs relating to graduate education. These recommendations were never put into effect primarily due to concerns of privacy and undue burden on respondents."}, {"section_title": "Graduate Education Budget Initiatives for FY 97 and FY 98", "text": "In FY 96 NSF senior management made a decision to devote $2 million of the FY 98 budget for graduate education activities. A plan was developed by SBE in mid-August 1996, with input from OPS and EHR, that would permit NSF to plan for improvements in the data compiled on graduate education, support the expansion of knowledge about graduate education and its consequences, and create partnerships to assure timely information on the graduate education endeavor. In late August, staff members from SBE, EHR, and OPS participated in the development of a proposal for hastening the data enhancements for graduate education if monies from the 1996 Director's Opportunity Fund were to be made available in FY 97. Subsequently, $1 million from the 1996 Opportunity Fund was allocated for data enhancements for graduate education in FY 1997. The NSF Working Group recommended stronger linkages between NSF funding data and those from national surveys. Such data would permit analysis of trends in support mechanisms and outcomes such as time to degree, career choice, and career success. Three activities were initiated in FY97 to begin implementing the recommendation. 1. Expanding the sample of the biennial Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) to include all recent S&E PhDs who received NSF graduate fellowships. This would enable the Foundation to track and analyze the careers of these students and to compare them with other groups. Since the new sample for the SDR was to be drawn in FY97, making an investment of funds in FY1997 would permit beginning this sample expansion immediately rather than waiting for the 1999 survey. Approximately 1000 holders of NSF Graduate Fellowship awards received S&E PhDs annually. Including the 1995 and 1996 PhDs in the FY 97 survey would involve an addition of about 2,000 individuals to the sample. The sample was expanded to include NSF graduate fellowships and the data were collected. Joan Burrelli analyzed the data while she was serving a detail in DGE. The internal report she produced looked at differences between NSF fellows, quality group 2 non-awardees, and other recent doctorate recipients in time to degree, debt, subsequent employment, and perceptions of the adequacy of their doctoral programs. The major findings were that NSF fellows took slightly less time to complete their doctorate, found jobs faster, had less debt, were more likely to have research assistantships, and were more likely to be in a tenure track position than other recent doctorate recipients. 2. Enlarging the SDR sample by including more recent PhDs and examining the feasibility of speeding up the processing of the data for all new PhDs. Widespread concern with the current labor market for new S&E PhDs at the time combined with the lack of both timely data and a large enough sample in the SDR to track their early careers highlighted a need for faster processing of SDR data for new PhDs and for further expansion of the SDR sample. The earlier availability of the data would provide quicker signals about the current labor market for new PhDs. The larger sample would permit better tracking of new PhDs through their early careers (e.g., how long one remains in a postdoc position). While the sample was expanded to include about 4,000 additional recent Ph.D.s, a change in contractor from the National Academies to NORC precluded the examination of speeding up the processing of the data for all new PhDs. 3. Testing the feasibility of using university accounting and financial systems to identify by name graduate students receiving NSF support. If university systems could be used to identify students receiving NSF support, the agency could reduce the reporting burden on PIs. The information could also supplement that derived from other surveys. Since NSF and universities were both examining or instituting changes in their data and information systems to further increased accountability at the time, it was felt that such a study would provide an interactive framework that might help identify best practices and assist both the Foundation and universities in implementing new approaches to gathering and storing information. A workshop was held in June 1997 in which a number of individuals from a representative set of universities were brought together to discuss a number of questions relating to their financial and accounting systems, especially to the availability of student-specific information. If there were consensus that this was a feasible approach, the next step would involve a review of the systems in about 20 institutions. Although it turned out that there was no consensus that this was a feasible approach, many of the participants thought that NSF might be able to collect two sets of data directly from universities: 1) aggregate data on race/ethnicity; and gender and 2) a list of individuals receiving NSF support, but including only public information (no social security numbers)."}, {"section_title": "Integrated Graduate Education and Research Training Program", "text": "At about the same time the inter-Directorate data group was formed, another inter-Directorate group was established to develop an integrated graduate education and research-training program. The goal of the new program was to respond to the growing need for researchers/teachers educated beyond the boundaries of a single narrow discipline and to facilitate the integration of research and education outside traditional boundaries. This led to the development of the IGERT Program. Human Resources Development Task Force (HRDTF) and Working Group (HRDWG) These entities were created to work on increasing the participation and success rates of women, members of historically underrepresented minority groups, and persons with disabilities in science and engineering at all levels of education. In September 1997, the HRDWG sponsored a roundtable discussion on strategies and tactics for increasing the participation and success rates of women, members of historically underrepresented minority groups, and persons with disabilities, as graduate students in science, mathematics and engineering, chaired by NSB member Dr. Claudia Mitchell-Kernan."}, {"section_title": "SRS/Professional Societies Workshop on Graduate Student", "text": "Attrition SRS, in conjunction with a number of science and engineering professional societies, held a Workshop on Graduate School Attrition on September 22, 1997. Participants included representatives of the academic research and graduate education administration communities, along with officials from disciplinary professional societies, NSF, and other government scientific agencies. The purpose of the workshop was to address key gaps in knowledge and data about the problem of graduate student attrition. Specific gaps addressed included knowledge and understanding of the overall extent of doctoral student attrition; factors that influence whether or not students complete their doctoral degrees; the impacts that such decisions have on their future earnings and labor force experiences; and further data that would be needed to assess more confidently the extent, causes, and consequences of graduate student attrition. The workshop focused on the problem of students who intend to obtain the doctorate rather than the master's as the terminal degree.

The conference was held in Washington, DC in June 1998. The conference was shaped by two primary purposes: 1. To share what has been learned about some of the featured practices for strengthening graduate education in science and engineering, and 2. To learn from one another about alternative strategies for successfully implementing change and innovation. The conference began by attempting to provide a foundation and framework for fruitful discussion by focusing on past, present, and future visions of graduate education in science and engineering. The remainder of the forum was organized around two sets of conversations. The first set focused on featured practices for strengthening graduate education in science and engineering at the individual, department, program, college, institutional, and inter-institutional levels. The second set focused on strategies for initiating and implementing change and innovation. Participants were invited to compare and contrast models of change and to describe alternate strategies for serving educational infrastructure, business and industry, and students and society.

In the paper, the Board identified some troubling issues that have emerged as a result of changes over the last fifty years, and offered recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the partnership for all concerned. The Board suggested new opportunities, particularly those offered by advances in communications technology, to expand the benefits of the partnership to a wider range of institutions in the academic research and engineering ecosystem, and to broaden the options for graduate students to experience environments outside the research university to supplement their core Ph.D. training. In addition, the Board drew attention to serious stresses in the partnership arising from administrative and accounting changes implemented by Federal funding and regulatory agencies. The Board provided recommendations in several areas: Federal support to the enterprise, breadth versus narrowness of graduate education, human resource policies, and impact of Federal regulatory and funding practices on the culture of institutions. Finally, the Board commented on outstanding issues to be negotiated between the Federal and university partners.

The objective of this workshop was to provide NSF, SRS, and the National Science Board with analyses of recent changes in graduate science and engineering education and international mobility of scientists and engineers among these regions. About a dozen international experts prepared country papers covering the main workshop topics: expansion of graduate capacity, educational reforms, the role of government and industry in supporting and employing S&E graduates, and the patterns of international mobility of scientists and engineers.

The study found that the way in which students financed their graduate education varied primarily by major field of study and type of institution. Assuming that financing a graduate education through grants and part-time assistantships (often related to the student's studies) would be preferable to taking out loans and working full time, graduate students in natural sciences and mathematics and those attending institutions classified as Research University I were more likely to receive preferable forms of financial aid, such as grants and assistantships. Graduate students in social sciences and psychology and those attending Master's/Baccalaureate institutions were less likely to obtain such financial aid packages. At the same time, science/engineering graduate students as a whole received more preferable forms of financial aid than their counterparts in the arts/humanities. That is, they were less likely to borrow and more likely to receive financial aid in the form of grants and assistantships.

It was felt that a longitudinal survey of beginning graduate students might be the only way to effectively collect information that could address issues such as: relationships of funding mechanisms to graduate school experiences (time to degree, persistence, completion, transition patterns between fields or institutions, transition patterns from education to work, and integration of research and education) and other issues of the relationships between various graduate school experiences and subsequent career outcomes. These issues could not be addressed with existing surveys sampling only successful doctorate completers. Nor could they be addressed with administrative records that cannot be used to follow students to identify relationships among experiences at different stages of education and work.

Variables included in the analysis in addition to primary support mechanism included doctoral field, personal characteristics (for example, age, race/ethnicity, citizenship, marital status), parents' education, field and institution paths (that is, how often individuals switch academic fields and institutions), and cumulative debt. The study found relatively large differences in the simple averages of time to degree computed across alternative support mechanisms before the variables mentioned above were included in the analysis.
