[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This study examines cross-sectional age differences, longitudinal age changes, and secular changes in obligatory, committed, and discretionary activities, using activity questionnaires completed by men and women participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging between 1958 and 1992. (1) Time spent, on obligatory activities and passive leisure is greatest, and on committed activities and active leisure least, for older adults. (2) Longitudinal patterns usually mirror cross-sectional ones. There are pronounced exceptions for women whose paid work time has been increasing and housework decreasing, while cross-sectional patterns show the reverse. (3) Over recent decades, time in committed activities shifted in opposite ways for men and women. Men decreased paid work and increased housework, repairs and yardwork, shopping, and child-care, while women increased paid work and decreased housework. In sum, the age structure of activities has persisted in the midst of new social opportunities; gender roles have proven more malleable than age roles.\nA S people age, their activities change due to shifts in L preferences, constraints, abilities, and health. The changes occur in many ways -the specific activities a person does, procedures to accomplish them, frequency, and duration. Stated briefly, these features are what, how, how often, and how long. Together, frequency and duration determine the amount of time spent on an activity in a day or a year.\nThis analysis examines time spent in 14 activity domains that span obligatory, committed, and discretionary activities.

In sociology, the strongest tradition of activity research is in time-use (time budget) studies Stafford, 1985, 1991; Szalai, 1972) . Subjects are asked to report all activities for a 24-hour period with start and stop times, either retrospectively by an interview about \"yesterday\" or prospectively by keeping a diary. Before the 1970s, samples were often limited to ages 18-64, thus excluding older persons; this has changed so there is now no upper age bound. Subjects' data are aggregated for analyses.\nParticipation rates (percentages doing an activity) and minutes per day (average minutes for an activity) for subgroups, such as gender or employment status, are reported. Age differences were of little interest until the past decade, and some major studies do not report them (Chapin, 1974; Szalai, 1972) .\nAlthough gerontology studies have a deeper descriptive and theoretical interest in age differences, their perspective on activities is often limited. (1) Studies tend to focus on selected specific domains such as leisure, or ADLs and IADLs, or productive activities (Altergott, 1988; Gordon and Gaitz, 1976; Herzog et al., 1989) . Until recently, virtually all research on older persons' activities was about leisure (Burrus-Bammel and Bammel, 1985; Cutler and Hendricks, 1990; Gordon and Gaitz, 1976; Kleemeier, 1961) . From the 1980s onward, interest in disability prompted a focus on personal care (ADLs) and household management (IADLs) activities. Recently, research on paid and unpaid productive activities (e.g., job, housework, child-care, volunteer work) has developed to offset the unbalanced view that older persons' lives are devoted to leisure and self-care. For particularly thoughtful reviews of activities in late life, see Lawton (1985a Lawton ( , 1985b . (2) Gerontology studies often focus solely on older persons either by limiting the survey sample to older ages or by choosing older respondents from a broad dataset for secondary analysis (Altergott, 1988) . (3) Even when a wide age span is used, results are usually cross-sectional. It is hard to say how well the age differences reflect age changes, that is, how activities change as individuals age. Longitudinal (intra-individual) data on activity changes are sparse, as noted by Cutler and Hendricks (1990) . Longitudinal data that do exist are retrospective or of limited prospective duration; for example, changes in leisure activities of retired men over 3 years (Bosse and Ekerdt, 1981; Parnes et al., 1985) , time-use AGING AND ACTIVITIES S31 changes for married couples over 6 years (Juster, 1985b) , and changes in leisure activities of older men and women over 7 years (Schmitz-Scherzer, 1976) . Although the Duke Longitudinal Study had a long prospective stretch of many years, changes in only a few activities were studied: paid job (retirement), social leisure (socializing, entertaining, voluntary associations, etc.) , and sexual behavior (Palmore, 1981) .\nRarely are sociological and gerontological interests combined (Little, 1984) . With the BLSA data, we can join sociology's expansive content (all activities) and comparative perspective (age differences) with gerontology's theoretical interest in the aging process (age changes). We study age differences and age changes in all activities ranging from hobbies to hygiene for persons ages 18 + ."}, {"section_title": "The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging", "text": "The raison-d'etre of the BLSA is to reveal aging processes in humans, that is, biological and physiological changes that are not disease-related (Shock et al., 1984) . The central goal is to portray natural aging rather than normative aging, which includes deleterious impacts of environmental and personal risk factors. This distinction is also called successful vs usual aging (Rowe and Kahn, 1987) or, alternatively, aging processes vs aging syndrome (Fozard, Metter, and Brant, 1990) . The open-panel design of BLSA makes for both analytic complexity and scientific opportunity. It gives analysts the chance to identify age changes in many cohorts, and it routinely permits comparisons of cross-sectional differences with longitudinal changes.\nStudies from BLSA have shown that the longitudinal course of physiological parameters can differ from that suggested in cross-sectional data (e.g., Brant and Fozard, 1990; Fozard, Metter, and Brant, 1990; Gittings and Fozard, 1986; Hallfrisch et al., 1988) . Here, we use social parameters in BLSA and compare cross-sectional and longitudinal patterns. The issue of natural vs normative aging is not germane for social data; no matter what time perspective is used, societal and psychosocial factors penetrate them. Instead, the goal is to study the social experience of aging in a particular population, attentive at all points to social forces."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "This section describes the data source and sample, survey questionnaire and analysis variables, and technical procedures."}, {"section_title": "Sample", "text": "Data were obtained from an activity questionnaire filled out by participants in the BLSA, an open-panel longitudinal study of community-dwelling adult volunteers (Shock et al., 1984) . Men first entered the study in 1958 and women in 1978. Until the 1980s, participants were largely White upper-middle-class persons; efforts then began to recruit more non-White and blue collar persons. The current design calls for a minimum of 30 active participants in every age decade (<20, 20-29, . . . , 80-89 ; no minimum specified for 90 + ) at any given time, for both men and, women. The BLSA participants have a series of examinations and questionnaires every two years. BLSA is currently conducted by the Gerontology Research Center, National Institute on Aging.\nThe activity questionnaire is administered at every visit. It was used sporadically from 1958 through 1965; regular administration began in 1966 and has continued since then. Data for all questionnaires from 1958 through March 1992 are studied here. There are 8,572 questionnaires available for 1,816 individuals (1,249 males, 567 females). Men had an average of 5.5 questionnaires (range 1-19); women had 3.0 (range 1-9). At their first BLSA visit, men's average age was 53.1 (range 18-96); women's was 52.6 (17-94)."}, {"section_title": "Questionnaire and Variables", "text": "Activities. -The questionnaire, called Activity Questionnaire II, asks the amount of time spent on 108 activities at home, job, and recreation. Subjects give time estimates in any units (hours per day, days per year, etc.). These are converted into a standard metric (minutes per day) during coding. The questionnaire's initial purpose was to provide estimates of calories expended per day (McGandy et al., 1966) ; the items range from physically passive to active pursuits.\nThe 108 items cover a broad scope of activities. Using classification schemes developed for time-use research (Chapin, 1974; Juster and Stafford, 1985; Szalai, 1972) , we organized them into 14 major domains: personal care, sleep and resting, walking, local transportation and distant trips, paid work, housework and food preparation, household repairs and yard maintenance, shopping and errands, child-care and elder-care, socializing with friends and relatives, entertainment away from home, public service/religious/club/ adult education activities, hobbies and other leisure, and active sports and physical recreation. They are abbreviated hereafter as Personal Care, Sleep and Rest, Walking, Transportation, Paid Work, Housework, Repairs and Yard, Shopping, Child-care, Socializing, Entertainment, Public Service, Hobbies and Leisure, and Sports. A list of the 108 specific items and their major domains is available on request.\nThe domains are organized in three overarching types of activity: Obligatory, Committed, Discretionary. These terms distinguish among activities required for survival and self-sufficiency (Personal Care, Sleep and Rest, Walking, Transportation), principal productive roles and household management activities (Paid Work, Housework, Repairs and Yard, Shopping, Child-care), and free-time pursuits (Socializing, Entertainment, Public Service, Hobbies and Leisure, Sports). Because mobility is essential for getting to roles and pursuits, it is placed in the obligatory category.\nThe three terms are similar but not identical to those used elsewhere (Aas, 1978; Altergott, 1988; Chapin, 1974; Juster and Stafford, 1985; Moss and Lawton, 1982) . In truth, activities are not so wholly obligatory, committed, or discretionary as the labels suggest (Aas, 1978; Chapin, 1974; Lawton, 1982) . Why an individual does an activity may be a mixture of constraint and choice, and different individuals can vary greatly in that mixture.\nThe BLSA activity data differ from time-use data. For the latter, respondents record all activities during a day; these are coded by a comprehensive classification of human activi-ties; each person's minutes add up to 24 hours. For BLSA, the list of activities is extensive but not comprehensive of all human activities; minutes do not add to 24 hours. Time-use researchers call this a stylized protocol (Juster, 1985c) . Empirical comparisons of stylized vs diary formats are in Robinson (1985b) . Two other formats for activity information have been used: a checklist indicating participation in various activities (Aas, 1978) and direct observation and recording of activities (Baltes, 1988; Bakes, Wahl, and Schmid-Furstoss, 1990; Clark, Czaja, and Weber, 1990; Czaja, Weber, and Nair, 1993) .\nDependent variables. -Descriptive analyses discuss participation rates (percent with ^ 1 minute per day), and average minutes per day (for all persons and for just participants) by age and gender subgroups for the 14 activity domains. For multivariate analyses, minutes per day for individuals are used for the 14 domains.\nPredictors. -We study variations in activities by age, gender, and date. Age is exact age at a BLSA visit (years plus proportion of year expressed in first decimal). Gender is a dummy variable with men = 1 and women = 0. Date is exact date of a BLSA visit (year plus proportion of year expressed in first decimal). In descriptive results, age is collapsed to age decades (<20, 20-29, . . . , 80-89, 90 + ) , and date is collapsed to time decades (1960s, . . . , 1990s) ."}, {"section_title": "Procedures", "text": "To accomplish each of the three types of analysis (crosssectional, longitudinal, secular), we chose appropriate portions of the whole data set: (1) The cross-sectional sample uses each individual's first questionnaire; this is usually from his/her first BLSA visit. Because each subject is represented just once in the cross-sectional sample, problems that would arise in a pooled sample of all visits are absent (e.g., unequal visits per individual; possible training effects in filling out the questionnaire). The sample is not cross-sectional in the usual sense, where data come from a single time-point; BLSA first questionnaires span 1958 to 1992. (2) For longitudinal analyses of individual change, we use subjects with four or more activity questionnaires; thus, 4 -I-BLSA visits. This is 57 percent of the men (n = 715) but only 34 percent of the women (n = 195) due to their later start in 1978. (3) For secular trends over decades (1960s, . . . , 1990s) , the analysis sample is constructed so subjects contribute data just once to an age decade-time decade pair. Operationally, for a given time decade, a person's earliest visit in an age decade (such as 30-39) is chosen; if s/he advances to another age decade within the same time period, s/he can contribute there as well. For example, for the 1970s time decade, a man age 47 at a 1972 BLSA visit provides data for age decade 40-49 and then again when he is age 51 in 1976 for age decade 50-59. Thus, a person can contribute to multiple age and time decades, but only once in any particular age decade-time decade pair. Altogether, there are 3,465 data points provided by men and 1,069 by women for the secular analysis. Table 1 shows details of the three analysis samples.\nAnalyses proceeded as follows: First, to evaluate the variability of activities within and among people, we computed correlations of time spent across the activity domains, standard deviations of time spent, and correlations across visits. Second, cross-sectional differences in participation rates and in average minutes per day were plotted by age for men and women separately. Regressions of individuals' minutes-per-day were estimated with predictors for age, gender, date, and several interactions. Third, longitudinal trajectories were analyzed and plotted based on two-stage regressions that yield average changes for age-gender groups and predict individual changes. Lastly, for secular trends, average minutes per day were computed for age decades in each time decade (1960s to 1990s for men, 1970s to 1990s for women). These were plotted to show changes in activity levels and age patterns over historical time. Further details about procedures are stated in Results and Tables as needed."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "There are four sections of results: variability of activities, cross-sectional age differences, longitudinal age changes, and secular changes across time periods."}, {"section_title": "Variability of Activities", "text": "We study variability of activities across domains, across persons, and within persons over time.\nTo do so, we analyze correlations across domains, between-and within-person diversity, and stability from one time point (visit) to the next, respectively. Comparing standard deviations, within-person variation in minutes spent on an activity is much lower than that found between persons, often by a factor of two or more. Thus, individuals have consistency -a certain degree of stability -in their activities over time.\nComparing coefficients of variation, we can see activities that vary the most across people and also within individuals. Cross-sectional c.v.s often exceed 1.00, indicating great Visits. -Another way to measure within-person variation is by correlations of minutes spent from one visit to the next. Longitudinal correlations were calculated for minutes reported at Visits 1 and 2 and at other pairs of points (not shown; available on request). There is moderate to high stability in the over-time correlations; almost all values are in the range .35-.50. Paid Work and Housework have particularly high stability over time (r = .81 and r = .74, respectively, for Visits 1 and 2).\nSumming up the section. -Individuals differ more from each other in activities at a given time than they do at various ages over their adult lives. This does not mean that activities are static for individuals. Instead, the data suggest that changes are usually gradual, not precipitous; there is moderate stability in activities from one visit to the next."}, {"section_title": "Age Differences in Activities (Cross-sectional)", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participation Rates", "text": "Rates of participation in activity domains for men and women are shown in Table 3 (left side).\nGender differences. -Obligatory activities (Personal Care, Sleep and Rest) have universal rates of participation for both genders. Mobility activities (Walking, Transportation) have very high participation rates, around 85-92 percent for both genders. Committed activities have lowest participation rates and largest gender differences: Men are more likely to do Paid Work (74% vs 50%) and Repairs and Yard (87% vs 76%). By contrast, women are more likely to do Housework (98% vs 68%) and Shopping (91 % vs 60%). For discretionary activities, Socializing and Hobbies and Leisure are virtually universal. Other discretionary activities show moderate to high participation, and sex differences are small.\nAge differences. -Many committed and discretionary activities have a curvilinear pattern with peak participation rates at ages 30-49, and lower participation in young and old adult years (not shown; available on request). For men, such crests appear in Walking, Paid Work, Repairs and Yard, Child-care, and Public Service; and for women, in Transportation, Repairs and Yard, Shopping, Child-care, Public Service, and Sports. The drops in participation after midlife are most pronounced for Paid Work, Child-care, Public Service, and Sports for both genders. There is just one instance of a positive association between participation and age (that is, percents rise across age groups); it is Shopping by men. Overall, the data suggest a narrower repertoire of activities for older persons, that is, less diversity. This has been shown elsewhere (Altergott, 1990) for the variety of people with whom one spends time. Based on all persons with 1 + visit (n = 1816); see Table 1 for distribution of no. of visits. \"Ever\" means reported at any questionnaire; \"always\" means reported at all questionnaires. \nUsing all questionnaires for each person, we created two longitudinal participation rates: percent who ever participate in an activity (reported at any BLSA visit) and percent who always participate (reported at all BLSA visits). Results are in Table 3 (right side).\nEver participation. -Not surprisingly, \"ever\" participation rates are uniformly higher than the cross-sectional (\"now\") rates. The sharpest rises are for Housework and Shopping by men; this means men do the activities at some point(s) in adult life but irregularly. There are also sizable rises in ever participation for Child-care and Public Service for both genders, compared to cross-sectional (based on just one visit). Gender differences for ever rates are the same as noted for cross-sectional rates, but the differences are smaller because ever rates are so much higher.\nAlways participation. -Universal activities (Personal Care, Sleep and Rest, Socializing, Hobbies and Leisure) noted in cross-sectional data are also invariant ones; people are doing them at every questionnaire. Otherwise, \"always\" rates are uniformly lower than cross-sectional (\"now\") rates. Men show many large differences (Walking, Paid Work, Housework, Shopping, Child-care, Entertainment, Public Service, Sports), reflecting sharper role changes they experience over life. By contrast, women show just one sizable reduction (Public Service) for always vs now.\nIn sum, the data show that women are more consistent, or steady, than men in their activities over time. This is confirmed by ratios of always to ever participation and ratios of always to now (not shown). The ratios are almost always higher for women than for men, especially for Housework and Shopping."}, {"section_title": "AGING AND ACTIVITIES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "S35", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cross-Sectional Differences in Time Spent", "text": "We evaluate the frequency distributions of minutes per day for the 14 domains. Then we discuss plots of average time spent by men and women of different ages. Lastly, we estimate regressions of individuals' minutes on age, gender, and date.\nFrequency distributions. -Distributions were generated for the cross-sectional sample (n = 1,816), all questionnaires (N = 8,572), and individual means (n = 1,816); results are the same. Several activity domains have normal distributions: Personal Care, Sleep and Rest, and Hobbies and Leisure. Truncated normal distributions (some percent of nonparticipants at 0, larger percents with low-to-moderate minutes, and percents tailing off for high minutes) appear for Transportation and Socializing. Paid Work has a bimodal distribution with peaks at 0 and about 350 minutes (6 hours). The other domains all show reverse J shapes (substantial percents of nonparticipants, and participants tailing out to the right in decreasing percents): Walking, Housework, Repairs and Yard, Shopping, Child-care, Entertainment, Public Service, and Sports. Despite this variety, we study minutes-per-day without transformation so results for all domains can be compared with each other.\nPlots of cross-sectional means. -Average minutes-perday for age decades (20-29, . . . , 80-89) were computed using first questionnaires. Patterns for obligatory, committed, and discretionary activities are in Figure 1 , Panels A-C, for both genders. The means include all persons (participants and nonparticipants, who score 0); results for just participants show the same patterns.\nGender Differences: For the most essential activities (Personal Care, Sleep and Rest), gender differences are small at all ages. By contrast, they are very evident for committed activities and mobility: Men spend more time in Paid Work, Repairs and Yard, and Transportation, and women more time in Housework, Shopping, Child-care, and Walking. For discretionary activities, men spend more time in active pursuits (Sports), and women more time in passive ones (Socializing until late ages, and Hobbies and Leisure at most ages). Both genders spend only small amounts of time on Entertainment and Public Service at all ages.\nAge Differences: (1) Several activities have the most minutes in late life: Obligatory activities (Personal Care, Sleep and Rest) have steady time spent up to midlife (age 50) and greater after that. Shopping, Hobbies and Leisure, and (for men) Housework times decrease from young to middle ages, then rise at older ages. (2) For most other activities, minutes per day decrease across adult ages (Transportation, Socializing, Entertainment, Sports for both genders, Walking for men, Paid Work for women) or after a midlife crest (Child-care, Public Service for both genders, Paid Work for men, Housework for women). (3) Roughly equal time is spent on Repairs and Yard at all ages.\nRanking the times spent in the 14 domains within each age-gender group, we find some commonalities: Sleep and Rest occupies the greatest number of minutes per day at all ages, for both genders. Paid work ranks next for men until about age 60 and for women until about age 40; then Hobbies and Leisure move from third into second rank for both. Socializing typically ranks fourth, followed by Personal Care and Walking. Of the 14 domains, the least time is spent on Public Service, Shopping, and Entertainment. Most activities retain their rank across age decades; that is, their prominence (high or low) in activity profiles is the same at every age. A few activities show striking drops in prominence for both genders (Paid Work, Child-care), and a few show clear rises in prominence for both genders (Personal Care, Housework, Shopping, Hobbies) for both genders.\nCross-sectional regressions. -Using individual data, we computed regressions with predictors for age (also age 2 , age 3 ), gender, date, and interactions among them. Several models were estimated, the simplest with just main effects S36 VERBRUGGE ETAL.\n(age, gender, date; abbreviated as A, G, D) and the most complex with main, interaction, and age-squared and -cubed terms. For a given activity, all models were estimated and then evaluated for fit, starting at the most complex model and working toward smaller ones. Models with nonsignificant higher-order interactions were dropped. The best-fit model is the smallest one with significant interactions or age\" terms; if they are all nonsignificant, the main-effects model is taken as the best fit. The regressions include participants and nonparticipants (0 minutes); regressions estimated for participants show virtually identical results. Table 4 presents results for the best-fit models.\nWe discuss the best-fit models for each activity domain, starting with simplest results:\nSleep and Rest, Walking, Transportation, and Public Service are predicted with the main-effects model. Age is positively related to Sleep and Rest, and negatively related to the other domains. Men engage in less Walking and slightly less Sleep and Rest, but more Transportation, than do women. Public Service has declined from the 1960s to 1990s. R 2 s are small for these models, ranging from .025-.088.\nHousework, Shopping, and Socializing have important two-way interactions. Housework (R 2 = .413) shows a slight increase with age, less time by men, and small decrease in recent decades. But that is too simplistic, and interactions indicate that older men and women are more similar in housework time than at younger ages (A*G) and that men's housework time has increased in recent decades while women's time has decreased (D*G). Socializing (R 2 = .119) has increased in recent decades, especially for women and young adults. Shopping (R 2 = .101) shows more time by women and recent rises in men's involvement. (Entertainment also has two-way interactions but all effects are small; R 2 = .017. Personal Care has higher-order age terms but all effects are small; R 2 = .065.) Child-care (R 2 = .115) is still more complex, having more interaction terms. Women's greater involvement is the principal effect. Overall decline in Child-care over time is also indicated, but changes have been highly variable for age-gender groups.\nPaid Work, Sports, Repairs and Yard, and Hobbies and Leisure have the most complex models. For Paid Work (R 2 = .538), age, gender, and date operate jointly, not on their own. Main effects vanish into strong interactions: older men and women are more similar in worktime than younger adults (A*G), an obvious reflection of higher male employment at young and middle ages followed by their sharper retirement patterns. Men and women are now more similar in worktime than in prior decades (D*G), as men retire earlier while middle-aged women obtain employment. "}, {"section_title": "Age Changes in Activities (Longitudinal)", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal Trajectories of Time Spent", "text": "We estimate and plot longitudinal trajectories of minutes per day from young to late adulthood. These age changes are compared with cross-sectional age differences.\nRegressions of trajectories. -Using all subjects with 4 + visits, we computed regressions for each individual of the form: MinuteSi = f[Time y , Time^2]. The subscript i identifies the person; the subscript j identifies the BLSA visit. Time is years since first visit to Visit j (number of years plus proportion of year expressed in first decimal). This adjusts precisely for the time between adjacent visits whether they occurred on schedule (two years) or had larger gaps. Each person's regression produces an intercept (b 0 ) and two slopes (b,, b 2 ). Collecting these across individuals, we have three sets of regression parameters for every activity domain.\nThen second-stage longitudinal regressions were produced. The sets of individual-level intercept (b 0 ) and slope (b,, b 2 ) values were regressed on age (also age 2 , age 3 ), gender, date, and interactions among them. Age and date refer to first questionnaire. The models and procedures were the same as for cross-sectional analyses. The longitudinal regressions were also estimated for participants (at least one values (all =s .10). Predictor coefficients are seldom significant; thus, differences in paces of change that individuals experience are not closely related to their entry age, gender, or entry date. Effects are hard to interpret in specific ways (noted above) and we chose not to do so. This does not vitiate the utility and necessity of b, and b 2 for estimating and plotting longitudinal trajectories -which we will now present.\nPlots of trajectories. -To generate plots of age changes, we grouped the individual-level intercepts and slopes by age decade (20-29, . . . , 70-79) at first questionnaire. Subjects with ages < 20 or 80+ were dropped because of small n; however, the small longitudinal sample of women 20-29 was retained for comparison with men those ages (Table 1) . Within age decade, average values for the intercepts and slopes were calculated. Using these, minutes per day were estimated for the midpoint age, 5 years later, and 10 years later. For example, the 20-29 group has estimates for ages 25, 30, and 35. Thus, each age decade produces a 10-year forward trajectory. This is a highly conservative use of the longitudinal data in two respects: It does not extrapolate beyond most subjects' actual measurements (on average, the men had 15 years of follow-up since first visit, and women 10 years), and it uses each person's longitudinal data just once, the age decade of first questionnaire.\nThe longitudinal estimates were plotted for the 14 activity domains. Cross-sectional means were included on the plots for comparison. (Cross-sectional means are placed at midpoints such as 25, 35, etc.; values for 30, 40, etc. are extrapolations between observed values.) The largest differences between longitudinal and crosssectional patterns appear for Paid Work, Housework, and For Paid Work, the two patterns match closely for menbut not for women. Whereas cross-sectional patterns for women show a steady decline across adult ages, the longitudinal patterns show pronounced increases in minutes working from ages 35 to 44, 45 to 54, and even 70 to 75. These findings portray real experiences as women ages 30-39,40-49, and 60-69 aged 10 years. They undoubtedly reflect women's increasing employment in recent decades, especially during child-raising years and shortly after (Taeuber, 1991) .\nPatterns for Housework are in the opposite direction from Paid Work. For men, cross-sectional and longitudinal results both show a gradual increase in the amount of time spent in housework with age. This is especially pronounced in the longitudinal series, indicating rising contributions by recent cohorts of men. For women, cross-sectional data show increasing housework time from young adulthood through midlife with declines thereafter. But longitudinal data show sharp decreases in housework for women under age 55. Presumably, the reason lies again in secular shifts in women's employment,, with job-time supplanting housework.\nFor Sleep and Rest, there is strong correspondence between the cross-sectional and longitudinal data for men, but some differences appear for women. Their cross-sectional data show small linear increases in Sleep and Rest after about age 60. Longitudinal data, however, show declines in minutes of Sleep and Rest from age 35 onward, especially after age 65. The longitudinal results tally with clinical knowledge about sleep decreases in later life.\nFor the other 11 domains, longitudinal patterns repeat the cross-sectional ones closely (plots available on request). Although succinctly stated, this is an extremely important result. It means that for most activities, cross-sectional results offer a very good clue about what will happen as individuals age."}, {"section_title": "Secular Changes in Activities", "text": "The cross-sectional and longitudinal activity patterns occur within a changing sociocultural context. From the 1960s to the 1990s, American society expanded employment and social opportunities for women and older persons, and it tolerated more diversity among people in their life dreams and daily pursuits. Historical effects penetrate BLSA data, certainly in social outcomes but possibly in physiological ones too. Such effects can be singular and brief (prompted by war or catastrophe) or secular and gradual (prompted by slow societal changes); our interest is the latter.\nSeveral results above have suggested secular changes in time spent on activities, and we now look at them directly across the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s . For each decade, mean values for age groups were plotted. As noted earlier, a person contributes just once to a given mean but can contribute to multiple ones as s/he moves to other age decades and time decades. Plots for Paid Work, Housework, Socializing, and Personal Care are shown in Figure 3 , Panels A-D; others are available on request.\nCommitted activities show definite secular changes. In all time decades, Paid Work ( Figure 3A ) by men begins to fall around ages 50-59. The drop has become steeper over time because of trends toward earlier retirement McLaughlin, 1988a, 1988b; Tuma and Sandefur, 1988) \u2022 1970s Men, O 1970s Women, \u2022 1980s Men, A 1980s Women, \u2022 1990s Men, and O 1990s Women. and Yard time at most ages, but the other two activities show little change.\nDiscretionary activities are taking more time in men's and women's lives. Socializing with friends and relatives (Figure 3C ) has increased for men of all ages and for women in young and middle adulthood. In recent decades, men are spending more time in Hobbies and Leisure and in Sports. Trends for women are in the same direction, but smaller and uneven. Entertainment shows slight uneven rises over time for both genders. In contrast to all other discretionary activities, Public Service shows decreased minutes for young and middle-aged men and women from the 1960s to 1990s. Secular changes in obligatory activities are especially interesting. Personal Care time has decreased in midlife for both men and women, but risen for young adults (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) and for older women (70 + ) ( Figure 3D ). Time spent in Sleep and Rest has decreased at most ages for women, but there is no clear trend for men. Transportation shows striking changes: women ages 30-79 are spending more time in local travel now than in prior decades due to rising employment, greater independence, driving skills, and access to public transport. Men these ages also spend more time in Transportation than before, but the trends are smaller. Walking has increased at young and middle ages (20-49) for men and women; there is no trend at later ages.\nNational time-use studies in the 1960s and 1970s showed the following trends: (1) decreasing worktime among employed persons overall but rising worktime for women; (2) decreasing family care (includes housework, child-care, shopping, repairs) by women but increasing time on those activities by men; (3) sharp increases in total leisure activities (principally in mass media, adult education, and recreation, but declines in certain categories such as visiting and other informal social life); and (4) no sizable or consistent changes for personal care or sleep (Juster, 1985b; Robinson, 1985a Robinson, , 1988 Robinson, Andreyenkov, and Patrushev, 1988 ; trends for earlier decades in Robinson and Converse, 1972) . Our data show all of these with the exception of socializing (secular rises in BLSA). Robinson's well-known finding of sharp rises in television viewing cannot be checked in the BLSA data because it is within the item \"reading/watching TV/listening to records.\" DISCUSSION This is the first study of longitudinal and secular changes in activities that has broad scope for activities and time period. We compare the longitudinal age changes to crosssectional age differences to assess if they give the same message about aging.\nThe longitudinal changes we find are sturdy with respect to generalizability. First, selective aspects of the BLSA sample are not very influential; wherever comparisons to other time-use studies are possible, our results are similar to them. Second, although historical era may be important in the long run of a century or so, it is not in the several decades studied. Even when activity levels (average time spent) shift during the observation decades, age patterns stay the same.\nWe chose to study demographic and date effects on activities, viewing them as premier factors that can never be ignored. Other social factors (e.g., marital status, parental status, living arrangements, education) affect people's activities, but the analyses were complex enough with demographic and date factors so we omitted them. Also, we chose an analytic approach commonly used in human development research rather than a demographic approach that distinctly separates age, period, and cohort effects. Ours is excellently suited to tracing individual as well as group trajectories.\nWe conclude by stating the most striking results and what they mean:\n1. Between People and Across Life. Individuals differ more from each other in time spent on activities (crosssectional) than they vary as they age (longitudinal). This does not mean that people have static activity profiles. Instead, it means that changes tend to be gradual -giving both consistency and dynamics to life.\n2. Age Differences. Time spent on Personal Care, Sleep and Rest, Shopping, and Hobbies and Leisure is greater for older persons than young and middle-aged adults. Thus, the most essential and universal aspects of living, and also those with the lowest physical and mental demands, take up a larger fraction of older adults' days. Activities with the highest physical and mental requirements (mobility, job and other committed activities, active leisure) are given less time by older persons than by other age groups.\n3. Age Changes. Longitudinal changes as individuals age usually mirror cross-sectional age differences -a strong and important result. But there are a few important exceptions for women. Recently, women have increased their Paid Work involvement as they grow older, in contrast to crosssectional declines in Paid Work across adult ages. Just the opposite appears for Housework; young and middle-aged women show sharp longitudinal declines, compared to cross-sectional rises at those ages.\n4. Secular Trends. In the latter half of the 20th century, expanded opportunities for women and for older persons translated directly into activity changes in all domains from obligatory to leisure. Most striking of all, women increased Paid Work and decreased Housework, while men decreased Paid Work and increased Housework. Thus, there is some convergence of men's and women's main productive activities, particularly in midlife (see also Juster, 1985b) . Time spent on discretionary activities (Socializing, Hobbies and Leisure, Sports, Entertainment) and on Transportation has increased. By contrast, time spent on Personal Care and Sleep and Rest has decreased, especially in midlife and for women.\nAge, gender, and date all play strong parts in the crosssectional, longitudinal, and secular results. All three are powerful forces for stasis and change in activities.\nThe most powerful force for stasis? The empirical hat tips toward age. Patterns of age differences have been very steady across time decades, even though levels (minutes per day) have shifted ( Figures 3A-3D) . Thus, the age structure of roles and activities is strongly embedded in our society so that age differences persist in the midst of much social change.\nThe most powerful force for change? Here, the hat tips toward gender. Women's longitudinal increases in Paid Work paired with decreases in Housework constitute a striking breakthrough in the age structure of roles. If high employment during childrearing years and after continues, the age pattern of paid work for women will gradually come closer to men's longstanding pattern of peak employment at ages 30-59. Men also changed their age structure of roles, though less strongly, by longitudinal decreases in Paid Work and increases in Housework.\nAs Riley has often noted (1976, 1978, 1988) , at all times there is both strong resistance and momentum for change in age roles. Where does the balance lie in recent decades? Our results show that longstanding sociocultural factors related to age have maintained their force in determining people's activities, and changes have been of modest scope. Change arises in the context of great stability, rather than vice versa."}]
