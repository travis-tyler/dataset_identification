[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Chronic pain is associated with brain atrophy with limited evidence on its impact in the older adult's brain. We aimed to determine the associations between chronic pain and a brain aging biomarker in persons aged 60 to 83 years old. Participants of the Neuromodulatory Examination of Pain and Mobility Across the Lifespan (NEPAL) study (N 5 47) completed demographic, psychological, and pain assessments followed by a quantitative sensory testing battery and a T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. We estimated a brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) that has been previously reported to predict overall mortality risk (brain-PAD, calculated as brain-predicted age minus chronological age), using an established machine-learning model. Analyses of covariances and Pearson/Spearman correlations were used to determine associations of brain-PAD with pain, somatosensory function, and psychological function. Individuals with chronic pain (n 5 33) had \"older\" brains for their age compared with those without (n 5 14; F[1,41] 5 4.9; P 5 0.033). Greater average worst pain intensity was associated with an \"older\" brain (r 5 0.464; P 5 0.011). Among participants with chronic pain, those who reported having pain treatments during the past 3 months had \"younger\" brains compared with those who did not (F[1,27] 5 12.3; P 5 0.002). An \"older\" brain was significantly associated with decreased vibratory (r 5 0.323; P 5 0.033) and thermal (r 5 0.345; P 5 0.023) detection, deficient endogenous pain inhibition (F[1,25] 5 4.6; P 5 0.044), lower positive affect (r 5 20.474; P 5 0.005), a less agreeable (r 5 20.439; P 5 0.020), and less emotionally stable personality (r 5 20.387; P 5 0.042). Our findings suggest that chronic pain is associated with added \"age-like\" brain atrophy in relatively healthy, community-dwelling older individuals, and future studies are needed to determine the directionality of our findings.

Although most chronic pain conditions are associated with changes to brain structure and function, 1, 31, 35, 36 these structures are similarly impacted by normal and pathological chronological aging processes. Indeed, chronological aging has been associated with both global and spatially localized changes to brain structure and function, which may be very similar to brain changes reported in chronic pain states. In addition, several preliminary investigations in older adults with and without low back pain (n 5 8/group) suggest that chronic pain may negatively impact the brain above and beyond age-related effects (ie, accelerated brain aging). [2] [3] [4] Recently, multivariate methods have been developed to define statistical models of healthy brain aging. Using machine-learning analysis of structural neuroimaging data, chronological age can be accurately predicted in healthy individuals. 16 Using this method, older predicted brain age (as compared with chronological age) has been reported in Alzheimer disease, 15 mild cognitive impairment, 18 HIV, 9 schizophrenia, 29 and after traumatic brain injury. 7 Meanwhile, protective factors, such as years of education, physical exercise, and practicing meditation, have been associated with a positive influence on brain aging. 6 Sponsorships or competing interests that may be relevant to content are disclosed at the end of this article.\nFurthermore, recent work found that having an older predicted brain age was associated with weaker grip strength, poorer lung function, slower walking speed, lower fluid intelligence, higher allostatic load, and increased overall mortality risk measured prospectively. 8 In the present investigation, we used a neuroimaging-derived brain biomarker to investigate the association between brain aging and chronic pain in community-dwelling individuals aged 60 to 83 years. Consistent with previous work, 8 we estimated a brainpredicted age difference (brain-PAD, calculated as brain-predicted age minus chronological age) using structural neuroimaging (T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] ) processed through an established analysis pipeline. The pipeline included comparing voxelwise gray and white matter volume images with a statistical model that accurately predicts chronological age from neuroimaging data in healthy people (trained on 2646 independent healthy adults aged 18 to 90 years). The primary hypothesis of the present study was that older adults reporting chronic pain will have a greater brain-PAD (ie, older brain, accelerated brain aging) compared with older adults who did not report chronic pain during the past 3 months. In addition, we also tested exploratory associations between brain-PAD with clinical pain characteristics, as well as somatosensory and psychological function."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Community-dwelling individuals older than 60 years who were native English speakers were recruited as part of an ongoing project at the University of Florida studying the neurobiology of age-related differences in pain modulation and its impact on function (Neuromodulatory Examination of Pain and Mobility Across the Lifespan [NEPAL]).

Several important contributions emerged from this investigation. First, older individuals with chronic pain had an \"older\" appearing brain compared with those without chronic pain, and greater average pain intensity was associated with an \"older\" brain. Second, among participants who experienced chronic pain, those who reported having pain treatments during the past 3 months had a \"younger\" appearing brain compared with those who did not report receiving any pain treatments. Finally, an \"older\" brain was significantly associated with decreased somatosensory perception, deficient endogenous pain inhibition, lower positive affect, having a less agreeable personality, and being less emotionally stable. As hypothesized, chronic pain was associated with an \"older\" brain relative to an individual's chronological age. Older pain-free control subjects had on average a brain that looked 4 years younger than their chronological age, whereas the chronic pain group had on average a brain that appeared 2 years older than their chronological age adjusting for important covariates. In a previous study, each extra year of brainpredicted age (ie, having a brain-PAD score of 11) resulted in a 6.1% relative subsequent increase in the risk of death between ages 73 and 80 years. 8 This is consistent with a recent meta-analysis suggesting that chronic pain increases the risk of mortality. 33 Our findings are also consistent with previous chronic pain research that used univariate methods to infer that pain is associated with altered brain structure in individuals aged 25 to 65 years with fibromyalgia 31 and aged 15 to 55 years with temporomandibular disorders. 36 Apkarian et al. 1 also reported global decreases in gray matter in people with chronic low back pain that were significantly greater than the expected age-related decreases alone. Although their sample's age ranged from 20 to 75 years, only 5 participants were between 60 and 75 years. Thus, the inclusion of younger and middle-aged individuals in these previous studies has hindered the direct examination of the interaction of pain with the aging brain, given the known age-related decrements in the brain's gray and white matter. However, our findings directly support several previous preliminary investigations in older adults with low back pain (n 5 8/group) where pain was significantly associated with significant changes in gray and white matter. [2] [3] [4] The variability in brain-predicted age in people with chronic pain was related to some characteristics of their pain experience. An older-appearing brain was associated with greater average intensity of a participant's worst pain, even after accounting for other potential confounders. In addition, individuals reporting they tried or received any pain-relieving treatments during the past 3 months had younger-appearing brains compared with those who did not. This is further supported experimentally, where those participants with \"older\" brains exhibited deficient endogenous pain modulation using a CPM paradigm. In combination, our findings suggest that chronic pain, when not sufficiently relieved, is negatively associated with brain structure above and beyond associations with chronological aging alone. Previously, Rodriguez-Raecke et al. 42 reported gray matter decreases that were reversed when pain was successfully treated in middleaged and older individuals. Future prospective studies including pain interventions should address these questions with greater statistical power. Better vibratory and thermal detection at 2 different body sites (ie, hand and foot) was also associated with a younger brain. Chronological aging is associated with a progressive decrease in vibratory and thermal perception. 23, 32 The presumed underlying causes include skin aging and subsequent reductions in receptor density and superficial skin blood flow. 27 However, animal and human studies also suggest that changes relating to fiber loss and decreased conduction velocity may also be involved. 21, 23, 37, 45, 46 Interestingly, our results suggest that chronic pain may also be associated with perceptual aging where even subclinical decrements in somatosensation may potentially impact the brain and vice versa. Although both vibratory and thermal systems have different components (eg, sensory receptors, spinal cord pathways, thalamic termination sites), they still require the brain for integration and ultimately perception. Future mechanistic studies are needed to determine peripheral vs central contributions of aging in the elderly.\nBrain-PAD was also associated with positive, but not negative, affect in those participants with chronic pain. This is consistent with the idea that positive affect may have a unique role in modulating the pain experience.\n14 Although not currently understood, it is likely that positive affect impacts the pain experience via multiple converging supraspinal mechanisms. First, increased positive affect and associated cognitions may translate into positive expectations for recovery and potential treatment success. 20 Thus, positive affect may also enhance motivation and treatment adherence, 48 which are important predictors of the success of exposure to treatments. 13 In addition, positive affect can enhance extinction learning or inhibitory learning processes, 51 which may further optimize the efficacy of existing treatments. Similarly, a personality characterized by greater emotional stability and agreeableness was associated with a younger appearing brain in those with chronic pain. In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, larger orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices and rolandic operculum were associated with greater emotional stability, and a larger orbitofrontal cortex with higher agreeableness. 28 Moreover, agreeableness was a significant positive predictor of attendance to a physical rehabilitation program after surgery. 25 In general, distinct personality traits are associated with stable individual differences in gray matter volumes. 41 Taken together, our findings underscore the idea that higher order traits, such as personality characteristics, are a feature of large-scale brain structure and function that may be negatively impacted by chronic pain and be sensitive to a brain aging biomarker. Our study has some limitations. Although the sample size for the training set was large, the NEPAL study cohort was relatively small. However, NEPAL participants are well-characterized across multiple characteristics relevant to the study of pain and aging within the biopsychosocial model of pain. 19 In addition, our groups were very similar regarding age-related health comorbidities and overall medication intake, which can make it hard to compare and isolate pain differences. Second, the current analysis was cross sectional; therefore, we cannot determine whether a specific brain-predicted age preceded or was subsequent to pain. From the present findings, directionality or causality cannot be inferred because it is equally possible that brain aging plays a central role for the sensitivity and resilience to many symptoms and disorders associated with biological aging, including chronic pain. Future studies are needed using longitudinal data to determine trajectories of brain aging and how they relate to pain and future health outcomes. Third, the NEPAL participants were high functioning community-dwelling older individuals, who were relatively healthy for their age. They were cognitively normal and free from overt disability and neurological disorders. Given that greater self-reported exercise was associated with positive brain aging in a previous investigation, it is possible that the true association between pain and brain-PAD was underestimated in our sample because everyone reported exercising regularly in our control group. Fourth, our brain aging measure does not provide the anatomical specificity to determine which brain regions are specifically \"aged\" because brain aging is not a uniform process. Future studies including participants with more severe pain and lower levels of physical function are required to further elucidate these associations. In addition, the development of region-specific aging biomarkers will help the field and ultimately clinical practice. Finally, many of our study findings became nonstatistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons, which amplifies the probability of finding a false-positive result. Future studies are needed to replicate our findings and determine whether our reported associations were the result of chance alone.\nWe present evidence that a clinically relevant neuroimagingderived aging biomarker, previously associated with greater risk of general functional decline and mortality during aging, is similarly associated with the presence and severity of the complex experience of pain in older individuals. Brain-PAD could be a valuable marker of brain health requiring minimal manual training to implement at the individual level with the potential to be estimated in large numbers of people because structural MRI is collected routinely in clinical settings. Our findings also suggest that both pain treatments and psychological traits may significantly mitigate the effect of pain on the aging brain and could further decrease the risk of age-related deterioration and death."}]
