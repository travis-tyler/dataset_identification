These students have historically been provided a less rigorous curriculum with individualized education program (IEP) goals that focus on computation (Shriner, Kim, Thurlow, & Ysseldyke, 1993) and have minimal linkage to long-term general education outcomes (Nolet & McLaughlin, 2000; Sands, Adams, & Stout, 1995; Smith, 1990) . In the sections that follow, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) Standards are discussed relative to standards-based reform efforts and students with disabilities, followed by a review of relevant characteristics of students with LD and ED. Finally, the purpose of the study is delineated."}, {"section_title": "N C T M A N D R E F O R M E F F O R T S", "text": "The NCTM is one of the national organizations that have produced a comprehensive approach to applying standards-driven reform. In 1989, a community of math educators and other professionals developed the Standards in an effort to address the low math performance of students in the United States. The NCTM Standards are guided by five main goals that encompass the \"spirit\" of the Standards, wherein students (a) become better problem solvers, (b) learn to reason mathematically, (c) learn to value mathematics, (d) become more confident in their mathematical ability, and (e) learn to communicate mathematically (NCTM, 1989) . These goals reflect changes in math curriculum, assessment, and professional teaching practices (NCTM 1989; to help all students achieve in mathematics. In contrast to past reform efforts (e.g., Back to Basics) that narrowly focused on the acquisition and retention of basic math skills, NCTM Standards address problem-solving and reasoning skills deemed essential for an increasingly technological society and future employment.\nSpecifically, the focus of the Standards is on conceptual understanding rather than procedural knowledge or rule-driven computation. Student understanding of mathematical concepts is promoted via active engagement with manipulatives or concrete objects, applying math to real-world situations, group work and discussions, and teacher facilitation. This approach to mathematics education is supported by recent analysis of data from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) . Based on the data, researchers (National Institute on Educational Governance, Finance, Policymaking, and Management, 1998) indicate that the problem with U.S. student performance is not basic mathematical computation, but advanced mathematical concepts and problem-solving.\nThe NCTM Standards are a critical component of the Standards-driven reform movement. Although no current count exists that identifies the number of states that have adopted state standards consistent with those set forth by NCTM, Blank and Dalkilic (1992) ;(as noted in Thurlow, 2000) report that 42 states have used the Standards as a guide to development of mathematics standards. Researchers (Rivera, Taylor, & Bryant, 1994 also assert that all students, including those with disabilities, should be taught areas identified in the Standards. This is becoming more of a reality as students with disabilities are being educated in the general education classroom and are exposed to the same curricula as their peers without disabilities. Further, it is a requirement in some states for students to pass assessments with open-ended problem-solving tasks that are in line with the Standards in order to receive a diploma (e.g., Maryland State Department of Education, 2000) ."}, {"section_title": "CHARACTERISTICS O F STUDENTS W I T H LD A N D ED", "text": "Students with LD and ED exhibit several common academic and behavioral characteristics (Anderson, Kutash, & Duchnowski, 2001; Scruggs & Mastropieri, 1986 ) that may affect success in NCTM Standards-based mathematics activities. In addition to performing approximately two grade levels behind peers without disabilities (Wagner, 1995) , significant characteristics affecting performance for both groups include difficulty attending to key dimensions of tasks (Kauffman, 2001 ) and deficits employing metacognitive strategies (Bricklin & Gallico, 1984; Gallico, Burns, & Grob, 1991) . Also, typical instructional approaches may combine with student learning and behavioral characteristics and affect student academic success (Marolda & Davidson, 1994) . For example, the common em-phases on computational skills and fact memorization, coupled with a limited exposure to problem-solving, may negatively impact these students. Such ramifications may be observed within subsequent classes where teachers utilize a problem-solving-based approach to math education (Baroody & Hume, 1991; Bos & Vaughn, 1994; Salend & Hofstetter, 1996) and also in contexts outside of school.\nResearchers also note relevant characteristics more specific to students labeled LD. Many adolescents with LD experience math difficulties (McLeod & Armstrong, 1982) , particularly in problem application, and generally perform at the fifth-grade level in math (Cawley & Miller, 1989) . These students typically approach complex math tasks, such as multistep word problems, in a notably different way than students proficient at problem-solving. For instance, many students with LD experience problems: (a) selecting and employing appropriate operations during problem-solving (Montague & Bos, 1990) , (b) representing problem-solving situations (Montague, Bos, & Ducette, 1991) , and (c) selecting relevant information in problems (Blankenship & Lovitt, 1976) .\nAdolescents with ED also possess characteristics that differentiate them from peers without disabilities and, to a lesser extent, from students with LD. For example, the academic success or failure of students labeled ED is greatly affected by the extent to which instruction is functional and recognized by students as relevant (Bos & Vaughn, 1994) . In addition, these students often exhibit a general lack of persistence and concentration and have difficulties with independent class work. Further, results of two studies (Carr & Punzo, 1993; Hogan & Prater, 1993) indicate that students with ED obtain a correct rate of between 20% and 76% on independent seatwork (Guntner & Denny, 1998) . The ability of students to persist and work independently on openended mathematical tasks could greatly affect the level of success experienced in light of the more constructivist approach that guides the NCTM Standards."}, {"section_title": "TEACHER BELIEFS O F NCTM STANDARDS WITH STUDENTS WITH LD A N D ED", "text": "In addition to academic and behavioral characteristics of students labeled LD and ED, certain teacher beliefs, such as familiarity and confidence with implementing the Standards, may also affect successful implementation of Standards-based activities. For example, Manouchehri (1998) noted that teachers who lack familiarity with conceptually-based questioning techniques rarely expect students to elaborate, justify their position, or support students in the systematic testing of opposing approaches to mathematical problems. Similarly, NCTM (1991) acknowledges that teacher confidence affects both what is taught and the instructional approach used by teachers. Although there is widespread use of the NCTM Standards (Parmer & Cawley, 1995) , no information is available that addresses secondary special and general education teacher familiarity and confidence with the standards with students with disabilities.\nTo achieve a clear understanding of secondary general and special educator confidence and familiarity with the NCTM Standards, student response to standards-based activities and barriers to implementation should also be considered. For example, Manouchehri (1998) noted that teacher beliefs and practices are strongly influenced by leadership at the school and district levels. Additionally, researchers (Reys, Reys, Barnes, Beem, & Papick, 1998) have identified obstacles to Standards-based reform efforts, including (a) teacher views and beliefs of mathematics that may influence practice (e.g., traditional view of math as facts and formulas, tracking students in math by ability level), and (b) initial student reactions to the new curricula that require more critical thinking and problemsolving skills than students may have experienced in past math courses."}, {"section_title": "P U R P O S E", "text": "To date, no studies investigate secondary teacher familiarity with the NCTM Standards, confidence with implementation, barriers to successful implementation, and student response to Standards-based activities. Nor is there research on these topics for general and special educators who teach students with LD and ED. This is unfortunate given that common, rigorous standards are the catalysts for improved educational outcomes within standards-based reform (Gagnon, McLaughlin, Rhim, & Davis, in press; McDonnell, McLaughlin, & Morison, 1997) . Identification of these factors is essential to assess teacher perception of preparedness and ability to implement Standards-based activities within the school context. Thus, our current study determined teacher perceptions related to implementation of the Standards with secondary students labeled LD and ED. A survey for general and special educators in Maryland secondary schools was designed to answer the following research questions: 1. How familiar are special and general education teachers with the goals of the NCTM Standards? 2. How confident are special and general education teachers in their ability to teach math relative to the goals of the NCTM Standards? 3. According to teachers, how favorably do students with LD and ED respond to activities, lessons, and strategies that incorporate the recommendations of the NCTM Standards? 4. What are perceived barriers to successful Standards implementation for students with LD and ED? 5. Do teachers' responses differ according to age, gender, years of teaching experience, grade levels taught, training, locale, position, and teaching load? The survey was developed via a four-step process. Based on a review of literature an initial version of the survey was constructed focusing on teaching math to secondary students with LD and ED. Second, a review board that included leaders in the fields of special education and math education examined the survey. Third, a focus group of educators provided feedback on the survey questions and design. The authors made appropriate revisions following each stage. To address issues specific to general and special educators, two versions of the survey were constructed and mailed to teachers. A majority of the questions on both surveys were the same. However, the special education survey included 14 questions that applied solely to those teachers (e.g., number of students on caseload). Similarly, the survey designed for general educators also included questions (n = 12) relevant only to them (e.g., average number of students in your math classes).\nReliability. To address possible threats to reliability and enhance replicability of research findings, survey data collection procedures were closely followed (Fink, 1995; Yin, 1994) . For example, standardized directions were incorporated into the survey instrument. Further, a reliability check was conducted on 25% of survey questions to assess the researchers' fidelity with data entry and was determined to have a 99% reliability rate. This agreement was calculated by the following formula: number of agreements divided by number of agreements and disagreements times 100. To further establish reliability, Cohen's Alpha was calculated to determine the internal consistency of items addressing barriers to implementation of the NCTM Standards (n = .724).\nValidity. Threats to validity were addressed to maximize the quality of the surveys and improve the generalizability of findings. To address construct validity, a focus group and advisory panel were developed prior to study implementation. The focus group consisted of secondary general and special education math teachers. These professionals offered feedback and recommendations in three areas: (a) accuracy of targeted objectives, (b) necessary question additions/deletions, and (c) clarification of questions and format. The advisory panel included experts in the fields of math education, statistics, and learning disabilities. This panel examined the survey instruments and also reviewed the methodology of the study. Modifications were made based on the recommendations of these two groups."}, {"section_title": "SAMPLE", "text": "Survey Sampling Procedures. The state of Maryland was selected for the study as the 24 school districts are representative of a national range of geographical locations (urban, suburban, and rural), as well as student population densities (0-599, 600-600, and 1,000 or more students). For example, 88% of students in Maryland are served in urban schools and 3% in suburban schools versus national averages of 71% and 12%, respectively. Also, the percentages of identified students in Maryland approach national statistics. For example, 11% (n = 4,933) of students in Maryland were labeled with serious emotional disturbance versus 11% (n = 275,485) nationally. Further, 5.19% of children ages 6-17 in Maryland were labeled with a specific learning disability during the 1997/1998 school year. This was close to the national average of 5.61%.\nThe following sampling procedures were followed for inclusion in this study: (a) a list of all Maryland school districts was identified using the Common Core of Data (National Center for Education Statistics, 1995); (b) initial contact was made via phone with administrators and supervisors of special education from each of 24 Maryland districts; and (c) the administrators in the districts willing to participate (n = 17) were mailed a description of the study, survey, and a request for all public school secondary (i.e., Grades 6-12) mathematics teachers and special educators who were currently teaching mathematics in the general education setting or in exclusionary programs (i.e., resource room and self-contained class). If more than two special education teacher names and two general educator names were provided per school, a two-stage cluster procedure (Fink, 1995; Fowler, 1988) was used. Teacher names were randomized and chosen in sequential order, and surveys were mailed to the targeted teachers, with 143 mailed to special educators and 182 to general educators, for a total of 325.\nResponse Rate. A total of 39 surveys were excluded from the analysis due to one of five concerns: (a) teachers were not instructing students labeled LD or ED (n = 4), (b) teachers changed schools from the initial to follow-up mailings (n = 29), (c) incorrect school address (n = 3), (d) the wrong survey was mailed to the teacher (n = 1), or (e) the survey was returned with the code number and name removed (n = 2). With the noted exceptions, a total of 286 teacher surveys met the criteria for inclusion. Of these, 129 teachers returned the survey for a response rate of 45%. The response rate remained low despite four survey mailings and follow-up phone calls. Although the return rate does not approach the common standard of 70% and could be considered a limitation, it is acknowledged that 50% is a typical return rate for mail questionnaires (Weisberg, Krosnick, & Bowen, 1989) . No statistically significant differences were found between respondents and nonrespondents for level of teaching (i.e., middle school and high school);( 2 = .945, p = .623), school size ( 2 = 2.365, p = .306), and number of general and special education teachers ( 2 = 3.745, p = .053). However, a significant difference was determined between school locales of respondents and nonrespondents (i.e., urban, suburban, and rural);( 2 = 8.786, p = .012), with a larger percentage of respondents represented in each category. Thus, in relation to these variables, respondents and nonrespondents were generally more similar than different.\nSchool Selection. A stratified random sample of schools was selected across population density (i.e., urban, suburban, and rural), enrollment (i.e., 0-599, 600-999, 1,000 and greater), and school levels (i.e., middle school, and high school). Percentages of schools across population density and enrollment were established to maintain a sample consistent with the overall make-up of schools within Maryland (see Table 1 ). While the return rate resulted in minor differences in these percentages, surveys were distributed with the intention of approximating the general characteristics of the state. Additionally, an approximate equal number of surveys were distributed to both middle and high schools.\nA total of 137 schools refused to participate and of these, 73.7% (n = 101) were from urban locales, 21.9% (n = 30) from rural locales, and 4.4% (n = 6) from suburban locales. In contrast, student population of the schools refusing to participate was more equally distributed. Approximately one-third of the 137 schools were in each population category, with 32.1% (n = 44) having up to 599 students, 32.8% (n = 45) with 600-999 students, and 35.0% (n = 48) with 1,000 or more students."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis Procedures.", "text": "Data analysis for the survey included descriptive statistics and additional statistical methods, such as t-tests or Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to compare group means. Given the ordinal data and the fact that some of the variables were not normally distributed (i.e., kurtosis or skewness greater than 1.0), nonparametric statistics were also calculated, with the alpha level set at .01 to reduce possible Type II errors. These nonparametric statistics included chi-square tests to compare proportions, MannWhitney U tests to compare medians between groups, and nonhierarchical regression analyses to determine how well certain variables (e.g., age, level, and number of methods courses) predict teacher familiarity, confidence, and favorable student response.

Approximately 45% of general education (n = 65) and special education (79) teachers (n = 64) responded for a total of 129 teachers. Forty-eight percent of these teachers (n = 62) were from urban school districts, followed by 36% rural (n = 46) and 16% suburban (n = 21) (see Table 1 ). Responses to demographic questions were further analyzed across teacher-type (special versus general education math teachers) (see Table 2 ). The majority of general education (n = 44) and special education (n = 51) teachers were female (69% and 80%, respectively).\nFurther, general education teachers taught for more years than the participating special educators (see Table 2 ). A significant difference was determined across general and special educators and years of experience teaching students with LD and ED. Compared to special educators, general education teachers had more years of experience teaching students with LD ( 2 = 12.872, p = .025) and ED ( 2 = 15.763, p = .008). Regarding the types of math courses currently being taught to students with LD and ED, teachers were asked to indicate \"All that apply.\" The most commonly marked course for both general and special educators was middle school math for students with LD.\nTeachers were questioned on pertinent student information, such as services provided and student achievement level. When asked the number of students with LD that were provided instruction in the general education math class with no special services provided, 29% of responding special education teachers (n = 10) indicated \"None,\" and 40% of general education teachers (n = 10) indicated \"1-5.\" The most common response to the range of students labeled ED with no special services was \"1-5 .\" Specifically, 71% of special educators (n = 25) and 48% of general education teachers (n = 29) noted this range. Further, when asked the number of students with LD that were receiving special services (e.g., consultative services, co-teaching) within general education math class, 43% of special educators (n = 15) noted \"None.\" The second most frequent response to this question was \"6-10 students\" by 29% (n = 10) of special education teachers. Also, 33% of general education teachers (n = 20) indicated that no students were receiving additional special education services (e.g., resource support), followed by 25% of general education teachers (n = 15), indicating \"1-5 students.\" In terms of students with ED receiving special services (e.g., consultative services and co-teaching) within general education math class, 63% of special educators (n = 22) noted \"None.\" The second most frequent response to this question was \"1-5 students\" by 26% of special education teachers. Also, 48% of general education teachers (n = 29) indicated that no students were receiving additional special education services (e.g., resource support), followed by 37% of general education teachers (n = 22), indicating \"1-5 students.\"\nResearchers also analyzed general and special educator ratings of the achievement level common for students labeled LD and ED in math relative to peers without disabilities (1 = well above average, 2 = above average, 3 = about class average, 4 = below class average, 5 = well below class average, 6 = not applicable). Both groups of teachers reported the mean achievement level for students with LD more closely approached the performance of unlabeled students than did the achievement of students labeled ED. Further, special educators reported slightly higher achievement for students with LD (M = 3.85) versus general education teachers (M = 3.92). In contrast, general educators noted a higher-level of achievement for students with ED (M = 4.42), as compared to the responses of special educators (M = 4.73).\nMethods Courses. Teachers also responded to questions concerning their prior methods courses that addressed, at least in part, teaching math to students with LD or ED. As reported in Table 3 , a significant difference was found ( 2 = 37.424, p = .000), with general education teachers indicating having taken more math methods courses.

Specifically, five central themes come to light: (a) teacher unfamiliarity with the Standards, (b) variables that affect teacher confidence in implementing Standardsbased activities, (c) favorable student response to Standards-based activities, (d) significant barriers (i.e., lack of materials) to successful implementa- tion of Standards-based activities, and (e) level of math courses typically taught by teachers of students with LD and ED. A primary concern is that many special education teachers indicated they were unfamiliar with the goals of the NCTM Standards. This is of concern given that the Standards were first published in 1989 and were also revised in April 2000. Further, as more students with LD and ED are educated in general education math classes, special education teachers need greater familiarity with the Standards to accommodate and adapt to individual learning needs.\nFor teachers who are familiar with the Standards, certain variables influenced teacher confidence with the Standards. Specifically, teacher confidence was influenced by familiarity, student response, number of methods courses, a lack of information, years of teaching ED, and teacher type. The overall contribution of all variables accounted for 61% of the variance. Two of these variables were uniquely and significantly related to teacher confidence (familiarity and years of teaching ED), when all other variables were controlled. Thus, teacher confidence in the ability to teach math consistent with goals of the Standards, significantly relates to familiarity with the Standards. However, it should be noted that this relationship does not necessarily imply actual teacher implementation of activities consistent with the NCTM Standards. As Batchelder (1998) determined, \" . . . teachers may be familiar with the language of standards-based strategies, but not understand the implications of these strategies for teaching and learning\" (p. 12). To identify the link between teacher confidence, familiarity with the Standards, and classroom practices, future research should include the addition of observation to validate teacher perceptions.\nResearchers also determined that more than half of general and special educators indicated students responded favorably to activities, lessons, and strategies that incorporate the recommendation of the Standards. This is consistent with past research on students' views of mathematics when taught in classes that are in line with Standards-"}, {"section_title": "338", "text": "Spring 2002 T a b l e 8 (Papanastasiou, 2000) from the TIMSS indicates no significant relationship between student attitude and achievement. Thus, conclusions based on teacher perception of student favorable response should be made with caution. Four variables (i.e., confidence, familiarity, years of teaching ED, and preparation) significantly related to favorable student response. Further, two variables (confidence and familiarity) uniquely and significantly contributed to this criterion variable when all other variables were controlled. Relatedly, Meyen, Vergason, and Whelan (1993) noted that a positive attitude toward teaching math and enthusiasm toward the subject matter positively impacts student attitudes. However, this link between teacher confidence, familiarity with the Standards, and favorable student response requires further study."}, {"section_title": "Non-Hierarchical Regression Analysis for Teacher Perception of Familiarity", "text": "In addition, barriers exist that impede successful implementation of the Standards by special and general educators when instructing students with LD and ED. Teachers identified administrative support and district curricula as relatively minor issues. This indicates that within the district and school levels, there is a general acceptance and adherence to the NCTM Standards. However, teachers did note that a lack of adequate materials was a considerable barrier to successful implementation of activities based on the Standards. The issue of inadequate materials has also been noted in the literature as hindering other teacher practices. For instance, in their analysis of 28 surveys on general education teachers' attitudes toward inclusion, Scruggs and Mastropieri (1996) determined that only one-third of teachers felt they had resources to adequately address student needs. The lack of suitable materials is especially disconcerting for students with LD and ED who require manipulatives, multiple representations, and varied examples and nonexamples as teachers progress through the concrete-semi-concrete-abstract phases of instruction that are recommended (Maccini & Gagnon, 2000) . Further, the highly conceptual and problem-solving approach that is recommended by 339 Exceptional Children Having students with LD and ED learn to solve complex, real-world math problems can promote generalization to other real world tasks, application of skills across time (Bottge & Hasselbring, 1993) , and conceptual understanding of mathematics (Van De Walle, 1994) . This is imperative given that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, 1997) calls for all students to have access to the general education curriculum to the greatest extent possible and accountability for learning the same material as their peers without disabilities. However, in the current study, respondents generally reported teaching lower-level math courses to secondary students with LD and ED (e.g., basic skills math, middle school math), versus higher-level math courses. This may have detrimental effects for students with LD and ED as the lack of challenging math content may hinder student achievement and possibly limit future career choices in mathematics. Additional research is necessary to identify the extent to which students with LD and ED have access to higher level math courses with appropriate academic supports."}, {"section_title": "LIMITATIONS A N D FUTURE RESEARCH", "text": "Although important results emanated from the current study, caution must be made when generalizing results beyond Maryland. Future studies should include a national sample of general and special education teachers' perceptions related to implementation of the Standards with secondary students with LD and ED. In addition to modifications in sampling procedures, future studies should also include different research methods to determine teachers' perspectives and behaviors. One such method is triangulation, which combines quantitative and qualitative research methods to investigate the variables of interest (Campbell & Fiske, 1959) . These methods represent different roles in data interpretation that will be essential to the integration of information involving various perspectives and behaviors (Sieber, 1973) . For example, as \"lack of materials\" was targeted as a common barrier, teachers should be interviewed and observed regarding the types and uses of materials perceived as necessary for effective implementation of activities based on the Standards. Recommendations for future courses of action can then be delineated.\nI M P L I C AT I O N S F O R P R A C T I C E Important implications for both general and special education teachers based on the current research include the need to educate and support teachers in their efforts to teach mathematics to students with LD and ED in light of the goals of the NCTM Standards. Such supports include:"}, {"section_title": "TRAINING A N D D I S S E M I N AT I O N", "text": "Given that 55% of special educators indicated they had not heard of the Standards, intensive teacher training via workshops and inservices are needed. This issue is particularly critical for high school special education teachers in rural areas. It is from this locale that the largest percentage of respondents (28%, n = 8) had not heard of the Standards. Thus, it is imperative that schools train special education teachers on the revised Standards (NCTM, 2000) and approaches to meeting the needs of students with disabilities in general education classes. Additionally, information provided in teacher training programs is vital to help educate teachers on the latest reform efforts.\nAdequate Resources. Special and general educators both indicated the lack of materials as a barrier to successful Standards implementation. Teachers have consistently cited inadequate materials as a barrier to successful implementation of educational reform (Scruggs & Mastropieri, 1996) . However, the availability of resources does not \"reveal how these resources are used\" or by whom. And they say nothing about the quality of that use (McLaughlin et al., 1995, p. 46) . Notwithstanding, adequate materials are one essential component to successful implementation of activities based on the Standards.\nTeachers in the current study did not identify which materials were lacking. However, adequate manipulatives are essential for students with LD and ED when completing higher-level math tasks. Although there are a number of effective resources for teachers, one consideration should be the use of materials that have been empirically validated. For example, the Algebra Lab Gear (colored blocks that represent numeric and vari-able amounts; Picciotto, 1990 ) is one validated tool teachers may use to help students visualize a problem and follow logical steps during activities focusing on algebraic reasoning. This representation is supported within the goals of the Standards (NCTM, 2000) . Additionally, students and teachers could benefit from varied texts and resources that present math activities embedded in real-world problems. For example, the Connected Math Series (Lappan, Fey, Fitzgerald, Friel, & Phillips, 1998) , which has an orientation and organization consistent with the NCTM Standards, can be used as a supplement to traditional texts (Reys et al., 1998) .\nOne creative approach to a lack of materials is currently being implemented within some secondary schools in Maryland. Students are allowed to borrow or \"rent-to-own\" graphing calculators that have been procured through donations or agreements with local companies. This approach assures that students have equal access to current technology and can participate fully in math activities within and outside of school.\nHigher-level Mathematics. In the current study, the most prevalent courses taught by respondents involved general/basic skills mathematics, versus higher-level math, such as algebra and geometry. Approximately an equal number of middle and high school teachers responded to the survey. It could be assumed that middle school math would typically be taught by middle school teachers. However, it is becoming more common for nonlabeled students to take algebra in the seventh or eighth grades and one would certainly expect a majority of students with LD and ED to be enrolled in algebra by the high school level. As IDEA assures students with disabilities have access to the general education curriculum, it is important to consider whether these students are enrolled in higher-level math courses with appropriate academic supports. Thus, there is a need for future research to examine the placement of students with LD and ED in math classes and whether these students would be successful in higher-level mathematics with supports that have been empirically validated. For example, manipulatives (Huntington, 1994; Maccini, & Hughes, 2000) and cognitive strategy instruction (Hutchinson, 1993) have been determined to help students with mild disabilities in higher-level mathematics. Future research on combinations of these supports within the context of higher-level mathematics courses is crucial to assist students in meeting district and state requirements for graduation and for future occupations.\nTo assure positive academic outcomes, students with LD and ED must have access to the general education curriculum and rigorous standards, such as those set forth by NCTM. However, to meet the unique needs of these students, and better prepare students for their \"next environment,\" it is imperative that teachers are given adequate supports, training, and resources. As stated by the National Research Council (2001), \"For people to participate fully in society, they must know basic mathematics. Citizens who cannot reason mathematically are cut off from whole realms of human endeavor\" (p. 1). This can be realized with knowledgeable and empowered teachers who are provided the necessary tools and information to implement math instruction consistent with the most recent reform movements and empirically validated instructional approaches.
