During these years, children acquire the reading knowledge and skills that prepare them for future schooling and life. Until recently, little national data have been available on young children's reading skills. While the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has regularly assessed the reading skills of U.S. 4th-graders since the early 1970s, few national studies have assessed the reading skills of children when they enter kindergarten and have documented the development of these skills through 5th grade. The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLSK), sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), strives to help fill this gap in knowledge. The study, which follows the academic progress of a nationally representative sample of children from kindergarten through 5th grade, provides information about children's reading achievement in early elementary school. In particular, the ECLSK assesses children's reading skills and collects detailed information about children's home literacy environment and the reading instruction they receive from their teachers and schools.1 This special analysis summarizes findings from the ECLSK on children's reading skills throughout the first 2 years of school and the classroom experiences of beginning readers. It starts with a brief description of how children's reading skills are assessed in the study and then presents what this assess-BEST COPY AVAILABLE ment tells us about the development of children's early reading skills across kindergarten and 1st grade. The next section explores some of the factors that relate to kindergartners' reading skills, suCh as the literacy environment in the home. The focus of the following section is on differences in the instructional practices used to teach reading in kindergarten and the emphasis that is placed on various reading activities and skills. Because kindergartners' school day can vary in length, information about these differences in classroom experiences are presented separately for full-day and half-day kindergarten programs. This special analysis concludes by examining the relationship between the type of kindergarten program children attend (fullday vs. half-day) and their early reading skills and achievement. Understanding the nature of this relationship is particularly important given the increase in the percentage of children who attend full-day programs (Walston and West forthcoming)."}, {"section_title": "Measures cl Reading Achievement in the ECLSK", "text": "Measuring the reading skills and knowledge of young children was not easy. An assessment was needed that was appropriate for children ages 4-7 and that reflected what was being taught in kindergarten and 1st grade in 1998 2000 (when the ECLSK assessments were being administered). To respond to these challenges, the developers of the study created an adaptive assessment that was administered individually to students and was untimed. As described below, the ECLSK reading assessment covered a range of content areas and included items that measured children's various abilities, such as basic skills, vocabulary, and comprehension. Basic skills include recognizing the printed word and its component orthographic and phonological coding skills (e.g., knowledge of the alphabet and of the relationship of letters to sounds at the beginning and ending of words). Vocabulary includes knowing the meaning of single words that represent objects and groups of objects, actions, and qualities of space and time. Four types of reading comprehension skills include initial understanding (e.g., identifying the main point of a passage, understanding words in the context of simple passages); interpretation (e.g., linking information across parts of the text as well as focusing on specific information); personal reflection and re-sponse (e.g., connecting knowledge from the text with children's own personal background knowledge); and demonstration of a critical stance (considering text objectivelye.g., what events in a Passage of text are plausible). Because most kindergartners are just beginning to read, the ECLSK uses items that assess children's listening comprehension and their reading comprehension. Absent from the ECLSK direct reading framework is children's writing. It is not feasible to include a sampling of children's writings given the practical constraints associated with the cost of scoring their samples. The ECLSK assessment did not include a direct measure of children's oral language.2 Nonetheless, by assessing a variety of reading skills appropriate for both kindergartners and 1st-graders, the study provides powerful information at a single point in time (i.e., estimates upon entry to kindergarten) and over time (i.e., estimates of growth across kindergarten and 1st grade) (for more information, see Rock and Pollack 2002)."}, {"section_title": "Reading Knowledge Er Edlls", "text": "The first 2 years of the ECLSK followed a cohort of students from their entry into kindergarten in fall 1998 to their completion of 1st grade in spring 2000. Thus, the findings from this study address key questions about the reading knowledge and skills of these children when they began kindergarten, their reading gains across kindergarten and 1st grade, and the specific factors that are related to children's reading knowledge and skills. What reading skills do children demonstrate when they enter kindergarten? Children who entered kindergarten for the first time in fall 1998 brought certain reading skills into their kindergarten classrooms. About two-thirds of the kindergartners already knew the letters of the alphabet. About one-third knew the letter-sound relationship at the beginning of words, and about onein-five knew the letter-sound relationship at the end of words (e.g., \"cat\" begins with the letter \"c\"; \"dog\" ends with the letter \"g\"). A small percentage of children who entered kindergarten could already read single words or words within the context of a sentence (figure 1)."}, {"section_title": "REST COPY AVAILABLE", "text": "ReadingYoung Children's Achievement and Classroom Experiences I Page 3 What reading skills and knowledge do children gain across kindergarten and 1st grade? Children made considerable gains in reading during their first 2 years of school (Denton and West 2002). Across the kindergarten year, they learned the alphabet and letter-sound relationships at the beginning and end of words. By the end of kindergarten, nearly all of the children knew their letters, 70 percent understood letter-sound relationships at the beginning of words, and about one-half understood letter-sound relationships at the end of words (figure 1). When the children began 1st grade, about one-quarter could read words that are often used (sight words), and about 1-in-10 could read and understand words in context. By the end of the 1st grade, about three-quarters could read these often-used words, and 4-in-10 could read and understand words in context (figure 1). What are some of the factors that are related to children's reading skills? Children who entered kindergarten in 1998 differed in the extent to which they demonstrated certain reading abilitiessuch as recognizing letters and understanding the letter-sound relationship at the beginning and end of words by their background characteristics. For example, White children scored higher than Black and Hispanic children on these reading skills (West, Denton, and Germino Hausken 2000). In addition, children whose mothers had higher levels of education scored higher in these skills than those whose mothers had less education (West, Denton, and Germino Hausken 2000), as did children from nonpoor families than those from poor families (Denton and West 2002).3 When some of these factors were considered along with other factors that are also associated with children being more at risk of school failure, children from families with multiple risk factors4 scored lower in reading upon kindergarten entry than children with no risk factors, or even one factor (figure 2 and Zill and West 2000). As in the beginning of kindergarten, children's reading skills across kindergarten and 1st grade differed by certain characteristics of the child and family. As might be expected, various groups of children showed growth in different areas. During the kindergarten year, as an illustration, children atrisk of school failure5 made gains that helped close the gap between themselves and their more advantaged peers in terms of basic reading skills, such as recognizing letters; however, on more difficult skills, such as reading single words, the gap between these groups widened (i.e., recognizing sightwords) (West, Denton, and Reaney 2001). At the end of 1st grade, differences began to emerge between boys and girls in the extent to which they acquired certain reading skills. After 2 years of formal schooling, girls were more likely than boys to be able to read single words and to read and understand words in context (Denton and West 2002). Other, factors were related to children's reading skills and knowledge at the start of kindergaiten and to their reading achievement at the end of kindergarten and 1st grade. At the beginning of kindergarten, children's reading skills and knowledge were related to their home literacy environment. Children from a \"literacy-rich\" home environment (i.e., those who are read to, sung to, and told stories to more frequently and those who have more children's books, records/audiotapes/CDs in the home) demonstrated higher reading knowledge and skills than other children. This relationship existed whether their families' income was above or below the federal poverty threshold Children's performance in reading during kindergarten and 1st grade was also related to their home literacy resources upon entering kindergarten (Denton and West 2002). Paralleling the pattern for children upon kindergarten entry, children with rich literacy environments at home were more likely than other children to perform well in reading at the end of both kindergarten and 1st grade. In addition, children who had certain early literacy knowledge and skills (e.g., could recognize letters of the alphabet, recognize numbers and shapes, and understand the concept of the relative size of objects) when they entered kindergarten demonstrated higher reading proficiency in the spring of both kindergarten and 1st grade than children who did not have this knowledge and skills. Figure 3 shows the relationship between children's proficiency in recognizing letters at kindergarten entry and their specific reading knowledge and skills in the spring of kindergarten. Similarly, children who frequently demonstrated positive approaches to learning when they entered kindergarten (e.g., persisted at tasks, paid attention, and were eager to learn) had higher reading skills than children who less frequently displayed such behavior. This pattern was found in the spring of both kindergarten and 1st grade (Denton and West 2002). Figure 4 shows the relationship between children's approaches to learning and their reading skills at the end of kindergarten. Furthermore, children's health was related to their reading performance in the early years of school. Children who were in \"very good\" to \"excellent\" general health when they entered kindergarten had higher scores in reading in the spring of both kindergarten and 1st grade than those children who were less healthy. As described above, children's reading achievement in kindergarten through the 1st grade is related to certain child and family characteristics, including their home literacy environment, early literacy skills, approaches to learn- ing, and general health. These relationships are still present after controlling for children's poverty status and race/ethnicity (Denton and West 2002).

Results from the survey can be used to answer questions about the percentages of children who attend kindergarten for a full day or part of a day (half day), the instructional approaches and strategies used in kindergarten classrooms, the amount of attention given to certain reading activities and skills, and whether children's reading gains differ by the type of kindergarten program they attend. The findings are presented separately for full-day and half-day kindergartens. What percentage of children attend full-day or half-day kindergarten? Not every child who attends kindergarten goes to. school for a \"full day\": in 1998-99, 56 percent of children attended a full-day kindergarten program, and 44 percent attended a half-day program. Whether children attended for a full day or a half day varied according to where they lived, their race/ethnicity, and poverty level. In public schools, for example, a higher percentage of children in the South attended full-day programs (83 percent) than children in the Northeast,Midwest,and West (41,45,and 23 percent,respectively). Urban and rural children were more likely than suburban children to attend full-day programs (59 and 65 percent, respectively, vs. 45 percent). A higher percentage of Black children than White, Hispanic, and Asian children attended fullday programs (79 percent vs. 49, 46, and 40 percent, respectively). Poor children were more likely than nonpoor children to attend full-day programs (62 vs. 51 percent)..Fifty-four percent of public school kindergartners and 70 percent of private school kindergartners attended a full-day program, compared with 46 percent and 30 percent of their counterparts who attended half-day programs (Walston and West forthcoming). What instructional practices are used in kindergarten classrooms? Kindergarten classrooms also differ in terms of the instructional practices that teachers use to help children learn to read.' Teachers' practices vary in terms of their instructional approachesthat is, the extent to which learning is teacher directed and involves the whole class; teacher directed and involves small group activities; or teacher guided and involves individualchild activities or child-selected activities. Teachers' practices can also vary according to the ways that children are grouped for instructionwhether children are organized into mixed-level groups, achievement groups, or peertutored groups. In whole-class, teacher-directed activities, the teacher initiates and leads the majority of activities while the entire class is involved. Teachers can also lead and structure small-group and individual teacher-directed activities, which sometimes can occur concurrently with child-selected activities. Childselected activities in kindergarten might include, for example, the use of learning centers in which the children can choose an activity (and perhaps the time spent on that activity). To account for the difference in the length of day between full-and half-day programs, in this analysis, the minutes that kindergarten teachers reported spending on these activities were converted into the percentage of class time."}, {"section_title": ".EST COPY AVAILABLE", "text": "Based on teacher reports, full-and half-day classes spent more time in wholeclass activities than in small group, individual, and child-directed activities. No differences were detected in the percentage of total class time spent on each type of teacher-directed activity by kindergarten program type (figure 5). In some classrooms, teachers group children for instruction by their level of ability. As mentioned previously, teachers use various types of groupsmixedlevel, reading achievement level, and peer-tutoringto teach reading. Mixedlevel groups consist of children of different ability levels working together. Reading achievement groups include children with similar abilities working together. Peer-tutoring allows proficient students to assist those who are less proficient with a learning activity. Ability grouping in kindergarten is related to the type of program. In spring 1999, full-day classes were more likely than half-day classes to use mixed-level groups (48 vs. 42 percent), reading achievement groups (26 vs. 14 percent), and peer-tutoring in reading (23 vs. 15 percent) on a daily basis (figure 6). Half-day classes used mixed-level groups more often than other types of groups (Walston and West forthcoming). How much time is spent in kindergarten classrooms on certain reading activities and skills? Reading was taught in practically all kindergarten classrooms (97 percent) in 1998-99 (Walston and West forthcoming). In terms of specific reading activities (e.g., learning phonics, learning vocabulary, reading books), teachers reported that kindergartners were more likely to spend time each day learning the names of letters or working on phonics than doing reading worksheets or reading from basal texts. Some differences in the time spent on various reading activities were found by program type. For example, full-day classes were more likely than half-day classes to work on phonics on a daily basis, discuss new vocabulary, read books chosen by the children, read aloud, read silently, work on a reading worksheet, or read from a basal text (figure 7) (Walston and West forthcoming). In addition to the preceding reading activities, classroom time was also spent on certain reading skills (e.g., matching letters to sounds, conventions of print, making predictions based on text).7 Recognizing letters of the alphabet and matching letters to sounds were the two most common (i.e.,"}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "ReadingYoung Children's Achievement and Classroom Experiences I Page 11 daily) reading skills reported taught in the kindergarten classroom regardless of program type (Walston and West forthcoming). Although there was some consistency in the skills most commonly taught, differences existed. Full-day classrooms were more likely than half-day classrooms to spend time every day on the following skills: letter recognition, letter-sound match, conventions of print, vocabulary, making predictions based on text, using context clues for comprehension, rhyming words, reading aloud, reading multi-syllable words, and alphabetizing (Walston and West forthcoming). The additional time that children who attend full-day kindergarten spend in school increases their exposure to a variety of instruction activitieslearning phonics, reading books, reading from a basal text, and so forth. Findings from the ECLSK suggest that public school children who attend full-day i 7 Page 12 I ReadingYoung Children's Achievement and Classroom Experiences classes make greater reading achievement gains during the kindergarten year than their counterparts who attend half-day classes (figure 8). On a reading scale that ranged from 0 to 72,8 the average kindergartner in a fullday program gained 10.6 points over the school year. For children in halfday kindergarten programs, the average gain was 9.4 points. These differences persist when other characteristics associated with kindergarten program type and/or children's academic success (e.g., race/ethnicity and poverty status), and classroom characteristics that might be related to kindergarten achievement gains (e.g., class size, presence of an instructional aide), are taken into account (Walston and West forthcoming).  "}, {"section_title": "Summary and Discussion", "text": "The ECLSK provides some of the first natiohally representative findings on young children's reading achievement and experiences during the first 6 years of elementary school. This special analysis has reported on the reading skills of children across kindergarten and 1st grade and the kindergarten classroom experiences of beginning readers. Findings from the analysis reveal: The differences in children's reading skills and knowledge usually seen in later grades appear to be present as children begin school and persist after 1 and 2 years of school. For example, White children outperform Black and Hispanic children in reading, and children from poor families tend to have lower reading assessment scores than children from nonpoor families. The resources children possess when they start kindergarten, such as their arly literacy skills and the richness of their home literacy environment, are related to their reading proficiency across kindergarten and 1st grade. Attendance in a full-day or half-day kindergarten is related to where the children live, their race/ethnicity, and the poverty level of their families. Attendance in full-day kindergarten is highest in the South, in urban areas, and among Black and poor children. The reading instructional activities of full-and half-day public school kindergarten classes seem alike in some ways and different in others. Both types of classes spend about the same percentage of time on whole-class, small group, and individual activities. Both types of classes spend time each day on reading. The most commonly taught skills in both types of classes are recognizing the letters of the alphabet and matching letters to sounds. However, full-day classes are more likely to spend time each day on certain skills, including letter recognition, matching letters to sounds, the conventions of print, and vocabulary. Public school children who attend kindergarten for a full day make greater gains in reading over the kindergarten year than public school children who attend kindergarten for half of a day. The findings in this special analysis scratch the surface of the potential of the ECLSK to provide information about children's reading achievement and the school, classroom, and home factors that affect their chances of becoming good readers.
