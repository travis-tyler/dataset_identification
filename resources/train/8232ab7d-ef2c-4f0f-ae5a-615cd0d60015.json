[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) using Centiloid scores. In 57 [C-11] Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positive (+) AD and 23 PiB (+) SVaD patients, we assessed standardized PiB uptake and Centiloid scores in diseasespecific cortical regions, with several reference regions: cerebellar gray (CG), whole cerebellum (WC), WC with brainstem (WC + B), pons, and white matter (WM). We calculated disease group differences from young controls (YC) and YC variance according to reference region. SVaD patients showed large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.8) using all reference regions. WM and pons showed larger YC variances than other regions. Findings were similar for AD patients. CG, WC, and WC + B, but not WM or pons, are reliable reference regions for amyloid imaging analysis in SVaD.\nThe use of amyloid PET scans for quantitative measurement of amyloid-beta deposition has grown in recent years. As a result, the development and standardization of methods for amyloid-PET data analysis, particularly methods applicable across centers, has increasingly interested clinicians and investigators 1-3 . The Centiloid project, an effort to standardize quantitative amyloid-PET plaque estimation across centers, is one such development. The ratio of target to reference region is an effective method for calculating amyloid load, with sufficient discriminatory power between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and matched controls 2,4 . This method is easy, useful, has obvious merit for clinical use as it requires no arterial blood sampling 2 , and has been adopted widely for semi-quantification of amyloid load. In probable AD, target to reference ratio is usually large and variance of the ratio matters little clinically 2 . However, there are sometimes subjects with borderline amyloid PET tracer uptake. A\u03b2 deposition occurs on a continuum; at present there is no clear a priori way to separate individuals who have A\u03b2 in the brain from those who do not. Therefore, small differences in quantification result according to the reference region used can present an issue especially in subjects with borderline uptake. Furthermore, when target-to-reference ratios are converted to the Centiloid scale, the values are increased, as the dynamic range of the Centiloid scale is greater than that of the target-to-reference ratio; consequently, choosing an inappropriate reference region may exaggerate errors in the Centiloid procedure especially in patients with borderline amyloid burden.\nCerebrovascular disease (CVD) and amyloid burden are the most frequent pathologies in cognitively impaired subjects 5 , and these two distinct pathologies present concurrently at a high rate. Mixed pathology is present in approximately half of all clinically diagnosed AD cases 6-9 , even in clinical trials with participants extensively screened for pure AD 10 . Conditions such as subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD), which exhibit both CVD and"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "amyloid pathology, also require amyloid quantification; however, reference region selection in SVaD presents additional difficulties because pathology may occur within and impact measurement of certain reference regions.\nAccording to Thal amyloid phase, pons and cerebellum are among the latest regions presenting amyloid pathology in AD 11 . The cerebellum has been used as a reference region in most previous studies using [C-11] Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET scans 2, 4, 12 . However, there is concern that cerebellum may not be suitable as a reference region for analyses of amyloid burden in conditions other than late-onset AD, as cerebellar amyloid deposits may be present in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) 13 , prion diseases 14 , and genetic AD 15, 16 . Therefore, alternative reference regions such as pons have been evaluated for reliability 4 . Edison and colleagues reported that the pons is a reliable reference region for analysis in [C-11] PiB studies where cerebellum is not an appropriate reference region 4 . A recent study also suggested that WM as a reference region improved discrimination between clinically-defined groups 17 . However, the appropriateness of different reference regions for assessing amyloid uptake in patients with SVaD has not yet been investigated.\nIn this study, we investigated the use of different reference regions in analyzing amyloid uptake in SVaD patients. Given that SVaD patients affect more severe white matter (WM), brainstem and cerebellum than AD patients [18] [19] [20] , we hypothesized that there might be differences between SVaD and AD in the appropriateness of different reference regions. For testing the hypothesis, we used five reference regions cerebellar gray matter (CG), whole cerebellum (WC), WC with brainstem (WC + B), pons, and WM which have been frequently used in previous studies."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Participant demographics. Table 1 shows demographic information of participants in this study. There were no differences in gender proportion between PiB (\u2212) old control (OC), PiB (+) AD, and PiB (+) SVaD groups. However, ANOVA (F = 14.2, p < 0.001) and post-hoc tests indicated the PiB (+) AD group was younger than the PiB (\u2212) OC (t = 3.4 and p = 0.001) and PiB (+) SVaD (t = 4.3 and p < 0.001) groups. Figure 1 shows disease-specific CTX ROIs representing large differences in group-averaged PiB images between OC and patients (see the section of \"Disease-specific CTX ROI\"). SUVr of every voxel in the ROIs is significantly higher in patients (see Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Both CTX AD and CTX SVaD were mostly located in frontal, temporal and parietal regions. When evaluating proportions by lobe, CTX SVaD showed relatively larger proportions in parietal and lower proportions in temporal regions than CTX AD (Table 2) . 1 for statistical test (the detail demographics of age and gender were not available); n: the number of subjects; M: male; F: female; and SD: standard deviation; Asterisk(*): significant difference from group of PIB(+) AD.

Compared to other ROIs, WM and pons ROIs showed greater variance of CL values."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we translated our PiB PET data into the Centiloid scale as described previously 1 , and tested multiple reference regions for evaluating amyloid-beta deposits in cortical target regions, with a focus on patients with PiB (+) SVaD. We found that there were large magnitudes of effect sizes for differences between SVaD and YC regardless of reference ROI. However, using WM or pons ROI as a reference region showed larger variances in YC than using other ROI regions. In PiB (+) AD patients, the results were similar. Taken together, our findings show that CG, WC, and WC + B could be used as reference regions for amyloid imaging analysis in patients with PiB (+) SVaD, which are the same for AD patients. We found that CG, WC or WC + B were reliable as reference regions for amyloid PET analyses in SVaD patients. These regions are commonly used as reference for amyloid PET analyses in AD patients because they are among the last regions where amyloid pathology is known to occur 2,4,12 , and are classified as Thal phase 5 11 . Although some studies have raised the possibility of requiring different reference regions for specific diseases 4,14-16 , our findings demonstrate that appropriate reference regions for SVaD patients are the same as those for AD.\nIn this study, WM showed higher variability of Centiloid-scaled values in YC group than other reference regions. [C-11] PiB binding to WM is mainly non-saturable and non-specific 21 , but PiB retention has been found to be reduced in WMH regions compared to normal appearing WM regions 22 . Some have raised concerns that using a WM-containing reference region for analysis of amyloid imaging data could be problematic in a population with high WMH 22 . Consistent with this, our findings suggest that the quantification of amyloid deposits based on the ratio of target to WM may be an inappropriate approach in SVaD patients.\nWe also found that pons showed higher variability than other reference regions of Centiloid-scaled values in YC. This may appear inconsistent with a recent amyloid imaging study demonstrating the value of the pons as a reference region 4 . The discrepancy may be partly explained by different analysis methods, as well as by different study subjects. Unlike the previous study, patients with genetic AD and prion disease were excluded in our study. However, our findings are consistent with a previous Centiloid study showing pons with higher variability and lower effect size than other reference regions 1 . In addition, the inherent variability of normalization processes could affect the results of our study. For example, poor performance of normalization process in the pons can occur frequently, due to its small size and the fact that the SPM normalization algorithm seems to handle brainstem structures less well than cortical structures 1 , and could influence the [C-11] PiB processing and results. One of the important findings of our study is that CG, WC, and WC + B, but not pons nor WM, are appropriate reference regions in both AD and SVaD. However, several limitations must be noted. First, our conclusions that WM and pons are not reliable reference regions, while CG, WC, and WC + B are suitable for analysis in the scaled data set, is not based on neuropathological studies. The precise performance of these reference regions will require confirmation by further neuropathological studies. Second, other pathologies such as prion disease, tau pathology, or hippocampal sclerosis are not considered because we did not perform a pathologic study. Third, due to the small number of SVaD patients used in this study, it will be necessary to replicate our results with larger samples in further study. Fourth, selecting a disease-specific CTX ROI as well as an appropriate reference region is important for calculating amyloid uptake. We therefore chose the disease-specific CTX ROI in the SVaD and AD groups, separately. Finally, we did not perform correction of PiB retention for brain atrophy, which might have effects on quantification.\nNevertheless, this study demonstrates that CG, WC, and WC + B are reliable reference regions for amyloid PET analysis in patients with SVaD, suggesting that amyloid burden in SVaD patients might be analyzed using the same reference regions as AD.

A 30-minute emission static PET scan was then initiated. The specific radioactivity of [C-11] PiB at time of administration was more than 1,500 Ci/mmol for patients and the radiochemical yield was more than 35%. The radiochemical purity of the tracer was more than 95% in all PET studies.\nImage processing. We employed image processing described in the Centiloid paper 1 , and replicated the Centiloid procedure to validate methodological consistency (see Supplementary information).\nDisease-specific CTX ROI. In Klunk et al. 1 , the CTX ROI was defined using a data-driven mask thresholded at 1.05 SUVr (using the WC reference ROI) difference between group-averaged PiB images of 19 AD subjects and 25 age-matched older controls. The threshold was designed to avoid WM regions and to minimize the number of separate clusters in the CTX ROI, and small holes and isolated voxels were manually edited. Although the typical amyloid binding regions reported in previous studies were included in the published CTX ROI, there were two reasons to generate a new CTX ROI. First, the published CTX ROI was designed specifically for AD patients, and given different progression patterns between SVaD and AD 26 , it was reasonable to make a new CTX ROI for SVaD patients. The second reason necessitating a new CTX ROI was the use of a numerical SUVr threshold. While amyloid deposition was well represented using a CTX ROI 1.05 SUVr unit difference in the dataset of Klunk et al. 1 , this value has not been validated in other datasets. CTX ROI values may be highly variable across cohorts, especially in AD patients with lower severity. Therefore, new CTX ROIs for SVaD and AD patients (CTX AD and CTX SVaD ROIs) were generated (using WC as reference) using data from the 57 PiB (+) AD and 23 PiB (+) SVaD patients, as well as control data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). When creating disease-specific CTX ROIs, we compared disease group and 14 PiB (\u2212) OC subjects to find regions of high amyloid accumulation in elderly. As described above, individual images were transformed to MNI-152 template space and SUVr values derived. The average OC image was (separately) subtracted from averaged AD and SVaD images and spatially smoothed with a 5 mm full width at half maximum kernel. To extract CTX AD and CTX SVaD ROIs, we applied a percent threshold (upper 3% intensity) to smoothed images to retain a similar number of voxels as the published CTX ROI 1 . These disease-specific CTX ROIs are shown in Fig. 1 .\nReference ROIs. The four data-driven ROIs (CG, WC, WC + B and pons) in Klunk et al. 1 have been used as reference ROIs for quantifying of amyloid retention in numerous previous studies [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] , because no significant binding differences between AD and OC are observed. WM has also been evaluated as a reference ROI in recent [C-11] PiB-PET studies 34 , as those studies reveal comparable WM amyloid burden between diagnostic groups and low inter-subject variability. Therefore, we included WM as a candidate reference region. To generate the WM ROI, the WM probability map on template of SPM8 was thresholded at 0.7. This threshold provided a WM region that avoided contributions from CSF and amyloid retention in gray matter."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis.", "text": "Individual SUVr values were calculated for normalized PiB-PET using five different reference ROIs (including WM), and CTX AD and CTX SVaD. SUVr values were obtained by ratio with each of the reference ROIs. CL values for individual subjects in AD group were computed by comparing to YC group which are considered not to have any brain amyloid pathology, and it defined as follows: To describe the dissimilar amyloid binding patterns between CTX AD and CTX SVaD ROIs, we measured regional volumetric proportion of CTX by dividing into frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital lobe and other regions.\nSelection of the standard reference was based on the effect size of the group differences between patients and YC and on the variance of reference ROIs. Effect size for each group was evaluated with Cohen's d with pooled standard deviation, where: \u03bc p and \u03bc n mean the average of SUVr in each patient and YC group. \u03c3 p 2 and \u03c3 n 2 are the variance in each patient and YC group. N p and N n are the number of subjects in each patient and YC group. For variance tests, Bartlett's statistics were employed for validating equal variances of reference ROIs in each clinical group 35 . Post hoc variance tests were also performed to investigate regional specificities for reference ROIs.\nFor quantitative analysis of lobar SUVr values among all groups, mean values of SUVr (using WC as reference) in each lobe were calculated."}]
