[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Studies in the field of mathematics have shown that teachers have stereotyped attitudes towards girls' mathematical abilities, which have detrimental effects on girls' self-concepts and their achievement in this subject. Little is known so far about corresponding processes for boys' reading competencies. The presented study analyzes the assessment of gender differences in children's reading abilities and reading motivation by German primary school teachers. One hundred and seventy-two teachers filled in a questionnaire with several questions on reading competencies, reading behavior and reading interest of girls and boys. Differences between the appraisal of girls and boys and differences between the answers of male and female teachers were analyzed by analysis of variance.\nResults show that teachers assume significant gender differences in reading competencies, reading motivation, and reading behavior in favor of the girls. Interestingly, male teachers assess these differences even to be greater than female teachers do. As a consequence, it seems necessary to analyze and discuss the influences of these stereotyped perceptions on boys' reading self-concepts and reading motivation. Results are also discussed with respect to the \"feminization of teaching\" discourse."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "After decades of research on disadvantages for girls in the educational system, \"male underachievement\" has become a frequently discussed topic in the social sciences. Especially after the-at least for some countries, e.g., Germany-\"shocking\" results of the PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) survey, boys' deficits in achievement got into the focus of attention. As a consequence also the media, as well as numerous publications in popular sciences identified boys as the so-called \"new losers\" in the educational system and their situation was labeled as \"crisis\" (for an overview see Hadjar, 2011; Hannover & Kessels, 2011) .\nBut looking at the statistical figures with respect to school grades and certificates and the results of the most important surveys on student assessment on boys' achievement in school, the resulting picture for Germany is not that uniform. As far as achievement at school in general is concerned, the so-called \"boy problem\" does not seem to be a new one. It had just been covered by keeping the girls back from higher levels of education up to the 1960s (Endepohls-Ulpe, 2011; Helbig, 2012) .\nIn Germany, in the field of mathematics differences are still discovered in favor of the boys regularly. Whereas several studies reveal that girls and boys enter school with equal preconditions for learning Martina Endepohls-Ulpe, Ph.D., Institute for Psychology, University of Koblenz-Landau, Campus Koblenz. D DA VID PUBLISHING mathematics (Tiedemann & Faber, 1994 , as cited in Budde, 2008; Rohe & Quaiser-Pohl, 2010) , an articulate gender gap already seems to develop in favor of the German boys in elementary school, and this gap is greater than in some other European countries. For older students, assessment studies like PISA and TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) show better results for males and the differences to girls' results are greater than in other European countries as well (difference in PISA 2006: 19 points, as cited in Blossfeld et al., 2009) .\nEverywhere in Europe, and this is also the case in Germany, one of the most striking gender differences in achievement for older children and the most frequently discussed issue of concern in the context of \"male underachievement\" is the gender gap in reading achievement. This gap is revealed by all international assessment studies conducted in the last decade. Also in PIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) 2006 girls in the fourth grade in average showed better reading achievement (Mullis, Martin, Kennedy, & Foy, 2007) . But there were also countries where no gender differences were found. In Germany, mean differences between reading competences of girls and boys were very small-only seven points, which makes the difference just significant (Bos et al., 2007) . There are several other German studies with primary school children that do not detect any gender differences in reading at all or at least only very small differences (Herwartz-Emden, Braun, Heinze, Rudolph-Albert, & Reiss, 2008; K\u00f6lbl, Tiedemann, & Billmann-Mahecha, 2006) . Actually, the gender gap in reading does not get really visible before we take a look at the reading achievement of older students. In PISA 2009, the mean difference in reading achievement between German girls and boys was 40 points in favor of the girls (Naumann, Artelt, Schneider, & Stanat, 2010) . Similar differences for 15-year-old students have been detected in all former PISA surveys. In Germany, the number of extremely poor readers is three times as high for the boys as for the girls (Naumann et al., 2010) In spite of their poorer reading abilities, boys' self-concept with respect to this domain is as high as the one of the girls (M\u00f6ller & Bonerad, 2007) . There seem to be differences in interest and engagement in reading activities that are crucial for their lower achievement (Naumann et al., 2010) . These differences are found for 15-year-old students (Naumann et al., 2010) but can already be noticed for primary school children (Bos et al. 2007; M\u00f6ller & Bernard, 2007) . For the group of boys and girls who are highly interested in reading activities no gender differences in reading achievement can be found (Prenzel et al., 2004) .\nThere is also evidence that male and female students have different reading preferences with respect to certain text types or genres, but the results of studies concerning this matter are not quite consistent. Richter and Plath (2007) as well as Riedinger (2011) found out that primary school girls are significantly more motivated to read stories and books than their male peers. Richter and Plath (2007) found no gender differences concerning comics, magazines, or picture stories, whereas Riedinger (2011) showed that boys prefer comics, and books or stories on television series or films. Boys are looking for suspense and adventure, like to read about heroes and fights, whereas girls prefer stories about friendship or human fates, stories related to their own lives (see Philipp & Garbe, 2007, p. 17) and stories about animals (Riedinger, 2011) . A difference which is consistently found in studies on reading interest and reading motivation is that a greater number of girls use to read just for fun (see Riedinger, 2011) .\nThere are several causes for gender differences in the educational system that are discussed in literature (for an overview see Endepohls-Ulpe, 2011; . With respect to boys' inferior reading achievement interestingly congenital biological differences-having been used for decades to underpin the thesis of females' intellectual inferiority-are frequently mentioned as a cause in the last decade. Boys are said to have deficits in language development and the development of fine motor skills, which hinder their process of learning to read and to have different learning styles and different needs with respect to physical activity which schools do not take into account (Birkenbihl, 2005 ; for a discussion and critique see Gilbert, 2009 ). Up to now, there is little evidence for innate biological disadvantages detrimental to boys' reading competencies. Gender-specific processes of reading socialization seem to be more promising when looking for explanations for gender differences (Bos et al., 2007) .\nA second explanation especially for boys' difficulties at school is the so-called \"feminization of teaching\". In Germany as well as in most of the European countries, in the early years of schooling most of the teachers are female. This circumstance leads boys to define school as something feminine and to oppose against the requests of instruction (Rohrmann, 2007) . There are even authors who postulate a discrimination of boys by their female teachers in primary school, e.g., by giving them worse marks or not recommending them for attending upper secondary school in spite of their sufficient aptitude (for an overview see Neugebauer, 2011) . Against the thesis that female teachers have a negative impact on boys' achievement some empirical evidence has been collected during the last years (Hadjar, 2011) . Boys in general do not do better at school when taught by male teachers nor do girls better when taught by females, but boys as well as girls show more positive attitudes towards school in general when they are instructed by females (Carrington, Tymms, & Merrel, 2008) . With respect to the field of reading boys' achievement is not necessarily higher in countries with a higher percentage of male primary school teachers (Blossfeld et al., 2009) , and boys are not better in reading when their teachers are male. When taught by a female teacher they do not stereotype reading as a female activity (Sokal, Katz, Chaszeswski, & Wojcik, 2007) .\nGender stereotypes have an impact on the process of identity formation of children and thereby also on their achievement in certain domains. Children and adolescents tend to engage in activities which fit to their self-concept as a male or female. This is said to have the consequence that boys avoid activities which they stereotype as female, e.g., reading, working diligently, cooperating with teachers, etc. (Hannover, 2004) . For girls, stereotypes are postulated to directly affect their performance in male connoted tasks by a phenomenon which is called \"stereotype threat\". When a task is marked as a male-typical one, this will have a negative effect on the achievement of females when performing this task (see Steele, 1997) . This could be shown in experimental studies especially for mathematical and spatial tasks (e.g., Neuburger, Jansen, Heil, & Quaiser-Pohl, 2012; Spencer, Steele, & Quinn, 1999) . It could also be shown that teachers have stereotyped beliefs about the abilities of male and female students. They think that girls' abilities in the field of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) are lower than boys' and by expressing these gender-stereotyped beliefs about students' abilities they often create stereotype threat for girls in their classes (Rustemeyer & Jubel, 1996; Tiedemann, 1995; Ziegler, Kuhn, & Heller, 1998) .\nUp to the moment, only a few studies have examined the impact of stereotypes on boys' reading achievement (Eckert & Imhof, 2011 Schirner, in press) and also little is known about teachers' beliefs about boys' reading abilities and reading motivation. Schirner (in press) identified a group of primary school teachers in her sample who indeed attributed inferior competences in the subject \"German language\" to boys.\nLooking at the discussion of the \"boy problem\" in media, in popular science, and in education politics one could assume that there are indeed \"\u2026 beliefs, shared by members of one group, about the shared characteristics of another group\" (Wright & Taylor, 2003, p. 433) in terms of teachers sharing negative attitudes against boys' reading abilities. Actually compared to reactions, e.g., in the UK, Australia, or the USA (see Lingard, 2003; Mills, 2003; Titus, 2004; Smith, 2003; Weaver-Hightower, 2003) , German education policy on the whole, at least until 2010 (see Hannover & Kessels, 2011; Neugebauer, 2011) , in fact reacted rather unexcitedly in view of gender differences in achievement, trying to meet the needs of boys and girls (BfFSFJ (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend), 2007; Budde, 2008; Blossfeld et. al, 2009 ). However, in the last years numerous measures were initiated at German primary schools to improve the reading competencies of boys (Engelhardt, 2006) , assuming that the origins of boys' lack of progress in reading achievement in secondary school must already lie in their primary school years and thus probably nurturing stereotypes about gender differences in reading for younger children."}, {"section_title": "Issues and Conception of the Study Aim of the Study", "text": "The presented study analyzes German primary school teachers' attitudes with respect to gender differences in primary school children's reading abilities, reading behavior, interest, reading motivation, and possible gender-specific detrimental influences on their reading ability.

No significant differences between male and female teachers or interaction effects could be shown (see Table 6 ). "}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusions", "text": "Results show that German teachers assume significant gender differences in reading competencies for primary school children, differences which are not consistent with results of empirical studies with German children of that age. Regardless of the detailed competency that had to be assessed, boys' achievement was rated to be lower than girls', and these differences were large-about one SD-with middle to large effect sizes. The same is true for the assessed verbal competencies of girls and boys when entering school and the assessed frequency of the case that a child's reading competencies are not developed age appropriately. In contrast to recent empirical evidence, boys' were rated inferior to girls. Thus the data support the notion that primary school teachers have stereotypical attitudes concerning children's reading competencies in disadvantage of the boys.\nWith respect to reading behavior (frequency of reading during leisure time) and general interest in reading, teachers' judgments for boys and girls are even more apart, nearly two SDs. In these domains teachers' perceptions are consistent with results of empirical studies, even though the rating differences seem to be rather large, assessing boys' reading only \"From time to time\" or \"Rarely\" and their general reading interest as not quite \"Satisfactory\". Results of PIRLS 2006 show that whilst 28% of the German boys never read books or magazines in their leisure time only 11.2% of the girls never read, but on the other hand 40.6% of the boys read up to one hour every day and 30.9% more than one hour (Bos et al., 2007) .\nLooking at text types and contents that teachers assume boys and girls to prefer, they seem to be rather gender stereotypical but, at least partly, to be consistent with results of recent studies. Nevertheless, a striking fact is that there is only a small correspondence of teachers' hypotheses on reading preferences with the types of texts teachers use in their literacy lessons. Teachers most frequently use non-fiction texts and rarely use comics in spite of their judgment that girls prefer fiction books and boys prefer adventure stories and comics.\nTeachers' judgments on possible influences on children's reading competencies are also rather consistent with results of recent studies. Baier and Pfeiffer (2011) showed that spending large amounts of time watching TV and playing computer games are the two most detrimental influences on primary school boys' general achievement at school and studies like PIRLS reveals a migration background and low status of parents as significant negative influences on children's reading abilities in general .\nWhen we take a look at differences between male and female teachers' judgments nearly no general differences in the form of main effects can be found. Male teachers seem to have more negative attitudes towards children's general verbal abilities at the age when they enter school. But the interaction effects \"Sex of child \u00d7 Sex of teacher\" in the field of reading competencies show that male teachers believe these differences to be greater than female teachers do. A look at the means of male and female teachers on the built \"Index reading competency\", the mean of the judgments of all detailed competencies, shows that these effects mainly result from male teachers assessing boys' competencies even lower than female teachers do.\nWith respect to teachers' attitudes on gender differences in preferred text types, interaction effects point out greater stereotypes in female teachers with respect to some items as well as for male teachers when looking at other ones. Male teachers see greater differences in interest for stories about animals and nature than female teachers do, whilst female teachers see a greater gender difference in interest for love stories and adventure books.\nAs a general consequence of these results it seems necessary to analyze and discuss the possible influences of teachers' stereotypical and non-realistic perceptions of boys' reading competencies on boys' reading self-concepts and reading motivation. One could assume similar effects as it has been shown for teachers' negative stereotypes on girls' competencies in mathematics, like lower self-concept in reading and/or creating situations of stereotype threat, which has detrimental effects on reading achievement. Actually, recent studies M\u00f6ller & Bonerad, 2007) show no gender differences in reading self-concept for younger children and first studies on effects of stereotype threat for the reading achievement of secondary school boys (Eckert & Imhof, 2012) even found an enhancement of boys' reading achievement under the condition of stereotype threat. Schirner (in press) found no differences with respect to gender specific classroom interactions in lessons in reading and language for primary school children between teachers with and without stereotypes in disadvantage of the boys for this subject. Thus it might be promising to study the consequences of teachers' stereotypes on boys' reading motivation. As Deci and Ryan (1985) pointed out intrinsic motivation is enhanced by a feeling of competence and autonomy. Maybe boys' lack of intrinsic motivation to read, which is blamed as one of the main causes for boys' inferior readings competencies in secondary school, is a result of a combination of negative feedback on their reading competency and a lack of autonomy, e.g., to choose reading materials on their own.\nInteraction effects \"Sex of child \u00d7 Sex of teacher\" have to be discussed with respect to the discourse on \"Feminization of teaching\" as a cause of boys failing at school. The fact that male primary school teachers seem to judge boys' competencies even poorer than their female colleagues do is inconsistent with the notion that the overweight of female primary school teachers discriminates boys by giving them bad marks and thus might be responsible for boys falling back behind girls at school.\nOf course, this study has some limitations that affect the generalizability of the findings. The sample is too small and with respect to age not representative for the population of primary school teachers as a whole. The former, due to the small quota of male primary school teachers, is especially true for the subsample of male teachers. Thus, also with regard to the small effect sizes, the results on gender specific interaction effects have to be interpreted with caution and must be verified by a larger sample."}]
