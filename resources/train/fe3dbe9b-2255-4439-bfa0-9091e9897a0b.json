PD pathology is therefore detected in, and may in some cases begin at, sites outside the central nervous system (CNS). For example, \u03b1-synuclein pathology is seen in autonomic nerves innervating the heart, 4 gut, 5 and prostate, 6 and immunoreactivity in skin tissue is observed in autopsy-identified cases with Lewy body disease. 7 A PD pathology staging system has been proposed based on more than 125 autopsy cases. 8 Six neuropathological stages have been proposed, each characterized by \u03b1-synuclein pathology, beginning in non-dopaminergic structures of the brainstem and olfactory bulb with progression to more caudal regions of the CNS. The six stages involve: 1) the caudal medulla, including the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and the olfactory bulb; 2) the medulla oblongata and adjoining portions of the pontine tegmentum, including the locus ceruleus and other 'gain setting nuclei'; 3) the SN; 4) the forebrain and temporal mesocortex; and 5) and 6) widespread regions of the cerebral cortex. 8 It is proposed that cardinal motor signs of PD begin to occur at the third stage. Although this study did not set out to provide clinicopathologic correlation, certain non-motor symptoms, such as olfactory dysfunction and sleep disorders, may occur prior to motor symptoms (see below), and the Braak staging suggests precise pathological underpinnings.\nThis hypothesis has provided a springboard for critical analysis of the pattern of \u03b1-synuclein pathology and its relationship to clinical features. 9, 10 For example, in the Baltimore longitudinal study of aging, of 117 brains examined at autopsy, \u03b1-synuclein pathology was observed in 100 % of seven cases of PD, in 31.5 % of 56 cases with Alzheimer's disease pathology, and in 8.3 % of 36 older control brains. 11 Another consideration is that the presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites may not be necessary for cellular dysfunction and may not therefore fully define regions of PD cellular dysfunction. There is accumulating evidence that axonal loss may occur earlier and as a distinct process from cell body degeneration in PD. 12 For instance, examination of \u03b1-synuclein pathology and tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining in cardiac sympathetic axons and ganglia in patients with incidental Lewy body pathology, PD, and controls, suggests that the disease process begins in the distal axon and proceeds in a retrograde fashion. 13 Moreover, the existence of distinct mechanisms mediating cell soma and axonal degeneration is supported by the protection of dopamine neuron cell bodies, but not axons, by jnk2 and jnk3 null mutations in the 6-hydroxydopamine rodent model of Parkinsonism. 14 This is important, since axonal loss, occurring as a distinct process prior to neuronal cell body loss in PD, has implications regarding target choices for neuroprotection. Although preservation of neuron cell bodies is essential for the function and prolonged survival of axons, focusing exclusively upon interventions aimed at protecting cell bodies against programmed cell death may be missing important therapeutic targets."}, {"section_title": "12,15", "text": "How Does Parkinson's Disease Present Clinically?\nThe variety of structures in which PD pathology has been observed suggests that a focus upon predicted clinical correlates may yield measures that could aid in early diagnosis. Langston in 2006 described Parkinsonism as the 'tip of the iceberg' of PD, with non-motor symptoms including mood disorders, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disorders, autonomic dysfunction, and pain or sensory syndromes coexisting alongside motor symptoms. 16 It is now increasingly recognized that non-motor symptoms might in some cases arise prior to the characteristic motor symptoms, possibly forming a pre-motor syndrome. The term 'Parkinson's associated risk syndrome' (PARS) has been coined to describe a combination of features identifying individuals at risk for developing PD (see Table 1 )."}, {"section_title": "17", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder", "text": "Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by recurrent episodes of sudden, abnormally vigorous body, head, or limb 19 There is a high risk for conversion to PD, in addition to conversion to dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), in multiple studies. For example, in a retrospective study of 44 patients with idiopathic RBD, 45 % went on to be diagnosed with PD or DLB a mean of 5.1 years after RBD diagnosis, and 11.5 years after the onset of RBD symptoms. 20 In a careful prospective study of 67 patients with idiopathic RBD, six went on to develop PD and 11 went on to develop dementia with DLB characteristics at five years, and 52 % developed a neurodegenerative disorder at 12 years. 21 "}, {"section_title": "Olfactory Dysfunction", "text": "In addition to RBD, olfactory dysfunction is one of the most well-known pre-motor symptoms, and multiple studies suggest it is an early sign of PD, 22 consistent with proposed involvement of the olfactory bulb in "}, {"section_title": "Constipation", "text": "Constipation is another symptom that often predates clinical PD and has been attributed to \u03b1-synuclein pathology in the myenteric and submucosal plexus. 27 In the Honolulu Heart Program, a prospective study of more than 8,000 Japanese-American men followed with periodic health surveys, men who reported less than one bowel movement per day were more than four times more likely to develop PD than those who reported two or more bowel movements per day. 28 Gastrointestinal dysfunction in PD is not limited to constipation, but includes delayed gastric emptying, dysphagia, and anorectal dysfunction. 29 "}, {"section_title": "Cardiac Autonomic Dysfunction", "text": "More than 40 studies on cardiac autonomic dysfunction in PD raise the possibility that neurophysiologic measures could contribute to earlier PD diagnosis.

In a study of 246 individuals, PD could be distinguished from MSA with 89.7 % sensitivity and 94 % specificity. 32 The role of a more accessible and cheaper test is now under examination; decreased heart rate variability (HRV), which may be detected by electrocardiogram (EKG) recordings, has now been observed in patients with PD in a number of studies, including during polysomnographic studies."}, {"section_title": "33,34", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Neurobehavioral Features", "text": "Symptoms including depression, anxiety, and cognitive changes are more commonly observed after PD diagnosis, but may be present up to 20 years prior to the diagnosis of motor symptoms.

Hitherto, individual clinical markers have not been specific; for instance, the severe olfactory dysfunction that can occur in PD also occurs in certain other neurodegenerative conditions, including MSA, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and other disorders. 38 The most reliable method of pre-motor PD detection will therefore most likely rely on a combinatorial approach. In a recent study, non-motor signs across six different domains were explored in patients with early motor PD. 39 Tests addressed visual deficits tested by color discrimination, contrast sensitivity, and spatial discrimination; olfactory function; sleep abnormalities by Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale rating and documentation of loss of muscle atonia during REM sleep on polysomnography; dysautonomia as reported on two self-completed questionnaires; executive dysfunction; and depression.\nThirty patients with motor signs of PD for less than three years were compared with a control group in each of these domains. Across all domains, patients with PD performed worse than the control group, with statistically significant differences in visual deficits, sleep abnormalities, hyposmia, dysautonomia, and depression; the most marked distinction between the test and control groups emerged in visual deficits, hyposmia, and dysautonomia. 39 By combining the results of the Farnsworth-Munsell color discrimination test and the non-motor symptom questionnaire (NMSQuest), the sensitivity and specificity for detection of PD peaked at 0.77, suggesting a relatively simple model for predicting PD.\nTesting performance characteristics of combinatorial markers in PD is useful, but ultimately needs to be performed in at-risk individuals. It is therefore important that clustering of non-motor features has also been observed in studies of individuals at risk for PD. For example, in a small study of 20 patients with RBD, HRV as determined by EKG was compared with that of control subjects with primary insomnia. 40 In those subjects with RBD, HRV was decreased compared with controls. Genomic analysis is useful as a 'trait' rather than 'state' biomarker and therefore may be most useful as a marker to stratify individuals in terms of PD risk. Multiple genes have now been identified that lead to Mendelian inheritance of PD and Parkinsonism being reviewed. 48, 49 In general, how best to use genetic testing as a predictor of PD remains to be established, and genes leading to heritable PD may only be useful in a minority of cases, with the exception of leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2) in specific populations. However, identification of genetic risk loci and the use of GWAS holds the promise of risk stratification, 50 with the possibility that significant PD risk might be "}, {"section_title": "Neuroimaging as a Diagnostic Tool of Pre-motor", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The worldwide increase in PD that is currently forecast makes efforts to improve its management imperative, and there is a critical need other biomarkers may provide more specificity, but in the near future will be largely limited to specialist centers, and are expensive. 58 It is unlikely that one specific clinical test or biomarker will serve all purposes.\nA constellation of clinical batteries and biomarkers, incorporating clinical symptom measurement, molecular genetics, and markers based upon PD pathophysiology may eventually provide better and more predictable risk profiling than single markers. Indeed, the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI), an international study obtaining longitudinal multimodal imaging data in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and controls (www.adni-info.org), is examining such a combinatorial approach. 59 New initiatives in PD are now testing how a collaborative approach for comparison and combination of markers may be applied to biomarker development, for example the Parkinson's progression markers initiative (PPMI: NCT01141023).\nFinally, more accurate diagnosis is predicted to enhance patient care significantly, and will certainly remove much of the initial uncertainty in practice as patients are newly diagnosed. However, can it be shown that earlier diagnosis of PD will have a significant impact upon long-term patient outcomes? If neurologists become inclined to increase effort in this area to speed initiation of treatment, will this result in health or social/economic benefit? As we develop technologies that put these goals within our reach, and provide a window of opportunity to redefine treatment paradigms, it will be important to pay attention to measures of long-term outcomes and impact upon overall health and social function. n"}]
