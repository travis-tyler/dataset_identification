Statistical profile of total doctorate recipients, by sex: 197J, 1981, and 1985 introduction Persons who earn education doctorates play an important role in the education system in this country -as administrators of elementary/secondary schools and postsecondary institutions, and as college and university faculty vho \"train the teachers,\" conduct research on teaching and learning, and develop curriculums. However, the field of educatton at the doctoral level has received lIttle attention in published reports. This report fills that information gap by presenting data on education doctorate awards and characteristics of education doctorate recipients from 1976 to 1986, with contextual information back to 1966.4* This special report is based on data from two annual Federal surveys. The Degrees and Other Formal Awards Conferred survey of all institutions of higher education was used as the best source to describe the number of awards (total doctorates and education doctorates). The Survey of Earned Doctorates, completed by all persons receiving doctor's degrees, was used as the best source to describe the characteristics of the recipients and their fields of specialization. (See the appendix for more information.; Education has been the most popular field of choice for doctoral study since 1966, accounting for over one out of five doctoral degrees in 19P6. The number of awards increased from 3,060 degrees in 1966 to a high point of 7,960 degrees in 1977.3 It has declined since then, due primarily to fewer men entering the field, and by 1986 hit a 14-year low of 7,110. Even with these declines, education was still the most popular field of doctoral study in 1986. The characte:istice of education doctorate recipients have changed considerably in the last decade and have come closer tc reflecting the characteristics of the U.S. population. Women now account for over half of all graduates, and there have been increasing numbers of minority graduates (with the exception of black graduates, whose numbers have been declining in recent years). More foreign students are studying for education doctorates, to a point where foreign graduates almost equal the combined number of all U.S. minorities earning education doctorates. Education doctorate recipients are going more into administration and less into teaching fields. Fewer plan to work in education institutions, and more plan to work for business and industry."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "For simplicity, academic years are referred to by the year in which they end.

However, by 1986, the number of education doctorates had more than doubled and had exceeded physical sciences doctorates, still in second place, by 3,560 awards."}, {"section_title": "Notes", "text": "Data for this section are from the Degrees andOther Formal Awards Conferred surveys, 1966 through 1986. 4 National Academy of Sciences, A Century of Doctorates, Data Analyses of Growth and Change. Washington, D.C., Printing and Publishing Office, National Academy of Sciences, 1978, pp. 12-23. -2-During the 1966-77 period, the number of education doctorates grew much faster than total doctorates, which peaked in 1973 and then stabilized. The field of education peaked in doctoral awards in 1977 (7,960 doctorates) and captured its greatest share of all doctorates in 1980 (24.3 percent) (table 2). Awards of education doctorates fluctuated briefly after peaking in 1977 and began a steady decline after 1980. By 1986, education doctorates were at a 14-year low of 7,110 awards, and their share cf total doctorates was down to 21 percent. Education was second only to humanities in lose of total awards and rate of decline over the 1976-86 period.5 Even with these declines, education was still the largest doctoral field. The number of education doctorates earned by men rose annually from 1966 to 1973, when it peaked at 5,500 (table 2). The number then fluctuated before beginning a steady decline in 1978. Women earned education doctorates in steadily increasing numbers from 1966 to 1981, though the numbers have stabilized since then. Over the 1976-86 period, education doctorates awarded to men and women followed strongly divergent paths: awards to women increased 46 percent, and awards to men decreased by 36 percent (table 2 and figure 1). Although men dominated doctoral awards in education in 1976, accounting for two-thirds of the total, their share of awards has declined annually sincl 1970. In 1983, for the first time, women earned more education doctorates than men. Since then, women's share of education doctorates has increased slightly every year, and reached 53 percent in 1986. However, the number of such awards earned by women has stabilized since 1981. Given the stability in doctoral awards in education earned by women and the fact that these awards to men have declined steadily, it is likely that the field of education will continue to decline as a choice for doctoral study. v_________ \"'National Research Council, Summary Report 1985, Doctorate Recipients from United States Universities, National Academy Press, Washington, D. C., 1986, p. 3; and unpublished data from the National Research Council's 1986 Survey of Earned Doctorates.  Fields of Specialization In Education, 1976-86 The top five fields in the number of education doctorates awarded were identical in 1976 and 1986 (table 3). Education administration and supervision was the largest field of specialization by far, awarding over twice as many doctorates as the next largest field, curriculum and instruction. Student counseling, personnel services dropped to the bottom of the top five fields. Education doctorates can be classified into non-teaching and teaching fields of specialization (appendix table A). No teaching fields appeared among the top five education fields in 1976 or 1986. Education doctorates awarded in non-teaching fields outnumbered those in teaching fields about 4 to 1 throughout the 1976-R6 period. Of the two major classifications, teaching doctorates declined more rapidly during this period--20 percent vs. 15 percent for non-teaching doctorates.\nData for this section are from the Survey of Earned Doctorates, 1976-86. The fields of \"other\" education and \"general\" education are excluded from analysis in this section (pp. 6 to 9) because of their indefinite content, unless otherwise stated. Physical education retained its position as the most popular teaching field, awarding over twice as many doctorates in 1986 as the next largest field--reading education. Reading education was the only teaching field among the top five to show a net increase in doctoral awards over the 11-year period. Science education was replaced arn_ag the top five by English education. The fields of \"other\" education and \"general\" education are included in the count of total education doctorates. -7-"}, {"section_title": "Top Gains and Louse of Awards", "text": "Absolute gains in education doctorates from 1976 to 1986 occurred in or 6 fields of specialization--curriculum and instruction, education measures and statistics, adult and continuing education, agricultural education, reading education, and foreign languages (appendix table A).. All six fields together had a net growth of only 70 doctorates. These negligible gains underscore the waning popularity of the education field as a whole for doctoral study. The largest loss in education doctorates occurred in the field of student counseling, perponnel services, which declined by 380 awards from 1976-86. Educational psychology was the second largest loser, dropping by 17C awards. Together, the two fields accounted for almost half of the total declire in education doctorates over the 11-year period. Among the teaching disciplines, trade and industrial education decreased the most, losing almost 90 awards, and physical education, health, and recreation (50 doctorates) and science education (40 doctorates) were the second and third 1-rgest losers."}, {"section_title": "Representation in Education Fields, by Sex", "text": "The number of education fields in which women received the majority doctoral awarCs more than tripled in 1976-86 (appendix tables A and B)."}, {"section_title": "By", "text": "1986, men dominated only 10 fields of specialization (figure 2), almost three-fourths of which were teaching fields. \u00b0T he number of awards to women increased sizeably in only two of the male-dominated fields: education aaministration and supervision, and physical education, health, and recreation (appendix table A). In the other fields, women either lost ground or made negligible gains. Nevertheless, women increased their proportional representation in most male-dominated fields over the decade, primarily because the number of education doctorates awarded to men dropped. Some of this increase is due to newly created fields in which women predominate.

The top 50 institutions awarding education doctorates in 1986 accounted for almost two -thirds of all education doctorates awarded that year. The number of education doctorates awarded by each of these institutions (table 5) ranged between 50 and 170 degrees. Three-fourths of these institutions were public; the remaining were priv e. The top two institutions awarding education doctorates were both from the State of Pennsylvania --Temple University and the University of Pittsburgh. Columbia Teachers College, the only teacher's college among the top 50, ranked third on the list.

Historically, white men have dominated doctoral study in education, although this figld has attracted more women and minorities than other major fields of study.' White males accounted for 60 percent of education doctorates in 1976, and by 1986 accounted for 38 percent. There were large decreases in the numbers of white men earning education doctorates (from 4,110 in 1976 to 2,110 in 1986). Women and minorities became the majority of education doctorates primarily because of these declines and the numerical increases in women earning education doctorates. Compared with their representation in the population, women were overrepresented among education doctorates, while most minority groups were still underrepresented in 1986 (table 7). Minorities have not made major gains in recent ye,..rs, and blacks have had significant declines (table 8). From 1982 to 1986, the number of black education 4octorates declined 26 percent; this decline was even greater than the 9 percent decline for the white majority group. The decline in blacks as a group was primarily the result of a precipitous decline of 40 percent in the number of black men earning education doctorates from 1982 to 1986, a decline twice that of white men (20 percent). The lose of black men in education, once the field in which most earngd their degrees, has not been counter-balanced by increases in other fields,w nor by increases in black women earning education doctorates (table 8). This decline in the number of blacks earning doctorates, especially of men, is not limited to education; it has also occurred to a lesser extec at other degree levels.\" In the same time period, the number of education awards to Hispanic men also declined. However, increases in awards to Hispanic women counterbalanced this drop, so no net losses occurred for this group as a whole. Since 1983, Hispanic amen have earned more education doctorates than Hispanic men (with the exception of Mexican-American degree recipientb until 1986) (table 8).

Foreign Students Earning U.S. Education Doctorates Doctoral education offered by U.S. universities has been drawing increasing numbers of students from foreign countries. Most of these students enroll in technological fields that are relatively \"culture-free,\" such as science and engineering. Although the field of education has not drawn large numbers of foreign students, their numbers have increased steadily since 1976, from 460 to 700 in 1985. During this period, foreign students climbed from 6 percent to over 10 percent of all education doctorate recipients (appendix table C). The 1985 figure is significant in that it approaches the proportion of education doctorates earned by all U.S. minority students combined. In 1985, most foreign education doctorate recipients were men (69 percent), most of whom were on temporary visas (82 percent). After earning their doctorates, about half planned to leave the U.!. (52 percent) to work in a foreign university or government. While foreign recipients of U. education doctorates came from all over the world, 36 percent came from Asia.

The median age at which recipients received their degrees increased during the decade from 37 to 39 years. Women recipients were slightly older (39 years) than men (38 :rears) when thay earned their degrees, although both were registered for graduate work for a similar amount of time (almost 8 years) (appendix table C). Education doctorate recipients have been about 5 years older (median age) than all doctorate recipients throughout the decade. For men, one year of this age difference was accounted for by additional registered time, and the remainder by time in which they were not registered for graduate work. Women who pursued education doctorates were registered for graduate work about the same amount of time as women pursuing doctorates in other fields, so the difference in age is accounted for by time in which they were not registered for graduat work. It is likely tnat many persons who earned an education doctorate were employed full-time during this period. From the time they earned their bachelor' degrees, a median time lapse of 15 years occurred until they earned their education doctorates; only 10 years elapsed for all doctorates (appendix tables C and D)."}, {"section_title": "Planned Employment after Graduation", "text": "At the completion of their education doctorate, more graduates had definite employment plane (66 percent) or were seeking employment (23 percent) (appendix table C).
