If shown to be robust, these proteins could have utility as a blood test for enrichment in clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics. Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether previously identified blood proteins also show evidence for association with NAB in serum samples from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL). The study considers candidate proteins seen in cohorts other than AIBL and candidates previously discovered in the AIBL cohort. Methods: Our study used the SOMAscan platform for protein quantification in blood serum. Linear and logistic regressions were used to model continuous NAB and dichotomized NAB respectively using single proteins as a predictor. Multiple protein models were built using stepwise regression techniques and support vectors machines. Age and APOE 4 carriage were used as covariates for all analysis. Results: Of the 41 proteins previously reported, 15 AIBL candidates and 20 non-AIBL candidates were available for testing. Of these candidates, pancreatic polypeptide (PPY) and IgM showed a significant association with NAB. Notably, IgM was found to associate with continuous NAB across cognitively normal control subjects."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The pathology of AD is characterized by three features in the brain: the aggregation of amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) into plaques, the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau in the form of tangles, and the occurrence of neuron loss leading to brain atrophy [1, 2] . There is debate as to how these processes interact to cause symptomatic AD. A popular theory is the amyloid cascade hypothesis: that A\u2424 deposition is central to disease development [3] . Studies show that A\u2424 plaques begin to develop up to 20 years prior to clinical diagnosis with their growth reaching a plateau as clinical symptoms arise [4, 5] . The presence of AD pathology can be investigated through characteristics that are informative of AD diagnosis; endophenotypes. Measurements of analytes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and molecular imaging by positron emission tomography (PET) scans are examples of endophenotypes that are biomarkers for AD. The disadvantages of the procedures involved in attaining these measurements include their invasive or expensive nature and that they require specialized administration.\nExisting treatments for AD provide short-term symptomatic relief, in a subset of patients, and trials of potential disease modifying treatments are failing [6] . Two suggestions have been made to address this shortcoming: the use of A\u2424 as a companion diagnostic in tertiary prevention trials (those investigating disease modifying or symptomatic treatments) and in secondary prevention trials (investigating treatments to prevent the disease from occurring in the first place). Firstly, we consider the use of a companion diagnostic in a normal clinical trial. To date, trials of A\u2424 targeting drugs have recruited patients with a clinical AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis and unknown brain A\u2424 burden [7] [8] [9] [10] . As A\u2424 PET scans became more readily available, toward the end of such trials, A\u2424 burden was measured and it was discovered that some of these AD patients had low A\u2424 burden (the target pathology). For example, in a trial of Bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-A\u2424 monoclonal antibody, approximately 14% of subjects had low A\u2424 burden [9] . Consequently, it has been suggested that A\u2424 PET or CSF measures are used as a companion diagnostic, with elevated brain A\u2424 becoming an eligibility requirement for A\u2424-lowering trials. A panel of blood biomarkers could enable cost-effective enrichment and identification of trial participants with A\u2424 pathology for subsequent confirmatory A\u2424 CSF tests or PET scans.\nA second use of a blood-based biomarker would be in recruitment for secondary prevention trials. It is hypothesized that the brains of people recruited with a diagnosis of AD or MCI are often too damaged for medication to have an effect. Treatments could have a higher chance of success in subjects with no clinical symptoms, under the assumption that it is easier to delay, rather than reverse, the development of AD pathology. Aisen et al. expand on this idea stating that there has been no medical advancements in the last decade in terms of treating AD [11] . They suggest basing recruitment of patients into clinical trials on the presence of biomarker defined pre-symptomatic AD; three such trials had begun by the end of 2014. As above, using a blood biomarker as an enrichment filter for PET scans and CSF markers could increase the efficiency of clinical trial recruitment by reducing screen failures. A simple blood test has the greatest potential impact in streamlining secondary prevention studies as screen failure rates due to low A\u2424 are expected to be higher (\u223c78.1% versus \u223c12%) in asymptomatic individuals than in subjects with AD (Ossenkoppele et al. and Jansen et al., unpublished results).\nConsequently, there is high demand for a bloodbased biomarker of AD pathology [12] . It has been shown that measures of A\u2424 in the brain are highly negatively correlated with those in the CSF [13] . However, overall, studies of blood A\u2424 do not show similar correlations [14] . It is therefore necessary to search for other analytes within the blood that may be associated with A\u2424 in the brain. Recent studies provide some evidence that proteins in blood show such a link to other AD endophenotypes and to A\u2424 burden in the brain [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . However, there is a need to investigate these results further in independent datasets of a larger size, using different technologies and different biological samples. We begin to address this here.\nThis study aimed to further test findings in the literature of proteins in blood plasma associating with brain A\u2424 burden [15] [16] [17] 19] . We used a radioactive marker of A\u2424, [ 11 C]-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB), combined with PET scanning to quantify the amount of brain A\u2424 burden and the SOMAscan proteomics platform [20] for quantification of protein in blood samples.\nWith over 1,000 protein analytes, the SOMAscan proteomics platform has been used in high-throughput biomarker discovery studies. For example, in AD research it has been used by Sattlecker et al. and Zhao et al. to discover potential plasma biomarkers of AD diagnosis, MRI measures, and/or rate of cognitive decline [18, 21] . In this study we focused our approach on candidate-based analysis, selecting only proteins previously found to associate with NAB. This was done to ensure that there was sufficient statistical power to detect weaker signal that could have been missed had the entire SOMAscan panel been used. This analysis was repeated within just the cognitively normal control subjects to evaluate whether this test would have utility to enrich for A\u2424-positivity in secondary prevention trials."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cohort", "text": "AIBL is a prospective, longitudinal study of subjects aged over 60 years.

The samples were centrifuged at 1,800 g for 15 min at 20 \u2022 C and immediately frozen at \u221280 \u2022 C. They were stored (long-term) in liquid nitrogen [22] . Protein levels in the blood serum were analyzed using the SOMAscan platform (SomaLogic Inc, Boulder, CA). The methods used in this assay are outlined in detail by Kraemer et al. but, in brief, proteins were measured using Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMAmer)-based capture arrays using a sample of less than 10 L per run [23] . SOMAmers are nucleotides that have been chemically modified to address two issues: hard to capture proteins and nonspecific binding. Firstly, the nucleotides are given protein-like properties resulting in high affinity for hard to capture proteins. Secondly, aptamers with slow dissociation rates are used allowing disruption of non-specific binding. These nucleotides are used to transform a protein signal to a nucleotide signal that can be quantified using relative florescence on microarrays. For full quantification details of this assay, see Gold et al. [20] . This study used SOMAscan Version 2 which captured information on 1,001 proteins and protein complexes.\nQuality control was performed at the sample and SOMAmer level, and involved the use of control SOMAmers on the microarray and calibration samples. Hybridization controls measured sample-by-sample variation in hybridization while the median signal over all SOMAmers measured technical variability. Scale factors of these two metrics were used to normalize across all samples with acceptance criteria of 0.4 to 2.5 based on historic trends. SOMAmer by SOMAmer calibration occurred through the repeated measurement of calibration samples. Historic values were used to generate a calibration scale factor the acceptance criterion for which was: 95% of SOMAmers must have a calibration scale factor within 0.4 of the median."}, {"section_title": "Imaging", "text": "The measures of NAB used in this study were collected by PiB PET scans.

Previously reported studies used blood plasma whereas this study uses blood serum samples. Thambisetty et al. discovered six proteins associated with brain A\u2424 burden in a group of non-demented, older individuals [15] . Kiddle et al. used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) in a discovery analysis to find 16 proteins associated with brain A\u2424 burden [16] .

We also studied differences between the SOMAscan platform and Myriad's Rules Based 415 Medicine Multi-analytes Profile (RBM MAP), one of the discovery proteomics platforms. To do so, we used proteomic data generated using the RBM MAP platform from the original publication of a blood biomarker in the AIBL study; methods described by Burnham et al.

Running random intercept linear regression, adjusting for family relatedness, identified proteins associated with chronological age. We performed a similar analysis using standard linear regression on our serum samples from the AIBL cohort. Within each cohort (TwinsUK and AIBL) the proteins were ranked by p-value from the regressions and the R package OrderedList was used to compare the rank of proteins present on both versions of the platform [28] .\nTo assess the concordance of proteomic signal between SOMAscan and RBM MAP, we implemented an identical method. OrderedList was used to compare lists of proteins ranked according to their associations with age and gender.\nWe began by comparing proteomic signal associated with age in plasma samples from the TwinsUK cohort and serum samples from AIBL. 975 SOMAscan probes matched between the Twins UK (Version 3, 1,129 SOMAmers) and AIBL (Version 2, 1,001 SOMAmers) datasets mapped using SOMAscan ID.

Proteins discovered in studies other than AIBL [15, 16] were analyzed separately to proteins discovered in AIBL using different biological samples (serum instead of plasma) [17, 19] . This split was implemented as the association of a non-AIBL candidate with NAB in AIBL would provide a fully independent replication of those findings, whereas the association of an AIBL candidate with NAB would only show that the marker could also be measured using SOMAmers on serum samples. Each analysis tested the protein levels against the continuous endpoint of SUVR as well as a dichotomized high/low NAB endpoint. A cut off of 1.3 was used to distinguish between high and low NAB [17] . Use of a continuous endpoint gives increased power in statistical analysis in comparison to a categorical measure [29] . Additionally, each analysis studied all samples and control samples alone.\nSubjects were randomly split into a training (66%) and test set (34%) using the createDataPartition function in the R package caret [30] . The split ensured that a range of values of NAB were present in each set for the continuous analysis by splitting the subjects into groups based on NAB percentiles and sampling within these groups.

Any sample with more than 20% missing data was removed. Missing data in the train and test sets was imputed separately using 10 nearest neighbors.\nIn some cases, there were multiple SOMAscan probes available for one UniProt ID. In this instance, a principal components analysis (PCA) was performed across these probes and only the first principal component (PC1) was included in the analysis. This was performed on all samples and on control samples alone, and separately for train and test sets. Additionally, the colinearity of such probe sets was investigated using Pearson's correlation coefficients.\nThere was no observed pattern in the missing data nor in the demographics of the subjects with data set to missing so it was assumed the data were missing at random.

No proteins were found to pass multiple testing corrections in a discovery analysis so we implemented a candidate based approach.\nTwo candidate proteins (PPY and IgM) showed association with NAB in the single protein analysis of the AIBL serum SOMAscan dataset. Both had already been identified as significant in the AIBL plasma RBM MAP dataset by Burnham et al. [17] .\nPPY passed multiple testing corrections for single protein analysis in all samples for the dichotomized endpoint. This provides further evidence for claims made by Chiam et al. who found PPY to be the most replicated blood protein marker of AD [34] . The direction of association (positive) matched that of Burnham et al. [17] , providing some evidence for concordance of the SOMAscan platform with RBM MAP for this protein despite technical differences. This is also consistent with Sattlecker et al. who used SOMAscan to show that plasma PPY levels increase with disease progression in subjects from the combined AddNeuroMed, Alzheimer's Research UK/Maudsley BRC Dementia Case Registry research cohorts [18] . However, the estimate was in the opposite direction to that described by Kiddle et al. [16] . This could suggest a complex relationship of PPY with NAB that we may be unable to describe fully with the statistical approaches applied here. Alternatively, the variation in direction could be due to lower statistical power in Kiddle et al. (n = 71) or cohort differences, perhaps differences between Americans and Australians or disease stage. Indeed, Lunnon et al. have previously shown that disease associated markers, albeit gene expression markers, can frequently change direction of effect depending on disease stage [35] . The subjects used by Kiddle et al. from ADNI were at a much later disease stage (with only three controls) than the subjects used here. Doecke et al. have previously shown PPY to be associated with AD diagnosis in the AIBL cohort [36] . Similarly, PPY was found to be associated with diagnosis in ADNI and the Texas Alzheimer's Research Consortium [37, 38] . However, there has been discussion around whether this effect could be a pharmacological response to the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Unfortunately, we were unable to examine this in the AIBL cohort but the possibility of medication confounding should be investigated in further studies. Chiam et al. use data from the AddNeuroMed study to suggest the effect of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor use is not significant on PPY (Chiam et al., unpublished results) .\nAdditionally, IgM was seen to replicate at the single protein level in control samples only. IgM is an antibody produced by B-cells that appears early in the course of an infection. This pathway of immune response has been linked to AD in previous studies [35] . Furthermore, IgM has been associated with diabetes [39] . When a presence of diabetes flag is included in the IgM model it is not significant. Additionally, the p-value of IgM remains nominally significant at 0.027 indicating that it is unlikely that this significant association is a result of disease confounding.\nThere were 29 candidates that gave non-significant results. These were: C3, APOE, Fibrinogen, Hap-toglobin, Albumin, \u24231-antitrypsin, \u24232-macroglobin, APOA1, C4, Chemokine Ligand 13, Clusterin, Factor B, Factor H, Gelsolin, Hemopexin, HRG, IgG, IL13, IL17, IL3, Leptin, MIP1\u2423, MMP9, Plasminogen, Transferrin, SAP, VCAM1, vWF, and APP.\nSome of these proteins showed significant q-values for model statistics (such as R 2 and accuracy based on permutation testing) although they were not significant in the parametric model. This indicates that greater sample size is needed for future studies of this nature in order to reduce the variation of statistics such as R 2 and hence give a more reliable estimate.\nMultiple protein models constructed in this study gave mixed success in explaining variation in brain A\u2424 burden. Although some provided increased accuracy or R 2 over models of age and APOE 4 number alone, the differences were minimal and largely no greater than those provided by some single protein models. LMG variable importance scores from linear regression models also emphasized that age and APOE 4 number were the most important variables. Consequently, given a larger sample size, an analysis stratified by APOE genotype could be used to reveal more complex relationships between APOE and protein markers.\nThe four studies that contributed candidates for this analysis used blood plasma samples. However, due to sample availability, we performed SOMAscan analysis on blood serum samples. It is possible that this tissue difference is responsible for the non-replication of some of the candidates; however, there are studies suggesting analyte specific consistency across sample type. O'Bryant et al. show that some blood-based markers of AD, including pancreatic polypeptide, are consistent between plasma and serum [38] . Furthermore, our comparison of ranked lists of proteins associated with age between blood serum (AIBL) and plasma (Twins UK) showed a high level of concordance on the SOMAscan platform.\nDifferences between the proteomic approaches used here (SOMAscan) and in the literature (Myriad RBM, 2DGE, and mass spectrometry) could be driving the disparity in results between these studies. We see nonsignificant p-values for similarity when comparing ranked lists of proteins associated with age and gender between SOMAscan and RBM MAP. Due to the similarity in signal between the Twins UK plasma samples and AIBL serum samples (detailed above), this difference is likely platform-driven. While SOMAscan measures the availability of a 3D shape and charge epitope, mass spectrometry measures mass to charge ratio. RBM MAP uses antibodies that could be measuring alternative versions or conformations of proteins to those measured by SOMAscan. It is likely the SOMAscan platform would show the highest correlation with other immunoassays. This is consistent with the observation that we see the most agreement between AIBL plasma RBM MAP candidates and our findings here using serum SOMAscan (PPY and IgM). A study examining the similarities and differences observed when running samples across these platforms would be useful when interpreting results such as these.\nTheprimaryanalysisusedinthisstudyfollowsaparametric, linear approach following that of three out of the four studies cited. Burnham et al. used a non-linear, non-parametric analysis. We investigated the potential ability to detect interactions and non-linear relationships, and consequently improve model performance, by building SVM models. These non-parametric models found slightly improved results suggesting that non-linearity and interactions could be important in the relationship between blood proteomics and NAB and should be considered in further studies.\nThroughout the analysis presented here we included APOE 4 number (0, 1, 2) as a covariate. We did not include the APOE genotype itself due to small numbers of samples in the 24 and 44 groups. We investigated whether grouping subjects with an 24 genotype with subjects with an 34 genotype was appropriate given that the 2 allele has been found to be protective and consequently subjects of the two genotypes could behave differently. Exploratory analysis of the PPY and IgM results suggest that the general trend between the 34 and 24 groups is similar and consequently it is reasonable to combine them in our analysis. Supplementary Figures 2 and 3 illustrate this.\nIt is clear that the sample size used in our analysis limits the power of any conclusions. An additional factor limiting interpretation of these findings is how representative the cohort used here is compared to potential clinical trial recruitment populations, both in terms of diagnostic groups and prevalence of high A\u2424 burden. Differences in prevalence between this cohort and the target populations can lead to inflated estimates of positive predictive value, the proportion of test positives that are true positives [40] . This should be addressed in further work through study of larger and more representative cohorts.\nA known disadvantage of stepwise regression analysis is a tendency to over fit to the training data. Several of the multiple protein models created failed to outperform age and APOE 4 number in test data which could be a suggestion that the stepwise models are over fitting to the training data. Alternatively, this may provide evidence that the candidates considered here provide minimal predictive information on NAB, above that of age and APOE 4 load, when measured in serum samples using SOMAscan. Studies of larger cohorts will allow this to be investigated further.\nIt is promising that we show for the first time that IgM predicts NAB in asymptomatic individuals. However, we note that the majority of candidates investigated in this study had been selected from populations with a variety of diagnoses. Thus, the lack of significance of association with NAB for most candidates in asymptomatic subjects was not unexpected. In further work it would be interesting to perform a discovery analysis on control subjects alone and identify proteins that are found to link with A\u2424 burden pre-symptomatically. The proteins identified by Thambisetty et al. are from a control population but of small sample size (n = 57) [15] .\nWe were surprised to detect a signal for fibrinogen from the SOMAscan technology. Currently it is thought that there should be no fibrinogen present in blood serum samples. This may reflect issues of specificity with the fibrinogen SOMAmer or the presence of low concentrations of fibrinogen in serum samples beneath detection thresholds of other assays. We note that this has been reported before in a study of tuberculosis [41] . As SOMAscan is a relatively novel protein quantification technology, more work is needed to qualify how it compares with other platforms and to identify the binding sites of SOMAmers.\nThere is a clear link between the development of A\u2424 plaques in the brain and AD but this relationship is not exclusive. That is to say, it is not always the case that high NAB indicates AD or vice versa; there are examples of elderly subjects with high A\u2424 burden and no cognitive impairment [42] . While this could be explained by misdiagnosis and A\u2424 starting a slow AD process in motion, the alternative hypothesis would be that A\u2424 is not causally related to late onset AD. However, while the focus of AD clinical trials is predominately anti-A\u2424, it is logical to find markers relevant to those trials. Furthermore, A\u2424 burden is appearing in new diagnostic criteria for AD [43] . More work is needed to thoroughly understand the role of brain A\u2424 burden in AD to validate the use mechanistic action of A\u2424, it would be interesting to study a cohort of subjects with A\u2424 positivity of a model of A\u2424 burden as a diagnostic biomarker. To investigate the prior to the development of MCI or AD. Unfortunately, the current study did not have a sufficient number of samples (n = 5) meeting this criterion to perform such analysis. The need for cohorts of this type is clear in order to advance understanding of the clinical relevance of A\u2424.\nIf the model statistics achieved in this study are shown to be robust across relevant, larger, and independent populations, these models could be beneficial in acting as a cost-effective enrichment filter between the general population and those predicted to have high NAB. Using a relevant simple blood test as a pre-screening tool could reduce the PET and CSF screening failure rate and hence the cost of trials."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this study we investigated blood proteins previously found to be associated with A\u2424 burden in the brain using serum samples from AIBL and the SOMAscan proteomics technology. Two candidate proteins (PPY and IgM) showed association with NAB in the AIBL serum SOMAlogic dataset. Notably, IgM was found to associate with continuous NAB across control subjects, suggesting it may have utility for predicting A\u2424-positive asymptomatic individuals. There are several reasons for a lack of significance for the other candidates including platform differences and the use of serum rather than plasma samples. To investigate the possibility of technical differences causing lack of further replication, further studies are required.
