[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coronaviruses, though uncommon, are serious pathogens responsible for infections that posit flu-like symptoms in infected individuals. These symptoms sometimes resemble the cold and cough symptoms caused by the rhinovirus. Recently, the family has added its seventh generation coronavirus -SARS-CoV-2 (Chengxin et al., 2020) . The virus shares 79% identity to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and 50% identity to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic outbreak in 2003 and 2012 (Salute, 2020) .\nSARC-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 mutated to transmit from animal to human. This virus is believed to have transferred to humans through bats from a meat market in Wuhan, China (Rajendran et al., 2020; Shereen et al., 2020) . In March 2020, WHO declared the COVID-19 to be a pandemic; a pandemic being described as an infection that has spread across countries and international borders rather than within a local region or neighbouring countries.\nThe SARC-CoV-2 is a deadly corona virus that is transmitted readily between humans and already infected more than 530,000 people all over the world in 198 countries as on 26 th March 2020 which led global shutdowns (WHO, 2020) . The fatality rate has varied among countries and age groups. Until June 2020, the fatality rate averaged 5.5% with Italy recording the highest of 14.49%. The fatality rate of US, Germany, and India were 5.56%, 4.72%, and 2.86% respectively until June 2020 (Our World in Data, 2020) . Of the total deaths, less than 5% belonged to the age group of less than 45 years thereby indicating that the younger population is much more resilient to the COVID-19 (Worldmeters, 2020) . While these fatality rates are significantly less than those of MERS (34.4%) and SARS (9.5%) (Petrosillo et al., 2020) , COVID-19 has severe transmissivity because of the possibility of asymptomatic people being carriers and spreaders of the virus (Daw et al., 2020) . The reproduction number R 0 for SARC-CoV-2 has been found to be between 2.06 to 2.52 (Sheng et al., 2020) . A value of R 0 greater than 1 indicates that the disease can invade the human population and higher the value, the easier is it's spread.\nSARC-CoV-2 is the largest single-strand RNA virus known to the humankind; while other viruses have a single protein spike for attachment to the human cell, this coronavirus family has 10 to 12 spike proteins, which makes it easier for the virus to attach itself to the ACE-2 protein in humans (Paraskevis et al., 2020) . The virus follows an unusual double step replication mechanism, which leads to high rates of proliferation (Luan et al., 2020) .

All rights reserved incubation period is typically 2 to 14 days, and the infected person often does not have serious symptoms, rather showing common symptoms associated with flu and pneumonia (Rodeny, 2020) . General symptoms of pneumonia include fever, cough, chest pain, shortness of pain, fatigue, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia (Sattar SBA, 2020) . In addition to symptoms of pneumonia, COVID-19 infected individuals may experience a loss of taste or smell, nausea, congestion, and diarrhoea (CDC, 2020) .\nThere are a few drugs that are being recommended and used to manage the symptoms of COVID-19, but there has, as yet, been no vaccines that are proven to be effective against the coronavirus family, including COVID-19 (Sexton et al., 2016; Gautret et al., 2020) . In the absence of vaccines, it is imperative to check transmission of the virus by alternative ways (Dey et al., 2020) . Policy changes in pandemic and epidemic situations involve social distancing, lockdowns, travel restrictions, awareness campaigns etc. It has been speculated in past research that environmental conditions of countries like temperature and humidity also sometimes play a significant role in controlling pandemics (Lin et al., 2020) .\nQuantitative COVID-19 impact analyses are scarce in literature, given the recency of the pandemic and more studies in this area are necessary, given the seriousness of the infection. Epidemics are assumed to have an exponential growth at an early stage and the number of infections reduces over time, due to interventions like lockdowns, travel restrictions, awareness programs, etc. Mathematical modelling studies using exponential growth analysis coupled with machine learning could provide a better prediction model for COVID-19 transmission (Keeling and Danon, 2009; Siettos and Russo, 2013; Victor, 2020) .\nSuch models must incorporate the various precautionary measures taken during the viral outbreak.\nThe objective of the research is to develop a mathematical model using exponential growth analysis coupled with machine learning, to predict worldwide COVID-19 early containment signs. Models have been developed based on data collected from 42 countries.\nThe objectives of this work are twofold. First, it seeks to identify countries that were successful in early containment of the COVID-19 virus. Secondly, the research aims at building supervised machine learning models with high accuracies for predicting signs of early containment with infrastructure availability, environmental factors, infection severity factors, and government policies of countries as independent variables. In the process of modelling, the significance of the above variables in containing the infection at early stages is\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved also studied.

It must be mentioned that the generalizability of the study is questionable because the ship was a contained environment and the results may not apply to the real world (Sheng et al., 2020) . Certain studies in China and Indonesia have investigated the relationship between the temperature and the spread of infection and resultant deaths and have reported a low to medium level of correlation (Tosepu et al., 2020; Yueling Ma et al., 2020) . Relative humidity was found to have low to no correlation with infection spread or deaths. Global warming has also been a reason for recent temperature increases and certain studies indicate that this can reduce flu based viral infections (National Research Council, 2001; Actuaries, 2010; Dincer et al., 2010) . However, these statements need to be further validated.\nWhile the spread of virus may be affected by climatic conditions, once the virus enters the human body, it is independent of the outside environment. However, since the virus lives outside the human body for a period of at least 12 hours under normal conditions (Richard, 2020) , it is necessary to study the effects of the environmental on the spreading patterns itself.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

The daily number of infections, recovery, and deaths were collected from the website of the WHO.

Environmentbased variables like average temperature and humidity since the onset of COVID-19 was taken from (Weather Underground, 2020). Day-wise COVID-19 case distributions extracted from WHO were used to identify countries that showed sign of containment of the virus based on a novel exponential growth modelling approach. Raw data from the sources were also consolidated and the variables physicians per thousand individuals, hospitals per thousand individuals, percentage of lockdown days since the first contact, cases per million population, deaths per million population, days since the first case, serious cases per thousand infections, average temperature since the first infection, and average humidity since the first infection were calculated to train the machine learning models.\nmodelling the initial stages on a pandemic like COVID-19 is both relevant and crucial in understanding the growth of the infection. Although sub-exponential and polynomial modelling have worked in cases of outbreaks like Ebola, HIV, and foot and mouth diseases (Chowell et al., 2016) , they generally work well with proceeding generations. For pandemics like COVID-19, the exponential growth model is relevant and the use of least-squares at the initial stages can afford precise insights.

All rights reserved act called COVID-19 Act which has proven to be effective to contain the infection (Library of Congress, 2020). The number of hospital beds per 1000 population of Austria was also high, which facilitated early recovery. Chile has implemented sanitary barriers and intense screening mechanisms to track and quarantine the infected (US Embassy, 2020). In addition to tough quarantine measures, Denmark closed down schools and also announced lockdown in March. Employers were also instructed to not cut salaries of the employees on quarantine thereby encouraging social distancing and hence containing the infection (Carstensen, 2020a) .\nJapan, South Korea, and Singapore did not announce any lockdowns. South Korea used processes that led to early detection of the COVID-19 and quarantining the infected, thus stopping spread. They also predicted the movement of viruses and tactical interventions were taken to minimize spread (NPR, 2020). Singapore had a ready infrastructure with isolation wards in place during the SARS outbreak and was readily equipped, which led to early containment of COVID-19. Strong community engagement messages and communications from the government also led to better pandemic management in Singapore (Fisher, 2020a) .\nMost other countries that showed early signs of recovery rigorously followed lockdowns, social distancing, travel restrictions, and testing to contain infections. Another reason for the countries like Japan, Korea and Austria to contain the infection was the presence of availability of strong health care infrastructures in these countries to address the infections.\nThe various actions taken by the government to control the transmission of COVID-19 are shown in Table 5 .\nCountries like Italy, Brazil, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, United Kingdom etc. do not have the necessary health care infrastructure to support mass admission of COVID-19 patients and hence need to rely on intense lockdowns to contain the infections. The increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the US and the inability to contain it is also due to late lockdown decision of the government post-outbreak. The percentage of lockdown days since the first infection continues to be low for these countries to be on a recovery path against the infection. With time, there is a high probability that the infection will be contained. However, in the long run, these countries must invest in improving health care facilities to reduce causalities during pandemics. Countries must be prepared for epidemics and pandemics and proactive policies and infrastructure as in the case of Singapore can save more lives than reactive measures. It is evident that COVID-19, unlike SARS, will not be controlled by environmental factors and any future outbreaks will still rely on healthcare infrastructures, timely lockdowns, and social distancing for containment.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Within few months, the virus has rapidly spread across the world, through transmissions of fluids and aerosol particles between humans. Initially, all diagnosed cases outside China had a travel history to the Wuhan market. Soon, community transfer caused exponential increases in infections in countries like Italy, US, UK, Korea, Japan, etc. The ability of the SARS-COV-2 virus to double replicate with the spike protein, has posed significant challenges to the development of vaccines (Shereen et al., 2020) . While hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have been recommended by some researchers, to treat COVID-19-infected people, there haven't been too many clinical trials to validate the claim (Gautret et al., 2020) . Thus, until a scientifically validate cure or vaccine is developed, countries have to rely on preventive measures to contain the spread. This, in turn, depends on epidemiological studies that can predict spreading patterns so that policymakers can take appropriate protective measures.\nSeveral viruses including SARS have been reported to be vulnerable to hot temperatures, which results in differences in spreading patterns across geographic locations (Zhang et al., 2020) . However, such geographic variations have not yet been analysed for COVID-19.\nOther factors like government policies and interventions, infrastructure availability, and the severity of the infection itself can affect the ability of a country to contain epidemics and pandemics.

It was used by the United Kingdom in 1918 to control the Influenza virus outbreak that caused about 100 million deaths. Social distancing involves the avoidance of mass gatherings and distancing of at least six feet between people. Such measures are combined with enhanced personal hygiene through regular hand wash, and wearing a protective mask for flu-like outbreaks (Yu et al., 2017; Leung et al., 2018) . This is done primarily because flu causing viruses are spread through aerosols generated from saliva and nasal fluid, which can be transmitted across distances as much as three feet. The average lifetime of COVID-19 viruses in the outer environment is believed to be about 12 hours, which increases transmissivity because aerosols from infected people can settle on doorknobs, lifts, transports, hotels, malls etc. and stay active for a long time, thus increasing the window of transmission. Direct physical contacts, such as hand-shaking, are also avenues of transmission of the virus.\nThe reduction of social contact has been proven to significantly reduce flu-like diseases (Maharaj and Kleczkowski, 2012) .

In all these cases, lockdowns were implemented by various countries to control the outbreaks. China announced lockdown as early as January 2020, to flatten the curve of the COVID-19 infections over time. In\nMarch, most countries around the globe announced lockdowns of local transport, office, industries, city and national borders to contain the virus (Callaway et al., 2020) .

During the massive Influenza outbreak of 1918, even developed countries had inadequate health care infrastructure, which further expanded the outbreak (George, 2008). The Ebola outbreak in West Africa became uncontrollable due to lack of infrastructure facilities (Paweska et al., 2017) . After the outbreak, WHO in South Africa had asked the hospitals to report their available facilities to plan for future infections optimally (Murrin, 2018) . Innovative measures have been recommended, to create necessary healthcare infrastructure during pandemic and epidemic situations by converting schools, colleges, theatres, and stadiums into hospitals and quarantine centres (Wimberly, 2018; Nuzzo et al., 2019) .

The research presents machine learning models based on variables such as infrastructure, environment, policies, and the infection itself, to predict early signs of containment in the country. For the purpose, disease data from 42 leading countries in COVID-19 infections were taken and exponential growth modelling was used to see if the countries showed signs of containment.\nThen with the sign of the early containment of the infection as a dependent variable, supervised machine learning predictive models including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine were developed. This research can directly be of use to countries and policymakers to understand if their proposed interventions are effective in containing infections even during early stages. (Tosepu et al., 2020; Yueling Ma et al., 2020) . However, the long-term effect of environmental factors on the infection rates may prove to be significant. Decision tree analysis also shows that early signs of containment are possible if the number of lockdown days is at least 33.7% of the days since the first contact to contain the infection. If that is not the case, countries show recovery signs if the lockdown is at least 10 days or more. For countries with a lockdown period less than 10 days, variable depicting the number of deaths per million population plays a significant role in containing the infection. This variable is indirectly related to the health care infrastructure of countries like beds, physician, ventilators, ICUs etc. Hence in any pandemic situation, governments must be proactive and frame policies even at the onset, thereby reducing the risk of spread, which would ultimately lead to early containment. This also emphasises on the need for resilient health care infrastructure to contain infections at an early stage. The machine learning models random forest and support vector machines were able to classify the countries with respect to their signs of early containment with an accuracy of 92.9 and 76.2 percentages, respectively, proving random forest to be the best machine learning algorithm for the problem studied. Although this research applies data from only 42 countries, the proposed models with their corresponding hyper parameters can be extended to predict early containment for the other countries as well.
