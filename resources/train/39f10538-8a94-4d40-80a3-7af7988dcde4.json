Gene products -proteins -are classified and grouped in three main ontologies: cellular components (CC) where the protein is located within subcellular compartments, molecular functions (MF) indicates the specific function of the gene is carried out in normal conditions and biological processes (BP) which describes the processes a protein is involved in (e.g.: neurogenesis). The ontology follows a hierarchical order and there are defined relationships between the GO terms. In the ontology structure, terms at the top represent general or broad concepts, whereas terms near the bottom represent more detailed processes. Therefore if a term has terms subordinate to it, it is referred to as a 'parent' term. Similarly, if a term has other terms superior to it, then it is referred to as a 'child' term. Both manual and automatic annotations of proteins are available in the GO database. Automatic annotations are inferred from electronic annotations and are not manually reviewed by a curator. In manual annotations, a curator reviews primary articles to generate annotations, and each annotation is based on experimental data referenced to a PubMed ID. The documentation for manual curation can be found at http://geneontology.org/page/annotation, and an example of annotations created by the authors can be found in the Alzheimer's University of Toronto dataset at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GAnnotation?source=Alzheimers_University_of_Toronto Quick GO (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/) is a web based tool used to extract data from the GO database.
