Even though students are less likely to be victims of a violent crime at school 1 than away from school (Indicators 1 and 2), any instance of crime or violence at school not only affects the individuals involved but also may disrupt the educational process and affect bystanders, the school itself, and the surrounding community (Henry 2000). For both students and teachers, victimization at school can have lasting effects. In addition to experiencing loneliness, depression, and adjustment diffi culties (Crick and Bigbee 1998;Crick and Grotpeter 1996;Nansel et al. 2001;Prinstein, Boergers, and Vernberg 2001;Storch et al. 2003), victimized children are more prone to truancy (Ringwalt, Ennett, and Johnson 2003), poor academic performance (Wei and Williams 2004), dropping out of school (Beauvais et al. 1996), and violent behaviors (Nansel et al. 2003). For teachers, incidents of victimization may lead to professional disenchantment and even departure from the profession altogether (Karcher 2002). For parents, school staff, and policymakers to effectively address school crime, they need an accurate understanding of the extent, nature, and context of the problem. However, it is diffi cult to gauge the scope of crime and violence in schools given the large amount of attention devoted to isolated incidents of extreme school violence. Measuring progress toward safer schools requires establishing good indicators of the current state of school crime and safety across the nation and periodically monitoring and updating these indicators; this is the aim of Indicators of School Crime and Safety."}, {"section_title": "PURPOSE AND ORGANIZATION OF THIS REPORT", "text": "Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2006 is the ninth in a series of reports produced by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) since 1998 that present the most recent data available on school crime and student safety. The report is not intended to be an exhaustive compilation of school crime and safety information, nor does it attempt to explore reasons for crime and violence in schools. Rather, it is designed to provide a brief summary of information from an array of data sources and to make data on national school crime and safety accessible to policymakers, educators, parents, and the general public. 1 See appendix B for a detailed defi nition of \"at school.\" school grounds are offered as a point of comparison. 2 Supplemental tables for each indicator provide more detailed breakouts and standard errors for estimates. A glossary of terms and references section appear at the end of the report. This year's report contains updates for all indicators and the expansion of two existing indicators, Indicator 5 on threats to and injuries of teachers and Indicator 11 on bullying. In response to requests for state-level information, tables showing available state-level estimates have been added to Indicator 5. These estimates have been added for the past three survey years. Indicator 11 looks at seven types of bullying, where reported incidents of bullying took place in school, whether any injuries were sustained as a result of being bullied, and the frequency of bullying incidents among students who were bullied. The indicator related to nonfatal teacher victimization at school has been discontinued. Because of sample cuts to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and declining victimization rates, the survey's capacity to provide useful estimates of teacher victimization has diminished, especially for disaggregated subcategories of teacher characteristics. The indicator has been determined to no longer be an adequate measure of teacher victimization. Also found in this year's report are references to recent publications relevant to each indicator that the reader may want to consult for additional information or analyses. These references can be found in the \"For more information\" sidebars at the bottom of each indicator."}, {"section_title": "DATA", "text": "The indicators in this report are based on information drawn from a variety of independent data sources, including national surveys of students, teachers, and principals and universe data collections from federal departments and agencies, including BJS, NCES, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each data source has an independent sample design, data collection method, and questionnaire design or is the result of a universe data collection. The combination of multiple, independent sources of data provides a broad perspective on school crime and safety that could not be achieved through any single source of information. However, readers should be cautious when comparing data from different sources. While every effort has been made to keep key defi nitions consistent across indicators, differences in sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and question phrasing can all affect the comparability of results. For example, both Indicators 19 and 20 report data on select security and safety measures used in schools. Indicator 19 uses data collected from a stratifi ed random sample of principals about safety and security practices used in their schools during the 2003-04 school year. Indicator 20, however, uses data collected from 12-through 18-year-olds in a rotated panel design of households. These students were asked whether they observed selected safety and security measures in their school in 2005, but they may not have known if, in fact, the security measure was present. In addition, different indicators contain various approaches to the analysis of school crime data and, therefore, will show different perspectives on school crime. For example, both Indicators 2 and 3 report data on theft and violent crime at school based on the National Crime Victimization Survey and the School Crime Supplement to that survey, respectively. While Indicator 2 examines the number of incidents of crime, Indicator 3 examines the percentage or prevalence of students who reported victimization. Figure A provides a summary of some of the variations in the design and coverage of sample surveys used in this report. Several indicators in this report are based on self-reported survey data. Readers should note that limitations inherent to self-reported data may affect estimates (Cantor and Lynch 2000). First, unless an interview is \"bounded\" or a reference period is established, estimates may include events that exceed the scope of the specifi ed reference period. This factor may artifi cially increase reports because respondents may recall events outside of the given reference period. Second, many of the surveys rely on the respondent to \"self-determine\" a condition. This factor allows the respondent to defi ne   1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 Incidents during the previous 6 months Not specified 3, 8, 10, 11, 16, and 17 20"}, {"section_title": "School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS)", "text": "Public primary, middle, and high school principals 2 1999-2000 and 2003-04 1999-2000 and 2003-04 school year 6, 7, 18, and 19 "}, {"section_title": "Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS)", "text": "Public and private school K-12 teachers 1993-94, 1999-2000, and 2003-04 Incidents during the previous 12 months 5"}, {"section_title": "Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)", "text": "Students enrolled in grades 9-12 in public and private schools at the time of the survey 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 Incidents during the previous 12 months Incidents during the previous 30 days 4, 9, and 12 13, 14, and 15 a situation based upon his or her own interpretation of whether the incident was a crime or not. On the other hand, the same situation may not necessarily be interpreted in the same way by a bystander or the perceived offender. Third, victim surveys tend to emphasize crime events as incidents that take place at one point in time. However, victims can often experience a state of victimization in which they are threatened or victimized regularly or repeatedly. Finally, respondents may recall an event inaccurately. For instance, people may forget the event entirely or recall the specifi cs of the episode incorrectly. These and other factors may affect the precision of the estimates based on these surveys. Data trends are discussed in this report when possible. Where trends are not discussed, either the data are not available in earlier surveys or the wording of the survey question changed from year to year, eliminating the ability to discuss any trend. Where data from samples are reported, as is the case with most of the indicators in this report, the standard error is calculated for each estimate provided in order to determine the \"margin of error\" for these estimates. The standard errors of the estimates for different subpopulations in an indicator can vary considerably and should be taken into account when making comparisons. Some estimates and standard errors have been revised from those provided in earlier editions of Indicators of School Crime and Safety and other previously published reports. Throughout this report, in cases where the standard error was at least 30 percent of the associated estimate, the estimates were noted with a \"!\" symbol (interpret data with caution). In cases where the standard error was greater than 50 percent of the associated estimate, the estimate was suppressed. See appendix A for more information. The comparisons in the text have been tested for statistical signifi cance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited in the report are statistically signifi cant at the .05 level. Several test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the statement being tested. The primary test procedure used in this report was the Student's t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates. Linear trend tests were used when differences among percentages were examined relative to ordered categories of a variable, rather than the differences between two discrete categories. This test allows one to examine whether, for example, the percentage of students who reported using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school increased (or decreased) with age. When differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordered categories (such as grade), analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. Appendix A of this report contains descriptions of all the datasets used in this report and a discussion of how standard errors were calculated for each estimate."}, {"section_title": "VIOLENT DEATHS VIOLENT DEATHS AT SCHOOL AND AWAY FROM SCHOOL", "text": "The number of homicides of youth ages 5-18 at school was higher in 2004-05 than 2000-01 (21 vs. 11 homicides), but remained lower than most years during the 1990's."}, {"section_title": "Indicator 1", "text": "Violent deaths at schools are rare but tragic events with far-reaching effects on the school population and surrounding community (Small and Dressler-Tetrick 2001).  4 The most recent data available for the total number of homicides of school-age youth are from the 2003-04 school year (fi gure 1.1 and table 1.1), at which time there were 1,437 homicides.

Theft and violence at school and while going to and from school can lead to a disruptive and threatening environment, physical injury, and emotional stress, and can be an obstacle to student achievement (Elliott, Hamburg, and Williams 1998). Data from the National Crime Victimization Survey show that students ages 12-18 were victims of about 1.4 million nonfatal crimes (theft plus violent crime) while they were at school and about 1.3 million crimes while they were away from school in 2004 (table 2.1). 6 These fi gures represent victimization rates of 55 crimes per 1,000 students at school, and 48 crimes per 1,000 students away from school (fi gure 2.1).

Violent victimization away from school declined from 32 victimizations per 1,000 students in 2003 to 21 victimizations in 2004. Students ages 12-18 were more likely to be victims of theft at school than away from school in most years between 1992 and 2004. In 2004, students were victims of 863,000 crimes of theft at school and 706,000 crimes of theft away from school. This translates into 33 thefts per 1,000 students at school, compared with 27 thefts per 1,000 students away from school. From 1992 to 1997, the victimization rates for violent crime were generally lower at school than away from school; however, there were no measurable differences in these rates in the years between 1998 and 2004, except in 2000, when victimization rates at school were lower. The rates for serious violent crime were lower at school than away from school in each survey year from 1992 to 2004. In 2004, students ages 12-18 were victims of 4 serious violent crimes per 1,000 students at school compared with 9 serious violent crimes per 1,000 students away from school. In 2004, the victimization rates for students ages 12-18 varied according to certain student characteristics. Older students (ages 15-18) were less likely than younger students (ages 12-14) to be victims of crime at school, but the reverse was true for the likelihood of crime away from school (fi gures 2.2 and 2.3 and tables 2.2 and 2.3). Females had a lower rate of violent victimization at school and a lower rate of serious violent victimization away from school than males, but no measurable gender differences were found in the rates of theft at and away from school.

In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students were asked if they had carried a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club in the past 30 days (referred to as \"anywhere\" in this report) or had carried one of these weapons on school property in the past 30 days. In 2005, some 19 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported they had carried a weapon anywhere, and about 6 percent reported they had carried a weapon on school property (table 13.1). The percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere declined from 22 to 18 percent between 1993 and 1997. However, subsequently, there was no measurable change in the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere. Similar to the pattern for carrying a weapon anywhere, between 1993 and 1999, the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon at school declined from 12 to 7 percent. However, there was no measurable change in the percentage of students who carried a weapon at school between 1999 and 2005. When looking at the characteristics of students who reported carrying weapons, males were more than two times more likely than females to carry a weapon-either anywhere or on school property-in all survey years (fi gure 13.1 and table 13.1). In 2005, for example, some 10 percent of males carried a weapon on school property, compared with 3 percent of females, and 30 percent of males carried a weapon anywhere, compared with 7 percent of females. In 2005, few differences were detected in the percentage of students who reported carrying weapons anywhere and on school property according to students' race/ethnicity (fi gure 13.2 and table 13.1). Asian students were less likely than students from all other racial/ethnic groups, except Pacifi c Islanders, 21 to report carrying a weapon anywhere, but no measurable differences were detected among Black, White, and Hispanic students. Asian students were also less likely than students from all other racial/ethnic groups, except for Blacks, to report carrying a weapon on school property, but no differences were detected among Black, White, and American Indian students. Hispanic students were more likely than Black students to report carrying a weapon during the previous 30 days on school property in    were more likely to report drinking alcohol anywhere than were students in lower grades. For example, 51 percent of 12th-graders reported using alcohol, compared with 36 percent of 9th-graders (fi gure 14.2 and table 14.1). However, no measurable difference was found across grade levels in students' likelihood of drinking alcohol on school property. In 2005, Asian and Black students were less likely to report using alcohol anywhere than were American Indian, White, or Hispanic students. Twenty-two percent of Asian students and 31 percent of Black students reported using alcohol anywhere, compared with 46 percent of White students, 47 percent of Hispanic students, and 57 percent of American Indian students. In the same year, Hispanic students (8 percent) were more likely to use alcohol on school property than were White, Black, or Asian students (4, 3, and 1 percent, respectively). In 2005, the percentage of students who reported drinking alcohol varied among states for which data were available. Among states, the percentages ranged from 16 to 49 percent for drinking alcohol anywhere, and from 2 to 9 percent for drinking alcohol on school property (table 14.2).   NOTE: \"On school property\" was not defi ned for survey respondents.

In 2005, some 20 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported using marijuana anywhere during the past 30 days, and 5 percent reported using marijuana on school property (table 15.1). The percentage of students who reported using marijuana anywhere increased between 1993 and 1995 (from 18 to 25 percent), and in 1995, 1997, and 1999, roughly one-quarter of students reported using marijuana anywhere (between 25 and 27 percent). By 2005, however, the percentage of students who reported using marijuana anywhere had declined to 20 percent. The percentage of students who reported using marijuana on school property increased from 6 to 9 percent between 1993 and 1995 and then declined to 5 percent in Both students' sex and grade level were associated with the use of marijuana among those in grades 9-12. Males were more likely than females to have reported using marijuana during the past 30 days in every survey year, both anywhere and on school property (fi gure 15.1 and table 15.1). For example, in 2005, some 6 percent of males and 3 percent of females reported using marijuana on school property. In that same year, 9th-grade students were less likely than 11th-and 12th-grade students to report using marijuana anywhere (fi gure 15.2 and table 15.1). While it appears that 9th-grade students were slightly more likely to report using marijuana on school property than were their peers in other grades, no measurable differences were detected in student reports of using marijuana on school property by grade level.

There was no measurable change between 2003 and 2005 in the percentage of students reporting fear of attack or harm at or away from school (fi gure 16.1 and table 16.1). Consistent with fi ndings from 1999 and 2001, students in 2005 were more likely to report being afraid of an attack at school than away from school. The percentage of students who reported that they were afraid of being attacked at school (including on the way to and from school) decreased from 12 to 6 percent between 1995 and 2001; however, no measurable difference was detected between 2001 and 2005. Similarly, there was no change in the percentage of students who feared such an attack away from school between 1999 and 2005. Black and Hispanic students were more likely than White students to fear for their safety regardless of location in 2005 (fi gure 16.2 and table 16.1). Nine percent of Black students and 10 percent of Hispanic students reported that they were afraid of being attacked at school (including on the way to and from school), compared with 4 percent of White students. Away from school, 7 percent of Black students, 6 percent of Hispanic students, and 4 percent of White students reported that they were afraid of an attack.

In the same year, 10 percent of 6th-graders, 6 percent of 9th-graders, and 3 percent of 12th-graders feared for their safety at school or on the way to and from school. School location was also related to students' fear of attack. In 2005, students in urban schools were more likely than students in suburban and rural schools to fear being attacked at school or on the way to and from school. Ten percent of students in urban schools feared being attacked at school, compared with 5 percent each of their peers in suburban and rural schools. School sector was also related to students' fear of attack. In every survey year, students in public schools were more likely than students in private schools to fear being attacked at school. In 2005, about 6 percent of public school students feared being attacked at school, compared with 4 percent of private school students.

In the School Crime Supplement 24 to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12-18 were asked whether they had avoided school activities or one or more places in school because they were fearful that someone might attack or harm them. 25 In 2005, some 6 percent of students reported that they had avoided a school activity or one or more places in school in the previous 6 months because of fear of attack or harm: 2 percent of students avoided a school activity, and 4 percent avoided one or more places in school 26 (fi gure 17.1 and table 17.1). The percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported that they avoided school activities because they thought someone might attack or harm them there decreased from 3 to 2 percent between 1999 and 2001 and remained at about 2 percent through 2005 (fi gure 17.1 and table 17.1). Between 4 and 5 percent of students reported avoiding one or more places in school during the same period. Students' reports of avoiding one or more places in school varied according to their race/ethnicity.

As in all previous survey years, no measurable difference was detected in the extent to which males and females avoided places in 2005. Generally, grade level was inversely associated with students' likelihood of avoiding one or more places in school. Eight percent of 6th-graders avoided one or more places in school in 2005, compared with 1 percent of 12th-graders (fi gure 17.2 and table 17.2).

The use of security measures varied by school level. Primary schools were generally less likely than middle schools, and middle schools generally less likely than high schools, to report using most of these measures. About 48 percent of public schools required faculty and staff to wear badges or picture IDs, compared with 6 percent of schools that required students to do so (3 percent of primary schools, 11 percent of middle schools, and 16 percent of high schools; fi gure 19.1 and table 19.1). Six percent of public schools required clear book bags or banned book bags altogether, but the use of this specifi c practice also varied by school level, with 3 percent of primary schools, 13 percent of middle schools, and 9 percent of high schools using it. In the 2003-04 school year, some 28 percent of primary schools, 42 percent of middle schools, and 60 percent of secondary schools used one or more security cameras to monitor the school.

SAVD seeks to describe the epidemiology of school-associated violent deaths, identify common features of these deaths, estimate the rate of school-associated violent deaths in the United States, and identify potential risk factors for these deaths. The surveillance system includes descriptive data on all school-associated violent deaths in the United States, including all homicides, suicides, and unintentional fi rearm-related deaths where the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school, while the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at such a school, or while attending or on the way to or from an offi cial school-sponsored event. Victims of such events include nonstudents as well as students and staff members. SAVD includes descriptive information about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). The SAVD Surveillance System has collected data from July 1, 1992, through the present. SAVD uses a four-step process to identify and collect data on school-associated violent deaths. Cases are initially identifi ed through a search of the Lexis/Nexis newspaper and media database. Then police offi cials are contacted to confi rm the details of the case and to determine if the event meets the case defi nition. Once a case is confi rmed, a police offi cial and a school offi cial are interviewed regarding details about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). A copy of the full police report is also sought for each case. The information obtained on schools includes school demographics, attendance/ absentee rates, suspension/expulsions and mobility, school history of weapon-carrying incidents, security measures, violence prevention activities, school response to the event, and school policies about weapon carrying. Event information includes the location of injury, the context of injury (while classes were being held, during break, etc.), motives for injury, method of injury, and school and community events happening around the time period. Information obtained on victim(s) and offender(s) includes demographics, circumstances of the event (date/time, alcohol or drug use, number of persons involved), types and origins of weapons, criminal history, psychological risk factors, school-related problems, extracurricular activities, and family history, including structure and stressors. One hundred fi ve school-associated violent deaths were identifi ed from July 1, 1992-June 30, 1994(Kachur et al. 1996. A more recent report from this data collection identifi ed 253 school-associated violent deaths between July 1, 1994-June 30, 1999 (Anderson et al. 2001). Other publications from this study have described how the number of events changes during the school year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2001), the source of the fi rearms used in these events (Reza et al. 2003), and suicides that were associated with schools (Kauffman et al. 2004). The interviews conducted on cases between July 1, 1994 and June 30, 1999 achieved a response rate of 97 percent for police offi cials and 78 percent for school offi cials. Data for subsequent study years are preliminary and subject to change. The SAVD data are considered preliminary until interviews with school and law enforcement offi cials have been completed. Readers should note that in 2003, in accordance with changes to the Offi ce of Management and Budget's standards for the classifi cation of federal data on race and ethnicity, the NCVS item on race/ethnicity was modifi ed. A question on Hispanic origin is followed by a question on race. The new race question allows the respondent to choose more than one race and delineates Asian as a separate category from Native Hawaiian or Other Pacifi c Islander. Analysis conducted by the Demographic Surveys Division at the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the new race question had very little impact on the aggregate racial distribution of the NCVS respondents, with one exception. There was a 1.6 percentage point decrease in the percent of respondents who reported themselves as White. Due to changes in race/ethnicity categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution. The indicator from NCVS related to nonfatal teacher victimization at school has been discontinued. Because of sample cuts to the NCVS and declining victimization rates, the survey's capacity to provide useful estimates of teacher victimization has diminished, especially for disaggregated subcategories of teacher characteristics. The indicator has been determined to no longer be an adequate measure of teacher victimization. The number of NCVS eligible households in 2004 was about 46,200. They were selected using a stratifi ed, multistage cluster design. In the fi rst stage, the primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of counties or groups of counties, were selected. In the second stage, smaller areas, called Enumeration Districts (EDs), were selected from each sampled PSU. Finally, from selected EDs, clusters of four households, called segments, were selected for interview. At each stage, the selection was done proportion-ate to population size in order to create a self-weighting sample. The fi nal sample was augmented to account for housing units constructed after the decennial Census. Within each sampled household, U.S. Census Bureau personnel interviewed all household members age 12 and older to determine whether they had been victimized by the measured crimes during the 6 months preceding the interview. The fi rst NCVS interview with a housing unit is conducted in person. Subsequent interviews are conducted by telephone, if possible. About 74,300 persons age 12 and older are interviewed every 6 months. Households remain in the sample for 3 years and are interviewed seven times at 6-month intervals. The initial interview at each sample unit is used only to bound future interviews to establish a time frame to avoid duplication of crimes uncovered in these subsequent interviews.  1989, 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 to collect additional information about school-related victimizations on a national level. This report includes data from the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 collections. The 1989 data are not included in this report as a result of methodological changes to the NCVS and SCS. The survey was designed to assist policymakers as well as academic researchers and practitioners at the federal, state, and local levels so that they can make informed decisions concerning crime in schools. The SCS asks students a number of key questions about their experiences with and perceptions of crime and violence that occurred inside their school, on school grounds, on a school bus, or on the way to or from school. Additional questions not included in the NCVS were also added to the SCS, such as those concerning preventive measures used by the school, students' participation in after school activities, students' perceptions of school rules, the presence of weapons and gangs in school, the presence of hate-related words and graffi ti in school, student reports of bullying and reports of rejection at school, and the availability of drugs and alcohol in school, as well as attitudinal questions relating to fear of victimization and avoidance behavior at school. In all SCS survey years, the SCS was conducted for a 6-month period from January-June in all households selected for the NCVS (see discussion above for information about the NCVS sampling design and changes to the race/ethnicity item made for 2003 onward). It should be noted that the initial NCVS interview is included in the SCS data collection. Within these households, the eligible respondents for the SCS were those household members who had attended school at any time during the 6 months preceding the interview, were enrolled in grades 6-12, and were not home schooled. The age range of students covered in this report is 12-18 years of age. Eligible respondents were asked the supplemental questions in the SCS only after completing their entire NCVS interview. The prevalence of victimization for 1995for , 1999for , 2001for , 2003for was calculated by using NCVS incident variables appended to the 1995for , 1999for , 2001for , 2003 SCS data fi les. The NCVS type of crime variable was used to classify victimizations of students in the SCS as serious violent, violent, or theft. The NCVS variables asking where the incident happened and what the victim was doing when it happened were used to ascertain whether the incident happened at school. For prevalence of victimization, the NCVS defi nition of \"at school\" includes in the school building, on school property, or on the way to or from school. Only incidents that occurred inside the United States are included. In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modifi ed from previous collections in three ways. First, in 1995 and 1999, \"at school\" was defi ned for respondents as in the school building, on the school grounds, or on a school bus. In 2001, the defi nition for \"at school\" was changed to mean in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. This change was made to the 2001 questionnaire in order to be consistent with the defi nition of \"at school\" as it is constructed in the NCVS and was also used as the defi nition in 2003 and 2005. Cognitive interviews conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on the 1999 SCS suggested that modifi cations to the defi nition of \"at school\" would not have a substantial impact on the estimates. Second, the SCS questions pertaining to fear and avoidance were changed for the 2001SCS survey. In 1995, 1999, 2003, students were asked if they were fearful or avoidant because they thought someone would \"attack or harm\" them. In 2001, students were asked if they were fearful or avoidant because they thought someone would \"attack or threaten to attack\" them. In the 1999 and 2001 SCS, students were asked to exclude times they were at school or going to or from school in the question about fear away from school. In 2003 and 2005, when asked about fear away from school, students were asked to exclude times they were at school; however, in these years the defi nition of \"at school\" included going to and from school. These changes should be considered when making comparisons across survey years. Third, the SCS question pertaining to gangs changed beginning with the 2001 SCS. The introduction and defi nition of gangs as well as the placement of the item in the questionnaire changed in the 2001 SCS. Because of these changes, the reader should be cautioned not to compare results from 2001 onwards (presented in this report) with estimates of gang presence in 1995 and 1999 (presented in previous editions of this report). In 2005, the SCS instrument was modifi ed again. In this year, the SCS question(s) pertaining to bullying changed. In 1999In , 2001In , and 2003, students were asked a single bullying question. The 2005 SCS included a series of questions about bullying. Because of substantive changes in questionnaire wording, comparisons between the 2005 SCS bullying indicator and all other survey years should be made with caution. Total victimization is a combination of violent victimization and theft. If the student reported an incident of either violent or theft victimization or both, he or she is counted as having experienced \"total\" victimization. Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and simple assault. Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and completed thefts except motor vehicle thefts. A total of 9,728 students participated in the 1995 SCS, 8,398 in 1999SCS, 8,398 in , 8,374 in 2001SCS, 8,398 in , 7,152 in 2003SCS, 8,398 in , and 6,297 in 2005 In the 2005 SCS, the household completion rate was 91 percent. In the 1995In the , 1999In the , 2001 and 2003 SCS, the household completion rates were 95 percent, 94 percent, 93 percent, and 92 percent, respectively; and the student completion rates were 78 percent, 78 percent, 77 percent, and 70 percent, respectively. For the 2005 SCS, the student completion rate was 62 percent. Thus, the overall unweighted SCS response rate (calculated by multiplying the household completion rate by the student completion rate) was 74 percent in 1995, 73 percent in 1999, 72 percent in 2001, 64 percent in 2003, and 56 percent in 2005. Response rates for most survey items were high-typically over 95 percent of all eligible respondents. The weights were developed to compensate for differential probabilities of selection and nonresponse. The weighted data permit inferences about the eligible student population who were enrolled in schools in 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005. Due to the low unit response rate in 2005, a unit nonresponse bias analysis was commissioned. There are two types of nonresponse: unit and item nonresponse. Unit response rates indicate how many sampled units have completed interviews. Because interviews with students could only be completed after households had responded to NCVS, the unit completion rate for SCS refl ects both the household interview completion rate and the student interview completion rate. Nonresponse can greatly affect the strength and application of survey data by leading to an increase in variance as a result of a reduction in the actual size of the sample and can produce bias if the nonrespondents have characteristics of interest that are different from the respondents. Furthermore, imputation, a common recourse to nonresponse, can lead to the risk of underestimating the sampling error if imputed data are treated as though they were observed data. In order for response bias to occur, respondents must have different response rates and responses to particular survey variables. The magnitude of unit nonresponse bias is determined by the response rate and the differences between respondents and nonrespondents on key survey variables. Although the bias analysis cannot measure response bias since SCS is a sample survey and we do not know how the population would have responded, the SCS sampling frame has four key student or school characteristic variables for which data is known for respondents and nonrespondents: sex, race/ethnicity, household income, and urbanicity, all of which are associated with student victimization. To the extent that there are differential responses by respondents in these groups, nonresponse bias is a concern. The YRBS uses a three-stage cluster sampling design to produce a nationally representative sample of students in grades 9-12 in the United States. The target population consisted of all public and private school students in grades 9-12 in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The fi rst-stage sampling frame included selecting primary sampling units (PSUs) from strata formed on the basis of urbanization and the relative percentage of Black and Hispanic students in the PSU. These PSUs are either large counties or groups of smaller, adjacent counties. At the second stage, schools were selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size. Schools with substantial numbers of Black and Hispanic students were sampled at relatively higher rates than all other schools. The fi nal stage of sampling consisted of randomly selecting within each chosen school at each grade 9-12 one or two intact classes of a required subject, such as English or social studies. All students in selected classes were eligible to participate. Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300, 13,600, 15,200, and 13,900 students participated in the 1993Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300, 13,600, 15,200, and 13,900 students participated in the , 1995Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300, 13,600, 15,200, and 13,900 students participated in the , 1997Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300, 13,600, 15,200, and 13,900 students participated in the , 1999Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300, 13,600, 15,200, and 13,900 students participated in the , 2001Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300, 13,600, 15,200, and 13,900 students participated in the , 2003Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300, 13,600, 15,200, and 13,900 students participated in the , and 2005 The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993 survey, 60 percent for the 1995 survey, 69 percent for the 1997 survey, 66 percent for the 1999 survey, 63 percent for the 2001 survey, 67 percent for the 2003 survey, and 67 percent for the 2005 survey. NCES standards call for response rates of 85 percent or better for cross-sectional surveys, and bias analyses are required by NCES when that percentage is not achieved. For YRBS data, a full nonresponse bias analysis has not been done because the data necessary to do the analysis are not available. The weights were developed to adjust for nonresponse and the oversampling of Black and Hispanic students in the sample. The fi nal weights were constructed so that only weighted proportions of students (not weighted counts of students) in each grade matched national population projections. Where YRBS data are presented, accurate national population projections are provided from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2002(U.S. Department of Education 2003, 2006. State level data were downloaded from the Youth Online: Comprehensive Results web page (http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/yrbss/). Each state and local school-based YRBS employs a two-stage, cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in grades 9-12 in their jurisdiction. All except a few state and local samples include only public schools, and each local sample includes only schools in the funded school district (e.g., San Diego Unifi ed School District) rather than in the entire city (e.g., greater San Diego area). In the fi rst sampling stage in all except a few states and districts, schools are selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size. In the second sampling stage, intact classes of a required subject or intact classes during a required period (e.g., second period) are selected randomly. All students in sampled classes are eligible to participate. Certain states and districts modify these procedures to meet their individual needs. For example, in a given state or district, all schools, rather than a sample of schools, might be selected to participate. State and local surveys that have a scientifi -cally selected sample, appropriate documentation, and an overall response rate greater than or equal to 60 percent are weighted. The overall response rate refl ects the school response rate multiplied by the student response rate. These three criteria are used to ensure that the data from those surveys can be considered representative of students in grades 9-12 in that jurisdiction. A weight is applied to each record to adjust for student nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade, sex, and race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction. Therefore, weighted estimates are representative of all students in grades 9-12 attending schools in each jurisdiction. Surveys that do not have an overall response rate of greater than or equal to 60 percent and do not have appropriate documentation are not weighted and are not included in this report. In 2005, a total of 40 states and 21 districts had weighted data. In sites with weighted data, the student sample sizes for the state and local YRBS ranged from 942 to 9,708. School response rates ranged from 72 to 100 percent, student response rates ranged from 61 to 93 percent, and overall response rates ranged from 60 to 85 percent. Readers should note that reports of these data published by the CDC do not include percentages where the denominator includes less than 100 unweighted cases. However, NCES publications do not include percentages where the denominator includes less than 30 unweighted cases. Therefore, estimates presented here may not appear in CDC publications of YRBS estimates and are considered unstable by CDC standards. In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Offi ce of Management and Budget's standards for the classifi cation of federal data on race and ethnicity, the YRBS item on race/ ethnicity was modifi ed. The version of the race and ethnicity question used in 1993, 1995, and 1997  In the 2005 national survey, race/ethnicity was computed from two questions: 1) \"Are you Hispanic or Latino?\" (response options were \"yes\" and \"no\"), and 2) \"What is your race?\" (response options were \"American Indian or Alaska Native,\" \"Asian,\" \"Black or African American,\" \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacifi c Islander,\" or \"White\"). For the second question, students could select more than one response option. For this report, students were classifi ed as \"Hispanic\" if they answered \"yes\" to the fi rst question, regardless of how they answered the second question. Students who answered \"no\" to the fi rst question and selected more than one race/ethnicity in the second category were classifi ed as \"More than one race.\" Students who answered \"no\" to the fi rst question and selected only one race/ethnicity were classifi ed as that race/ethnicity. Race/ ethnicity was set to missing for students who did not answer the fi rst question (176 cases) or for students who answered \"no\" to the fi rst question but did not answer the second question (48 cases). The questions used in 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 result in the possibility of respondents marking more than one category. While more accurately refl ecting respondents' racial and ethnic identity, the new item cannot be directly compared to responses to the old item. Brener, Kann, and McManus (2003) found that allowing students to select more than one response to the race/ethnicity question on the YRBS had only a minimal effect on reported race/ethnicity among high school students. CDC is examining the effect of using a two-question format to assess race/ethnicity in the 2005 national YRBS.

The 1993The -94, 1999The -2000The , and 2003-04 SASS were collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). SASS consists of four sets of linked surveys, including surveys of schools, the principals of each selected school, a subsample of teachers within each school, and public school districts. In 1993-94, there were two sets of teacher surveys, public and private school teachers. In 1999-2000, there were four sets of teacher surveys, public, private, public charter, and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) school teachers. In 2003-04, there were three sets of teacher surveys, public (including public charter), private, and BIA. For this report, BIA and public charter schools are included with public schools. The public school sampling frames for the 1993-94, 1999-2000, and 2003-04 SASS were created using the 1991-92, 1997-98, and 2001 Core of Data (CCD) Public School Universe Files, respectively. In SASS, a school was defi ned as an institution or part of an institution that provides classroom instruction to students; has one or more teachers to provide instruction; serves students in one or more of grades 1-12 or the ungraded equivalent and is located in one or more buildings. It was possible for two or more schools to share the same building; in this case they were treated as different schools if they had different administrations (i.e., principals). Since CCD and SASS differ in scope and their defi nitions of a school, some records were deleted, added, or modifi ed in order to provide better coverage and a more effi cient sample design for SASS. Data were collected by multistage sampling, which began with the selection of schools. This report uses 1993-94, 1999-2000, and 2003-04 SASS data. Approximately 10,000 public schools and 3,300 private schools were selected to participate in the 1993-94 SASS, 11,100 public schools (9,900 public schools, 100 BIA-funded schools, and 1,100 charter schools) and 3,600 private schools were selected to participate in the 1999-2000 SASS, and 10,400 public schools (10,200 public schools and 200 BIAfunded schools) and 3,600 private schools were selected to participate in the 2003-04 SASS. Within each school, teachers selected were further stratifi ed into one of fi ve teacher types in the following hierarchy: (1) Asian or Pacifi c Islander; (2) American Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo; (3) teachers who teach classes designed for students with limited English profi ciency; (4) teachers in their fi rst, second, or third year of teaching; and (5) teachers not classifi ed in any of the other groups. Within each teacher stratum, teachers were selected systematically with equal probability. In 1993-94, approximately 57,000 public school teachers and 11,500 private school teachers were sampled. In 1999-2000, 56,300 public school teachers, 500 BIA teachers, 4,400 public charter school teachers, and 10,800 private school teachers were sampled. In 2003-04, 52,500 public school teachers, 700 BIA teachers, and 10,000 private school teachers were sampled. This report focuses on responses from teachers. The overall weighted response rate for public school teachers in 1993-94 was 88 percent. In 1999-2000, the overall weighted response rates were 77 percent for public school teachers, and 86 and 72 percent for BIA and public charter school teachers, respectively (which are included with public school teachers for this report). In 2003-2004, the overall weighted response rates were 76 percent for public school teachers and 86 percent for BIA-funded school teachers (who are included with public school teachers). For private school teachers, the overall weighted response rates were 80 percent, 67 percent, and 70 percent in 1993-94, 1999-2000, and 2003-04, respectively. Values were imputed for questionnaire items that should have been answered but were not. For additional information about SASS, contact: nonresponse rates above 15 percent, and minimal bias was detected. Weights were developed to adjust for the variable probabilities of selection and differential nonresponse and can be used to produce national estimates for regular public schools in the 2003-04 school year.

For "}, {"section_title": "ACCURACY OF ESTIMATES", "text": "The accuracy of any statistic is determined by the joint effects of nonsampling and sampling errors. Both types of error affect the estimates presented in this report. Several sources can contribute to nonsampling errors. For example, members of the population of interest are inadvertently excluded from the sampling frame; sampled members refuse to answer some of the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all of the survey questions (questionnaire nonresponse); mistakes are made during data editing, coding, or entry; the responses that respondents provide differ from the \"true\" responses; or measurement instruments such as tests or questionnaires fail to measure the characteristics they are intended to measure. Although nonsampling errors due to questionnaire and item nonresponse can be reduced somewhat by the adjustment of sample weights and imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling errors or gauging the effects of these errors is usually diffi cult. Sampling errors occur because observations are made on samples rather than on entire populations. Surveys of population universes are not subject to sampling errors. Estimates based on a sample will differ somewhat from those that would have been obtained by a complete census of the relevant population using the same survey instruments, instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a statistic is a measure of the variation due to sampling; it indicates the precision of the statistic obtained in a particular sample. In addition, the standard errors for two sample statistics can be used to estimate the precision of the difference between the two statistics and to help determine whether the difference based on the sample is large enough so that it represents the population difference. Most of the data used in this report were obtained from complex sampling designs rather than a simple random design. The features of complex sampling require different techniques to calculate standard errors than are used for data collected using a simple random sampling. Therefore, calculation of standard errors requires procedures that are markedly different from the ones used when the data are from a simple random sample. The Taylor series approximation technique or the balanced repeated replica-tion (BRR) method was used to estimate most of the statistics and their standard errors in this report. Figure A.3 lists the various methods used to compute standard errors for different datasets. Standard error calculation for data from the National Crime Victimization Survey and the School Crime Supplement was based on the Taylor series approximation method using PSU and strata variables available from each dataset. For statistics based on all years of NCVS data, standard errors were derived from a formula developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, which consists of three generalized variance function (gvf) constant parameters that represent the curve fi tted to the individual standard errors calculated using the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique. The formulas used to compute the adjusted standard errors associated with percentages or population counts can be found in fi gure A.3. The coeffi cient of variation (C v ) represents the ratio of the standard error to the mean. As an attribute of a distribution, the C v is an important measure of the reliability and accuracy of an estimate. In this report, the Cv was calculated for all estimates, and in cases where the C v was at least 30 percent the estimates were noted with a ! symbol (interpret data with caution). In cases where the C v was greater than 50 percent, the estimate was determined not to meet reporting standards and was suppressed."}, {"section_title": "STATISTICAL PROCEDURES", "text": "The comparisons in the text have been tested for statistical signifi cance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited in the report are statistically signifi cant at the .05 level. Several test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the statement being tested. The primary test procedure used in this report was the student's t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates, for example, between males and females. The formula used to compute the t statistic is as follows: (1) t = se 1 2 +se 2   2where E 1 and E 2 are the estimates to be compared and se 1 and se 2 are their corresponding standard errors. Note that this formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the estimates are not independent (for example, when comparing a total percentage with that for a subgroup included in the total), a covariance term (i.e., 2*se 1 *se 2 ) must be added to the denominator of the formula: t = se 1 2 +se 2 2 +2 * se 1* se 2 Once the t value was computed, it was compared with the published tables of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels. For this report, an alpha value of .05 was used, which has a t value of 1.96. If the t value was larger than 1.96, then the difference between the two estimates is statistically signifi cant at the 95 percent level. A linear trend test was used when differences among percentages were examined relative to ordered categories of a variable, rather than the differences between two discrete categories. This test allows one to examine whether, for example, the percentage of students using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school increased (or decreased) with their age. Based on a regression with, for example, student's age as the independent variable and whether a student was physically attacked as the dependent variable, the test involves computing the regression coeffi cient (b) and its corresponding standard error (se). The ratio of these two (b/se) is the test statistic t. If t is greater than 1.96, the critical value for one comparison at the .05 alpha level, the hypothesis that there is a linear relationship between student's age and being physically attacked is not rejected. Some comparisons among categories of an ordered variable with three or more levels involved a test for a linear trend across all categories, rather than a series of tests between pairs of categories. In this report, when differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordered categories, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. To do this, ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts corresponding to successive levels of the independent variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors (that is, standard errors that were calculated by the Taylor series method), the variance between the means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used to partition the total sum of squares into within-and between-group sums of squares. These were used to create mean squares for the within-and between-group variance components and their corresponding F statistics, which were then compared with published values of F for a signifi cance level of .05. Signifi cant values of both the overall F and the F associated with the linear contrast term were required as evidence of a linear relationship between the two variables.  1 The interviews conducted on cases between July 1, 1994, and June 30, 1999 achieved a response rate of 97 percent for police officials and 78 percent for school officials.
