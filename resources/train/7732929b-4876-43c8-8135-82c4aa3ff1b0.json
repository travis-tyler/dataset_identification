Guidelines recommend voxel-based statistical testing to support visual evaluation of the PET images. However, the performance of voxel-based testing strongly depends on each single preprocessing step involved. Objective: To optimize the processing pipeline of voxel-based testing for the prognosis of dementia in subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: The study included 108 ADNI MCI subjects grouped as 'stable MCI' (n = 77) or 'MCI-to-AD converter' according to their diagnostic trajectory over 3 years. Thirty-two ADNI normals served as controls. Voxel-based testing was performed with the statistical parametric mapping software (SPM8) starting with default settings. The following modifications were added step-by-step: (i) motion correction, (ii) custom-made FDG template, (iii) different reference regions for intensity scaling, and (iv) smoothing was varied between 8 and 18 mm. The t-sum score for hypometabolism within a predefined AD mask was compared between the different settings using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with respect to differentiation between 'stable MCI' and 'MCI-to-AD converter'. The area (AUC) under the ROC curve was used as performance measure. Results: The default setting provided an AUC of 0.728. The modifications of the processing pipeline improved the AUC up to 0.832 (p = 0.046). Improvement of the AUC was confirmed in an independent validation sample of 241 ADNI MCI subjects (p = 0.048).\nThe prognostic value of voxel-based single subject analysis of brain FDG PET in MCI subjects can be improved considerably by optimizing the processing pipeline."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Positron emission tomography (PET) with the glucose analog 2-[F-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) is a well-established radionuclide imaging modality for non-invasive in-vivo assessment of synaptic function and dysfunction in the brain [1] . Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) show a characteristic pattern of cerebral hypoactivity including the posterior cingulate/precuneus area and parietotemporal association cortices not only in the dementia phase but already in the phase of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Therefore, FDG PET is widely used for early diagnosis of AD and differentiation from neurodegenerative diseases with different characteristic FDG PET pattern [6, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .\nRevised criteria for the diagnosis of AD recommend biomarkers including brain FDG PET to complement clinical, i.e., symptom-based criteria with objective evidence of the underlying pathology [13] [14] [15] , at least in research settings, although it has also been noted that synaptic dysfunction of the brain most likely is a down-stream consequence of amyloid-\u2424 pathology and, therefore, might be better considered a biomarker for staging and/or disease monitoring rather than a diagnostic marker [16] . Whereas the future role of FDG PET in the management of patients with suspected AD might not be clear yet, currently it is still widely used in clinically unclear cognitive impairment (CUCI) in everyday routine.\nInterpretation of brain FDG PET is based on visual inspection of the reconstructed tomographic images. However, the quality of the interpretation can be improved by software support. Voxel-based statistical single subject analysis [17, 18] , i.e., voxel-by-voxel statistical testing of the patient's FDG PET image against a database of normal brain FDG PETs, has been found particularly useful: it not only allows inexperienced readers to detect the AD pattern in FDG PET with the same accuracy (both sensitivity and specificity) as experts, but also results in small improvement of expert interpretation [19] . Thus, common practice guidelines for brain FDG PET recommend the use of voxel-based single subject analysis to support visual interpretation of brain FDG PET in patients with suspected AD [20, 21] .\nHowever, whereas there is general consensus that voxel-based single subject analysis should be used, there is much less consensus about how the analysis should be performed. This is a major limitation, because voxel-based testing requires several preprocessing steps, each of which can have strong impact on overall performance. The lack of standardization of voxel-based single subject analysis might result in the use of suboptimal protocols at some institutions so that the diagnostic and prognostic potential of brain FDG PET most likely is not fully exploited. The aim of the present study therefore was to optimize the processing pipeline of voxel-based single subject analysis for prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion within the framework of the freely available statistical parametric mapping software package (version SPM8) [22] ."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).

In detail, for each NC, the motion-corrected FDG PET was coregistered to its baseline MPRAGE MRI (the first of the two baseline MPRAGE scans was used in all cases; unpreprocessed MRI data was downloaded from ADNI). Then, the MRI was segmented and stereotactically normalized using SPM's unified segmentation algorithm [26] . Unified segmentation was guided by freely available tissue probability maps (TPM) with 1 mm isotropic resolution generated from a sample of 662 healthy elderly subjects [27] .

A similar mask has previously been created by the union of the a priori images of gray and white matter provided by SPM, each thresholded at a given probability [33] .

This resulted in a total of 241 additional MCI subjects who had completed the 3 years follow-up in the meanwhile (ADNI participant roster IDs are listed in the Supplementary Material). 181 of these MCI subjects had been cognitively stable for 3 years; the remaining 60 had converted to ADD.

The cut-off was selected according to the Youden criterion [39] , i.e., by maximizing the Youden index J = sensitivity + specificity -1, which is symmetric in sensitivity and specificity and, therefore, imposes equal penalty on false positive and false negative classifications. Although maximization of the Youden index is a rather simple model, it might be affected by statistical noise. Thus, overfitting cannot be ruled out so that estimates of diagnostic accuracy measures are most likely overly optimistic. In order to correct for overfitting, 100 repeats of 20-fold cross-validation were performed. Estimating errors of accuracy estimates by variance across repeats of cross-validation is limited by the risk of duplicated training samples. We therefore used Equation (3) in [40] to estimate the 95% confidence interval of the accuracy measures."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Image processing worked properly in all subjects (according to visual inspection of stereotactically normalized images and statistical maps), i.e., there was no failure in any of the subjects (108 + 241 = 349 ADNI MCI subjects, 32 ADNI normals, and 32 ADNI ADD patients), although no subject was excluded based on technical constraints such as poor PET image quality. This demonstrates the robustness of the fully automatic SPM processing pipeline, which is an important prerequisite for use in everyday clinical routine. The processing time for single subject analysis was about 4 minutes on a standard PC, which is compatible with busy clinical workflow.\nThe results of the ROC analyses in the original sample of 108 MCI subjects are summarized in Fig. 4 . With the SPM default setting for voxel-based single subject analysis, the t-sum score provided an AUC of 0.728 for the differentiation between 'MCI-to-AD converter' and 'MCI stable'. Frame-by-frame motion correction improved the AUC to 0.754. Whereas replacing SPM's [O-15]-water template by the custom FDG template did not further improve AUC (0.753), parenchyma scaling (instead of proportional scaling) resulted in considerable further improvement to AUC = 0.832. The total improvement from AUC = 0.728 for the default setting to AUC = 0.832 for the 'optimized' setting was statistically significant (two-sided p = 0.046).\n'Simple', i.e., non-iterative parenchyma scaling performed better than all other scaling methods, including iterative parenchyma scaling. The degree of smoothing had negligible impact on the AUC, at least with parenchyma scaling.

The following aspects of the processing pipeline were considered: frame-by-frame motion correction, [O-15] -water versus FDG template, spatial smoothing, and intensity scaling.\nThe first step towards improved single subject analysis of brain FDG PET was motion correction. The majority of the ADNI brain FDG PETs included in the present study comprised 6 frames of 5 min duration from 30 to 60 min post injection. Motion correction was performed frame-by-frame by realigning frames 2 to 6 with the first frame. With modern PET/CT (and PET/MR systems), PET emission recording is in list mode which allows arbitrary framing of the acquired data during image reconstruction. Modern PET/CT (and PET/MR systems) also provide high sensitivity for the detection of radioactive decays so that adequate statistical image quality requires less than 30 min acquisition time (after injection of a standard dose of about 200 MBq FDG [20, 21] ). In our department, we perform a 15-min acquisition 40 \u00b1 5 min post injection which then is reconstructed into 15 frames of 1 min duration for frame-by-frame motion correction.\nThe second important factor was intensity scaling which has been found to have a large impact on the performance of single subject analysis of brain FDG PET also in previous studies [32, [41] [42] [43] [44] . In the present study, direct voxel-wise scaling to the mean intensity in a predefined gray and white matter (parenchyma) mask provided the best performance. Compared to the widely used proportional scaling method implemented in SPM, the AUC increased from 0.754 to 0.832. This most likely is explained by elimination of extra variability associated with inter-subject differences of extracranial FDG uptake, for example in the scalp and in nasopharyngeal space. Proportional scaling typically averages the voxel intensity over all tissues with visually detectable FDG uptake including extracranial structures.\nA limitation of simple scaling to the mean intensity in the fixed parenchyma mask is that this mask includes brain regions affected by reduced FDG uptake in patients with ADD and MCI due to AD, which results in underestimation of the true reference value. The latter causes overestimation of scaled FDG uptake which results in reduced power for the detection of hypometabolism (and spurious hypermetabolism) [45] . This effect can be avoided either by using a fixed Table 4 Area (AUC) under the ROC curve, cut-off value on the t-sum score determined by the maximum Youden index, and accuracy measures for prediction of ADNI-MCI to ADD conversion within 36 months by the t-sum score computed by the SPM8 single subject processing pipeline with default or optimized setting in the validation sample of MCI subjects. All accuracy measures were cross-validated by 100 repeats of 20-fold cross-validation. 95% confidence intervals (CI) are given in brackets. The 95%-CI for the AUC was obtained as described in [38] , the 95%-CIs for the accuracy measures were estimated according to [40] . anatomical reference region which is not affected by AD or by using data-driven techniques to automatically eliminate affected regions based on statistical criteria. Methods of both types were tested in the present study. The pons was used as AD-unaffected reference region, based on the finding of preserved pontine glucose metabolism in AD by Minoshima and co-workers [32] . Iterative parenchyma scaling and the Yakushev method [31] were used as data driven techniques. However, none of these methods performed better than simple parenchyma scaling. We hypothesize that this is related to statistical noise of the reference value: the larger the reference region the smaller the statistical noise of the reference value obtained by averaging the intensity over all voxels within the reference region. The results of the present study suggest that reduction of statistical noise by the large size of the parenchyma reference region overcompensates the impact of systematic underestimation of the reference value caused by AD-related hypometabolism in the parenchyma reference region, at least for prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. With data-driven methods, the reference region varies between tests which might be considered a disadvantage in single subject analysis (inter-subject variability of test performance).\nThe mean of the voxel intensity over all voxels within the reference region was used as reference value to characterize the FDG uptake in the reference region. We also tested the median instead of the mean (results not shown). The rationale for this was that the median might be less sensitive to moderate (disease-related) intensity changes which primarily affect the intensity spectrum above the median and, therefore, do not change the median. However, using the median did not improve prognostic accuracy (for example, parenchyma scaling: AUC = 0.798 versus 0.832 with median and mean, respectively).\nPons scaling performed slightly worse than parenchyma scaling (AUC = 0.762 versus 0.832). In addition, when using the pons as reference region, it is mandatory to carefully check in each single subject whether the pons has been completely within the fieldof-view of the PET acquisition. Failure to do so might result in false negative single subject analysis due to severe underestimation of pontine FDG uptake.\nConcerning the brain template used to define the target space for stereotactical normalization, there was no difference with respect to MCI-to-AD prognosis between the [O-15]-water template provided by SPM and a custom-made tracer-specific template generated from FDG PETs of age-matched ADNI NC subjects. We made some attempts to improve the FDG PET template, for example by using the 32 ADNI ADD patients included in the present study rather than the ADNI NC subjects to generate the template. However, this ADD FDG template resulted in increased voxel-by-voxel coefficient of variance over the stereotactically normalized and parenchyma scaled NC FDG PET images (Fig. 1) . Although this did not degrade the accuracy for prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion (0.831 versus 0.832 for ADD FDG and NC FDG template, respectively), the NC FDG PET template described above was used for all analyses presented here.\nIt has been previously shown that the template can have a considerable impact on the performance of single subject analysis [46, 47] . That the impact was small in the present study might be explained by the fact that O-15-water and FDG PET provide rather similar images (both are considered surrogate of synaptic activity).\nMRI-based stereotactical normalization of FDG PET was performed only during template generation (see Materials and Methods), although MRI-based stereotactical normalization has been shown to improve the power of voxel-based testing compared to PET-based stereotactical normalization [48] . However, in everyday clinical patient care, MRI is not available in all patients. Therefore, we recommend PET-based stereotactical normalization for clinical routine, in order to guarantee the same processing in all patients.\nFully consistent processing in all patients appears important in clinical routine to guarantee stable performance of statistical single subject analysis.\nThe amount of smoothing, too, had only very small impact on the prognosis of MCI-to-AD conversion, even though it was varied in the rather large range from 8 to 18 mm FWHM. The aim of spatial smoothing is (i) to cope with residual inter-subject variability after stereotactical normalization and (ii) to increase the signal-to-noise ratio for improved statistical power for detection of hypometabolic clusters. It has been suggested that spatial smoothing should match the spatial extent of the effect to be detected [49, 50] . Thus, one would expect rather strong smoothing to work best for the detection of the spatially rather extended AD-characteristic pattern of hypometabolism in FDG PET (typical volume of the ADD mask was about 370 ml, comp. Fig. 3 ). The fact that smoothing had only a very small effect in the present study might be explained by some interaction with the parenchyma mask used as reference region for intensity scaling. The parenchyma mask is rather narrow (Fig. 2) so that increasing the width of the Gaussian smoothing kernel beyond the radial width of the mask is expected to have only a small effect on voxel intensities within the parenchyma mask. In order to test this hypothesis, variation of the smoothing kernel was repeated in combination with proportional scaling. Proportional scaling typically includes the whole head as reference region and, therefore, should be more sensitive to smoothing than parenchyma scaling. This was confirmed: with proportional scaling, the AUC of the t-sum score increased with the amount of smoothing, from AUC = 0.749 at 8 mm kernel width to AUC = 0.767 at 14 mm to AUC = 0.782 at 18 mm. This indicates that the impact of spatial smoothing depends on the reference region for intensity scaling: the impact is large for proportional scaling, but small for parenchyma scaling. Stability of parenchyma scaling with respect to the amount of smoothing might be considered an advantage, particularly in multi-site and single-site/multi-camera settings in which the spatial resolution of the tested images depends also on cameraspecific PET acquisition and reconstruction protocols.\nIt might be noted that smoothing with 8 mm FWHM provided greater AUC than smoothing with 12 mm FWHM (Fig. 4) , although the difference was very small and far from being statistically significant. Nevertheless, we recommend 12 mm rather than 8 mm smoothing. The rationale for this is that 12 mm is better in compensating inter-scan variability in spatial resolution in the original brain FDG PET images. The variability of spatial resolution in ADNI PET images is rather small due to homogenization of the acquisition protocol across different PET scanners in the ADNI. Variability is expected to be larger in settings with less homogenized acquisition protocols. In these cases, 12 mm smoothing is more effective than 8 mm smoothing in reducing non-physiological inter-subject variability of FDG uptake.\nAccounting for the subjects' age as covariate in the statistical testing did not improve the performance of FDG PET single subject analysis for the prognosis of MCI-to-AD conversion. Therefore, age correction does not appear mandatory for this task, at least as long as patients and control group for voxel-based testing are well matched with respect to age (all groups were very well matched with respect to age in the present study, Table 1 ). Age correction might have even detrimental effects, particularly if some of the older subjects in the control group suffer from preclinical AD. In this case, age correction will correct not only for effects of healthy aging on FDG uptake but, to some extent, also for AD-typical hypometabolism. The latter will reduce the power for detection of the AD pattern in patients to be diagnosed.\nFinally, switching the order of image smoothing and intensity scaling, i.e., performing intensity scaling prior to smoothing, resulted in considerable deterioration of the prognostic power and, therefore, cannot be recommended.\nAltogether, optimizing the parameter setting of the SPM processing pipeline improved the AUC of the t-sum score for differentiation between MCI-to-AD converters and MCI stable subjects by about 14% from 0.728 (SPM default setting) to 0.832 (Fig. 4,  5) . The effect was statistically significant (two-sided p = 0.046). To put this into perspective, it might be noted that many studies suggest a capping of prognostic accuracy in MCI patients considerably below 100%, independent of the criteria and/or biomarkers used [28, [51] [52] [53] [54] . Therefore, not only the relative improvement by 14%, but also the final absolute value of AUC = 0.832 appears rather remarkable, particularly as it can be achieved rather easily without extra costs, i.e., using standard FDG PET acquisition protocols (no dynamic imaging of the full time course of FDG concentration in tissue starting with i.v. injection required, no blood sampling, no tracer kinetic modeling) and the freely available SPM software package with only minor adaptions.\nThis finding was confirmed in an independent validation sample of 241 further ADNI MCI subjects. The relative improvement in AUC was about the same in the original and in the validation sample: 14% and 11%, respectively. However, it should be noted that the absolute AUC values were lower in the validation sample: 0.675 versus 0.728 with default parameter settings, 0.746 versus 0.832 with optimized parameter settings of the SPM8 processing pipeline. We hypothesize that this is related to the fact that the original sample mainly included late MCI subjects from the ADNI-1 phase, whereas the validation sample included many subjects from ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 with early MCI in which prognosis is expected to be more difficult than in late MCI. To some extent this is reflected by the fraction of MCI-to-AD converters in both samples, as it is smaller in the validation sample (25% versus 29%).\nThe power of brain FDG PET for the prognosis of MCI-to-AD conversion has been investigated in several previous studies using different methods. Arbizu and coworkers, who evaluated a variant of the ADrelated hypometabolic convergence index [55] for the prognosis of MCI-to-AD conversion in 121 ADNI MCI subjects, reported an AUC of 0.804 for a multivariate model including the posterior cingulate index together with age, gender, MMSE, and ApoE4 status [51] . Morbelli and coworkers, who evaluated the AD t-sum score in 127 MCI patients from the European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium network, reported an accuracy of 79.6% for prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion [54] . In the present study, maximum accuracy of the t-sum score was 83.3%.\nIn a recent study on multimodal prediction of MCIto-AD conversion we found the sum score of the functional activity questionnaire (FAQ) to be the best single feature [56] . For the original n = 108 ADNI MCI sample included in the present study, ROC analysis of this sum score (FAQTOTAL) resulted in AUC = 0.786 (Fig. 5) . Thus, the t-sum score from the single subject analysis of FDG PET performed better than the FAQ only after optimizing the processing protocol. This finding underpins the necessity of optimizing single subject analysis of brain FDG PET, since otherwise the additional benefit from FDG PET might be rather small, particularly when considering the cost-benefit ratio.\nConcerning the parameter setting for single subject analysis of brain FDG PET within the SPM framework, Perani and colleagues optimized an SPM5-based processing pipeline with respect to differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases including AD, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and dementia with Lewy bodies [57] . Visual interpretation of the statistical parametric maps improved the differentiation between AD and FTLD compared to visual interpretation of the raw FDG uptake images. The optimized SPM5 processing pipeline used PET-based stereotactical normalization (with very similar parameter settings as in the present study) to a dementia-specific FDG template, proportional intensity scaling followed by smoothing with an isotropic 3-dimensional Gaussian kernel of 8 mm FWHM. The impact of extracranial inter-subject variability of FDG uptake was taken into account by an explicit mask to restrict voxel-based testing to the brain. The results of this previous study are in good agreement with the results of the present study. Minor differences of the optimized processing pipeline between the two studies might be explained by the different task for which the processing was optimized: differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases in the study by Perani and colleagues versus MCI-to-AD conversion in the present study. Visual interpretation of statistical parametric maps in the Perani study versus quantitative t-sum score analysis in the present study might also have contributed to the minor differences.\nLimitations of the present study include the use of a fixed time interval for prediction (3 years) and that all analyses were strictly univariate. Future studies might use Kaplan-Meier analysis and/or multivariate Cox regression to better account for inter-subject variability of follow-up duration and time to conversion as well as to assess the incremental value of FDG PET over other features used for the diagnosis of AD."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Optimizing SPM for voxel-based single subject analysis of brain FDG PET can provide considerable improvement of MCI-to-AD prediction. To achieve this we recommend: (i) reconstruction (of list mode data) into several frames of constant duration (1 to 5 min), (ii) frame-by-frame motion correction by realignment to the reference frame (chronologically closest to the low-dose CT for attenuation correction), (iii) discarding all frames with more than 4 mm displacement with respect to the reference frame in order to avoid attenuation artifacts (if the spatial mismatch with respect to the low-dose CT for attenuation correction can be corrected frame-by-frame during image reconstruction, this might be preferred), (iv) add the selected frames to generate one static FDG uptake image (5 min total duration provides sufficient statistical image quality in most cases), (v) 3-dimensional spatial smoothing with an isotropic Gaussian kernel with 12 mm FWHM, (vi) voxel-wise intensity scaling to the mean tracer uptake in brain parenchyma using a predefined mask in template space. These steps can easily be implemented as a fully automatic processing pipeline."}]
