[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the use of integrated information from multi-modalities could significantly improve diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, feature selection, which is one of the most important steps in classification, is typically performed separately for each modality, which ignores the potentially strong inter-modality relationship within each subject. Recent emergence of multi-task learning approach makes the joint feature selection from different modalities possible. However, joint feature selection may unfortunately overlook different yet complementary information conveyed by different modalities. We propose a novel multitask feature selection method to preserve the complementary inter-modality information. Specifically, we treat feature selection from each modality as a separate task and further impose a constraint for preserving the inter-modality relationship, besides separately enforcing the sparseness of the selected features from each modality. After feature selection, a multi-kernel support vector machine (SVM) is further used to integrate the selected features from each modality for classification. Our method is evaluated using the baseline PET and MRI images of subjects obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Our method achieves a good performance, with an accuracy of 94.37% and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9724 for AD identification, and also an accuracy of 78.80% and an AUC of 0.8284 for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) identification. Moreover, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 67.83% and an AUC of 0.6957 for separating between MCI converters and MCI non-converters (to AD). These performances demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art classification methods."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a genetically complex and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder which is clinically characterized by progressive dementia and neuropsychiatric symptoms (Blennow et al., 2006) . The number of subjects with AD has been predicted to quadruple by 2050 (Brookmeyer et al., 2007) . Although numerous efforts have been made in the past decades to develop new treatment strategies, there is no effective treatment or effective diagnostic instrument until now. This causes substantial financial burden to the society, as well as psychological and emotional burden to patients and their families. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an intermediate stage between normal cognition and dementia, has a high risk of progressing to AD (Petersen et al., 1999) . While the annual incidence rate of healthy subjects to develop AD is 1% to 2% (Bischkopf et al., 2002) , the conversion rate from MCI to AD is reported to be approximately 10% to 15% per year (Grundman et al., 2004) . Thus, it is of great interest to identify MCI and also predict its risk of progressing to AD.\nAccumulating evidence demonstrates that individuals with AD have both functional and structural changes in the brain, such as loss of gray matter volume (Karas et al., 2003) and metabolic abnormalities (Matsuda, 2001 ). However, these findings are mainly obtained based on group-level statistical comparison, and thus are of limited value for individual-based disease diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, pattern classification methods have been used in recent years, and have shown great potential in neuroimaging studies (Fan et al., 2007; Wee et al., in press ). Unlike group-based comparison approaches, pattern classification methods are able to detect the fine-grained spatial discriminative patterns, which are critical for individual-based disease diagnosis. Moreover, some studies have shown that the combination of complementary information from different imaging modalities can improve the accuracy in diagnosis of AD and MCI. For example, Z. used both structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and NeuroImage 84 (2014) [466] [467] [468] [469] [470] [471] [472] [473] [474] [475] resting-state functional MRI to classify 16 AD patients from 22 healthy subjects, and achieved a classification accuracy of 89.47%, which is an increase of 2.63% from the single-modality based method. Wee et al. (2012) used both Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI to identify 10 individuals with MCI from 17 matched Normal Controls (NC), and obtained a very promising classification accuracy of 96.3%, which is an increase of 7.4% from the single-modality based method. Although high classification accuracies were achieved, the small sample and large feature size problem in these studies may still lead to data overfitting. Since the original feature space of neuroimaging data is relatively high compared to the sample size, feature selection is one of the most important steps in neuroimaging classification. However, in the literature, feature selection in multimodal classification studies is often performed separately for each imaging modality without considering the potentially strong relationship among different modalities, thus possibly affecting the final classification results. Hence, it is reasonable to consider preserving the inter-modality relationship during the feature selection for final improvement of classification.\nRecently, multi-task learning approach has attracted the increasing attention in machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence (Evgeniou and Pontil, 2007; Zhou et al., 2011) . The main goal of this approach is to capture the intrinsic relationship among different tasks with the assumption that these tasks are related to each other. Learning multiple related tasks simultaneously has been shown to often perform better than learning each task separately (Evgeniou and Pontil, 2007) . Specially, recent emergence of multi-task learning method enables joint feature selection via group sparsity (i.e. using L 2,1 norm) (Liu et al., 2009) . However, this constraint may be too strong, since it forces common features to be selected for different tasks, without considering that different tasks may need different features.\nIn this paper, a novel multi-task learning based feature selection method is proposed to better preserve the complementary information conveyed by different modalities. More specifically, selection of features from different modalities is treated as different tasks. To better capture the complementary information among different modalities, it is also important to preserve the relationship between the feature vectors derived from different modalities, especially after their projection onto the lower dimensional feature space. To this end, a new constraint is imposed to preserve the inter-modality relationship, besides enforcing the sparseness of the selected features from each modality as popularly used in the literature. A multi-kernel support vector machine (SVM) is finally used to combine the selected features from each modality for predicting the classification labels.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Materials and methods section furnishes information on the image dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and details of the proposed framework. Experimental results of the proposed method and some state-of-the-art methods on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset are summarized in the Experiment and results section. The findings of proposed framework are extensively discussed in the Discussion section, which is followed by the Conclusion section."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The data were taken from the ADNI dataset (www.adni.loni.ucla.edu/ ADNI). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Dr. Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California, San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research, approximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals to be followed for 3 years, 400 people with MCI to be followed for 3 years, and 200 people with early AD to be followed for 2 years.\nAll the patients met the following inclusion criteria: 1) diagnosis of AD was made if the subject had a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 20-26, a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0.5 or 1.0, and meets the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria for probable AD. 2) Individuals were categorized as amnestic MCI if they had an MMSE score of 24-30, a CDR of 0.5, a memory complaint, objective memory loss measured by education adjusted scores on Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II, absence of significant levels of impairment in other cognitive domains, while essentially preserved activities of daily living, and an absence of dementia. All NC individuals met the following criteria: an MMSE score of 24-30, a CDR of 0, nondepressed, non-MCI, and nondemented. The research protocol was approved by each local institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from each subject at the time of enrollment for imaging and genetic sample collection.\nTwo hundreds and two subjects from ADNI dataset: 51 patients with AD, 99 patients with MCI (43 MCI converters who had converted to AD within 18 months and 56 MCI non-converters who had not converted to AD within 18 months), and 52 NC are analyzed in this study.

MRI acquisitions were performed according to the ADNI acquisition protocol (Jack et al., 2008) . For the image preprocessing, we first performed Anterior Commissure-Posterior Commissure (AC-PC) correction on all images, and then used N3 algorithm (Sled et al., 1998) to correct intensity inhomogeneity. Skull-stripping was then performed, followed by the registration-based cerebellum removal. We used FAST in FSL (Zhang et al., 2001 ) to segment brain into three different tissue types: gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We registered the template into subject specific space using HAMMER (Shen and Davatzikos, 2002) to preserve the absolute image volume of each subjects. Subsequently, we parcellated the brain in 93 regions-of-interest, based on the Jacob template (Kabani, 1998) . GM volume of each ROI was extracted as the feature for the MRI modality. PET images were acquired 30-60 min postinjection, averaged, spatially aligned, interpolated to a standard voxel size, intensity normalized, and smoothed to a common resolution of 8-mm full width at half maximum. For each subject, we aligned the preprocessed PET image to its respective MRI image using affine registration. Then we calculated the average intensity of each regions-of- Table 1 Characteristics of the subjects used in this study. 14.7 \u00b1 3.6 15.9 \u00b1 2.9 15.8 \u00b1 3.2 MMSE (mean \u00b1 SD) 23.8 \u00b1 2.0 27.1 \u00b1 1.7 29.0 \u00b1 1.2 interest and treated it as the feature for the PET modality. Thus, we finally have 93 features from the MRI image and 93 features from the PET image, for each subject."}, {"section_title": "Overview of our method", "text": "An overview of the proposed classification pipeline was illustrated in Fig. 1 . From the preprocessed PET and MRI images, we first extracted the respective regional features as motioned above. Based on these features, inter-modality relationship constrained multi-task feature selection was applied to select the important features from each modality. Based on the selected features, a kernel matrix was constructed for each modality. Then, a fused kernel matrix was further constructed, based on the individual matrix from each modality, for classification by using SVM.\nAlthough we used regional features, the number of features was relatively large compared to the sample size, and most importantly, some of them were irrelevant or redundant for classification. Thus, an effective feature selection could not only speed up computation, but also improve the classification performance. Unlike the traditional single-task feature selection approaches which treat each task independently, such as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) (Tibshirani, 1996) , multi-task feature selection approaches can often significantly improve the classification performance by learning multiple tasks simultaneously (Evgeniou and Pontil, 2007) ."}, {"section_title": "Multi-task feature selection", "text": "T be a n \u00d7 d matrix that represents d features of n training samples for modality j, j = 1,\u2026, m, where m is the total number of modalities. Let\nT be a n dimensional corresponding target vector (with classification labels as values of +1\nor \u22121 in this study) for modality j. Linear regression model used for prediction can be defined as follows :\nwhere \nwhere \u03bb 1 N 0 is a regularization parameter which controls the sparsity of the model, with a higher value leading to a sparser model, i.e., more ele-\nThis regression approach is known as LASSO.\nThe limitation of above-mentioned model is that each task is treated independently. Although we can use the recent emergence of multitask feature learning method, under framework of group sparsity (i.e., L 2,1 norm, Liu et al., 2009) , to guide selection of common features from different modalities, the complementary information conveyed by different modalities might be discarded after this too strong group sparsity constraint and thus affect the final classification results.\nTo address this problem, we propose to preserve the relative distance between the feature vectors extracted from different modalities of the same subject (also called as inter-modality relationship), before and after feature projection, by imposing the following constraint:\nwhere x i j and x i k denote the feature vectors of the j-th and k-th modalities in the i-th subject, respectively. \u2016x i j \u2212 x i k \u2016 F 2 is the relative distance between the feature vectors x i j and x i k before feature projection, while\nis the respective distance after feature projection (or the distance between the corresponding predictions). Basically, if\nis also required to be small after projection. The goal of providing this additional constraint or guidance as described in Eq. (3) is to better preserve the manifold of relative distributions among different modalities. Although using the sparse regression (based on L 1 norm) can effectively select discriminative features from each modality separately, it ignores the relationship among different modalities, which could make the final selected features over-fitting to the data and thus affect the final performance. Therefore, the use of Eq. (3) is mainly for keeping the joint relationship among different modalities, when each modality selects its own discriminative features. Note that, in this way, the relationships among different modalities can be preserved via this constraint after projection onto the low dimensional feature space. By using the constraint given in Eq. (3), the objective function of the proposed multi-task feature selection model can be further defined as\nwhere \u03bb 1 N 0 and \u03bb 2 N 0 are the regularization parameters controlling, respectively, the sparseness and the degree of preserving the intermodality relationship. The optimization of objective function in Eq. (4) can be solved using the Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG) method (Nesterov, 2003) . In our application, the target vectors are the classification labels, and we just have two modalities (MRI and PET) with the same target vector, i.e., m = 2 and y 1 = y 2 . The models constructed by different approaches are compared in Fig. 2 .\nOf note, all the procedures of feature selection are always performed on the training set, without using the information from the test set. Also, each feature in the training set is transformed into z score via the following transformation:\nwhere f r and \u03c3 r are the mean and standard deviation of the r-th feature across all the training subjects. The f r and \u03c3 r are also used to normalize the r-th feature f r in the test subject. It is also worth noting that, for feature selection, we just keep those features with non-zero regression coefficients for the subsequent classification with SVM. For simplicity, in the following, we still use x i j to denote a vector of the selected features for the j-th modality in the i-th subject."}, {"section_title": "Multi-kernel SVM", "text": "} represent a feature vector of the i-th subject with m modalities and y i \u2208 {1, \u22121} denote the corresponding class label.

A ten-fold cross-validation strategy was used to evaluate the classification performance. Specifically, the whole samples were randomly partitioned into ten subsets and then nine subsets were chosen for training and the remaining one was used for testing, and this procedure was repeated ten times to avoid any bias introduced by random partitioning in the cross-validation. To determine the optimal values for the parameters, i.e., the regularization parameters \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 and the above-mentioned kernel combination weight, we performed another ten-fold cross-validation on the training samples. The SVM model with the best performance in this nested cross-validation was then used to classify the unseen test samples. ACCuracy (ACC), SENsitivity (SEN) and SPEcificity (SPE) were calculated to quantify the performance of all compared methods, which were defined respectively as\nwhere TP is the number of true positives (number of patients correctly classified), TN is the number of true negatives (number of NC correctly classified), FP is the number of false positives (number of NC classified as patients), and FN is the number of false negatives (number of patients classified as NC)."}, {"section_title": "Experiment and results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Experiment settings", "text": "The proposed approach was compared with three different classification approaches, i.e., single modality approach using single-task feature selection (i.e., LASSO) and conventional single-kernel SVM (SSTS), multi-modality approach using single-task feature selection (i.e., LASSO) on each modality and multi-kernel SVM (MSTM), and multimodality approach using joint feature selection (i.e., L 2,1 norm) and multi-kernel SVM (MJSM).

The top ten selected regions in PET and MRI were provided in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. Most of the selected regions, e.g., hippocampal formation, precuneus and entorhinal cortex, are highly related to AD pathology.

It can be observed that the proposed method consistently performs better than the other 3 methods, and also the performances of all methods increase for the late scanned images, since the separation between MCI converters and MCI non-converters becomes larger and larger when subjects become older and older."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This paper has presented a novel multi-modality multi-task feature selection approach for brain disease diagnosis. Different from the conventional single-task feature selection, which selects features independently from each modality, and also the joint feature selection using the L 2,1 norm, the proposed method considers the relationship of (Z. Fan et al., 2007; Walhovd et al., 2010) . However, feature selection in these studies was performed independently in each modality. Thus, it may overlook the complementary information conveyed in different modalities. Multi-task learning approach is a paradigm that learns a number of supervised learning tasks simultaneously by exploiting the commonalities between them. Because it allows the learner to use the relationship among different tasks, this often leads to a better model than the case of learning these tasks independently (Evgeniou and Pontil, 2007) . The key of multi-task learning is to capture the intrinsic relationship among different tasks. Actually, tasks can be related in various ways. The relationship of tasks was modeled by different assumptions, e.g., (1) all tasks are close to each other in some norm (Bakker and Heskes, 2003) , (2) all tasks share a common underlying characteristic (Ben-David and Schuller, 2003) , and (3) all tasks have a common set of features (Argyriou et al., 2008) .\nWe propose to preserve the relative distance between feature vectors of different modalities of the same subject, before and after their projection to the low-dimensional feature space. The promising classification performance we obtained also indicates a good diagnostic power and generalizability of our proposed framework. As we can see from Table 2 , the SSTS method does not use the complementary information from other modalities and thus leads to the lowest classification accuracy when using only single-modality features for classification. Our finding, along with other multi-modality classification studies (Z. Fan et al., 2007; Walhovd et al., 2010) , demonstrates that the complementary information in different modalities can help diagnose AD and MCI. On the other hand, both MSTM and MJSM methods have better classification results than SSTS, but still lower than our results. MSTM method performs feature selection in each modality independently without considering the complementary information between modalities. On the other hand, MJSM method forces too strongly for joint feature selection from different modalities, i.e., selecting same regional features from different modalities. Actually, the abnormal regions in PET and MRI data could be different, e.g., some regions could have decreased GM volume while still having the normal metabolism, and other regions could have metabolic abnormality while having the normal GM volume (Ishii et al., 2005) . Therefore, the complementary information conveyed by different modalities might be eliminated after this too-strong joint feature selection, thus finally affecting the classification performance.\nFurthermore, as shown in Table 3 , our method is better than three other recent studies, even though they used more modalities, which further shows the efficacy of our proposed method in both AD and MCI classifications. Although direct comparison with the aforementioned studies is not appropriate due to the possible use of different subjects (although from the same ADNI dataset), the obtained results validate the promising performance of our method for classification to some extent. For fair comparison, we also compared the results with our previous study which used the same dataset. Better performance (compared to our previous work) further validates the efficacy of our proposed method.\nClassifying MCI converters from MCI non-converters has recently received a significant amount of attention due to its importance for early AD diagnosis. In MCI patients, there are typically two types of clinical changes: 1) MCI patients who will convert to AD in the future time point, i.e., MCI-converters, and 2) MCI patients who will not convert after a certain period of time, i.e., MCI non-converters. Early diagnosis of MCI conversion is tremendously important for possible delay of the disease, and prediction of progression of the disease. For classifying MCI converters from MCI non-converters, as shown in Table 5 , our method achieves an accuracy of 67.83%, sensitivity of 64.88%, and specificity of 70.00%. Our accuracy and AUC are both higher than the comparison methods. Besides, better classification results on a longitudinal dataset further demonstrate the robustness and superiority of our proposed method.\nIdentification of objective biomarkers is of great interest as it could, ultimately, inform clinical decisions of individual patients. With this consideration, our proposed feature selection method seeks to identify those features that are the most discriminative in classifying the MCI converters from MCI non-converters. These features include the hippocampal formation, and the frontal, parietal, and occipital regions. Specifically, the hippocampal formation plays an important role in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory (Eichenbaum et al., 1994; Jaffard and Meunier, 1993) . This region is one of the first brain regions to suffer damage, with memory loss and disorientation, which are included among the early AD symptoms (Van Hoesen and Hyman, 1990) . In addition, voxel-based analysis studies demonstrate significant changes in the perirhinal cortex (Leube et al., 2008) , middle temporal gyrus (Busatto et al., 2003) , amygdala (Matsuda, 2013) , entorhinal cortex (Derflinger et al., 2011) , uncus (Yang et al., 2012) , and inferior frontal gyrus (Kim et al., 2011) . Besides, PET studies showed significant abnormalities in the precuneus (Del Sole et al., 2008) , middle occipital gyrus (Smith et al., 2009) , superior parietal lobule (Potkin et al., 2002) , inferior occipital gyrus (Melrose et al., 2009) , lingual gyrus (Eustache et al., 2004) , superior frontal gyrus (Desgranges et al., 2002) , medial occipitotemporal gyrus (Matsuda, 2001) , and angular gyrus (Hunt et al., 2006) . The fact that our results are consistent with the previous findings suggests the effectiveness of our method in identifying biomarkers for MCI subgroup classification.\nAlthough our proposed method demonstrates a good performance from cross-validations, several limitations should be considered in the present study. First, the proposed feature selection method requires the same number of features computed from different modalities. Indeed, in addition to MRI and PET data, there are other modalities in ADNI database, such as CSF and genetic data, which have different numbers of features. These modalities carry important pathological information that can help further improve classification performance. In the future work, we plan to extend our proposed method for including more modalities. Second, we use 10-fold cross-validation strategy on ADNI dataset to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. Although we do not use separate dataset to test our method, 10-fold cross validation, as used popularly in the machine learning field for classification performance evaluation, somehow tests the performance of our method on separate datasets. Third, there is no consensus of a time boundary for MCI converters and non-converters. Here, we use 18 months for an exploratory analysis. Further classification analysis should be performed by using different time boundaries in MCI subgroup classification. Finally, although we use a cross-validation to evaluate the generalizability of our method, it is important to test on a completely independent dataset in the future."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We have proposed a novel multi-task learning based feature selection method to effectively preserve the complementary information from multi-modal neuroimaging data for AD/MCI identification.
