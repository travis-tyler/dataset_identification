The package has substantial potentials in metagenomic studies that focus on identifying system-level variations of human microbiome associated with disease.\nThe paper \"Constructing a Genome-Wide LD Map of Wild A. gambiae Using Next-Generation Sequencing\" sequenced the genomes of nine individual wild A. gambiae mosquitoes using next-generation sequencing technologies. And 2,219,815 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected. Nearly one million SNPs that were genotyped with 99.6% confidence were extracted from these high-throughput sequencing data. Based on these SNP genotypes, the authors constructed a genome-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) map for wild A. gambiae mosquitoes from malaria-endemic areas in Kenya and made it available through a public website.\nThe paper entitled \"How to Isolate a Plant's Hypomethylome in One Shot\" provided an easy, fast, and cost-effective tool to obtain a plant's hypomethylome (the nonmethylated part of the genome) by an optimized methyl filtration protocol with subsequent next-generation sequencing, in essence In \"Genetic Interactions Explain Variance in Cingulate Amyloid Burden: An AV-45 PET Genome-Wide Association and Interaction Study in the ADNI Cohort,\" the authors performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a genome-wide interaction study (GWIS) of an amyloid imaging phenotype, using the data from Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Neuroimaging Initiative. The GWAS analysis revealed significant hits within or proximal to APOE, APOC1, and TOMM40 genes. The GWIS analysis yielded 8 novel SNP-SNP interaction findings that warrant replication and further investigation.\nThe paper \"Understanding Transcription Factor Regulation by Integrating Gene Expression and DNase I Hypersensitive Sites\" identified the functional transcription factor binding sites in gene regulatory region by integrating the DNase I hypersensitive sites with known position weight matrices. The authors present a model-based computational approach to predict a set of transcription factors that potentially cause such differential gene expression in cervical cancer HeLa S3 cell and HelaS3-ifna4h cell. This model demonstrated the potential to computationally identify the functional transcription factors in gene regulation.\nThe paper \"Survey of Programs Used to Detect Alternative Splicing Isoforms from Deep Sequencing Data In Silico\" is a review paper. Alternative splicing (AS) is very important for gene expression and protein diversity. First the authors summarized the alternative splicing forms and the means of selective splicing. Then the authors described the numerous methods for the read mapping of RNA-seq data and alternative types of splicing prediction software. At last, HMMSplicer, SOAPsplice, TopHat, and STAR were used to evaluate the performance of alternative splicing isoforms detection.\nThe article \"MicroRNA Promoter Identification in Arabidopsis Using Multiple Histone Marker\" was devoted to a computational strategy, which identified the promoter regions of most microRNA genes in Arabidopsis, using the genome wide profiles of nine histone markers. Based upon the assumption that the distributions of histone markers around the transcription start sites (TSSs) of microRNA genes are similar with the TSSs of protein coding gene, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to identify 42 independent miRNA TSSs and 132 miRNA TSSs which are located in the promoters of upstream genes. The annotation of microRNA TSSs will provide the measurements regarding the initiation of transcription and better understanding of microRNA regulation.\nThe paper \"454-Pyrosequencing Analysis of Bacterial Communities from Autotrophic Nitrogen Removal Bioreactors Utilizing Universal Primers: Effect of Annealing Temperature\" carried out a metagenomic analysis (pyrosequencing) of total bacterial diversity including Anammox population in five autotrophic nitrogen removal technologies, two bench-scale (MBR and low temperature CANON) and three full-scale (Anammox, CANON, and DEMON), by optimization of primer selection and PCR conditions. The pyrosequencing data showed that annealing temperature of 45 \u2218 C yielded the best results in terms of species richness and diversity for all bioreactors analyzed.\nThe paper entitled \"Active Microbial Communities Inhabit Sulphate-Methane Interphase in Deep Bedrock Fracture Fluids in Olkiluoto, Finland\" investigated active microbial communities of deep crystalline bedrock fracture water from seven different boreholes in Olkiluoto (Western Finland), using bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA, dsrB, and mcrA gene transcript targeted 454 pyrosequencing. The results demonstrated that active and highly diverse but sparse and stratified microbial communities inhabited the Fennoscandian deep bedrock ecosystems."}]
