[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the coronavirus infectious disease called which surfaced in late 2019 as a novel global public health emergency [1, 2] . In the middle of August 2020, Europe alone was confronted with 3.7 million reported SARS-CoV-2 infections and >210'000 deaths and the dire prospects of exceeding 4 million by the end of summer [3] .\nGiven the continuing global transmission, the unavailability of effective and safe vaccines or antiviral agents for prophylaxis or treatment, many countries have implemented targeted lockdown-and containment strategies as recommended by the WHO [4] . To this end, prompt testing of symptomatic individuals [2, 5] as well as follow-up testing of exposed and recovering patients potentially shedding SARS-CoV-2 are important for case identification, contact tracing, infection control, and clinical patient management [6] [7] [8] . Detecting viral RNA in respiratory fluids by reverse transcription-quantitative nucleic acid testing (RT-QNAT) is currently the gold standard for the specific diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 replication and CoVID-19 [9] . The rapid availability of viral genome sequences in January 2020 facilitated the development of RT-QNAT protocols for SARS-CoV-2 detection [10-12], followed by a range of commercial SARS-CoV-2 assays in the subsequent months [12] [13] [14] [15] . In our center, we applied a prospective parallel testing strategy using the laboratory-developed Basel-S-gene RT-QNAT assay together with a commercial assay for rapid delivery of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 results in the early pandemic phase until March 2020 [11] . To meet the increasing demand of SARS-CoV-2 tests, and to reduce the hands-on time in the laboratory, we prospectively validated a fully automated SARS-CoV-2-assay. Here, we report on the prospective comparison of our established approach with the automated high-throughput Roche-cobas\u00ae6800-Target1/Target2 using nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS).\nAs comprehensive real-life data are scarce, we analyze the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2detection following lockdown and relaxation measures and investigate the quantitative relationship of the different assays and explore SARS-CoV-2-loads in follow-up NOPS and in time-matched lower respiratory fluids, and in plasma samples.\n2"}, {"section_title": "Study periods and clinical samples", "text": "The prospective validation cohort consisted of 1344 naso-oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS) submitted from 30 March to 3 April 2020 in calendar week 13, which were analyzed in parallel with the Basel-SCoV2-S-111bp targeting the S-gene of SARS-CoV-2, the commercial Roche-E-gene RT-QNAT and the cobas\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche-Cobas-Target1/Target2). The Basel-SCoV2-ORF8-98bp corresponding to the previously described as Basel-N-gene assay was used as confirmatory assay for discordant NOPS [11] .\nSubsequently, 12363 NOPS were analyzed with the Roche-Cobas-Target1/Target2 assay from calendar week 14 to 24 (follow-up cohort-1) and 10207 NOPS from calendar week 24 to 34 (follow-up cohort-2) using Basel-S-gene for discordant Roche-Cobas-Target1 and -Target2 results. For NOPS sampling, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal sites were swabbed separately and collected together in one universal transport medium tube (UTM) as described [11] .

The samples had been submitted from 1255 (93%) symptomatic adult and 89 (7%) pediatric patients ( Table 1) Figure S1) . Accordingly, the Roche-Cobas-Target1 assay had a sensitivity of 92.3% (95% CI: 85.9% -96.4%) and a specificity of 99.8% (95% CI: 99.4% -100%), while the Roche-Cobas-Target2 assay had a sensitivity of 92.3% (95% CI: 85.9% -96.4%) and a specificity of 99.2% (95% CI: 98.5% -99.6%)(Supplementary Table S1 ).\nImportantly, the cycle threshold (Ct) values were significantly lower indicating higher viral loads for the concordant positive samples than for the discordant ones being close to the limit of detection (p<0.001; Figure 1 ).\nTo address the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes potentially impacting assay performance and discordance rate, 25'168 complete sequences were downloaded and analyzed. Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 genomes were highly conserved with only eight SNPs present at frequencies >10% within the large 30'000 nt-long RNA genome sequence (Figure 2) . The Sgene sequence of 3'822 nt displayed high sequence conservation with only two SNPs present at frequencies >2% (A23403G at 74.1% and C23731T at 2.3%). Importantly, only a single SNP (i.e. C22432T) was detected in the probe-binding site of the Basel-S-gene RT-QNAT in 268 of 25'168 (1.1%) sequences, at a position not predicted to affect the assay 6 performance (Figure 2) . The ORF8-gene sequences of 366 nt showed SNPs at C27964T, T28144C and G28077C at frequencies of 3.2%, 11.7%, and 1.1%, respectively. Target sequences of the commercial assays are not publicly available precluding evaluation of the assay targets, but the overall SNP frequencies of the E-gene were below 0.3% (Figure 2 ).\nTo specifically address the impact of circulating HCoVs, NOPS from 20 different patients testing positive for each of the four HCoV-HKU1, -NL63, -OC43, and -229E were analyzed, but showed no cross-detection by any of the five assays (Supplementary Table 2 ).\nTaken together, the results indicated a very good performance of all assays, and suggested a stochastic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in NOPS carrying very low viral loads as the most likely reason for discordance. Thus, the prospective validation cohort of 1344 patients comprised a total of 117 (9%) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Although some variability was seen especially within the first 5 days, the overall results showed that SARS-CoV-2 loads in NOPS significantly declined with increasing time after the initial diagnosis ( Figure 5A ). At 10 days, SARS-CoV-2 loads were approximately 3 log10 copies/mL lower than at diagnosis. Twenty days after the initial diagnosis, persisting SARS-CoV-2 loads mostly below 10'000 c/mL.

Both goals are critically dependent on the performance of diagnostic assays, which again are impacted by the prevalence and dynamics following effective lockdown measures and their relaxation. There are only limited real-life data available addressing these diagnostic and epidemiologic challenges in a comprehensive manner. In this study, we report the qualitative and quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 QNAT assays for the diagnosis and in clinically relevant settings of patient follow-up and describe the impact following lockdown and relaxation in Northwestern Switzerland. Our prospective cross-validation of 1344 NOPS demonstrates that a fully automated dual-target assay has a high positive and negative predictive value of 99.5% and 98.7%, respectively, at a prevalence of 15% for a qualitative result, which changes to 91.9% and 99.9% at rates around 1%. Expectedly, single-target assays are more dramatically affected. Thus, this real-life setting indicates the need for confirmatory information in up to 8% of clinical cases and point to critical limitations of large-scale screening of the general population and impact the validity of sample pooling endeavors. Both approaches are discussed for assessing periods of effective containment as well as for testing populations with difficult to define SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk such as returning travelers.\nAll rights reserved.

The epidemiologic dynamics were captured by weekly detection rates, which steadily declined to <1% and then flared up to 4%, both at approximately 6 weeks following lockdown and relaxation measures, respectively. Although we cannot define the key factors for either development, the demographics reveal a significantly younger median age of only 34 years of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in the follow-up cohort-2 compared to approximately 50 years in the validation and follow-up cohort-1. Although the proportion of children testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 had also significantly increased from 3% to 10%, the interquartile age range of follow-up cohort-2 indicated that the recent SARS-CoV-2 flare was mostly due to younger adults between 24 and 48 years of age. These data suggest that behavioral factors were underlying these developments, which might reflect older populations remaining more adherent to (self-)protective measures, while younger adults accepted increased exposure risks such traveling and gathering in larger groups during this period of summer holidays and school closure in Switzerland.\nOur detailed study of SARS-CoV-2 quantification added an independent layer of confirmatory evidence in low prevalence settings. SARS-CoV-2 positive NOPS showed high median viral loads of 10 million copies per milliliter of sample (IQR 130'000 -150 million) in our validation cohort and were equally high in patients diagnosed during the pandemic rise [11] and during off-peak times with detection rates of 2%. Although no commutable validated calibrator is available, highly significant quantitative correlations were observed for all SARS-CoV-2 assays analyzed. The detailed Bland-Altman analysis enumerated the precision in Ct-values when comparing the different assays. Specifically, the automated Roche-Cobas-Target1 and the Basel-S-gene could be used interchangeably as mean differences of Ct-values ranged from 0.0 to 1.4; hence, being within the difference of 0.3 -0.5 log10 commonly accepted in QNAT comparisons [17, 18] .

In half of these cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection could be independently confirmed, again having low viral loads. Among the 1220 NOPS having undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA by both, Roche-Cobas-Target1 and -Target2, only 9 NOPS (0.7%) were independently confirmed as being low SARS-CoV-2-positive, in line with the high negative predictive values. Although details of the commercial assays were not available, our analysis of more than 25'000 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes provided no evidence for relevant target sequence changes of the laboratory-developed assays. Together, the data support the view that high viral loads confirmed the diagnosis, whereas low viral loads close to the limit of detection were associated with discordant or potentially missed diagnosis, for which confirmatory testing should be considered.\nQuantifying viral RNA in NOPS provided independent evidence that SARS-CoV-2 loads decreased by approximately 3 log10 copies per milliliter NOPS at 10 days after diagnosis.\nThis observation is notable for several reasons: First, the data indicate a fairly rapid decline of viral replication in the upper respiratory tract in the absence of effective antiviral treatment.\nSecond, the window for confirmatory NOPS testing is rather short for diagnosing patients having low viral loads or ambiguous results. Third, in symptomatic patients with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 results in NOPS, the potential diagnostic utility of SARS-CoV-2 in lower respiratory fluids or in plasma should be considered [19] .\nThe comparison of time-matched samples from the upper and lower respiratory tract revealed a weak, but significant correlation.

Taken together, individual confirmatory and quantitative follow-up testing should be considered within few days, submitting lower respiratory fluids from symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative NOPS. Other studies have reported similar rule-of thumb dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-loads in upper respiratory fluids of symptomatic, pre-symptomatic and more recently in asymptomatic infected individuals, whereby disease severity, older age and immunodeficiency have been associated with prolonged shedding in some but not all studies [20] [21] [22] ."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Limitations of our study are the observational character of this data reflecting the real-life setting and the fact that we have no comprehensive data regarding duration and severity of symptoms of the approximately 24'000 patients.

A recent study reported that medical attention was sought on average 3 to 5 days after symptoms onset similar to other influenza-like illnesses [19] . Conversely, most of our 261 patients providing follow-up NOPS were hospitalized and in their sixth age decade associated with more severe disease including the need for intensive care.
