[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: We discuss optimization and validation of composite end points for presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. Optimized composites offer hope of substantial gains in statistical power or reduction in sample size. But there is tradeoff between optimization and face validity such that optimization should only be considered if there is a convincing rationale. As with statistically derived regions of interest in neuroimaging, validation on independent data sets is essential. Methods: Using four data sets, we consider the optimized weighting of four components of a cognitive composite which includes measures of (1) global cognition, (2) semantic memory, (3) episodic memory, and (4) executive function. Weights are optimized to either discriminate amyloid positivity or maximize power to detect a treatment effect in an amyloid-positive population. We apply repeated 5 ! 3-fold cross-validation to quantify the out-of-sample performance of optimized composite end points. Results: We found the optimized weights varied greatly across the folds of the cross-validation with either optimization method. Both optimization methods tend to down-weight the measures of global cognition and executive function. However, when these optimized composites were applied to the validation sets, they did not provide consistent improvements in power. In fact, overall, the optimized composites performed worse than those without optimization. Discussion: We find that component weight optimization does not yield valid improvements in sensitivity of this composite to detect treatment effects."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "1 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the (North American) Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (NA-ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

For example, the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC) [1] is a weighted sum of four components: (1) Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT); (2) Logical Memory Paragraph Recall; (3) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); and (4) Digit Symbol Substitution Test. The components were chosen, based on a broad literature review, for their sensitivity to decline in preclinical and prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease. For example, the MMSE has demonstrated sensitivity to decline in preclinical Alzheimer's populations [2] [3] [4] . In its current implementation, PACC components are weighted equally, with the aim of giving more than half of the total weight to episodic memory (components 1, 2, and part of 3), but also giving importance to orientation and language (parts of component 3) and executive function (component 4).\nThe PACC has been criticized on several fronts. It has been suggested that the MMSE has a restricted range of likely scores in this population and should be dropped from composite measures for preclinical Alzheimer's [5] . Others have suggested a more data-driven approach should be used to select components and weights should be optimized to increase power to detect treatment effects or reduce required sample size [6] . Our motivation is to explore the out-of-sample performance of versions of the PACC with such optimized component weights.\nThe component weights can be optimized according to any reasonable criterion, for example, to maximize placebo group decline [6] , or maximize power, or to minimize the smallest detectable effect size. All optimization algorithms are \"greedy\" in the sense that their solution is guaranteed to be optimal only for the given training set, and this tends to come at the cost of generalizability to new data.

The MMSE, FCSRT, LM, and digit rows represent the four components of the PACC. Columns 2 through 6 represent the four pilot data sets, and indicated groupings, used to explore the performance of the PACC. The indicated proxy components (e.g., CVLT) were used when the actual PACC components (e.g., FCSRT) were not available in a study (e.g., AIBL). To explore optimized weighting of the PACC, we fit AIBL data to a logistic model of Ab1 status with month 36 component change z-scores as covariates. The regression coefficients from this model (rescaled to sum to 100%) provide a weighting tuned to discriminate Ab1 status. The resulting weights are in bold and parentheses in the AIBL column, and the resulting minimum detectable d is summarized in the bottom row. The numerically minimized d was 25% (2% smaller than the logistic-derived d), but this required weighting digit in the opposite direction (6% MMSE, 48% CVLT, 54% LM, and 28% digit).\n*The AIBL-optimized PACC was not significantly different at any visit in ADNI, whereas the original was significant only at year 2.\nbased on natural history data such as that depicted in Fig. 1 . Change is estimated in the amyloid-b (Ab) positive and negative groups, and the smallest detectable treatment effect is expressed as a percent difference between those groups, d. We can \"optimize\" w according to any objective function, that is, any function conceived to evaluate the performance of any given weight vector. We explore two potential approaches:\n1. Minimize minimum detectable d: Weights are derived to minimize the detectable treatment effect (d) as a percentage of the group difference in change from baseline between the target and reference populations. These weights are found by submitting the sample size formula [11] to a numerical optimization routine [12] . The resulting weight is rescaled so that it sums to 100%. 2. Logistic regression: Weights are derived from a logistic regression to discriminate the target (e.g., Ab1) from the reference population (e.g., Ab2) based on 3-year component change scores. In this model, Ab status is the binary outcome variable, and the four component change scores are predictors. The resulting regression parameter estimates from this logistic regression are normalized so that they add to 100% to produce the weights. The composite then can be interpreted as a linear predictor of Ab status based on component change scores.\nA demonstration of the R code used for both approaches is included in the Appendix. Note that optimization comes at the price of simplicity and clinical interpretation. For example, a composite optimized using either of the aforementioned approaches could down-weight a component with greater clinical relevance. Also, available natural history data provide no information regarding treatment effects on components. These objective functions effectively assume, without supporting data, that treatment effects will be the same on each component. It is possible for an optimized composite to down-weight a component that could have greater response to treatment (to the detriment of power).\nTo explore the out-of-sample performance of these optimization routines, we attempt two forms of validation: (1) \"external\" validation, and (2) repeated 5 ! 3-fold crossvalidation. We describe both approaches in the following sections."}, {"section_title": "External validation", "text": "The external validation approach we apply is a two-step process:\n1. Training/optimization step: We derive optimized weights using the two optimization approaches described previously applied to one of the data sets. In this application, we chose AIBL to act as the training set. 2. Validation step: We apply the optimized weights from the training step to each of the other external data set to compute the corresponding optimized composite. We fit a mixed model of repeated measures (MMRM) [13] to estimate the difference between target and reference groups in optimized composite change at 36 months, as well as the variance-covariance parameters required for the power calculation. The model treats time as a categorical variable and includes a fixed effect for age at baseline. The model assumes heterogeneous variance with respect to time, and compound symmetric correlation structure. We submit these out-ofsample pilot estimates of the variance-covariance parameters to a sample size formula for MMRM [11] to determine the minimum detectable effect size d as a percentage of the difference between target and reference groups at year 3. We assume a 36-month trial, 6-month visit intervals, N 5 500 participants per group, 30% attrition, 5% a, and 80% power.\nThe choice of AIBL for the training set is arbitrary. Any study could have been used instead. This external validation exercise is meant to be a gentle introduction to, and motivation for, \"validation\" in general. We expect the optimized weights to demonstrate improvements when applied to AIBL, but much less improvement, if any, when the AIBL-optimized weights are applied to the other data sets. A limitation of the external validation approach is that each study has different population characteristics and different assessments. To address this limitation, we also apply cross-validation in which optimization and validation are done within the same study.\n"}, {"section_title": "Repeated 5 ! 3-fold cross-validation", "text": "Cross-validation [7] is typically used to estimate out-ofsample prediction error or to estimate a tuning parameter Fig. 1 . Amyloid (Ab) group profiles and the smallest detectable effect, d, based on Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of aging [10] with mixed-effect model assuming 80% power, 5% two-sided a, 3-year trial, and n 5 500 per group. The assumed attrition for the active group is shown along the bottom of the figure (row marked by green square). The assumed attrition for the placebo group was 5% (n 5 25 participants) less at each visit. This amounts to an assumed overall attrition rate of 30% over 3 years (i.e., 1 2 (337 1 337 1 25)/1000 5 30%). The other rows of numbers along the bottom are the observation counts for the indicated group over time. (Reproduced from Figure 1 of [1] .) that minimizes out-of-sample prediction error. Here we use cross-validation to estimate the out-of-sample estimate of power, as expressed by minimum detectable effect size. A key aspect of cross-validation is that it holds out data (validation set) while performing estimation on the rest of the data (training set). This feature allows an assessment of the out-of-sample performance of an estimate derived on the training set when applied to the independent validation set. Notably, the nonparametric bootstrap does not have this hold-out feature. Cross-validation is typically done with five or ten \"folds\" where each fold, in turn, is omitted from the training step and reserved as the out-of-sample validation set. Because our data sets are relatively small, we chose instead to use repeated 5 ! 3-fold crossvalidation [14] to reserve a larger data set for the power calculation.\nRepeated 5 ! 3-fold cross-validation is essentially a bootstrapped 3-fold cross-validation. With repeated 5 ! 3-fold cross-validation, we divide each study up into three random subgroups of roughly equal size with roughly the same proportion of subjects in the target and reference groups. Each of the three random subgroups, in turn, is reserved as the validation set, and we apply the validation step procedure described previously. The remaining two-thirds of the data are used to derive optimized weights (training/optimization step). We then repeat this 3-fold cross-validation five times on different random permutation of the data. We summarize the medians and ranges of the optimized weights and out-ofsample minimum detectable effect sizes across the 15 folds of the 5 ! 3-fold cross-validation.\nAll analyses were conducted using the R [15] , with packages nlme [16] , and longpower [17] . Graphics were produced using ggplot2 [18] . Table 1 summarizes the results of the external validation. The weights optimized using the logistic regression approach applied to AIBL down-weighted MMSE (6%) and digit symbol (5%) and up-weighted CVLT (55%) and logical memory (35%). This resulted in a small improvement in the minimum detectable treatment effect (from 33% treatment effect without optimization to 27% with optimization). However, when these optimized weights were applied to the other data sets, we saw the minimum detectable treatment effect actually increased. By using the numerical optimization approach, we were able to reduce the minimum detectable effect in AIBL down to 25%, but this required weighting Digit Symbol in the opposite direction. This is likely due to minimal and variable change on Digit Symbol in AIBL. The optimized weight would likely converge to a sensible estimate with a larger data set. Table 2 and Figs. 2 and 3 summarize the results of the 5 ! 3-fold cross-validation. Both optimization approaches tend to down-weight MMSE and Digit Symbol overall (Fig. 2) ; however, we see large range of weight values across the folds. All of the ranges include 25% (i.e., no optimization), except the range for MMSE weights in AIBL and PI-APOE (bottom left; Fig. 2 ) and the range for digit symbol weights in AIBL and PIprogression (top right; Fig. 2 ).

The pooled medians (51% with no optimization, 60% with logistic regression weights, and 58% with minimized d) suggest that, overall, there is no reliable improvement in power using the optimized composites."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We explore the out-of-sample performance of optimized composites and find there is no evidence to support their use for optimizing the PACC given the available data. Both MMSE and Digit Symbol were consistently down-weighted by optimization, suggesting they are contributing less to the composite performance. However, there was a wide range of optimized weights across crossvalidation folds (long vertical lines in Fig. 2) , indicating that the MMSE and digit symbol were valuable in some subsamples. Furthermore, down-weighting MMSE and digit symbol did not reliably improve composite performance (i.e., decrease the minimum detectable effect) in the validation sets (Fig. 3) . The MMSE has good face validity as a global assessment and has demonstrated sensitivity to preclinical decline [2] [3] [4] . Digit Symbol has good face validity as a measure of executive function that is associated with progression to dementia [19] and mortality risk [20] . It is possible that other larger data sets, perhaps with treatment effects, could inform a reliable optimization in the future. Based on available data, we do not find strong support for removing or downweighting MMSE or Digit Symbol. Our results are consistent with conclusions of Insel et al. [21] , who found that applying equal weights provided the greatest estimates of cross-validated power in an analysis of ADNI. They also found diminishing returns when considering composites with more components.\nWe applied two validation approaches, each with their own strengths and limitations. The external validation approach applied to existing data will always suffer from mismatches of populations or assessments between training and validation data sets. And attempting to collect new data is an expensive solution to this limitation. On the other hand, cross-validation is a mere simulation of real-world validation. Furthermore, the cross-validation subsamples may not be of sufficient size for training and/or validation steps. We argue that this sample size limitation is actually a limitation of optimization because optimization should not be attempted without robust validation.\nAlso, the optimization that we attempted must necessarily make assumptions about treatment response which are unsupported by the available natural history data. We and others (e.g., [6] ) have implicitly assumed that a treatment would have the same effect on each component. We and others have also implicitly assumed that each component is of equal clinical meaningfulness. And even if an optimization can be validated, the improvement in power comes at the price of simplicity and face validity. Therefore, optimization should only be considered if there is a convincing rationale and its efficiency gains can be validated.\nRamchandani et al. [22] discuss a global rank test approach and review-related literature on nonparametric global tests for multiple outcomes. Their proposed adaptive weighting method uses the actual clinical trial data to derive weights. Simulations suggest type-I error is maintained and \"power can improve significantly in settings with differing treatment effect sizes or moderate correlation between outcomes.\" However, the global test approach has some limitations in comparison to the likelihood-based approach in our setting, and so results might not be directly comparable. First, the global treatment effect is much more broad than typical MMRM estimand (i.e., ITT contrast at the final visit). The global test approach provides a measure of how many patients were \"better off\" in the active versus control group, but it does not provide an estimate of the degree to which they were better off (it is elementally trinary: better, worse, or equivocal) or when they were better off (certain time points could be prioritized, but other time points would have to break ties). This lack of specificity may be a concern to regulators, not to mention the lack of a prespecified outcome. Second, the global test approach does not accommodate covariates, which account for considerable variability in our setting, and render the Missing at Random assumption more plausible.
