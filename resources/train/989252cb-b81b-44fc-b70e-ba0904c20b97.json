[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The importance of academic achievement to adult functioning and adjustment is evident.\nChildren who fail to complete school work and homework are more likely to receive failing grades, be retained (Huffman, Mehlinger, & Kerivan, 2000) , and experience difficulties in their peer relationships (Wentzel & Caldwell, 1997) . This trajectory places them at greater risk for dropping out of school, later unemployment (Woodward & Fergusson, 2000) , psychopathology (Velez, Johnson, & Cohen, 1989) , substance use (Kasen, Cohen, & Brook, 1998; Wichstrom, 1998) , teenage pregnancies (Feldman, 1990) , and delinquent behavior (Yoshikawa, 1995) . By virtue of its potential impact, academic achievement clearly warrants careful study.\nNumerous studies have examined factors related to children's academic functioning. A key clinical contribution from this line of research is in the ability to identify and test the relationships of malleable environmental variables that influence academic functioning. Once these relationships are reliably established, the ability to improve children's academic functioning by changing an environmental variable becomes a viable goal. Variables identified as related to academic achievement include discipline methods and parenting style (Dornbusch, Ritter, Leiderman, Roberts, & Fraleigh, 1987) , homework behaviors and structure for learning (Toney, Kelley, & Lanclos, 2003; Miller & Kelley, 1991) ; parent involvement (HooverDempsey et al., 2001; Keith et al., 1998) , cognitive ability, (Cool & Keith, 1991; Neisser et al., 1996; Furnham, 1995) , marital discord (Demo & Acock, 1988; Unger, McLeod, Broan, & Tressell, 2000; Forehand et al., 1990) , psychopathology (Marmorstein & Iacono, 2004; Karustis, Power, Rescorla, Eiraldi, & Gallagher, 2000) , and socioeconomic status (SES) (Blair, Blair, & Madamba, 1999; Hill, 2001 ). Although cognitive ability and SES are not amenable to treatment, their consistently reported relationship to academic achievement necessitates their inclusion in studies that measure factors related to academic achievement.\nThe present study evaluates the relationship between family conflict and academic achievement, namely parent-child conflict. To date, studies have overwhelmingly defined family conflict as martial discord and/or divorce. Results of these studies have consistently shown that marital conflict and divorce are related to poorer academic outcomes for children. Unger et al., (2000) examined the relationship between marital conflict, family support and academic functioning of adolescents. Family support was conceptualized as perceived levels of cohesion (\"how close do you feel to the rest of your family\") and involvement (\"my mother watches me in sports or activities\"). Results showed that family support mediated the relation between marital conflict and academic achievement. Thus, the quality of the parent-child relationship was a better predictor of academic achievement than marital conflict.\nResearchers proposed that the mechanism by which marital discord and divorce impact academic achievement is through disruption of the parent-child relationship, such that families with high marital conflict, but supportive parent-child relationships do not show the same poor academic outcomes (Forehand et al., 1991; El-Sheikh & Elmore-Staton, 2004; Amato & Keith, 1991) . This implicates the parent-child relationship directly, rather than indirectly via measures of marital conflict. The association between parent-child relationships and academic achievement has been largely limited to studies that conceptualize the relationship via molar constructs such as parenting styles (authoritativeness, authoritarianism, and permissiveness) rather than molecular, behaviorally defined measures of the parent-child relationship (such as the number of times parents and children discuss various topics, and the intensity of the discussions).\nUnfortunately, studies that have examined the parent-child relationship have often used inadequate methodology (e.g., failing to include a measure of cognitive ability; a factor known to have a strong relationship with academic achievement).\nThe purpose of this study is to determine whether findings similar to those of Unger et al., (2000) will hold when examining conflict levels within the parent-child relationship, rather than assessing global traits such as cohesion, while controlling for adolescent cognitive ability.\nThe previously mentioned factors of SES and homework behaviors will also be examined in the analysis of parent-adolescent conflict and academic achievement.\nA review on adolescence and parent-adolescent relationships are presented, followed by a literature review of family conflict. Factors that have been previously studied regarding academic achievement will also be reviewed (specifically, parental style and parental involvement). Measurement issues regarding rater differences between parent-and adolescentreport of relationship characteristics are discussed. Lastly, factors associated with academic achievement, namely, homework behaviors, cognitive ability and SES, are reviewed."}, {"section_title": "Adolescence and Parent-Adolescent Relationships", "text": "Adolescence is a unique period of transition marked by both physical and psychosocial changes. Individuals in this developmental stage undergo dramatic pubertal changes and are capable of increasingly abstract and complex reasoning. Family relationships are also altered as the process of differentiation begins to take place. This is a time when adolescents rely more on peers, seek increased independence, and are less willing to see themselves as part of a hierarchy that is headed by their parents (Fuligni & Eccles, 1993; Collins & Repinski, 1994) . As a result, the parent-adolescent relationship experiences increased conflict and decreased closeness (Steinberg & Morris, 2001 ). However, a decrease in closeness does not relegate the parentadolescent relationship to one without importance. Noller (1994) found that family relationships remain important throughout adolescence. In families where relationships are seriously attenuated, however, peer influence surges and adolescents are at greater risk for adjustment problems (Fuligni & Eccles, 1993; Sheppard, Wright, & Goodstadt, 1985) .\nPsychologists during the first half of the twentieth century viewed significant conflict in adolescence as a vital component to healthy development (referred to as the \"storm and stress\" of adolescence) (Peterson & Leigh, 1990) . In fact, adolescents who did not exhibit high levels of conflict with their parents were feared to suffer from stunted development. However, since then, evidence has shown that levels of conflict vary considerably and high levels are not necessarily seen as optimal (Montemayor, 1986) . Although conflict is still considered to be a normal part of adolescent relationships, higher levels of intensity are associated with hostility and the limited potential for future positive interactions (Patterson, 1986; Montemayor, 1986; Laursen, 1995) .\nFrequency of conflict has been shown to vary across the stages of adolescence (early adolescence ages 10-12; mid adolescence ages 13-16; and late adolescence ages 17-22).\nResearchers have shown that the number of conflicts peak in early adolescence and taper off by mid-late adolescence (Allison & Schultz, 2004; Steinberg & Morris, 2001; Montemayor, 1986) . Laursen, Coy, & Collins, (1998) found that parent-adolescent conflict frequency rates decrease linearly with age, while conflict intensity increases.\nChanges in the frequency and intensity of conflict may be topic-dependent. Smetana, Daddis, and Chuang (2003) found that intensity levels of conflict varied across time depending on the topic: conflict over homework increased over time, while conflict over chores decreased from early to middle adolescence. Sons and daughters report more conflict with their mothers than their fathers, and daughters report more intense conflict than sons (Allison & Schultz, 2004) . Topics of conflict between parents and adolescents tend to revolve around issues of daily living, such as chores, hygiene, and homework, rather than issues such as smoking, alcohol, and sex (Smetana, 1988; Laursen, Coy, & Collins, 1998; Noller, 1994) ."}, {"section_title": "Family Conflict and Divorce", "text": "As previously noted, much research has been done regarding the impact of family conflict on children's interpersonal, social and academic adjustment. Children in families with high levels of conflict are at greater risk for internalizing, externalizing, academic, and social competency problems (O'Keefe, 1994) . The finding that children living in families with higher rates of marital conflict perform more poorly academically than peers living in families with little or no marital conflict, has been well supported in the literature (e.g., Unger et al., 2000; Neighbors, & Forehand, 1992; Rodgers & Rose, 2001; Amato & Keith, 1991) . Studying children's responses to marital conflict can be useful as a basis for understanding the effects of conflict between parents and adolescents. Smith, Berthelsen, and O'Connor (1997) examined the impact of marital conflict and violence on child adjustment. Child adjustment (as measured with the Child Behavior Checklist) was associated not with parenting discipline practices nor consistency, but with the amount of conflict to which children were exposed, how the children responded in the face of conflict, and whether they imitated the maladaptive behaviors they observed. Rodgers and Rose (2001) found that adolescents in divorced families do not perform as well academically as their peers in never-divorced two-parent families and that school attachment was a stronger predictor of academic achievement for children in divorced families, than for children in two-parent families. Forehand, et al. (1990) looked at interparental conflict, parent visitation, and adolescent cognitive competence among divorced families. They found that adolescents' cognitive competence, as rated by a teacher, decreased when interparental conflict was high, and that frequent parent visitation served as a protective factor. This lends support to the idea that the parent-child relationship may have a more direct bearing on child outcomes than interparental conflict per se. Amato and Keith (1991) conducted a meta-analysis of parental divorce and child adjustment. They considered the following three perspectives as to why children from divorced families have more adjustment problems: parental absence, economic disadvantage, and family conflict. The parental absence perspective posits that difficulties are due to having only one parent. This perspective does not consider the reasons why one parent is absent, thus, children who have lost a parent due to death are considered to be at the same disadvantage as children who have lost a parent due to divorce. The economic disadvantage perspective says that it is not the family structure that matters, but the level of economic resources a family has. Lastly, the family conflict perspective states that rather than being due to family structure or lack of resources, it is the level of family conflict that best explains child adjustment and well-being.\nResults indicate that the family conflict perspective has the strongest empirical support, followed by the economic disadvantage perspective, which has modest support, and lastly, the parental absence perspective, which has only minimal support. The authors conclude that all perspectives contribute to the understanding of family factors and child well-being, however, family conflict was most consistently associated with child adjustment (Amato & Keith, 1991) . Although this study conceptualized family conflict as parental discord, it noted that parental discord results in deterioration of the parent-child relationship.\nA study that compared the effects of marital conflict and parent-child conflict separately was conducted by El-Sheik and Elmore-Staton (2004) . They found that after accounting for marital conflict, parent-child conflict predicted additional unique variance of child externalizing disorders.\nSeveral theories have been proposed to explain the impact of marital conflict on child adjustment. Social learning theory posits that child adjustment problems directly result from witnessing poor parental conflict resolution skills. Thus, children learn to model the dysfunctional behavior they observe. Family systems theory asserts that marital conflict indirectly results in adjustment problems by disrupting family functioning and taking the parents' focus away from the child (Robin & Foster, 1989; Smith et al., 1997) . This disruption to the parent-child relationship interferes with the parents ability to attend to their child's needs and results in poor parental effectiveness and consistency (Patterson, 1982) .\nIt is important to note that not all children in high-conflict families develop problematic outcomes. It has been found that when there is marital conflict, the presence of a supportive parent-child relationship is a buffer for maladaptive outcomes (Forehand et al., 1991) . For example, supportive parent-child relationships have been shown to buffer the negative effects of poverty and homelessness on children's academic achievement (Miliotis, Sesma, & Masten, 1999) .\nAlthough positive parent-child relationships can buffer the negative effects of marital conflict, negative parent-child relationships can also be influential. Crosnoe and Elder (2004) considered the impact of peer and teacher relationships on academic competence as compared to the influence of the parent-adolescent relationship. They found that even when there were positive peer and teacher relationships present, poor parent-adolescent relationships remained a significant risk factor for academic difficulties."}, {"section_title": "Parenting Style and Parental Involvement", "text": "Studies that have considered the effects of the parent-adolescent relationship on academic outcomes, have overwhelmingly conceptualized the quality of the relationship via parenting styles, such as authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and indulgent (e.g., Bean, Bush, McKenry, & Wilson, 2003; Dornbusch, Ritter, & Leiderman, 1987) .\nParenting Styles are typically defined along three dimensions: behavioral control (e.g., monitoring), psychological control (e.g., intrusiveness, demandingness), and parental support (e.g., warmth, acceptance, responsiveness) (Baumrind, 1966; Bean, et al., 2003) . The global nature of these constructs have been criticized by behaviorally-oriented researchers who point out the lack of observable, behaviorally-based definitions (Shek, Chan, & Lee, 1997) .\nFew studies have incorporated both a global measure of parenting as well as specific parenting behaviors. One study that included both types of parenting measures (Shek, Chan, & Lee, 1997) examined the relationship between global and specific measures of parenting practices and adolescent adjustment in a sample of Chinese students with low academic achievement. Results revealed that both types of measures (i.e., measures of parenting style and measures of specific practices) were correlated with adolescent adjustment.\nParental involvement is also a commonly assessed measure of parental influence. This construct, while not receiving the same criticism from behavioral researchers, has been given inconsistent definitions and has been measured in numerous ways. As a result, the literature regarding parental involvement have yielded contradictory findings (Hoover-Dempsey et al., 2001; Unger, et al., 2000) . Studies that have found a positive relationships between parental involvement and academic achievement include Keith (1991) and Steinberg, Brown, and Dornbusch, (1996) , whereas studies reporting a negative association or the lack of an association include Singh et al., (1995) and Watt, Moorehead-Slaughter, Japzon, and Keller, (1990) .\nThe negative association found by Singh et al., (1995) relates to one of four parental involvement components that were researched using the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988. The four components are parental aspirations for the child's education, parent-child communication about school, home structure, and parent participation in school activities. The only component to have a positive effect on academic achievement was parental aspiration.\nParent-child communication and parent participation in school had no effect on achievement.\nHome structure had a counter-intuitively small negative effect on achievement. The authors address the difficulties in defining and measuring these components of parental involvement. Cooper, Lindsay, and Nye (2000) investigated several studies on parental involvement and found that many studies lacked adequate methodology, e.g., relying on only one question to assess involvement. Further contributing to the inconsistent findings are the various definitions of involvement (ranging from quantitative to qualitative aspects) and the varying breadth of the context of involvement (restricted to one domain, such as school activities, or broadened to include multiple domains) (Cooper, Lindsay, & Nye, 2000) .\nResearch has shown no clear method that is preferred when studying this construct. The present study will measure parental involvement indirectly via parent and adolescent reports of conflict and frequencies of discussions which include questions about the strength of the relationship (similar to the notion of support), quality (e.g., parental warmth), and frequency of discussions."}, {"section_title": "Assessment of Parent-Adolescent Conflict", "text": "A difficulty in assessing parent-adolescent conflict is that parents and adolescents often do not agree (Steinberg, 2001; Pelton & Forehand, 2001; Gonzales, Cauce, & Mason, 1996) .\nAdolescents tend to rate family functioning as more negative (less cohesive, less adaptable) than their parents (Noller, 1994) . In a study comparing ratings of one's own video-taped family interaction with ratings of another family, families tend to rate their own family more positively than the other family. However, this is not true when looking specifically at adolescent ratings.\nIn this study, adolescents rated their own family in a similar fashion to how an \"outsider\" rated them. This means that even though families tend to rate themselves more positively than another family, adolescents do not. This may be seen as lending support to the notion that adolescents' negative views are the result of having adopted a more objective, outsider's perspective of their own family (Noller, 1994) .\nSeveral studies indicate that adolescent ratings are more strongly associated with adolescent outcomes than parent ratings (e.g., Kramer et al., 2004; Repinski & Shonk, 2002; Gonzales, et al., 1996) . Yet, despite identifying adolescents' ratings as more objective, there are data that contradict this. In a study comparing families that were referred to a clinic for relationship problems and families who were not referred, Noller and Callan (1990) found that parents in non-clinic families rated their families more positively than parents in clinic families, but adolescent ratings in both groups did not show a similar pattern. Both groups of adolescents rated their families in a similar negative fashion. Because it is more likely that family functioning differs between families that are seeking clinical intervention and those that are not, this supports the notion that parents are more sensitive and accurate reporters of family functioning than adolescents (Noller & Callan, 1990 ). The present study will examine whether adolescent-report, parent-report, or the combined average of the two are more highly correlated with adolescent academic achievement."}, {"section_title": "Homework Behaviors", "text": "Homework is a common demand of most adolescents, and in some cases it is the source of conflict with parents. There is a wide variation to parental involvement in homework, depending on characteristics of the adolescent (age, learning difficulties, cognitive abilities) and characteristics of the parent (personality, attitudes about homework, own academic ability, time, and resources).\nThe advantages and disadvantages of assigning homework have been debated by parents and educators. Opinions that homework is critical are countered with opinions that it is a waste of time, a hindrance, and that it allows children to practice mistakes (Keith, DiamondHallam, & Fine, 2004; Walberg, Paschal, & Weinstein, 1985) .\nA meta-analysis of 15 carefully selected studies on the effects of homework revealed that homework has large and consistent positive affects on children's academic achievement (Walberg, Paschal, & Weinstein, 1985) . Improvements in children's achievement were noted even when teachers assigned homework and did not give any feedback or grade, however, graded work resulted in higher achievement gains than ungraded work. The effects of homework on achievement are evident in several subject areas (particularly reading and social studies) and across lower and middle socioeconomic groups. Tymms and Fitz-Gibbon (1992) found that after controlling for ability and prior achievement, homework had a positive influence on current achievement. However, the benefit of working several more hours per week was minimal. Cooper (1989) reported that positive homework effects were not evident in elementary school, but were increasingly evident in middle and high school.\nNot all studies concur. Out of 20 studies that experimentally manipulated the presence of homework, 6 did not show a positive relationship between homework and achievement (Cooper, 1989) . Further, the effects of homework may be curriculum and difficulty-dependent. Cool and Keith (1991) found that homework had less influence on achievement for students who were taking less demanding courses, whereas for those taking more demanding courses, the effects of homework increased. Location may even play a role. Keith, et al., (2004) compared the effects of completing homework in class versus out of school. Homework that was completed in school had no effect on grades, whereas homework completed out of school had a substantial impact.\nBecause it is typically done in the home, homework may have a larger impact on the parent-child relationship than other academic skills such as test-taking strategies. Homework behaviors are an important measure of academic skill and may have implications for parent-adolescent conflict.\nTo assess academic skill, including homework, the present study will use the Homework Problems Checklist (e.g., \"complains about homework... fails to bring home materials\") as reported by parents and the broader measure of academic skill (the Diagnostic Checklist of School Success, DCSS). The DCSS has four sections: homework, organization, test preparation and test taking, and reading comprehension."}, {"section_title": "Cognitive Ability and Socioeconomic Status", "text": "Unfortunately, most studies that have investigated academic achievement, have neglected to include well-standardized and reliable measure of cognitive ability. Without a valid measure of cognitive ability, great caution must be used when interpreting results with respect to academic achievement. In an effort to increase interpretability of results, the present study will include the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI), an abbreviated measure of cognitive ability that has been deemed both highly reliable and valid (Keith, 2000; Stano, 2004 ).\nOne's access to resources has clear implications for many outcomes, including academic achievement. Parents in low-income communities are less engaged with homework, less likely to attend events at school, and are more likely to defer to teacher opinion (Drummond & Stipek, 2004 ). Ginsburg and Bronstein (1993) reported that socioeconomic status (SES) accounted for a substantial portion of the variance in children's academic performance. DeGarmo, Forgatch, and Martinez (1999) found SES to be significantly related to parenting practices which had direct affects on achievement.\nEffects due to SES do not always remain when other variables are considered. Mulkey, Crain, and Harrington, (1992) found that the effects on academic achievement due to SES, parental absence, and parent education level were reduced to zero once the behavioral variables were controlled (i.e., school absence, homework behaviors, lack of contact with non-custodial parent, and frequent dating).\nBecause SES has been consistently shown to have an impact on academic achievement, the present study will limit participant recruitment to lower income families in order to experimentally control for this variable. One benefit to recruiting with individuals from low-income families is that traditionally, these individuals have not been well represented in psychological research. However, in so doing, the external validity of the study is reduced."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Academic achievement is an important predictor of adjustment and has been associated with several factors such as parenting styles, parental involvement, family conflict, homework behaviors, cognitive ability and SES. The relationship between family conflict and children's academic achievement has been well established and largely limited to marital conflict. For example, children of divorced parents tend to perform more poorly and have lower grades than children living in never divorced, two-parent families (Unger et al., 2000) . Amato and Keith (1991) examined three alternative hypotheses of divorced families to determine which was most consistently associated with child and adolescent functioning: family structure (one vs. twoparent homes); family resources; and family conflict. They found the strongest and most consistent support for the family conflict perspective. The family conflict perspective states that it is the level of conflict in the home (not the family structure or amount of resources) that best predicts child outcomes. Although family conflict is often defined as marital conflict, conflict between parents has been shown to result in the deterioration of the parent-child relationship.\nEvidence exists for both positive and negative effects of the association between parentchild relationships and child adjustment. Positive parent-child relationships may act as buffers to marital conflict (Forehand, et al., 1991 ) whereas negative parent-child relationships can serve as significant risk factors despite the presence of other positive relationships (i.e., relationships with peer and teachers) (Crosnoe & Elder, 2004) .\nChallenges exist when trying to measure parent-adolescent conflict because parents and adolescents often do not agree. There is conflicting evidence as to whose perspective is best to use when studying conflict levels in parent-adolescent relationships (e.g., Gonzales, et al., 1996) .\nThe present study will consider whether a primary rater or an average of the two raters is more strongly correlated with adolescent academic achievement.\nCognitive ability is a key variable for studies about academic achievement.\nUnfortunately, its assessment has been largely absent or done using tests with unknown or low validity. Socioeconomic status is another important factor to consider when examining academic achievement. Studies have found that children from lower SES families are more likely to perform poorly on an achievement test. However, some studies have found that these effects are attenuated when behavioral factors are considered (Mulkey, et al., 1992) ."}, {"section_title": "Purpose", "text": "In response to the lack of research addressing the direct effects of parent-adolescent conflict on adolescent academic achievement, the purpose of this study is to (1) Determine whether adolescent-report is more strongly associated with academic achievement than parentreport of parent-adolescent conflict; (2) Determine the relationship between parent-adolescent conflict and academic achievement controlling for homework behaviors and cognitive ability; (3) Determine whether homework behaviors moderate the relationship between parent-adolescent conflict and academic achievement."}, {"section_title": "Research Hypotheses", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "1.", "text": "Hypothesis: It is predicted that adolescent-report of parent-adolescent conflict will have a higher correlation with academic achievement than parent-report of parent-adolescent conflict."}, {"section_title": "2.", "text": "Hypothesis: It is predicted that parent-adolescent conflict will have a significantly negative effect on the prediction of academic achievement once cognitive ability and homework behaviors are accounted for."}, {"section_title": "3.", "text": "Hypothesis: It is predicted that homework behaviors will moderate the relationship between parent-adolescent conflict and academic achievement.

The correlation matrix is presented in Table 2 Table 2 Cognitive ability was entered on the first step, followed by homework problems on the second step, and finally the average scores of the Issues Checklist and the Conflict Behavior\nQuestionnaire on the third step. Results indicate that parent-adolescent conflict does not explain significantly more variance of academic achievement and therefore does not add to the model.\nResults from this regression are presented in Table 3 . The final research question predicted that parent-adolescent conflict would moderate the relationship between homework problems and academic achievement. To test this hypothesis, the two conflict questionnaires were analyzed separately. For each regression, cognitive ability was entered on the first step and the Homework Problems Checklist was entered on the second step. On the third step the average parent-adolescent conflict score was entered on two separate analyses. The second analysis included the interaction term of the Homework Problems Checklist and the average Conflict Behavior Questionnaire term. When considering the Conflict Behavior Questionnaire, the interaction term is not significant at the p<.01 or p<.05 levels (p=.08). The Conflict Behavior Questionnaire, when the interaction term is included (see Table   5 , Step 3), it explains significantly more variance (p<.05). The Homework Problems Checklist remained a significant predictor when the interaction term was included in the model (p<.01). Tables 4 and 5 show the results for the Conflict Behavior Questionnaire and Tables 6 and 7 show results for the Issues Checklist. Table 5 illustrates the effect of the Conflict Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ) on the Homework Problems Checklist (HPC). If the CBQ increases by 1 point, there is a direct effect of -.89 points on the WIAT. However, there is a moderating effect of CBQ on the HPC. When the CBQ score increases by one point, the WIAT score will increase by .04 points. Figure 2 shows the graphical representation of the interaction between homework problems and the Conflict Behavior Questionnaire as they relate to academic achievement (after accounting for cognitive abilities).\nThe Issues Checklist was entered alone (Table 6 ) and with the Homework Problems Checklist interaction term (Table 7) . When the interaction term is added to the model, it significantly predicts academic achievement (p<.05), whereas the Issues Checklist alone remains non-significant. Support for the hypothesis that adolescent report of parent-adolescent conflict would be more highly correlated with academic achievement than parent report was not found. In the absence of empirical evidence to determine which rater to use (parent or adolescent), the average scores of parent and adolescent report were used for analyses."}, {"section_title": "Conflict as a Predictor of Academic Achievement", "text": "Parent-adolescent conflict, as measured by the Conflict Behavior Questionnaire and the Issues Checklist did not significantly predict more variance once cognitive abilities and homework problems were accounted for. Thus, this study found no support for the role of a linear function of parent-adolescent conflict in understanding factors that influence adolescent's academic achievement."}, {"section_title": "Moderating Effects of Conflict on Homework Problems", "text": "The final hypothesis predicted that parent-adolescent conflict would moderate the relationship between homework skills and academic achievement. This hypothesis was statistically significant for the Issues Checklist measure of conflict, however, the direction of the relationship was unexpected. Rather than a cumulative negative effect when children have both homework problems and high parent-adolescent conflict, the results of this study suggest that adolescents in this situation perform better on an academic achievement test as compared to adolescents who either have homework problems without conflict, or conflict without homework problems.\nThere are two possible alternatives: either the results are spurious due to peculiarities of the sample, or the sample is an adequate representation of middle school-aged adolescents from low-income households. If the latter is true, it is possible that when children are struggling with homework, it may be constructive for parents to be involved, even if it leads to conflict.\nAccording to these results, children with low levels of homework problems but high levels of conflict perform more poorly on an academic achievement test than children with high levels of homework problems and high levels of conflict. It is possible that the nature of conflict varies significantly in these two situations. In the former situation, rather than being directed toward a practical problem, such as homework difficulties, conflict may be more diffuse, less constructive and possibly more detrimental than in the latter situation. More research is certainly needed to determine whether the nature of conflict (that is, the presence or absence of a practical problem where parents are more likely to take an active role) is an important distinction when considering its impact on adolescents' academic achievement."}, {"section_title": "Post Hoc Analyses", "text": "Post hoc analyses were conducted to determine whether the moderation model was significant when considering subscales of achievement (reading, arithmetic, and spelling).\nResults reveal that the parent-adolescent conflict moderated the relationship between homework problems and reading, but did not significantly moderate the relationship between homework problems and arithmetic or spelling."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and Limitations of the Study", "text": "Strengths of this study are its use of well-standardized cognitive and achievement measures. Limitations are its small sample size, its restriction to low-income households (which limits its generalizability) and its reliance on parent and adolescent self-report of parentadolescent conflict. Although statistically significant results were obtained with the moderation model, it is important to consider the clinical significance of the findings. Academic skills, as presently measured by the Homework Problems Checklist, are seen as an important contributor to academic achievement. In the present study, this variable explained an additional 5% of the variance after accounting for cognitive ability, whereas parent-adolescent conflict (as measured by the Issues Checklist) explained an additional 4% of the variance (the reader is referred to Table 7 ). These figures may be too small to conclude that the results were clinically significant.\nReplicability of findings is an important tool to determine whether results from one study generalize to other populations or if they are spurious. Improvements to future study about parent-adolescent conflict and academic achievement would be to increase the number of participants, recruit participants from a more heterogeneous sample, and include an observational method of measuring parent-adolescent conflict. (Although, it can be argued that one's perceptions of conflict are more salient and relevant to adjustment than observational data, the use of third party observation in addition to parent and adolescent report is more likely to yield a more robust measure of conflict.) With respect to the findings, it would be helpful for future studies to include more direct measures of parental involvement per se in order to determine whether these results are in fact related to involvement, conflict, both, or some other mechanism.\nPrevious research has found high levels of intensity to be associated with hostility and the limited potential for future positive interactions (Patterson, 1986; Montemayor, 1986; Laursen, 1995 ). Yet it is not well understand what is meant by \"high levels\" of conflict intensity. Further study is needed to clarify and define levels of intensity among adolescents that are adaptive and maladaptive, respectively."}]
