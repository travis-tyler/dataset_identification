[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "NASA's Applied Sciences Program (ASP) expands NASA's current Earth Science capabilities by conducting scientifi cally rigorous and technologically advanced projects that respond to critical societal needs and concerns. Leveraging all the assets of NASA's Earth Science Division, ASP works with end-users and/or operational partners to use NASA Earth Science observations and research results for practical applications. The Stennis Space Center (SSC) Applied Science and Technology Project Offi ce (ASTPO) is a part of the NASA Applied Sciences Program. ASTPO's mission is to demonstrate the utility of NASA Earth Science data, models, tools, and techniques, and to transfer the results of NASA's Earth Science research projects from the laboratory into the real world. The inclusion of end-users within project development enables ASTPO to demonstrate how Earth science assets can address societal issues. In part due to the devastation caused by hurricanes Katrina (August 2005) and Rita (September 2005), ASTPO has focused its expertise in remote sensing, image processing and analysis, oceanography, time-series analysis, land use/land cover (LULC) monitoring, and GIS product development on Gulf of Mexico applications of NASA science data and models. To ensure that the Gulf of Mexico community issues were accurately and appropriately identifi ed, ASTPO worked closely with the Gulf of Mexico Alliance (GOMA) and the Gulf of Mexico Research Priorities Planning effort of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Sea Grant program. GOMA is an effective regional partnership of the fi ve U.S. Gulf States (Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas) and 13 federal agencies, including NASA. GOMA is in part the result of guidance within the 2004 U.S. Ocean Action Plan to strengthen regional collaboration within the Gulf of Mexico. Formed in the midst of several damaging Gulf of Mexico hurricanes, GOMA is also an interagency consortium for supporting resiliency and recovery of Gulf communities. ASTPO also participated in several Gulf of Mexico Research Priorities (GMRP) planning workshops that were sponsored by NOAA Sea Grant and created in response to the 2007 Ocean Research Priorities Plan of the Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology. By participating in these workshops, ASTPO received signifi cant public content related to end-user and community research needs. ASTPO's participation in both the GOMA Federal workgroup and GMRP workshops provided valuable perspective and insight into key areas where NASA's Earth science assets might contribute to water quality, nutrient sources and transport, regional sediment management, and coastal ecosystem resilience. ASTPO's expertise in remote sensing of coastal land and water patterns and processes, as well as its multidisciplinary personnel specializing in the majority of ASP program elements, are critical components that enable successful implementation of projects in areas relevant to GOMA and other Gulf of Mexico partnerships. The next section highlights how ASTPO is using NASA assets to"}, {"section_title": "Land-use and Land-cover Change Detection in Mobile Bay, Alabama", "text": "The Mobile Bay National Estuary Program (MBNEP) provides stewardship for the Mobile Bay estuarine system, including wetland areas surrounding the Bay, waters extending from the Mississippi Sound westward to the Alabama-Mississippi state line, and Gulf of Mexico waters protected by the State of Alabama. The Mobile Bay estuarine system contains ecologically sensitive and economically important environments that provide habitats for many coastal wildlife species and serve as breeding grounds for commercially important fi sh species. Habitat mapping and environmental monitoring are essential to understanding changes that can affect sensitive estuary environments. Diurnal tide effects on hydrology, nutrient fl ux from the surrounding watershed, industrial effl uent, and increased dredging and sedimentation are several factors that may result in highly variable estuarine conditions. Estuarine alteration, whether natural or manmade, can be linked to substantial LULC changes that can be diffi cult to monitor, particularly when gradual annual changes are considered cumulatively. Satellite data can provide a snapshot physical record of the spatial and temporal patterns and processes that can dramatically convey how profound changes occur to the landscape. Land cover analysis based upon remotely sensed data from the Landsat satellites provides one of the most extensive and continuous digital, terrestrial imagery archives. The spatio-temporal information provided by these data often illustrates where patch-level changes have occurred and provides the basis for understanding changes from a historical perspective. Integration of LULC change maps with other types of data often enables the context of changes to be assessed. Prior to this project, the MBNEP did not have this type of information. ASTPO and the MBNEP defi ned a pilot project that would provide the following information desired by the MBNEP: a series of maps that indicate the long-term LULC changes around Mobile Bay, especially those changes that result from storms and urban encroachment. Landsat images for years 1974, 1979, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2001, 2005, and 2008 were obtained and processed to derive unique, multi-decadal time-series of coastal LULC products to assist MBNEP with assessment of coastal change, especially as a result from storms and urban encroachment. To study changes occurring after Hurricanes Frederic (September 1979) Inventory, 1979Inventory, , 1988Inventory, , and 2002National Land Cover Database, 1992 and2002;and Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP), 1996, 2001, and 2005. The following classifi cations, as specifi ed by the MBNEP, for LULC products were used: open water, barren, upland herbaceous, non-woody wetlands, upland forest, and urban. The resulting products could be directly compared to C-CAP products. ASTPO calculated the areal extent of each class for the Mobile Bay region and determined change detection statistics for the periods of 1974-1979, 1974-1984, 1974-1988, 1974-1992, 1974-1996, 1974-2001, 1974-2005, 1984-1996, and 1996-2008. The accuracies of LULC maps, delineated areas of particular interest to the MBNEP, were assessed and the extent of each land class was calculated. Map products highlighted the decadal-scale (1974-1984, 1984-1996, and 1996-2008) changes for the urban land-use class. ASTPO also used example Landsat products from this project to quantify and assess trends in LULC change from 1974 to present (Figure 1). A unique aspect of this project is the application of data from multiple Landsat sensors to derive a time-series product that encompasses the entire Landsat era."}, {"section_title": "Harmful Algal Bloom Forecasting", "text": "Over the past two decades, HABs have caused an estimated $1 billion in damage worldwide. The 2004 Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research Amendments Act (Public Law 108-456) seeks to enhance our ability to detect, assess, predict, control, and mitigate HAB events and expands NOAA's mandate to monitor and predict bloom events. Almost every U.S. coastal state has identifi ed HAB occurrence as a critical threat to water quality. Additionally, public health issues arise from HAB events in recreational waters, as the toxins produced by these algal species cause fi nfi sh and shellfi sh poisoning and marine animal mortality. The monitoring and forecasting of HABs underscores numerous actions within the GOMA Governors' Action Plan. In the 2006 GOMA Governors' Action Plan for Healthy and Resilient Coasts, the Gulf States of both the United States and Mexico cite the need for enhanced technology and decision-making capabilities for the identifi cation, monitoring, and forecasting of HABs and for better understanding of the public health and socioeconomic effects of bloom events. ASTPO leveraged the results of a competitively selected cooperative agreement between NASA, Naval Research Laboratory at Stennis Space Center (NRL-SSC), and Applied Coherent Technology (ACT), Inc., to assist GOMA with several water-quality actions related to HAB monitoring and forecasting. From 2003 to 2008, NASA, NRL-SSC, and ACT worked with NOAA to validate the use of satellite observations, Earth science models, and data fusion techniques for coastal applications and for transition to NOAA operational HAB monitoring and forecasting. Enhanced Earth science products (e.g., chlorophyll advection products) were provided to NOAA, and subsequently to GOMA state entities, for enhanced performance (accuracy, early detection, and tracking) and improved geographic coverage of the operational HAB Forecasting System. Ocean color and sea surface temperature (SST) products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on the Terra and Aqua satellites, wind fi elds from QuikSCAT, and the Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM) were used to derive blended geophysical data products ( Figure 2). Using the results from this cooperative agreement, NASA supported GOMA actions to improve the HAB forecasting system for southwest Florida, to advance technologies for enhanced real-time remote sensing of HABs, to implement a HAB forecasting capability for the southern coast of Texas, and to develop a satellite detection and internet-based notifi cation system for Karenia brevis (\"red tide\") occurrence within coastal waters of the Mexican State of Veracruz. The transition of data processing techniques and algorithms from this project to NOAA ultimately aids NOAA HAB forecasting efforts for other U.S. coastal regions."}, {"section_title": "Regional Sediment Management in the Gulf of Mexico", "text": "Regional Sediment Management (RSM) is a holistic approach that takes into account environmental impacts (from watershed to sea), human activities, and stewardship of natural resources for best practices of sediment management. RSM considers both positive and negative consequences of sediment transport to ensure that water resource projects can begin and continue in an economically and environmentally sensible manner. Sediment deposition contributes to processes such as marsh creation, coastal accretion, and shoaling of shipping channels. Suspended sediments create turbidity, which in turn keeps light from reaching submerged aquatic vegetation. Sediment loads can also carry substances such as dissolved and particulate organic and inorganic matter, including pesticides, pathogens, metals, and nutrients. The extent and direction of the sediment plume is indicative of where these materials may settle or spread. Therefore, knowledge of transported sediment loads at both the local and regional scales is important for coastal planning, ecological forecasting, water and disaster management, and public health. RSM focuses on understanding the environmental forcings, whether natural or manmade, that can af- Figure 1. LCLU Mobile Bay, Alabama -Examples of the Landsat-derived LULC data products for the Mobile, Alabama, two-county region for 1974 (A) and 2008 (B). In the region shown, the satellite-based estimates indicate that during the 34-year study period, urban areas increased from 80,972 to 128,662 acres, representing a 58.9% increase, or 1.73% per annum. continued on page 1452 fect the erosion, removal, transport, and/or deposition of sediment. For successful water management, sediment loading issues must be resolved at both the local and regional scales. Resource managers need relevant information to deal with regional sediment sources and to make environmentally sound decisions concerning transported sediments. Developing methods to use existing technologies for assessment of regional consequences associated with local sediment management actions and activities is a continual challenge in RSM projects. Accordingly, several GOMA actions focus on the development of effective RSM for Gulf of Mexico estuaries and waterways and on the implementation of advanced technology for RSM. The primary remote sensing instrument used for RSM is MODIS; however, MODIS is nearing the end of its operational life and will be replaced with the Visible/Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). Nevertheless, VIIRS is not a direct replacement for MODIS, and questions regarding its suitability for many oceanographic applications are still a matter of concern. To assist with this issue, NASA evaluated the use of the future sensor, VIIRS, for monitoring RSM in the Gulf of Mexico region. Collaborating with Mississippi State University (MSU) and Dauphin Island Sea Laboratory (DISL), ASTPO used MODIS data to simulate VIIRS data and also combined MODIS data with empirical models and in situ suspended sediment concentrations from Mobile Bay, Alabama. MSU collected in situ data in Mobile Bay, Alabama. DISL analyzed these samples and provided historical data. ASTPO used these collective datasets, empirical models, and MODIS data to simulate VIIRS data products that might be used to support RSM efforts. The resulting products were used to qualitatively and quantitatively simulate and evaluate morphological changes that occurred between data collections. The team developed techniques to detect, map, and track the suspended sediments and their resultant effects within the Gulf of Mexico (Figure  3). Results from this feasibility study show that MODIS data products coupled with in situ data may be used to generate simulated VIIRS data products for enhanced decision making in regional sediment and water quality management."}, {"section_title": "Monitoring Coastal Forest Conditions with NASA Satellite Data", "text": "Coastal forests provide vital environmental and economic benefi ts to the Gulf of Mexico region, manifested in a wide range of habitat types and ecosystems. Precipitation, soil type and moisture, proximity to a river drainage, exposure to salt spray, and disturbance/disaster events greatly affect coastal forest composition and structure. Additionally, coastal forests are often exposed to environmental threats from multiple anthropogenic, abiotic, and biotic sources. Information on coastal forest change is important for addressing many Gulf of Mexico issues, such as coastal community resiliency, wetland restoration, habitat identifi cation and characterization, and water quality. The monitoring of coastal forest health indicators (e.g., forest canopy greenness) is useful for characterizing and assessing status and trends in forest condition indicators. Forest managers can use this information for better management practices and for assessment of environmental threats on forest health and associated coastal ecosystems. The use of remote sensing can aid regional evaluations of coastal forest health change, especially after a damaging event, such as a major hurricane. Managers may integrate this information into an increasingly accurate representational landscape for modeling disturbances and may improve their understanding of the spatial variability in potential forest responses to environmental impacts. ASTPO developed a pilot project focused on regional to site-specifi c monitoring of forest damage from hurricanes. Coastal forests in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida suffered damage from major hurricanes in 2004 and 2005. Some of the impacts were Figure 2. HAB Monitoring -Chlorophyll advection product for HAB tracking on the Florida coast. The project team of NASA, NRL-SSC, and ACT obtained current speeds from 12-and 24-hour NCOM forecasts and linked this information with temporal composites of MODIS chlorophyll products to derive a chlorophyll advection product. Once a HAB has been identifi ed by anomalous satellite chlorophyll values and verifi ed by fi eld measurement, coastal managers must closely track HAB transport so that timely warnings can be issued for beaches and shellfi sh beds.

Because of its large swath, MODIS data are particularly useful for assessing coastal forest damage across an entire hurricane impact zone. At more local scales, Landsat data are viable for assessing forest damage and recovery. Additionally, improved coastal forest monitoring datasets are essential in documenting changes in conditions of specifi c coastal forest types occurring in the Gulf of Mexico. For example, baldcypress forest stands are common in the coastal wetlands along the Gulf of Mexico. In coastal Louisiana, this type of forest stand is increasingly susceptible to threats associated with altered hydrology, persistent fl ooding, salt water intrusion, insect-induced forest defoliation, erosion, and non-sustainable timber harvesting practices. The use of Landsat data for mapping of baldcypress forest stand type and condition provides increased monitoring capability and enhances existing, outdated maps with additional forest health information (Figure 4)."}, {"section_title": "The Coastal Online Assessment and Synthesis Tool", "text": "One of the goals of NASA's Applied Sciences Program is to enable expanded use of NASA's Earth science assets. Although these NASA data are freely available, use or access to them can sometimes be cumbersome. Additionally, many projects also incorporate data from non-NASA sources. Therefore, to address these issues and to make the data use and access more user-friendly, ASTPO created the Coastal Online Assessment and Synthesis Tool (COAST) by leveraging previous NASA open source tools: the World Wind geobrowser developed by NASA Ames Research Center, and SERVIR-Viz, another adaptation of World Wind developed by NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. COAST is an open source 3D geobrowser that drastically simplifi es the process of locating and accessing data sources. COAST provides users with insightful new data visualization and analysis capabilities ( Figure 5). The tool enables users to easily integrate previously disparate datasets from NASA and from other sources by importing the data and creating overlays of geo-image and vector datasets. COAST provides full transparency control over multiple data layers. Users can also create temporal image overlay animations. Such data access tools bring NASA science products, tools, and data into the NASA/GOMA collaboration to provide greater insight and integration to the Gulf of Mexico community. COAST maximizes the use of existing open source tools for data access, viewing, and data manipulation. Several improvements underway include an enhanced user interface (UI) that provides a user-friendly and effi cient means for users to discover, access, visualize, and analyze imagery and related data layers from within COAST. The interface also features options for users to import their own data in their COAST session. Another enhancement extends the capabilities of the Temporal Visualization Tool (TVT) UI for COAST, which enables users to explore the temporal components of the COAST data. The TVT allows direct data listing of accessible online raster datasets and temporal overlay animation and transparency control over the animated layer within COAST. The resulting temporal data animations during a COAST session provides greater insight into coastal trends and events. To help new users, ASTPO has created a series of on-line video tutorials that demonstrate the major features of COAST, such as navigating in 3D space and using the layer managers, Image Overlay Tool, Temporal Visualization Tool, and KML/KMZ (Keyhole Markup Language/KMZ zipped KML fi les; fi le formats used to display geographic data in an Earth browser) Import Tool."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "As part of NASA's Applied Sciences Program, ASTPO is working closely with federal, state, and local entities to demonstrate how NASA's Earth Science assets can help them understand, address, and resolve Gulf of Mexico issues.

The collaboration of ASTPO with the MBNEP provided important change statistics for regional planning related to urban encroachment and coastal storms. NASA's work with the NRL and AGT initiated enhancements for NOAA's HAB updates that are provided to the Gulf of Mexico coastal managers. Collaborations with MSU and the DISL demonstrated the feasibility of using VIIRS data to implement regional sediment management practices within the Gulf of Mexico estuaries. Novel uses of Landsat and MODIS data provided enhanced information for improved coastal forest management, especially after the occurrence of hurricane-induced damage. The development and release of COAST to the open source community enables a broader range of NASA data users. NASA's Applied Sciences Program and ASTPO will continue to advance projects that transfer NASA Earth Science assets to address the concerns that face the Gulf of Mexico. In turn, ASTPO will continue to refi ne the proof-of-concept projects currently under investigation, will complete feasibility studies for selection of new prototype projects, and will maintain participation within and in support of GOMA.
