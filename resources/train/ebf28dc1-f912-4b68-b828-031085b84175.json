[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Lower urinary tract function is modulated by neural, vascular and urethral and bladder structural elements. The pathophysiological mechanisms of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) encompass prostate enlargement, alterations in urethra histological structure bladder fibrosis and alterations in pelvic neuronal and vascular networks, The complex pathophysiological relationship between testosterone (T) deficiency (TD) and the constellations LUTS, and metabolic dysfunction manifested in the metabolic syndrome (Met S) remains poorly understood. TD has emerged as one the potential targets by which Met S may contribute to the onset and development as well as worsening of LUTS. Because it has been recognized that treatment of men with Met S with T therapy ameliorates Met S components, it is postulated that T therapy may represent a therapeutic target in improving LUTS. Furthermore, the effect of TD on the prostate remains unclear, and often debatable. It is believed that T exclusively promotes prostate growth, however recent evidence has strongly contradicted this belief. The true relationship between benign prostatic hyperplasia, TD, and LUTS remains elusive and further research will be required to clarify the role of T in both benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and LUTS as a whole. Although there is conflicting evidence about the benefits of T therapy in men with BPH and LUTS, the current body of literature supports the safety of using this therapy in men with enlarged prostate. As the population afflicted with obesity epidemic continues to age, the number of men suffering from Met S and LUTS together is expected to increase."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Impact of metabolic syndrome on lower urinary tract symptoms", "text": "Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are a set of bothersome voiding symptoms, including increased urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, slow stream, postmicturition dribble, and are traditionally attributed to benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). Epidemiological studies have suggested that age is among the principal unmodifiable risk factor of LUTS [1] . Metabolic syndrome (Met S) is a complex pathology manifested through a host of interrelated factors, such as increased waist circumference (WC), elevated insulin resistance (IR), hyperglycemia, hypertension, visceral adiposity, dyslipidemia, endothelial dysfunction, and atherosclerotic disease concomitant with low-grade inflammation, as indicated by elevated non-specific inflammatory markers. The Met S components often exist concomitantly with a reduction in circulating serum testosterone (T) levels [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Furthermore, Met S is thought to be associated with nephrolithiasis, BPH, LUTS, erectile dysfunction (ED), and infertility [14] . Met S and its related comorbidities are often associated with development and/or progression of BPH-LUTS [1] .\nPreclinical and clinical studies suggest that obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes, components of Met S are critical determinants and are potentially modifiable risk factors in BPH-LUTS (Fig. 1 ). Testosterone deficiency (TD) is a predictor and contributor to Met S [2] [3] [4] 11] . Met S is associated with increased inflammatory state and increased sympathetic activity together with pelvic ischemia [14] . These pathophysiological states contribute to the worsening of LUTS. Furthermore, TD contributes to increased adrenergic activity and reduced nitric oxide synthase activity concomitant with increased endothelin and Rho kinase activity, further contributing to the worsening of LUTS.\nCentral obesity and WC, components of Met S, have been associated with increased risk for BPH and LUTS [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . However, central obesity may adversely impact LUTS independent of the prostate growth, as demonstrated by changes in severity of LUTS in men after prostatectomy [31] [32] [33] [34] . An emerging body of evidence suggests that a relationship exists between LUTS severity and Met S [32, 33, [35] [36] [37] . As reported by Kupelian et al [38] , Met S was significantly associated with an elevated American Urological Association-symptom index score (multivariate odds ratio [OR]=1.68). After adjusting for age, men younger than 60 years with Met S were more likely to report intermittency, incomplete emptying, and nocturia [38] . We should point out that some studies [21] suggested that the presence of Met S was not significantly associated with moderate to severe LUTS (OR=1.13, p=0.53) and only altered serum triglycerides, an important component of Met S, and diabetes were associated with this risk. Yet, a positive association was noted between number of Met S components and LUTS/bladder outlet obstruction in this study [21] . It is possible that endocrine abnormalities attributed to central obesity and hypertriglyceridemia may play an important role in development or progression of the pathophysiology of lower urinary tract dysfunction [38, 39] . In particular, triglyceride and cholesterol levels seem to have a detrimental effect on prostatic function and inflammation, which may be associated with development and progression of LUTS/BPH [37] . Moreover, a meta-analysis, including 8 studies and 5,403 patients, demonstrated that Met S is associated with increased prostate size, supporting a potential role for metabolic dysfunction in progression of BPH, thus contributing to the pathophysiology of LUTS. It is likely that obesity, dyslipidemia and age represent significant risk factors in worsening LUTS [32] . Furthermore, an association between Met S and pelvic floor dysfunction exists independent of disease of the prostate [40] . "}, {"section_title": "Bidirectional relationship between testosterone deficiency and metabolic syndrome", "text": "As shown in Table 1 , a considerable body of literature exists demonstrating a bidirectional link between TD and Met S [2] [3] [4] . Several systematic reviews, crosssectional studies, and clinical trials have reported low levels of total T (TT) and sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in men with Met S, irrespective of age [11, 44, 63, 64] . The relationship between low TT and SHBG may be attributed to hyperinsulinemia in men with Met S. In addition, it was shown that serum estradiol (E 2 ) levels are higher in men with Met S and are positively correlated with the number of Met S components [65] . Reduced TT levels predict the development of the Met S in men with normal body mass index (BMI) [41, 43, 56, 66] . Additional evidence that low TT levels increase the risk of Met S is derived from experience with androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer [67] [68] [69] .\nLaaksonen et al [41] evaluated 702 men who initially were without Met S or diabetes mellitus. After 11 years of follow-up, there were 147 incident cases of Met S (20.9%) and 57 incident cases of diabetes (8.1%). After adjustment for age, men with TT, free testosterone (FT) and SHBG levels in the lower T quartile had a several fold increased risk of developing Met S (OR=2.3, 95% confidence imterval [CI], 1.5-3.4; OR=1.7, 95% CI, 1.2-2.5; and OR=2.8, 95% CI, 1.9-4.1, respectively) and diabetes (OR=2.3, 95% CI, 1.3-4.1; OR=1.7, 95% CI, 0.9-3.0; and OR=4.3, 95% CI, 2.4-7.7, respectively). Furthermore, adjustment for potential confounders, such as cardiovascular disease, smoking, alcohol intake, and socioeconomic status did not alter the associations. The authors concluded that low TT and SHBG levels independently predict development of Met S and type 2 diabetes in middle-aged men. In addition, it was suggested that TD is an early marker for disturbances in both insulin and glucose metabolism, which may progress to Met S and diabetes. This may also contribute independently to the pathogenesis of such diseases. In a subsequent study, Laaksonen et al [42] reported that men with Met S at baseline had a 2.6-fold increased risk of developing TD (T levels<11 nM) at the 11-year follow-up independent of age, smoking, and other potential confounders. In addition, adjustment for BMI (OR=2.0, 95% CI, 1.1-3.8) or baseline TT levels (OR=1.9, 95% CI, 1.0-3.4) attenuated the association. The association of Met S with TD (FT<225 pmol/L) was similar. The adjusted decrease in T levels during the 11-year follow-up was also greater in men with than without Met S. Antonio et al [56] reported that in 1,651 men without Met S at baseline, 289 men developed incident Met S during the followup. Men with lower baseline TT levels were at higher risk for developing Met S (OR=1.72, p<0.001), even after adjustment for SHBG (OR=1.43, p<0.001), BMI (OR=1.44, p<0.001), or homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (OR=1.64, p<0.001). E 2 was not associated with development of Met S (OR=1.04, p<0.56). However, a lower E 2 /T ratio was associated with a lower risk of incident Met S (OR=0.38, p<0.001), even after adjustment for SHBG (OR=0.48, p<0.001), BMI (OR=0.60, p<0.001) or HOMA-IR (OR=0.41, p<0.001). It was concluded that lower T levels, but not E 2 , are linked with an increased risk of developing Met S, independent of SHBG, BMI, or IR. A lower E 2 /T ratio may be protective against developing Met S [56] . The authors suggested that low T but not E 2 levels in men may be regarded as a biomarker or risk predictor for Met S, independently of SHBG, IR, and body composition. The importance of aromatase activity in Met S requires further investigation. These findings may have implications for the assessment of cardiometabolic risks in older and obese men [60] . The aforementioned studies strongly suggest that low TT levels independently predict Met S and the number of Met S components are inversely correlated with TT levels. Considering the Met S components individually, WC seems to be the strongest correlated factor with lower TT levels as demonstrated by multivariate analysis [11] . Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that TD is an independent predictor of the Met S."}, {"section_title": "METABOLIC SYNDROME, TESTOSTERONE DEFICIENCY, AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF LOWER URINARY TRACT SYMPTOMS", "text": "LUTS, which include frequency, urgency, incomplete voiding, and slow stream, are common in both men and women with advancing age.

SHBG remained significant after multivariate adjustment, suggesting that androgens (T and DHT) may be biomarkers rather than causally related to incident Met S.

TD was an independent risk factor for Met S (p<0.001).\nLow T levels are important predictors of development of Met S. Low T and high hs-CRP levels are independent predictors of Met S. Although a host of factors appear to predict Met S; however, low T, obesity, and BMI are strong predictors.\nLUTS have yet to be fully delineated [70] [71] [72] [73] . A significantly larger prostate volume was reported in men afflicted with Met S [19, 21, [74] [75] [76] , however it is unclear if this increase in prostate volume indeed exerts a clinical significance [32] . Met S which was associated with decreased improvement of postoperative symptoms and LUTS after prostate surgery, suggesting interplay of multiple metabolic risk factors contributing to this complex disorder [77] .\nIt is important to note that in a study of 122 men Favilla et al [78] found no correlation between TT and FT and prostate size or volume. Thus, the increase in prostate volume in men with Met S may be, in part, attributed to intra-prostatic inflammation due to hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia [31, 79] . In addition, reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and increased triglyceride levels are significantly related to higher prostatic inflammation and increased secretion of interleukin (IL)-8, in response to oxidized low-density lipoprotein [26, 31] . Furthermore, increased WC in men with Met S was positively correlated with prostate volume, which may contribute to severity of LUTS [80, 81] .\nIn contrast, a recent meta-analysis found that Met S components, such as alteration in WC and serum HDL levels were not associated with increased odds of having moderate to severe LUTS [21] . This meta-analysis suggested that serum triglycerides and diabetes may be more significantly associated with increased risk of LUTS and severity.\nLUTS are frequently associated with BPH in men, concomitant with a progressive decline in serum T levels and a gradual increase in prostate volume, reflecting pathophysiology of BPH and LUTS. As summarized in Table 2 [16, 19, 21, 25, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] 37, 38, [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] , Met S, visceral obesity, ED, and increased IR are conditions associated with progressive decline of T with age [84] . Schatzl et al [85] reported that TD was detected in 22.1% of 312 men with LUTS but had no impact on International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), maximum urinary flow rate (Q max ), prostate volume, or prostate specific antigen (PSA) level. A large population study suggested that circulating levels of sex hormones are not significant predictors of LUTS in men, after adjustment for age, and the pathophysiology of LUTS is com- A multi-center, cross-sectional study examined the association between TT, SHBG, and the risk of Met S in 3,332 men.\nLower TT and SHBG levels were found in men with Met S (p <0.001). The association with Met S and SHBG levels persisted through multivariate adjustment.\nAn association exists between reduced T and SHBG levels and Met S. TT and SHBG levels, but not serum FT, are inversely associated with the prevalence of Met S and SHBG is an independent and dominant risk factor for Met S.

In men with Met S, lower T levels predicted increased mortality.\nMet S may be a modifier of the association between TD and overall mortality.

Additionally, Tan et al [90] reported that the decrease in serum FT concentrations with a relative rise in serum E 2 levels with advancing age may be an important factor in the development of BPH. These findings indicated that the relationships between sex hormone levels and the development or severity of LUTS are conflicting, and further studies in large populations of men with and without LUTS and with various severities of BPH are required to reach more definitive conclusions. TD may alter the structures of the lower urinary tract, such as urethral and bladder epithelial cells. The role of Met S components including WC, HDL, triglycerides, and diabetes on the risk of having moderate-tosevere LUTS have been reported [38, [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] . More specifically, decreasing T levels have been associated with altered release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and acetylcholine (ACh) responsiveness to stretch, micturition reflex, and functional factors like bladder capacity [91, 97, 98] . Met S contributes to increased sympathetic nervous system activity and increased muscle tone of the prostate, resulting in more severe LUTS, even in the absence of prostate enlargement [21] ."}, {"section_title": "PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF LOWER URINARY TRACT SYMPTOMS", "text": "Animal model studies demonstrated that T elicits direct and indirect effects on neural tissue involved in bladder control [99, 100] . Bladder function is coordinated by a complex interplay of central and peripheral mechanisms [99] . At the local level within the bladder wall, the urothelium, a highly specialized transitional epithelium, acts as a distensible barrier between the underlying tissues and the urine and is also thought to play a major role in the sensation and transmission of information from the bladder to the nervous system [101]. Distension and stretch of the bladder during filling with urine causes the release of non-neuronal ATP from the urothelial cells, activating sensory nerves via purinergic P2X3 receptors and resulting in afferent signaling to higher central nervous system centers via the spinal cord to initiate bladder emptying. Thus, ATP release is crucial in initiating the micturition reflex and voiding [97] . The urothelium also releases other chemical mediators including ACh [102] , which is thought to communicate with the underlying tissues, nerves, smooth muscle, myofibroblasts and interstitial cells, to regulate sensory mechanisms and bladder contraction [101] . Whilst the role of ACh is less well understood than that of ATP, urothelial ACh can stimulate the release of other mediators such as NO or ATP and may also stimulate muscarinic receptors on the detrusor smooth muscle (DSM) and nerves [102] . Maggi et al [103] reported that T treatment in castrated rats increased prostate weight, but had no effect on bladder weight, bladder capacity, or amplitude of bladder contractions. However, T treatment induced detrusor instability and markedly increased residual volume, indicating intravesical outflow obstruction. Pandita et al [104] also reported that T treatment for 2 weeks increased micturition pressure, bladder capacity, residual volume, and micturition volume. Other studies have suggested that T treatment improves bladder capacity, reverses the parameters of DSM contractility, and improves smooth muscle/collagen ratio [98, 105, 106] . Tek et al [106] reported that T treatment of orchiectomized rats inhibited bladder activity. Castration reduced bladder capacity, and T treatment reversed this change. A similar effect of T treatment increased bladder capacity in castrated rabbits [107] . The discrepancies in these findings may be attributed to differing T concentrations used in such experimentation. Moreover, it is possible that supraphysiologic T levels may affect the urethral outlet and may induce urinary retention which indirectly influence bladder function. Cheng and de Groat [108] reported that castration altered several storage and voiding functions of the LUT and these changes are attributed to effects on activity of both the urethra and the bladder. Some of the observed changes in LUT function were completely reversed by T treatment, however, others were not reversed, suggesting that TD alters the LUT by several overlapping physiological mechanisms. T has been reported to relax the pig urinary bladder neck [109] , and rapidly inhibit the contractility of DSM preparations [110] . In rat DSM, inhibition of androgen receptor with flutamide does not abolish the relaxing effects of T on DSM, suggesting that T is acting via a non-genomic mechanism [110] . Hristov et al [111] examined the effects of T treatment on bladder smooth muscle excitability in the animal model and suggested that T at physiological levels decreases DSM cell excitability by directly activating BK channels via a non-genomic mechanism. The authors demonstrated that T at 100 nM increased the whole cell BK current in freshly isolated guinea pig DSM cells, suggesting a regulatory role of T in DSM cell excitability. Ito et al [112] have shown that significant increase in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release from stretched bladder epithelium after castration concomitant with significant increase in bladder IL-1\u03b2 and cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2) expression. T treatment reversed the PGE2 increase, suggesting that castration induces inflammation in the rat bladder, which causes elevated PGE2 release from bladder epithelium and may contribute to the disruption of bladder storage function.\nIn a rabbit model of Met S, Vignozzi et al [26] demonstrated that in animals fed high-fat diet (HFD), the mRNA expression of several proinflammatory markers in the prostate (IL-8, IL-6, IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1), T lymphocyte (CD4, CD8, T-bet, GATA3, and ROR-\u03b3t), macrophage (toll-like receptor 2 [TLR2], TLR4, and STAMP2), neutrophil (lactoferrin), inflammation (COX-2 and receptor for advanced glycation end products), and fibrosis/myofibroblast activation (tumor growth factor [TGF]-\u03b2, SM22-\u03b1, \u03b1-SMA, RhoA, and Rhoassociated kinase1 [ROCK1]/ROCK2) were significantly increased. T treatment normalized all the HFD-induced prostate alterations. These observations suggest that T treatment protects rabbit prostate from Met S-induced prostatic hypoxia, fibrosis, and inflammation, which can play a role toward the development/progression of BPH/LUTS. Juan et al [113] reported that castration resulted in decreased activity in the mitochondria specific enzyme, citrate synthase, the activity of which was greatest in the urethra and lowest in the corpora. Cholinergic nerve density indicator, choline acetyltransferase activity was greatest in the bladder body and lowest in the urethra. Zhang et al [114] demonstrated that TD in the animal model induces bladder fibrosis and decreases bladder maximal volume and compliance. TD induced TGF-\u03b2 mRNA and treatment www.wjmh.org of the castrated animals with anti-TGF-\u03b2 antibodies abolished the effects of TD on induced bladder fibrosis and dysfunction. T treatment prevented the histological and functional abnormalities induced by TD in the bladder of the animal model. Changes in bladder capacity and compliance in this study were similar to the findings of Cayan et al [115] observed these changes in rats treated with hormone replacement therapy including T and E 2 alone and in combination."}, {"section_title": "DOES TESTOSTERONE THERAPY IMPROVES LOWER URINARY TRACT SYMPTOMS?", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Testosterone therapy ameliorates metabolic syndrome components", "text": "T therapy has been shown to improve hyperglycemia and IR and ameliorate some of the Met S components (Table 3 ) [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] . However, conflicting evidence exists suggesting changes in weight loss and WC are not maintained [63] . M\u00e5rin et al [130] reported that T therapy improved insulin sensitivity in obese men and reduced central adiposity. Recently it has also been shown that T therapy improves insulin sensitivity in the HOMA-IR model. A significant reduction in IR in men with TD and type 2 diabetes was reported in men treated with intramuscular T therapy over a 3-month period [131] . Although this study reported reduction in glycated hemoglobin and fasting blood glucose, the effect of T therapy on these factors remains unclear [123, 131] . In one multicenter, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial, T treatment reduced hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and WC [132] . Heufelder et al [117] also demonstrated this in 32 hypogonadal (TT<12 nmol/L) men with Met S and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes randomized to 52 weeks of treatment with diet and exercise with or without transdermal T (50 mg/d). Addition of T treatment to supervised diet and exercise resulted in greater therapeutic improvement of glycemic control and reversed the Met S in 81% vs. 31% of controls after 52 weeks. Hoyos et al [133] investigated the effects of T therapy in obese men with severe obstructive sleep apnoea in an 18-week randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Sixty-seven men were randomized to intramuscular T therapy or placebo. T therapy improved insulin sensitivity, reduced liver fat, and increased muscle mass, as well as decreased arterial stiffness, but did not differentially reduce overall weight or the Met S and this may be attributed to the short treatment duration.\nCai et al [134] have identified only five randomized clinical trials with a total of 351 subjects who were treated with T for an average of 6.5 months. A meta analysis of these clinical trials to determine the metabolic effects of T therapy in hypogonadal men with type 2 diabetes found that fasting plasma glucose levels decreased 1.1 mmol/L (95% CI, -1.88 to -0.31), fasting serum insulin levels decreased by 2.73 mIU/L (95% CI, -3.62 to -1.84), HbA1c decreased by 0.87% (95% CI, -1.32% to -0.42%). The authors concluded that T therapy can improve glycemic control and decrease triglyceride levels in men with TD and type 2 diabetes.\nInterestingly, other trials have failed to show improvements in glucose metabolism. Gianatti et al [135] conducted a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebocontrolled trial in 88 men with type 2 diabetes, aged 35 to 70 years with an HbA1c \u22648.5% (69 mmol/mol), and a TT level of \u226412.0 nmol/L (346 ng/dL). Participants were randomly assigned to 40 weeks of intramuscular T therapy (n=45) or matching placebo (n=43). T therapy did not improve IR despite a decrease in fat mass and an increase in lean mass. T therapy reduced subcutaneous but not visceral abdominal adipose tissue. T therapy did not improve glucose metabolism or visceral adiposity in obese men with moderately controlled type 2 diabetes and modest reductions in circulating T levels typical for men with type 2 diabetes.\nHaider et al [136] reported data from a registry study on T therapy in men with obesity and diabetes. A total of 156 obese, diabetic men with TD, aged 61.17\u00b16.18 years, fulfilled selection criteria. T treatment for up to 6 years decreased WC by 11.6 cm, weight declined by 17.5 kg (15.04%), fasting glucose declined from 7.06\u00b11.74 to 5.59\u00b10.94 mmol/L (127\u00b131 to 101\u00b117 mg/dL, p<0.0001) and HbA1c decreased from 8.08% to 6.14%, with a mean change of 1.93%. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, lipid profiles including total cholesterol: HDL ratio, C-reactive protein, and liver enzymes all improved (p<0.0001). While this is not a randomized controlled clinical trial, it does suggest the potential benefits of T treatment on metabolic parameters when weight loss is achieved, and it suggests that long term treatment with T may contribute to weight loss.\nIt is widely recognized that T therapy reduces fat mass and increases lean body mass; however, until recently, most reports have not been associated with much weight loss [137] . Changes in body composition [116] This was a 9-month observational study of men with hypogonadism who were treated with either IM with TU 1,000 mg every 12 weeks (mean age, 60 years) or T gel 50 mg daily (mean age, 61 years).\nT therapy resulted in reduction WC concomitant with changes in total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL.

According to the study by Favilla et al [78] in men with BPH a significant association exists between severity of LUTS and reduced serum TT level, but not other serum sex hormones. Importantly, this study demonstrated that serum T levels are not associated with prostate size and volume. In fact, it has been shown that there exists a negative relationship of FT and BT with IPSS on multivariate analysis [24] . This negative relationship provides a framework with which to approach the evidence regarding T Therapy in men with LUTS.\nThe way in which T is hypothesized to improve LUTS includes regulation of the expression of alpha1-adrenergic receptors, phosphodiesterase type 5 activity, Rho-kinase activation, endothelin activity, and neural nitric oxide synthase [146, 147] . As shown in an animal model, T therapy also improves LUTS and bladder function parameters, in part by increasing bladder capacity and compliance and by decreasing detrusor pressure at maximal flow [106] . In that animal model, the authors found that orchiectomy decreased the mean bladder capacity by 38.9% while T therapy actually increased bladder capacity by an average of 46.6%. Celayir [107] measured the baseline urodynamic and T levels in control and orchiectomized rabbits treated with or without T. Bladder capacity and compliance were increased on days 5 and 10 with T treatment but decreased thereafter and returned to the baseline levels on day 30, suggesting that T modulates bladder capacity and compliance.\nAside from storage factors, T therapy is also observed to decrease DSM cell excitability by direct activation of large conductance voltage and calcium activated K+ channels through a non-genomic mechanism [111] . Additionally, T therapy can induced bladder neck smooth muscle relaxation and inhibit contractility in the DSM [109, 110] . Such findings suggest that there are underlying T-mediated physiological and anatomical mechanisms in bladder function.\nIt has long been believed that the most common etiology for LUTS in older men is BPH [108] . An inverse associations between serum T and LUTS was reported by Trifiro et al [88] . T therapy was reported to improve lower urinary function by increasing bladder capacity and compliance and by decreasing detrusor pressure at maximal flow in men TD [140, 141] .\nCrawford et al [148] found that endogenous T levels did not correlate with LUTS or prostate size and these findings support the saturation theory [149] . This is consistent with data reported by Schatzl et al [85] , in which T levels were shown to have no impact on LUTS status or prostate volume. On the other hand, preliminary evidence indicates that men with LUTS benefit from T treatment [116] and pilot studies have also shown that T therapy has a positive effect on LUTS men with TD [140] . In a recent review Baas and K\u00f6hler [150] suggested that T may be beneficial for BPH/LUTS, likely via increased expression and activity of nitric oxide synthase concomitant with smooth muscle relaxation. Concern remains that T therapy may worsen LUTS secondary to BPH, although few major adverse events have been reported with T treatment. We examined the effects of long-term T therapy in men with TD on urinary and erectile function and compared the findings with those of men in the same registry who remained untreated. More importantly we performed propensity matching analysis [151] to adjust for a number of variables to ensure that confounding factors such as age and obesity were considered. This was done to assess changes in urinary and sexual function as well as in quality of life (QoL). The currently reported data and those reported previously [73, 151] were derived from the same registry. We report that T therapy produced significant improvements in LUTS as assessed subjectively by IPSS and objectively by the significant reduction in post-voiding residual www.wjmh.org [140] A randomized, non-placebo, controlled clinical trial in 10 men who were treated with T gel (50 mg daily for 3 mo) and 20 treated with IM TU (1,000 mg for 26 wk).\nT therapy was associated with improved IPSS score and AMS score, along with also improved IIEF scores.\nThe findings support a role for T therapy in men with Met S and LUTS.

In a recent study of the epidemiological relationship between Met S and LUTS it was hypothesized that Met S was associated with over activity of the autonomic nervous system and that IR, a key element of Met S, might be responsible [154, 155] . Furthermore, the presence of Met S might mediate intraprostatic inflammation because of its association with an increased serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration, which would link Met S to symptomatic BPH [96, 156] .\nLiu et al [157] investigated the effects of T therapy on LUTS in 632 diabetic men and reported that men with the lowest T levels (2.21\u00b10.51 ng/dL) had the highest prevalence of nocturia, and it was more likely to be severe (\u22653 times/night). Francomano et al [126] examined the effects of T therapy for 5 years on LUTS in 20 obese men with TD and Met S and compared the findings in 20 matched subjects who remained untreated. After 5 years of T therapy no significant changes were reported in IPSS, PVR, or Q max . The authors suggested that the improvement in the components of the Met S may have played some role in maintaining unaltered urinary function. Furthermore, in a propensity matched subgroup analysis of 164 men with low T, it was shown that long term T therapy of as much as 10 years contributed to improved IPSS and Aging males' symptom scores, as well as decreased post-void residual volume [73] .\nKohn et al [158] reported that marked differences exist in LUTS between obese and non-obese patients, including differences in voiding and storage symptoms. The increased obesity associated with TD and worsening LUTS may have a common pathophysiological mechanism. Obesity increases aromatase activity, leading to a state of TD, while in the meantime the prostate continues to enlarge, worsening LUTS [126] . Since T therapy results in a sustained and marked decrease in body weight, WC, and BMI [151] , weight loss associated with T treatment may contribute to the observed improvement in LUTS. Our findings are also supported by a number of human and animal studies demonstrating a strong independent association between the components of Met S and BPH/LUTS as discussed above [153] ."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY", "text": "Lower urinary tract function is modulated by neural, vascular and urethral and bladder structural elements.

Androgen deficiency in the animal model is reported to produce marked alterations in the bladder wall structure as shown by decreased elastic fibers and increased collagen fiber density, a pathology that is reversible by T treatment [159, 160] . This observation has clinical implication as reported by Yassin et al [145, 161] in which T therapy was shown to reduce bladder wall thickness interruption of T therapy led to increase in bladder wall thickness.

Although a pathophysiological link between components of Met S and LUTS has been proposed [162, 163] , our understanding of the complex interaction between these elements is limited. While a host of studies point to a link between Met S and LUTS (Table  2) , other studies have suggested that no relationship exists between Met S and LUTS [164] [165] [166] . Thus, large, prospective studies are needed to ascertain such relationship. Cohen [167] has advanced the hypothesis that intra-abdominal pressure caused by visceral obesity plays a dynamic role in LUTS by damaging the oneway valves of the internal spermatic veins. T and TD have emerged as one potential avenue by which these two diseases may interact. The bidirectional relationship between TD and Met S, as we have discussed, certainly may represent a therapeutic target in future research, however, the current body of evidence is still developing. Furthermore, the effect of TD on the prostate is unclear. For many years it was believed that T exclusively produced prostate growth, however recent evidence has strongly contradicted this belief. The true relationship between the two factors remains elusive and further research will be required to clarify the role of T in both BPH and LUTS as a whole. The evidence for T therapy in men with LUTS is quite reassuring. Although there is conflicting evidence about the benefits of T therapy in men with BPH and LUTS, the current body of literature does support the safety of using this therapy in men with enlarged prostate. As the population afflicted by the obesity epidemic continues to age, the number of men suffering from Met S and LUTS together should be expected to increase. Given the association between Met S and TD, as well as the potential association with LUTS, the safety and efficacy of T therapy in these men will require further study."}]
