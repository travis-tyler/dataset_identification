Total cropland acreage in 2007 reached its lowest level since the Major Land Use series began in 1945. Over 1959, forest-use land and grassland, pasture, and range also decreased, while land in special uses (primarily recreation areas, transportation, and national defense) and urban areas increased. \u2022 From 2000 to 2010, national aggregate farm real estate values appreciated faster than residential values. Traditionally, farmland values were driven largely by the returns from agricultural activities, but today in some regions farmland values are influenced by factors such as urban influence and income from hunting leases. As a result, cropland values in these regions greatly exceed their implied agricultural use value. \u2022 From 1948 to 2009, agricultural output grew 1.63 percent per year while aggregate input use increased only 0.11 percent annually, so positive growth in the farm sector was mainly due to productivity growth (1.52 percent per year). \u2022 Total agricultural research and development (R&D) funding generally increased since 2000; private sector funding grew to exceed that of the public sector, which grew slowly and sporadically until 2006 before declining. Private sector R&D tends to emphasize marketable goods, while public sector R&D tends to emphasize public goods like environmental protection, nutrition, and food safety. \u2022 Corn, cotton, and soybean growers have widely adopted genetically engineered herbicidetolerant and insect-resistant seeds since 1996. Despite higher prices for genetically engineered seed than for conventional seeds, U.S. farmers are realizing economic benefits from increased crop yields, lower pesticide costs, and/or management time savings. \u2022 Real expenditures (2010 US$) and quantities for pesticide active ingredients declined an average 2.4 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, per year during 1996-2007, even though expenditures and quantities applied increased from 2006 to 2007. However, herbicide use increased, and increasing glyphosate use on herbicide-tolerant crops and reduced diversity of weed management practices are associated with increased weed resistance. \u2022 Commercial fertilizer consumption fell from 23 million short tons in 2004 to 21 million short tons in 2010, with high fertilizer prices contributing to the decline. Since 2004, nitrogen recovery rates (amount removed by harvested crop/amount applied) on corn and cotton have increased, and the shares of planted acreage where application rates exceed 125 percent of the crop's agronomic need have decreased. Phosphate recovery rates are relatively unchanged for corn and cotton. Mining phosphate in soybean plantings increased. \u2022 In recent decades, onfarm irrigation efficiency-the share of applied water that is beneficially used by the crop-has increased: from 1984 to 2008, total irrigated acres in the West increased by 2.1 million acres, while water applied declined by nearly 100,000 acre-feet, reflecting improved water-use efficiency, as well as changes in irrigated acreage and regional cropping patterns. \u2022 Since 2000, corn, cotton, soybean, and wheat acreage under conservation tillage (mulch, ridge, and no till) has increased, which may reduce soil erosion and water pollution but increase pest management costs. Over that same time, continuous corn and corn-inclusive rotations increased and continuous soybeans decreased due to higher corn prices, with uncertain effects on erosion and water pollution. Erosion control structures and conservation buffers are more widely used on highly erodible land than on other land, but overall, structures were more widely used and buffers less widely used on cotton and wheat than on corn and soybeans. \u2022 From 2004 to 2011, organic food sales more than doubled from $11 billion to $25 billion, accounting for over 3.5 percent of food sales in 2011. In 2008, growers practiced certified organic production on less than 1 percent of U.S. cropland and pasture/rangeland, but the percentage is higher for fruit/vegetable crops and for dairy production. \u2022 Federal funding for voluntary programs that encourage land retirement and adoption of conservation practices on working lands was $5.5 billion in 2010, higher than at any time since 1960 (when expressed in 2010 dollars); funding increased nearly tenfold for workingland conservation from 2003 to 2010. Enrollment in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) peaked at 36.8 million acres in 2007, but the 2008 Farm Act cut maximum enrollment to 32 million acres and high crop returns have discouraged new CRP bids, so 29 million acres were under 10-to 15-year contracts as of June 2012. Goals of the CRP include soil conservation, improved water and air quality, and enhanced wildlife habitat. Total 2008-12 authorized funding for the Environmental Quality Incentive Program is $7.25 billion; 60 percent is targeted for resource concerns in poultry and livestock production."}, {"section_title": "Farm Resources and Land Use", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Farm Numbers and Size", "text": "Robert A.

Growing productivity led to excess capacity in agriculture, farm consolidation, and the exit of farm operators to work in the nonfarm economy. The decline in farm numbers slowed in the 1980s and halted in the 1990s, reflecting increases in the number of very small farms whose operators do not depend on farming for their livelihood.

However, land-retirement programs-the Conservation Reserve Program, Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, and Wetlands Reserve Program-are targeted at environmentally sensitive land, not the production of commodities.

Land-use patterns vary greatly by region, reflecting differences in soils, climate, topography, population, and the relative profitability of having land in a particular use. For example, cropland accounts for 54 percent of all land in the Corn Belt but only 12 percent in the Northeast (fig. 1.2.1). Similarly, variation exists among States within a region. Almost two-thirds of North Dakota is cropland, versus 41 percent in South Dakota.

Changing commodity and timber prices, agricultural and natural resource policies and, more recently, bioenergy policies prompt private landowners to shift land to uses that maximize returns to land.

For example, yields could increase simply because farmers are adding more of other inputs, such as chemicals or machinery. USDA's Economic Research Service produces measures of total factor productivity (TFP) that account for the use of all inputs to the production process. Under the USDA-ERS TFP measure, annual productivity growth is the difference between growth of agricultural output and the growth of all inputs taken together (Ball et al., 1997;Ball et al., 2011). Productivity, therefore, measures changes in the efficiency with which inputs are transformed into outputs. Inputs are adjusted for changes in quality, such as improvements in the efficacy of chemicals and changes in the demographics of the farm workforce.

Likewise, the consumers of agricultural products also depend on scientific reports for information about nutrition, food safety, and environmental quality. Much of the science used in agriculture comes from the life sciences. For example, plant varieties need resistance to pests and diseases and tolerance to nonbiological stresses such as drought and heat. Some stressors can be managed chemically or physically, for example, by controlling pests with insecticides or delivering water by irrigation. Even in these cases, the biological basis of the plant or pest must be understood. But many stressors can be managed best by utilizing inherent resistance in the plant or animal variety.

Little incentive exists for private firms to pursue public-goods research because the results benefit society as a whole, rather than the specific innovator. Thus, the private sector focuses mainly on R&D related to marketable goods. The food industry accounts for the largest category of private R&D (though this may also include marketing research). Advances in research in biology, microbiology, and computing created new technological opportunities for private companies.

By 2011, U.S. farmers were using HT soybeans on 94 percent of all planted soybean acres. HT cotton occupied 73 percent of cotton acreage, and HT corn accounted for 72 percent of corn acreage in 2011.

Benefits of GE Seeds Outweigh Added Cost for Most U.S. Farmers Despite the higher prices for GE seed compared to conventional seed (figs. 2.3.2-2.3.3), U.S. farmers are realizing economic benefits from increased crop yields, and/or lower pesticide costs, and management time savings. The impacts of GE crops vary with the crop, technology, pest infestation levels, and other factors. For example, Bt crops may lead to yield gains and/or lower insecticide costs, while HT crops lead to savings in management time. Moreover, farmers adopting the HT varieties for corn, cotton, and soybeans often substitute glyphosate for more toxic herbicides. HT crops also facilitate the adoption of conservation tillage. By enabling more crop residue to be safely left in the field, conservation tillage reduces soil erosion by wind and water, increases water retention, and reduces soil degradation and water and chemical runoff. Despite its net benefits, however, consumer concerns may have limited acceptance of GE crops, particularly in Europe. In addition, farmers' reliance on glyphosate has recently led to the evolution of weed resistance to this herbicide, reducing the effectiveness of the weed-management tool. On the other hand, insect resistance to Bt crops has been limited and of \"little economic and agronomic significance\" (National Research Council, 2010).

Changes in the use of pesticides during this period are due to several factors, including the widespread adoption of genetically engineered crops, the expiration of the glyphosate patent in 2000, the availability of new compounds with lower application rates, boll-weevil eradication, and changes in pesticide prices, which increased slowly compared to the prices of other inputs such as fertilizer ( fig. 3.1.2). Of the five crops, 53 percent of the pesticide total was applied to corn in 1982, followed by soybeans (28 percent), cotton (9.6 percent), fall potatoes (4.8 percent), and wheat (4.5 percent). Corn's share declined to 43 percent in 2010, while fall potatoes' share increased to 20 percent (because of large increases in the application of other chemicals, particularly vine killers such as sulfuric acid). Herbicides accounted for the largest share of pesticides applied throughout 1982-2010, while the other-chemicals category increased most in share. Corn accounted for the majority of herbicide and insecticide use until the early 1990s, after which cotton accounted for the majority of insecticide use due to boll-weevil eradication efforts. The majority of fungicides and other chemicals were applied to fall potatoes."}, {"section_title": "Management Practices", "text": "ARMS data on pest management practices first became available in 1996 and indicate that fields were scouted for weed control on the majority of acres planted to corn, cotton, soybeans, and winter wheat, and that weed scouting intensity increased during 1996-2007 ( fig. 3.1.3). With the  widespread adoption of herbicide-tolerant (HT) corn, cotton, and soybeans during 1996-2007, the use of post-emergence herbicides increased, particularly for soybeans, while the use of preemergence herbicides first declined and then leveled off, for corn and cotton, and increased for soybeans. The percentage of winter-wheat acres receiving pre-emergence herbicides increased slowly and steadily during this period, while the percentage of acres receiving post-emergence herbicides declined and then increased somewhat. The share of planted acres on which pesticides are rotated to slow resistance trended downward during 1996-2007, particularly for soybeans. This trend-along with the widespread adoption of HT crops and the popularity of glyphosate-might help explain why glyphosate resistance is an emerging problem facing producers of corn, cotton, and soybeans. Changes in insect management practices are less apparent. Fields were scouted for insect control on the majority of planted acres, and the only discernible change over 1996-2007 occurred in soybeans, where the share of planted acres scouted increased slightly, perhaps because of the recent introduction of the soybean aphid. Nutrient consumption has been volatile since 2004. Commercial fertilizer consumption increased rapidly before 1982 as more acreage was devoted to high-yield crop varieties and hybrids that responded favorably to more intensive fertilizer use. As global demand for grains grew, nutrient consumption peaked at 24 million tons in 1981. When grain demand dropped in 1983, Government payment-in-kind programs idled record acres and reduced nutrient consumption to 18 million tons. Nutrient use then moved steadily upward, largely due to an increase in corn plantings. (Corn, on average, uses the most fertilizer of all crops.) Beginning in 2004, fertilizer consumption was volatile due to highly variable corn plantings and volatile fertilizer prices in the biofuels era. Record fertilizer prices in 2009 reduced consumption to 18 million tons, a 24-percent decline from 2004. As fertilizer prices declined in 2010, consumption rebounded to 21 million tons. Nitrogen fertilizer use has increased more rapidly than phosphate and potash due to the development of seed varieties with more favorable yield responses to nitrogenous fertilizers. Cornwith many planted acres under intensive fertilizer application-accounted for around 46 percent of the U.S. fertilizer consumption in 2010. Farmers are improving nutrient recovery rates for most crops. Nutrient recovery rate is the ratio of the amount of nutrient in the harvested crop to the amount of nutrient applied. Partial recovery occurs when the amount applied exceeds the amount removed. For corn, nitrogen recovery efficiency increased from 73 percent in 1987 to 81 percent 2010, while phosphate recovery hovered near 100 percent. For soybeans, phosphate recovery is above 100 percent, Crops' nitrogen recovery rates"}, {"section_title": "Percent of nitrogen applied", "text": "Recovery efficiency is the average of recovery efficiencies from each observation.

Efficiency above 100 percent indicates more phosphate is removed than applied. Source: USDA, Economic Research Service's calculation using individual observations from ARMS survey. Farmers are reducing planted acres with excess nutrient use for most crops. For corn, the share of planted acres with excess nitrogen applied (above 25 percent of the crop's needs) declined from 59 percent in 1996 to 47 percent in 2010, while the share of acres with excess phosphate declined from 43 percent in 1996 to 31 percent in 2010. Other crops also exhibit either declining or unchanged shares of planted acres with excess use of nitrogen or phosphate. Yield increase is the major factor in improving nutrient use efficiency in corn in recent years. Higher yields result in more nutrients being removed from the soil, thus reducing nutrient losses. Yields (and efficiency) have benefited from increased crop rotation (corn planted after soybeans), soil testing for nitrogen, use of GE seeds to reduce pest damage, increase in seeding rate, and adoption of precision technology (such as yield monitors and soil map). Water-use efficiency gains provide many farm-level benefits, including enhanced productivity of applied water; improved efficiency of production inputs for labor, energy, or chemicals; and higher farm returns. The potential for water savings at a watershed scale will depend, however, on local hydrologic factors and net changes in crop consumptive use. Whether or not improved water-use efficiency eases basin-level water-supply constraints, onfarm water conservation may contribute to farmer and societal welfare, improved fish and wildlife habitat, and reduced ecosystem and human health risks associated with environmental degradation. In recent decades, onfarm irrigation efficiency-the share of applied water that is beneficially used by the crop-has increased. FRIS survey data reveal a marked shift to more efficient irrigation application systems, reducing average per-acre applied water rates across crops and regions. While an important concern across U.S. irrigated agriculture, irrigation efficiency is of particular importance across the arid Western States, where water demand for agriculture is greatest and where competing water demands and shifting water regimes under climate change are projected to place additional strain on available water supplies for agriculture. In 1984, gravity systems-which used roughly 54 percent more water per acre than pressurized systems, on average-accounted for more than 70 percent of all water applied for crop agriculture in the 17 Western States. By 2008, gravity systems applied less than half of all irrigation water, while water used with pressure systems accounted for 52 percent of water applied ( fig. 3.3.1). At the same time, continued efficiency advances were achieved with both gravity and pressure systems. By 2008, fewer acre-feet of water were required to irrigate a greater number of acres, reflecting improved water-use efficiency, as well as changes in irrigated acreage distributions and regional cropping patterns. From 1984 to 2008, total irrigated acres in the West increased by 2.1 million acres, while water applied declined by nearly 100,000 acre-feet. In 2008, applied water rates in the region averaged 2.4 acre-feet per acre for gravity systems and 1.4 acre-feet for pressure systems. 5 While substantial technological innovation has already occurred in U.S. irrigated agriculture, additional water-use efficiency gains are achievable. Figure 3.3.2 shows changes, from 1994 to 2008, in the share of Western irrigated acres using more efficient irrigation systems (as defined in the figure's legend). More than half of irrigated cropland acres in the West continue to be irrigated with more traditional, less efficient application systems, for both gravity and pressure irrigation systems. Continued investment in irrigation efficiency will depend on adoption incentives at the farm level, including factors that influence investment returns (e.g., crop value, water/energy, and system upgrade costs), access to capital, and production risk."}, {"section_title": "Private and Public Investment in Irrigation Improvements", "text": "Irrigators continue to make significant capital investments in irrigation equipment and infrastructure. Approximately $2.15 billion was spent on irrigation systems (beyond expenditures for maintenance and repair) across U.S. farms in 2008. Nearly three-fourths of these capital investments were on land in the West, where the vast majority of irrigated land is located. About 52 percent of on-farm expenditures in the West were driven by replacement of existing equipment and machinery; upgrades in irrigation facilities and equipment (where water conservation was identified as the primary purpose) accounted for 17 percent. Investment in new equipment accounted for nearly 31 percent of all investment expenditures.  (1984, 1988, 1994, 1998, 2003, and 2008).  (1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008). Traditional irrigation includes systems other than those defined above for more efficient gravity/sprinkler irrigation (largely including high-pressure sprinkler and unlined furrow and flood systems without field borders). More efficient pressure-sprinkler irrigation includes acres irrigated using either drip/trickle systems or lower pressure sprinkler systems [pressure per square inch (PSI) < 30]. More efficient gravity irrigation includes furrow irrigated acres using above-or below-ground pipe, or a lined open-ditch field water-delivery system, plus acres in flood irrigation (between borders or within basins) on farms using laser-leveling and pipe or lined open-ditch field water-delivery systems. The majority of U.S. irrigation investment is financed privately; fewer than 10 percent of farms reporting irrigation improvements in 2003 or 2008 received public cost-share assistance. Over half of the farms receiving public assistance for irrigation investments made use of USDA's Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), though these farms represented less than 5 percent of all irrigated farms that made irrigation investments in 2003 or 2008. However, EQIP funding has had an important cumulative impact on irrigation investments. Nationally, irrigation practices accounted for roughly a quarter of total EQIP cost-share funding obligations ($5.7 billion) from 2004 to 2010. The magnitude of public irrigation investment under EQIP varies across the United States ( fig. 3.3.3), reflecting, in part, the relative importance of irrigation to the regional agricultural economy, as well as Federal program funding guidelines and State contract-ranking criteria. In the Western States, funding of irrigation practices as a share of total EQIP outlays (2004-10) ranged from 13 percent for the Northern Plains to 58 percent for the Southern Mountain States. Irrigation practices account for a relatively small share of program expenditures in the Corn Belt, Lake States, Appalachia, and Northeast regions. Since 2004, however, EQIP funding shares for irrigation practices have generally increased in the Eastern States, in contrast with declining funding shares for irrigation practices across the West.

Conservation tillage that maintains residue cover provides environmental benefits and improves both agronomic and economic efficiency. The reduction in fuel and labor expenditures due to fewer tillage passes over the field can boost farm profits. Additionally, farms using crop residue management retain more moisture by trapping snow, decreasing water evaporation from the top layer of soil, and improving water infiltration to plant root systems. Environmental benefits include reduced soil erosion and water pollution "}, {"section_title": "Corn-Soybeans and Continuous Cropping Remain Dominant Cropping Patterns", "text": "The choice to rotate crops-which helps to cycle nutrients, break pest cycles, and maintain or improve soil quality-is contingent on the relative rates of return for candidate crops. Rotations may consist of strictly spring-planted crops, or may involve fall-planted crops or cover crops. The most common rotation, corn and soybeans, demonstrates several of the major agronomic and environmental advantages to crop rotation. By alternating a nitrogen-dependent grain (corn) with a nitrogen-fixing legume (soybeans), nitrogen fertilizer needs are reduced. Yields have been shown to increase for grain-legume rotations irrespective of fertilizer rates. Weeds, insects, and disease are disrupted by crop rotation, which allows farmers to save on pesticide application and costs. Rotating closely grown crops, such as small grains, with row crops increases vegetative cover and can reduce soil losses due to water and wind erosion, thereby reducing nutrient and pesticide runoff into waterways. Crop rotations that include legumes, row crops, and small grains are most effective at disrupting weed, insect, and disease cycles. Market factors-including relative commodity prices and input prices-greatly affect crop rotation decisions. The past decade has seen increased corn grain prices in addition to higher commercial fertilizer prices. High corn prices could lead to more continuous corn, while a desire to contain fertilizer expenses could encourage rotation of crops that require less fertilizer. Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) results for corn and soybeans indicate a small increase in corn in rotation and continuous corn over the past decade."}, {"section_title": "Conservation Structures Help To Minimize Erosion", "text": "Conservation programs such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Conservation Stewardship Program help farmers to implement best management practices,  Still, many U.S. producers are embracing organic farming in order to lower input costs, conserve nonrenewable resources, capture high-value markets, and boost farm income. While only a small percentage of the top U.S. field crops-corn (0.2 percent), soybeans (0.2 percent), and wheat (0.7 percent)-were certified organic in 2008, nearly 9 percent of U.S. vegetable crop acres and 3 percent of U.S. fruit and tree nut acres were grown under certified organic farming systems. Markets for organic vegetables, fruits, and herbs have been developing for decades in the United States, and fresh produce is still the top-selling organic category in retail sales. Organic livestock was beginning to catch up with produce in 2008, with 2.7 percent of U.S. dairy cows and 1.5 percent of layer hens managed under certified organic systems. Obstacles to adoption by farmers include high managerial costs and risks of shifting to a new way of farming and limited knowledge of organic farming and marketing systems. According to Lynn Clarkson, a top organic grain broker, specific obstacles to adoption in organic grain production include the 3-year lag due to the organic transition period requirement, fewer organic marketing outlets, the need for onfarm storage, the lack of third-party contractors for organic pest and nutrient management, heavy managerial requirements, fear of criticism from neigh- "}, {"section_title": "Organic operations accounted for less than 1 percent of total crop acreage in 2008", "text": "Number bors, unknown risks, lack of government infrastructure support, and subsidies for ethanol that increase demand for conventional grain supplies (Clarkson, 2007). Producers also face many challenges once they have shifted to organic production. Respondents to USDA's 2005 organic dairy producer survey indicated that certification paperwork and compliance costs were the most challenging aspect of organic milk production, followed by finding new organic sources of feed and dairy replacements, higher costs of production, and maintaining animal health (McBride and Greene, 2009). In the produce sector, a recent California study of small and mid-sized organic farmers, producing mostly fruit and vegetables, found that more than 80 percent reported marketing challenges-having too much or too little volume, obtaining organic price premiums, locating and accessing markets, handling competition, and accessing information on pricing (Cantor and Strochlic, 2009). With the growth of conservation programs over the past 25 years, conservation spending for fiscal year 2010-expressed in constant dollars-was higher than at any time since 1960. In 1960 at the height of the Soil Bank program (a large land retirement program initiated in 1956), conservation program funding was almost $5.8 billion in 2010 dollars. It is not clear that conservation spending will continue to rise in the future. The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 reduced the CRP acreage cap to 32 million acres, slowing spending in that program. If the demand for major commodities (e.g., corn, soybeans, and wheat) continues to be strong and market prices for these commodities continue to be well above historic levels, farmers may be unwilling to enroll land in CRP unless annual payments are increased to match the profits from crop production. Under such a scenario, CRP expenditures could jump or the program's acreage could shrink.    (compared with an acceptance rates ranging between 48 and 74 percent in the signups between 1997 and 2006). A high share of offered acres were re-enrollments (over 85 percent in 2011), suggesting that the pool of landowners interested in the CRP may be shrinking. Furthermore, enrollment seems to be shifting toward less productive land, with rental payments for newly accepted general signup acres basically constant between 2006 and 2011. As the total acreage enrolled via CRP's general signups has declined, \"continuous signups\"including land in one of the many State-Federal conservation partnerships under the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP)-have increased. This acreage, which is targeted to address high-priority environmental concerns and is subject to more stringent eligibility requirements, grew from 3.7 million acres in 2007 to over 5.3 million acres in June 2012. Further growth in continuous signups is likely as targeted conservation practices and sites are identified. For example, about three-fourths of the 850,000 continuous signup acres allocated to the 2008 State Acres for Wildlife Enhancement initiative have been enrolled. New initiatives continue to emerge, such as the Louisiana Coastal Prairie CREP and expansion of Nebraska's Platte-Republican CREP, as high valued conservation opportunities are developed.

Much of the 17-percent increase in conservation funding authorized by the 2008 Farm Act goes toward two working-lands programs-the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Conservation Stewardship Program. These programs provide producers with financial and technical assistance for implementing and managing a wide range of conservation practices for crop, livestock, and forest production."}, {"section_title": "Two Different Program Designs Are Used", "text": "The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) is the largest working-lands program in terms of funding and acreage. Established in 1996, EQIP's principal objective is to (1) promote production and environmental quality as compatible goals, (2) optimize environmental benefits, and (3) help farmers and ranchers meet Federal, State, and local regulatory requirements. Financial assistance is in the form of a cost share. Farmers seeking to participate in EQIP complete an application indicating which land on the farm will be enrolled, which resource concerns will be addressed, and what practices will be used. Contract selections are made at the State or local level. Total authorized funding for 2008-12 is $7.25 billion, 60 percent of which is targeted to natural resource concerns related to poultry and livestock production. The remainder is directed toward practices that address conservation priorities on working cropland. In 2010, EQIP obligated $839 million to treat 13 million acres of land. The goal of the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) is to encourage producers to address resource concerns in a comprehensive manner by (1) undertaking additional conservation activities, and (2) improving, maintaining, and managing existing conservation activities. To participate in CSP, farmers and ranchers must, at minimum, have already addressed at least one resource concern throughout their farm, and agree to address at least one additional priority resource concern during the 5-year contract term. CSP pays participants for conservation performance-the higher the performance, the higher the payment. Performance is measured with the Conservation Measurement Tool. Using a point-based scoring system, the environmental benefits associated with each activity are assessed. Additional activities receive a higher payment rate than existing activities. This creates an incentive for landowners to provide more conservation than a simple cost-share might. The 2008 Farm Act directs the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture to enroll 12.77 million acres per year into CSP at an average cost of $18 per acre, or about $230 million per year. In 2010, CSP obligated $320 million to enroll 25 million acres of land."}, {"section_title": "Multiple Resource Concerns Are Addressed", "text": "Working-lands programs address multiple resource concerns on farms, including air quality (odor, gaseous emissions), livestock and poultry (manure), fish and wildlife habitat, plant condition (forage quality, noxious and invasive plants), soil condition (organic matter, compaction, salinity), soil erosion, water quality, and water quantity (drainage, irrigation). Water quality, plant condition, and water quantity received the largest shares of financial assistance in the EQIP program ( fig. 4.3.1). (Similar data are not available for CSP.) Resource concerns addressed through EQIP vary widely across regions, driven largely by climate and predominant types of agriculture ( fig. 4.3.2). Water quantity is a major issue in regions where irrigated crops are common: the Basin and Range, Mississippi Portal, Fruitful Rim, and Prairie Gateway regions. Water quality and soil erosion are major concerns in the Heartland, Mississippi Portal, Southern Seaboard, and Northern Crescent regions.  "}]
