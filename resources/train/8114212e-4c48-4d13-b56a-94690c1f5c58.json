In this framework \"water scarcity\" is defined as 1,000 m\u00b3/person 7 or less. The water consumed per person (from all sources -surface and aquifer) includes not only what is normally classified as domestic/residential water consumption per capita, but also the individual's share of national water consumed for productive activities -agriculture and industry -and the individual's share of water required for ecosystem needs (flushing channels, supporting aquatic life, etc.).\nUsing the per capita definition (of the UNDP, UNEP, World Bank, WRI) China as a whole will be classified as water stressed by 2010 at the current rate of population growth. Using the IWMI's classification, China currently uses 44% of its water and is still within the \"comfortable\" water use margin, but its use of water is projected to exceed 60% by 2020 8 , putting it in the \"environmentally overexploited\" category. Thus, by either definition, China will face a potentially serious water management problem in the coming decades.\nThe water use percentages cited above are substantially higher than the ratio of what is recorded as \"Water Use\" 9 in Chinese statistics relative to the total natural availability of water --currently on the order of 20 % (see Table 1 .2). The latter figure superficially suggests that there is substantial scope for expanding water use in China. However, such a conclusion is not warranted because:\n\u2022 The aggregate use figures refer only to flows tapped for human use and do not include flows required for ecosystem maintenance.\n\u2022 The data on gross availability exceeds the amount of water that actually can be harnessed for human use (i.e. in a \"cost-effective\" way based on \"known\"/current technologies).

In the absence of sufficient water treatment plants, large volumes of raw sewage are dumped daily into local streambeds, and industrial water is often untreated. When upstream water is returned to the stream polluted, water quality downstream is degraded. In some cases, polluted water in the streams has seeped into ground water 30 .

In fact, the amount of water used for irrigation actually declined by over 4%, from 358 to 343 billion m\u00b3 (between 1980 to1993) as industrial and urban needs pre-empted agricultural needs 35 , and as productivity (efficiency) of water use in agriculture increased.\nThe role of water pricing in rural areas of China is negligible because, for a long time, government policy kept water prices low as part of a larger strategy to keep farmers in their fields in order to avoid the huge social implications of a rush to the cities. This has had the side effect of encouraging wasteful use of water in inefficient crops and activities 36 . China recently re-emphasized the policy of food (grain) self-sufficiency. 34 Wang. 2004 .

However, this shift has been brought about through administrative means rather than through economic pricing of water.\nIndustry: Industry has been the second most important source of demand for water. Since economic reforms were initiated in the early 1980s, China's economic growth has been rapid, particularly in the non-agricultural sectors. Between 1980 and 2002, water use in industry increased from 46 to 114 billion m\u00b3, an increase of 250% in two decades (Table  3 .1). Industry now accounts for 21% of the total 37 . Together the production sectors account for 90% of water demand.\nSome have argued that water demand by industry may be decelerating as industries are becoming more water-efficient or shifting towards sub-sectors with lower-water requirements 38 . The evidence for this, however, is still anecdotal. Even if a shift is occurring, there is still the problem that Chinese industries as recently as the late 1990s were still consuming 4-10 times as much water as their counterparts in more industrialized countries 39 ."}, {"section_title": "Water Demand for Consumption Purposes -by Households", "text": "Rural: Rural residential demand for water was 21 billion m\u00b3 in 1980, 4.8% of total use.

A major program to put in tap water systems for rural villages has been underway now for many years. As this program progresses, more households will have access to regular supplies of tap water, and domestic/residential consumption of water in rural areas is expected to increase 40 .\nUrban: Urban residential water demand was insignificant in 1980 at 1.5% of the total. However, in the two decades 1980-2002, China entered a major phase of urbanization. The number of residents in China's cities more than doubled --from 191 million to an estimated 459 million and their per capita income has increased even more rapidly. As a result the urban residents' share of total water use has quadrupled to almost 6% (in absolute terms urban water consumption in this period increased from 7 billion m\u00b3 to 32 billion m\u00b3) as urban residents bought washing machines and rented apartments that included flush toilets and individual shower facilities, activities that increase per capita urban water use.

Implementing effective demand management policies requires dealing with public goods differently from dealing with private goods Public Goods: By definition, public goods cannot be provided by markets. In the absence of feedback through market prices/ signals, managing the environmental component of public goods requires feedback from scientific knowledge, (and public commitment to act on that knowledge) to restore critical ecosystem functions affected by inadequate and degraded (/polluted) water availability. Similarly, managing the social component of public goods requires feedback from communities, (and public commitment to act on this feed back) to correct damaging consequences to public health, as well as, to the livelihoods of vulnerable households arising from inadequate and degraded water availability.\nPrivate Goods: Expanding the role of markets and market price signals as a feedback mechanism in water allocation will go a long way in helping conserve the resource and allocate it to the highest economic use, as well as, to send signals on priority investment requirements. Expanding the role of water markets and prices is a corollary of expanding the role of markets in the production of private goods and services. However, the expansion of water markets and prices presupposes progress on establishing the institutional framework on property rights (water rights/entitlements), valuation, and appropriate measurement. Taxes and subsidies, as well as, educating farmers, firm managers, and households in water conservation options can also augment the role of water pricing where the latter provides insufficient information and incentives on the allocation of water."}, {"section_title": "Trends Affecting Future Demand Projections", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Elasticity of Water Demand with Respect to GDP", "text": "As noted above agriculture is still the largest consumer of water in China, but growth in demand has been greatest in urban and industrial use. In 2002, China consumed about 550 billon m\u00b3 of water annually, of which 68.8% was used for agriculture, 21% for industry and 11% for household purposes ( Using GDP in constant 1990 prices 52 , the elasticity of water demand in industry with respect to GDP (at ~.45) is still much higher than the elasticity of water demand in agriculture (at ~.01) in the period (see table 4 .2). However, this period really consists of two sub-periods with very different trends. In the period 1980-1997 the elasticity of water demand in industry was 10 times higher than it was in the period 1997-2002. In the case of agriculture the elasticity was actually negative in the second period.\nThis suggests that the production sectors were able to grow even as they reduced their demand for water. However, in the case of agriculture, real output grew at only half the rate it did in the previous period (2.8% vs. 5.5%) suggesting water shortages may be affecting growth opportunities, which is consistent with anecdotal evidence. Real industrial growth rates also decelerated from 12% to 9% between the 1980-1997 and 1997-2002 periods. Again there have been anecdotal observations that water shortages are affecting growth opportunities in the sector. Thus, the observed drop in water use elasticity with respect to GDP growth has been accompanied by a drop in agricultural and industrial growth rates as water shortages limited investment and therefore growth opportunities. While there is substantial scope for improving water use efficiency in agriculture and industry in China, it is not clear whether over a 40-50 year period, improved efficiencies will be sufficient to fully offset water use requirements associated with very high GDP growth rates, as was done in the five year period 1997-2002."}, {"section_title": "Long-term Water Use Trends", "text": "In the absence of a China-wide simulation model it is difficult to analyze the implications of different scenarios. However, some aspects of future water demand can be analyzed with the aid of a simple simulation model. This is primarily an illustrative exercise to understand the key drivers of water demand at a broad-brush level. It is not capable of identifying location-specific policy priorities, or planning targets.\nThe key variables in the model are population forecasts, changes in the urban-rural composition of the population, changes in the per capita water demand of rural and urban households, changes in the composition of production between primary (agriculture plus), 52 World Bank 2003b. secondary (manufacturing plus), and tertiary (services) activities. With these few variables one can show the sensitivity of the \"aggregate demand for water\" to different average GDP growth rates to 2050 --if water demand per yuan of output does not change significantly in the various sub-sectors. This then provides a backdrop for comparing actions to aggressively increase the efficiency of water use in the sub-sectors vs. actions to aggressively increase water supplies -recognizing that the composition of the action portfolio will vary by region, river basin, and even locality.\nThe projections use \u2022 Two scenarios for population in 2050: (1) the UN medium term projection, assuming a growth rate of 0.2% per annum with the population peaking and then leveling off at 1.4 billion people by 2050; (2) the population of 1.6 billion in 2050 which was used in the 3H study (and implicitly assumes a 0.45% per annum growth rate).\n\u2022 The same urban-rural split and GDP structure for 2050 used in the 3H study.\n\u2022 The assumption that the demand for water of rural and urban households will continue to grow but at different rates -varying between a fast one akin to the explosive growth in the 1980-1997 period, and a slow one akin to the growth in the period 1997-2002.\nUsing these very simple assumptions, we find that the doubling of overall population growth rate from 0.2% to 0.45% p.a. has a negligible impact on water demand. The increase in the urban share of the population, however, is more significant particularly if the average demand for water of urban households continues to grow rapidly. But these changes in demand -not excessive in their own right --will be more difficult to accommodate if there is not also a substantial deceleration and possibly even a decline in water demand by agriculture and industry.\nIn other words, if the unit water consumption patterns of the latter do not change significantly, even though their share in GDP decreases, shortages will continue to grow and average GDP growth rates >5% p.a. over 50 years (say 7% p.a. in the first till 2025 and 4% thereafter) will be difficult to sustain, as they could generate water demand in excess of China's ability to supply at a reasonable cost.\nEven a 4% p.a. growth rate for the country through 2050 could generate the need to increase water supply in many growth areas in excess of 100%. To put this required increase in water in perspective -it is worthwhile to note that in the explosive GDP growth period of the last 20 years, (with its attendant industrialization and urbanization transformations) aggregate water demand grew by only 25% from 440 BCM to 550 BCM --with the 3H river basins and key metropolitan regions experiencing so much water shortage that they have had to resort to diverting water from downstream rural users and estuaries, as well as, pumping aquifers at a rate faster than replenishment --which is ultimately unsustainable."}, {"section_title": "In the Scenarios above the Real Pressure on Water Demand Emanates from Lack of Efficiency Improvements in Water Use in Agriculture and Industry", "text": "Thus, there is a strong premium on lowering water consumption patterns in the production sectors, i.e. towards agricultural and rural activities that are less water-intensive per unit of output, and to increase the re-use of water in industry.\nClearly increasing the role of water pricing is necessary but not sufficient to ensure more efficient use of water. Government has recognized this and has started the process. But it will have to stay the course and steadily increase prices. At present, water prices are set administratively, without adequate and timely feedback, as would happen with market prices that reflected the balance between the costs of increasing supply versus benefits foregone if supply is not increased."}, {"section_title": "The Utility of Prices as a Signaling Device Can Be Increased If Markets to Trade Water Rights Can Be Implemented with Appropriate Safeguards /Complementary Actions to Address Public Goods", "text": "The average price of water increased from almost nothing, prior to 1980, to 0.038 USD per m\u00b3 in 1988, to 0.15 USD per m\u00b3 in 2003 53 . Recent decisions 54 suggest prices in some urban areas will be increased further in the next two years (e.g. in Beijing to 1.29 USD per m\u00b3 55 -nearly double the current price there). But the overall average price is still low both in terms of what is needed to reduce water wasted by households and industries (as noted earlier Chinese factories use 4-10 times as much water as factories in developed countries to produce an equal amount of goods), and by comparison with other countries where markets determine a larger proportion of prices -0.47 USD per m\u00b3 in South Africa, 0.51 USD per m\u00b3 in the USA, and 1.45 USD per m\u00b3 in Germany 56 .\nThere have been many studies exploring water-pricing reforms in China including different pricing methods (volumetric/marginal cost pricing; tiered pricing; two part tariffs <life-line plus commercial>; input-output pricing; per area pricing; etc.) 57 . Most have been theoretical. The 3H basin study included some estimates of price elasticity. But there have been no empirical studies of the impact on production (epecially in irrigation) of increasing prices or moves to increase cost recovery. Nor have there been any studies of willingness to pay. One study for irrigation 58 (Wang, etc., 2003; Li, etc. 2003 ; Jiang, 2000 ; Jia, 2000) \"A major water conservation program in irrigated agriculture is needed that focuses on increasing the agricultural production yield and economic value of production per unit of water consumed, while at the same time drastically reducing consumption. China has already made some progress in this regard, but a major escalation in effort is required. There is a need for a major program of agricultural research and training of technicians and farmers to increase yields and production value in conditions of partial supply and rain fed agriculture, as well as for full irrigation supplied areas. China's existing water savings program that focuses mainly on increasing irrigation system efficiencies is inadequate and partially misguided. Much of the water losses in existing irrigation systems returns to the surface or groundwater system, and reducing these losses also reduces these return flows.\nOften improving irrigation system efficiencies results in an increase in agricultural consumption of water and a decrease in return flows, and therefore results in more water consumption rather than less. The Bank supported Water Conservation Project, which began implementation in 2001 and the GEF Hai Basin Integrated Water and Environment Management Project focus on integrated irrigation, agriculture and on-farm management measures with the objective of increasing yields and value per unit of water consumed or in other words per unit of evapotranspiration (ET). These projects will develop and demonstrate ways to achieve this objective.\nMeasurement of water extracted from wells in irrigated areas is also usually not metered or charged for. One of the major principles to implementing an effective system of water conservation through demand management therefore will be implementing a system of measurement and volumetric charging at the lower ends of the irrigation delivery systems and in well systems. Water user associations (WUAs) can takeover responsibility for the operation and maintenance of lateral-level irrigation systems with good measuring devices installed and monitored at the point of delivery to these systems.\""}, {"section_title": "Box 4.1 (continued)", "text": "\"A third critical area of emphasis is the design and implementation of mechanisms that will facilitate the functioning of a system of tradable water rights. Such a system would make a major contribution to increasing the value of production per unit of water consumed in irrigated agriculture areas and to the reallocation of water from agriculture to priority uses. A significant amount of informal water trading already goes on in China. Chinese water law includes provisions for the issuing of water licenses, but the issuing and enforcing of water licenses in irrigation areas is not widespread. At each point of water measurement, a corresponding water right should be issued that includes: (a) a flow rate; (b) a total volume of allowable annual delivery/extraction; and (c) a total volume of allowable annual consumptive use. The sum of all of the consumptive use rights for a river basin or aquifer should not exceed the allowable total consumptive use in the basin or aquifer in order to have sustainable water resources use and management. Once the consumptive use water rights issued equal the allowable total consumptive use rights in a basin, no further water rights should be issued. No water diversion or well drilling/pumping should be permitted without a corresponding water right. Once a complete system of water rights/measurement is operational, then a system of tradable water rights could begin to function. To ensure maintaining a water balance and no negative impacts on third parties, the consumptive use right is the right that should be traded. All water rights trades should be registered and approved by the government authorities ensuring no impact on third parties. Without a complete system of consumptive use water rights and measurement, tradable water rights will not be able to aid in the reallocation of water within a sustainable water resources management system and therefore, trading in water rights should be restricted.\" \"The action plan recognizes the important social and political (including food security) implications of maintaining adequate water supplies to rural areas for agriculture. At the same time, the cost to the government of supplying large volumes of water to low valueadded agricultural activity is no longer sustainable. Thus, the action plan focuses on structural and nonstructural components.\nThe action plan recognizes the need to increase participatory mechanisms and to continue management reforms in order to develop innovative models for irrigation district management, including joint stockholder cooperatives, water supply companies, water user associations and self-financed irrigation and drainage districts. The proposed improvement components run in parallel with existing Chinese government programs, particularly the comprehensive agricultural development (CAD) program, the large irrigation district (LIS) program, and the water-saving program. These are focused on demand management, increased efficiency of water use, and appropriate pricing reviews without any augmentation of supply. The exception might be water supply derived from wastewater reuse schemes that may be available for market gardens in the peri-urban areas around cities. The action plan however calls for increased commitments to these objectives.\""}, {"section_title": "Addressing the Social Implications of Increasing the Role of Water Pricing", "text": "Moving towards economic pricing of water requires that one addresses the impact on vulnerable groups in a manner that does not undermine improvements in allocative efficiency.\nFor example, encouraging agriculture to shift out of water intensive activities (e.g. from wheat to livestock) through a steady increase in water charges could adversely affect many poor and vulnerable rural households. Essentially, as in the analysis on WTO Accession 59 removing implicit subsidies on a key input into agriculture (i.e. water), is likely to displace farmers and individuals with limited alternatives.\n\"Beijing farmers are generally far poorer than their urban cousins, rural water costs only 0.2 renminbi (Yuan) a cubic meter\u2026.but competition for resources is nevertheless growing as Beijing's urban suburbs expand, making the use of precious water in the fields increasingly irrational\" 60 . \"Farmers cannot compete economically with industry for water in China (or anywhere else). The arithmetic is stark. A thousand tons of water produces one ton of wheat, which has a market value of 1,600 Yuan ($200), while a thousand tons of water used in industry yields an estimated 112,000 Yuan ($14,000) of output, or 70 times 59 Anderson, Kym. 2002. 60 Holland, Lorien. 2000."}, {"section_title": "Box 4.2. (continued)", "text": "\"A key aspect that needs to be strengthened in conjunction with the participatory institutional and water price measures is water measurement and volumetric water charging. Although everywhere in China irrigation water charges are stated in terms of cubic meters of water use, in reality there is a major lack of adequate water measurement at the lower end of the irrigation systems and the actual calculation of the water charge is based on the irrigated area and an average water usage rate, rather than on a measured delivery amount. Although there are no accurate data that can be generalized, anecdotal data have shown in China that when transparent water measurement and volumetric charging are introduced in specific areas (i.e. where there are no major distortions due to water shortages) in conjunction with water user associations, there is a reduction in the amount of water used. The action plan includes a program to introduce and strengthen water measurement and volumetric charging in conjunction with water user associations.\nThe third part of the action plan for agriculture recommends that an integrated comprehensive approach be adopted in order to effect real water saving from the standpoint of the hydrological system. The integrated approach does not rely solely on engineering measures unlike the present National Irrigated Agricultural Water Saving Program, but instead focuses on (a) physical improvements to canal and on farm irrigation and drainage systems, (b) agronomic measures and (c) irrigation management measures.\" Source: Gunaratnum. 2004. p. 22 as much\" 61 . In other words, a rise in prices to reflect economic scarcity is more easily absorbed by industrial enterprises (and urban households) than by many farmers (and rural households) engaged in grain production 62 .\nThe competition for water could substantially reduce the acreage devoted to waterintensive, low value grain production 63 . Reducing grain production by 13 million tons would free up 13 bcm of water (at current water use productivity rates in grain production of 1 kg/cu m) which is equivalent to the current excess water use in the Hai basin. However, reducing grain production is at odds with the current policy of food (grain) selfsufficiency. The reduction in grain output will be less if water system efficiency improvements or implemented. For example, reducing evaporation and transpiration could double water use productivity and cut the amount by which grain production would have to be reduced. But even then, it could be difficult to fully reconcile the competing objectives of no reduction in grain production while eliminating water deficits.\nReturns to water use can be increased by shifting to higher value crops but this could displace some grain farmers lacking the skills or complementary resources (credit and technical assistance) to manage the cultivation of higher value commercial crops. Some of these displaced farmers and households can be absorbed in other non-farm rural activities. But many cannot. This will create a push factor, stimulating rural to urban migration. This will not be undesirable, if a couple of precautions are addressed and implemented:\nPrograms are introduced to facilitate rural to urban migration of vulnerable populations that cannot shift to other rural activities. These programs will have to also concentrate on providing assets to the rural poor (including education, training, improved property rights to access credit) so they have the skills to compete in urban labor markets (or become entrepreneurs in legal SMEs) and avoid falling below the poverty line again.\nNew urban centers are identified that can absorb the migrant population both to satisfy the need to increase overall economic productivity (agglomeration economies, etc.), but also the need to avoid the increasingly costly water scarcities in existing large metropolitan centers. With some important exceptions, encouraging urbanization (and new infrastructure development) in areas that are not water scarce, or likely to become water scarce, may be an efficient long-term strategy. As is evident from table 1.1 above there has been a dramatic demographic shift from rural to urban areas between 1980 and 2000 (with the urban share increasing from 19% to 36% and the rural shares declining from 81% to 64%) which is associated with a quadrupling of the urban share in total water demand. However, there has been no noticeable demographic shift from North to South (relative shares remaining almost constant at 42% and 58% respectively) 61 WWI. 2004. 62 Dinar, Ariel. 2004 . 63 China's water shortages could result in massive grain imports and higher global grain prices. (Lorien Holland 2000.) despite the growing water scarcities in the North 64 . This is an anomaly that requires further analysis --but lack of adequate price signals on the real economic costs of water could be one factor.\nEfforts are made to reduce the exposure to a set of risks that can arise if the poor rural migrant populations are forced to live on cheaper land (e.g. in vulnerable flood plains, or near polluted water basins).\nThus, to address water scarcities it is not going to be sufficient to focus just on economic efficiency criteria.

Allowing or encouraging continued urbanization also requires that the collateral damage associated with expanding urban water demand be lowered. Using freshwater would be less consequential if water abstracted upstream could be returned to river flows in good condition to be used again downstream. This can only be done if water polluted through urban and industrial use is treated appropriately first.

It is easier, to introduce water charges when scarcity has emerged but critical thresholds have not yet been crossed. It is more difficult to introduce water pricing and waste water charges when implicit rights have been acquired and critical thresholds crossed.\nTwo such thresholds in China are: (1) the lack of adequate water in rivers to ensure year round flows to flush the rivers, transport silt to the delta, and avoid ecosystem damage down stream -all of which are already occurring; and (2) the need to restore some, if not all the ground water, that has been over-pumped in the recent past. In both these cases, more water flow has to be restored to the ecosystem and aquifers.\nIt might be possible to do that by setting the price so high that existing users voluntarily renounce some of their water claims. But in the absence of water markets and well-defined water rights it may not be possible to fully restore the minimum requisite water abstracted from rivers that now run dry. More importantly, ecosystem needs are public goods and by definition difficult to include in water markets (today, when dry weather flows in rivers are \"Industries in urban areas would reduce waste production by use of cleaner technology and would dispose of wastewater, after removal of toxics, by reuse, discharge to environment, or discharge to municipal systems. Rural industries, including livestock operations and township and village enterprises (TVEs), represent a large pollution source that has been given little attention. Addressing the problem, the action plan would require livestock operators to utilize stabilization treatment ponds, and would require TVEs to utilize adequate treatment facilities for TVE types that can afford this, and otherwise plan for gradual phasing out of TVE types that cannot afford to comply. The overall pollution control program would also include attention to promoting adequate solid waste management in both urban and rural sectors, so that these wastes would not be left unmanaged and subject to being flushed into waterways by surface runoff.\nThe nonstructural part of the action plan for water pollution is equally ambitious. The main components include (a) review of water quality standards, both ambient and emission, and revision of these to be practicable and appropriate for use in China, including the 3-H basins, with emission standards based on mass rather than concentration units; (b) establishment of a permit system whereby municipalities can control waste discharges from industries, including effective monitoring and enforcement of their performance; (c) use of the environmental impact assessment process for all major waste polluters to reinforce the permit system operations; and (d) coordination of the basin water-quality monitoring programs operated by the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) and MWR to eliminate overlapping and to fill important gaps.\" Source: Gunaratnum. 2004. p. 23 low, water for environmental needs have to come from a reduction in irrigation). This will require institutional reforms as noted in box 4.4.\nOther investments in infrastructure such as a \"catchments reservoirs\" and watershed management in \"catchments basins\", e.g. through re-forestation, to stabilize damaging unevenness in water flows over time are other examples of supply oriented interventions that need to complement demand management policies where there are externalities and public goods involved.

Water Scarcity and Water Resource Development \"The proposed action plan recommends two key measures for demand management to reduce water demands to minimum feasible levels: (a) water price increases for all use sectors so that revenues would reflect cost of supply and scarcity, and (b) a series of measures for increasing water use efficiency in all sectors. These demand management measures alone, however, would not reduce demands sufficiently to match available basin supply. Hence the action plan proposes two key measures for augmenting supply, namely:\n(a) systematic increase in reuse of treated wastewaters. As shown by experience in industrial countries, treated municipal wastewaters represent a very valuable source of supplemental water supply for industrial raw water supply and for irrigation of urban area green zones and farming. Hence the action plan would incorporate provisions for planning of municipal sewerage systems to facilitate reuse. Such planned reuse would be subject to regulatory control by use of the permit system, to ensure attention to needs for protecting public health, (b) interbasin S-N transfer. Because such a transfer is very expensive, a primary goal of the action plan is to reduce the need for transfer to the minimum feasible levels by implementing demand management and institutional reforms, simultaneously with supply augmentation methods. With the supply augmentation measures it is also necessary to improve, rehabilitate and expand all city supply, wastewater treatment and drainage systems on the S-N transfer routes to ensure more efficient water distribution and drainage.\" Source: Gunaratnum. 2004. p.21.

Markets cannot totally replace administrative (quota) allocations for reasons that are well known and implicit in the recommendation above regarding public/private use of water. The balance between the two allocation mechanisms (administrative vs market) will be determined politically, though good technocratic analysis can inform the political debate.\n(3) Improve the institutions involved in water management --including better coordination of water use through invigorated river basin/watershed mgt commissions and greater involvement of communities in joint monitoring and enforcement through public disclosure schemes.\nTwo important ancillary recommendations are:\n(i) Increase urban water recycling through more reliable and cost-effective sewerage treatment, and\n(ii) Commission additional studies to analyse socio-economic options (such as willingness to pay/ ability to pay for different services in different locations) beyond those considered in the 2002 water study.\nIn summary, the biggest challenge will be for national and local governments to craft policies and rules within China's complex cultural and legal administrative system that provide incentives for users to increase efficiency of water use, and for polluters to clean up the water they use and return clean water to stream flows. Using a standard public economics framework, water requirements for public goods -such as ecosystem needsshould be set aside first, before allocating property rights in water (to enable water markets to function and generate efficient allocation signals 70 ). Even then, water markets will have to be regulated to ensure public goods, such as public health, are not compromised.
