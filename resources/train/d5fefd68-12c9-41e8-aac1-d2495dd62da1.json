[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract -As animal agriculture has evolved to larger production operations in subtropical regions of United States, the problems associated with manure handling, storage and disposal have grown significantly. Understanding the interaction effects of sustainable cow farming with water-table management, nutrient dynamics and water quality in pastures could be the key to reducing nutrients in runoff. Soils do not contribute equally to nutrient export from watersheds or have the same potential to transport nutrient to runoff nor would soil test levels accurately predict total dissolved nutrients. Better understanding of soil nutrient dynamics and crop nutrient changes resulting from different management systems should allow us to predict potential impact on adjacent surface waters. In many states, these issues are critical and of increasing importance among environmentalists, ranchers, and public officials particularly in the case of N and P. One of the first steps in assessing N or P level on any farm is to consider total N or total P inputs and outputs. In Florida, reduction of P transport to receiving water bodies is the primary focus of several studies because P has been found to be the limiting nutrient for eutrophication in many aquatic systems. Long-term monitoring of the changes in soil nutrients, especially soil P would enable us to predict soil chemical or physical deterioration under continuous forage-livestock cultivation and to adopt measures to correct them before they actually happen. Despite substantial measurements using both laboratory and field techniques, little is known about the spatial and temporal variability of nutrient dynamics across the entire landscape, especially in agricultural landscapes with cow-calf operations.\nbahiagrass / cow-calf / groundwater / surface water / groundwater / sustainability / nutrient cycling / plant uptake / water quality / subtropics / BMPs / eutrophication / trophic state index (TSI)"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Beef cattle (Bos taurus) pastures in subtropical regions of United States and other parts of the world are typically dominated by subtropical and tropical grasses such as bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum, Fl\u00fcgge) or bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon, L). The establishment and maintenance of persistent grass-legume pastures is a key option to increase productivity and profitability of beef cattle production systems. The development of effective grass-legume pastures for beef cattle production is a good option to improve nutritional value of the pastures, minimize N or P fertilizers input, and better manage nutrient cycling to enhance water quality. The greatest environmental concern with many grazing areas in Florida is level of soil P due to P accumulation in soil, and the subsequent loss of sediment-bound and soluble P in runoff. Our ability to estimate the levels and changes of soil P and other crop nutrients in subtropical beef cattle pastures has the potential to improve our understanding of P dynamics and nutrient cycling at the landscape level.\nThroughout the southeastern United States, grazinglands have considerable variability in soils, climate, and growing season, which not only affect the types of forage that can be grown, but also the overall environmental and biodiversity management. Grazing animals affect the movement and utilization of nutrients through the soil and plant system, and thus the fertility of pasture soils (Haynes and Williams, 1993) . Different pasture species may affect nutrient use and turnover due to seasonal timing of growth, root type, and forage types (Haynes, 1981; Wedin and Tilman, 1990; Stout et al., 1997) . Nutrient availability at watershed scale may control pasture growth and thus the number of domestic animals that can be supported. Increased nutrient availability, through fertilizer applications, and the subsequent increases in pasture production offer the potential for increased animal production (Haynes and Williams, 1993) . Society relies on adequate freshwater resources to support populations of people, agriculture, industry, wildlife habitat, aquatic ecosystems, and a healthy environment. Consequently, the interaction of pasture management and hydrology is important issue to environmentalists, ranchers, and public officials because it may affect nutrient dynamics and water quality.\nForage-beef cattle research programs must adopt an integrated approach that will lead to the development of appropriate sustainable pasture technologies that optimize beef cattle ranching profitability. Thus, both actual and perceived environmental problems associated with beef cattle production systems need to be addressed when new management systems are being developed. A key issue to be evaluated is how different livestock management practices impact the environment, including water quality, flora and fauna biodiversity, and soil and landscape integrity. Another equally important issue concerns the balance of fertility management for forage-livestock agro-ecosystem that may result in increased nutrient use efficiency and, therefore, less likelihood of nutrient loss to the environment due to leaching and/or runoff. Additionally, there is a heightened likelihood of P losses from over fertilized pastures through surface water runoff or percolation past the root zone (Gburek and Sharpley, 1998; Stout et al., 2000) .\nReduction of P transport to receiving water bodies has been the primary focus of several studies because P has been found to be the limiting nutrient for eutrophication in many aquatic systems (Botcher et al., 1999; Sigua and Tweedale, 2003) . Elsewhere, studies of both large (Asmussen et al., 1975) and small watersheds (Romkens et al., 1973; Hubbard and Sheridan, 1983) have been performed to answer questions regarding the net effect of agricultural practices on water quality with time or relative to weather, fertility, or cropping practices.\nRecent assessments of water quality status have identified eutrophication as one of the major causes of water quality \"impairment\" not only in the United States, but also around the world. In most cases, eutrophication has accelerated by increased inputs of P and/or N due to intensification of crop and animal production systems since the early 1990's. The current high demand for quality protein and fiber production because of increasing world population has resulted in an intensification of agricultural production systems. As animal-based agriculture has evolved to larger production operations in subtropical region of United States, the problems associated with manure handling, storage and disposal have grown significantly. This review article examines the following two key questions: (1) are forage-based animal production systems as suggested by regulators the major sources of non-point source nutrients pollution that are contributing to the degradation of water quality in lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and ground water aquifers? and (2) is properly managed cow-calf operations in subtropical agro-ecosystem would not likely be the major contributors to excess loads of N or P in surface water and/or shallow groundwater?"}, {"section_title": "Animal numbers, livestock operations and animal manure production in the United States", "text": "Data from the census of agriculture were used by Kellog et al. (2000) to make estimates of livestock populations in the United States. A census of agricultural producers is being conducted every five years by the United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service. The basic building block of the estimation process is an animal unit. For the purposes of this paper, an animal unit represents 1000 pounds or 450 kilograms of live animal weight. An example of animal units for beef and dairy cattle spatial distribution in the United States is shown in Figure 1 . For more detailed information related to spatial and temporal trends of animal units in the United States, the published report by Kellog et al. (2000) is highly suggested. They also reported the estimated amount nutrients (i.e., N and P excreted) based on manure production associated for livestock animals units.\nThe amount of manure N and P excreted in the United States are shown in Figures 2 and 3 . The annual amount of manure N and P production from beef cattle operations remained constant from 1982 to 1997 while manure N and manure P production for dairy cattle had shown slightly decreasing trend from 1982 to 1997. On the contrary, the manure N and manure P production from poultry operations showed a remarkable increasing trend from 1982 to 1997 (Figs. 2 and 3 )."}, {"section_title": "Overview: cow-calf operation and management in Florida", "text": "Eleven million ha of grazingland in the subtropical (23.5-30 \u2022 N Lat) United States supports about 30% of the U.S. beef cow herd. Florida's beef production ranks 10th among beef producing states in the United States and 4th nationally among states in number of herds with more than 500 brood cows. Florida's beef cattle had sales of more than $443 million in 2004. The majority of Florida's cow herd is located in the Kissimmee/Lake Okeechobee watershed, a place where the public is becoming more concerned about high levels of P entering the lake and subsequently flowing out into waterways and the Everglades.\nFlorida is a large state with a considerable variability in soils and climate. In north Florida, there are some clay-loam soils with good moisture-holding capacity that are quite productive (Chambliss et al., 2001) . Coming down the peninsula, soils are dominated by sandy ridges and flatwoods. In general, the flatwood soils with their higher moisture-holding capacity are more productive than the upland deep, droughty sands. The warm growing season is longer in south Florida than in north Florida while winter temperatures are usually lower in north Florida than in south Florida. These differences in climate, soils and length of growing season affect the types of forage that can be grown. Nevertheless, Florida's relatively mild climate, together with more than 127 cm of annual rainfall, affords a better opportunity for nearly 12 months of grazing than in any other state except Hawaii (Chambliss et al., 2001 )."}, {"section_title": "Pasture management: grazing and fertilization (typical in Florida ranches)", "text": "Bahiagrass is a common pasture used for beef cattle across Florida. Fertility and management practices have been based on University of Florida's recommendations as described by Chambliss (1999) . Pastures are being grazed during spring of the year. After the start of summer rainy season, pastures that are to be hayed are being dropped out of the grazing cycle (usually starting in July). Pasture fields with bahiagrass are normally fertilized in the spring with 90 kg N ha \u22121 and 45 kg K 2 O ha \u22121 . Grazing cattle at the United States Department of Agriculture Subtropical Agricultural Research Station in Brookville, FL and other Florida ranches are being rotated among pastures on a 3-day grazing interval with 24 days of rest between pastures. The average number of grazing cattle was about 2.9 animal units per hectare and grazing days of about 5.5 on monthly basis as shown in Table I . In addition, the number of days grazed each month, average number of animals per hectare and estimated total feces excreted along with the estimated total N in feces and from urine are also shown in Table I ."}, {"section_title": "Eutrophication associated with animal-based agriculture: overview", "text": "Eutrophication is frequently a result of nutrient pollution, such as the release of sewage effluent, urban stormwater runoff, and run-off carrying excess fertilizers into natural waters. Nutrients (e.g., N or P) and other pollutants may enter from a number of sources (Fig. 4) . However, it may also occur naturally in situations where nutrients accumulate (e.g. depositional environments) or where they flow into systems on an ephemeral basis. Eutrophication generally promotes excessive plant algal growth and decay, favors certain weedy species over others, and is likely to cause severe reductions in water quality (Schindler, 1974) .\nIn aquatic environments, enhanced growth of choking aquatic vegetation or phytoplankton (that is, an algal bloom) disrupts normal functioning of the ecosystem, causing a variety of problems such as a lack of oxygen in the water, needed for fish and shellfish to survive (Fig. 5 ). The water then becomes cloudy, colored a shade of green, yellow, brown, or red. Human society is impacted as well; eutrophication decreases the resource value of rivers, lakes, and estuaries such that recreation, fishing, hunting, and aesthetic enjoyment are hindered. Health-related problems can occur where eutrophic conditions interfere with drinking water treatment. Many drinking water supplies throughout the world may experience periodic massive surface blooms of cyanobacteria (Kotak et al., 1993) . These blooms contribute to a wide range of water-related problems including summer fish kills (Fig. 5) , and unpalatability of drinking water (Palmstrom et al., 1988) .\nIncreased loss of nutrients in agricultural runoff has potentially serious ecological and public health implications . Nitrogen and P are particularly important as both are implicated in aquatic eutrophication (Levine and Schindler, 1989) . Eutrophication and the associated ecological effects result in a general decline in overall water quality, restricting its use for general and drinking purposes (USEPA, 1988; Sharpley and Withers, 1994) ."}, {"section_title": "FORAGE-BASED COW-CALF OPERATION: EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND WATER QUALITY", "text": "Beef cattle operations have been suggested as one of the major sources of non-point source P and N pollution that are contributing to the degradation of water quality in lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and ground water aquifers in Florida (Allen et al., 1976 (Allen et al., , 1982 Bogges et al., 1995; Edwards et al., 2000) . Cattle manure contains appreciable amounts of N and P (0.6% and 0.2%, respectively), and portions of these components can be transported into receiving waters during severe rainstorms (Khaleel et al., 1980) . Work in other regions of the country has shown that when grazing animals become concentrated near water bodies, or when they have unrestricted long-term access to streams for watering, sediment and nutrient loading can be high (Thurow, 1991; Brooks et al., 1997) . Additionally, there is a heightened likelihood of N and P losses from overfertilized pastures through surface water runoff or percolation past the root zone (Schmidt and Sturgul, 1989; Gburek and Sharpley, 1998; Stout et al., 1998 Stout et al., , 2000 . Reduction of P transport to receiving water bodies has been the primary focus of several studies because P has been found to be the limiting nutrient for eutrophication in many Florida aquatic systems (Botcher et al., 1999; Sigua and Tweedale, 2003) . Recently, Sigua et al. (2004 Sigua et al. ( , 2006 found that the levels of soil P varied widely with different pasture management. Water quality in lakes associated with cattle production was \"good\", equivalent to 30-46 trophic state index (TSI) based upon the Florida Water Quality Standard. These findings indicate that properly managed livestock operations may not be major contributors to excess loads of nutrients (especially P) in surface water (Sigua et al. 2006) . In another study in south Florida, Arthington et al. (2003) reported that the presence of beef cattle at three stocking rates (1.5, 2.6, and 3.5 ha per cow) had no impact on nutrient loads (P and N) in surface runoff water compared with pastures containing no cattle. However, these studies should not be considered as definitive for the region because of the wide range in management options (fertilization, stocking rate, grazing system, forage type, etc.) that are used in beef cattle production systems. Whether or not nutrient losses from grazed pastures are significantly greater than background losses and how these losses are affected by soil, forage management, or stocking density are not well defined (Gary et al., 1983; Edwards et al., 2000; Sigua et al., 2004) . Concern for losses of soil P by overland flow were noted when soil P exceeded 150 mg kg \u22121 in the upper 20-cm of soil (Johnson and Eckert, 1995; Sharpley et al., 1996) . Sharpley (1997) noted that all soils do not contribute equally to P export from watersheds or have the same potential to transport P to runoff. In their studies, Coale and Olear (1996) observed that soil test P levels did not accurately predict total dissolved P. Better understanding of soil P dynamics and other crop nutrient changes resulting from different management systems should allow us to better predict potential impact on adjacent surface waters. These issues are critical and of increasing importance among environmentalists, ranchers, and public officials in the state (Sigua et al., 2006) ."}, {"section_title": "Impact of grazing cattle, cattle movement, and grazing behavior on water quality and the soil nutrient dynamics around and beneath cattle congregation sites", "text": "Understanding cattle movement in pasture situations is critical to assess their impact on agro-ecosystems. Movement of free-ranging cattle varies due to spatial arrangement of forage resources within pastures (Senft et al., 1985) and the proximity of water (Holechek, 1988; Ganskopp, 2001) , minerals (Martin and Ward, 1973) , and shade to grazing sites. The breed of the animal also affects livestock distribution pattern (Herbel et al., 1967) . Hammond and Olson (1994) and Bowers et al. (1995) reported that temperate British breeds (Angus and Hereford) of Bos taurus cows grazed less during the day than tropically adapted Senepol cows, but compensated for reduced grazing activity during the hotter parts of the day by increasing time spent grazing at night. Grazing animals congregate close to the shade and watering areas during the warmer periods of the day (Mathews et al., 1994 (Mathews et al., , 1999 . White et al. (2001) claimed that there was a correlation between time spent in a particular area and the number of excretions and this behavior could lead to an increase in the concentration of soil nutrients close to shade and water. Sigua (2004) demonstrated that concentrations of total inorganic N, total P and the degree of soil compaction varied significantly among different animal congregation sites. The highest concentrations of total inorganic N and total P were found at the shade and mineral feeder sites, respectively. The most compacted soil was at the mineral feeders' site. Although the levels of total inorganic N and total P were high near the center of the congregation sites, their levels did not increase with soil depth and their concentrations decreased almost linearly away from the center of the congregation sites. Soil compaction tended to decrease away from the center of the mineral feeder sites, but not at the water trough or shade sites. This study suggest that congregation sites in beef cattle operations in Florida are not as nutrient rich as suspected, and may not contribute more nutrients to surface and groundwater supply under Florida conditions because P levels at the center of sites were below 150 mg kg \u22121 (Sigua, 2004) . This concentration of soil P should not be considered an absolute maximum number for soil P to become harmful to water quality and the environment, but rather a good indicator of P accumulation in the soil. Furthermore, since there was no evidence of a vertical build up or horizontal movement of inorganic N or total P in the landscape, Sigua et al. (2005) surmised that cattle congregation sites may not be considered a substantial source of nutrients at the watershed level.\nGrazing animals impact the movement and cycling of nutrients through the soil and plant system, and thus on the fertility of pasture soils (Haynes, 1981; Haynes and Williams, 1993) . Grazing can accelerate and alter the timing of nutrient transfers, and increase amounts of nutrients cycled from plant to soil (Klemmendson and Tiedemann, 1995) . Long periods of time, position of shade and water resources for grazing cattle can influence the spatial distribution of soil biochemical properties including soil organic C and N, particulate organic C and N, microbial biomass, and net N mineralization (Ruess and McNaughton, 1987; Kieft, 1994; Kieft et al., 1998; Franzluebbers et al. 2000) . Long-term intensive grazing may decrease the input of organic matter into soils in the immediate vicinity of individual plants and eventually reduce nutrient concentrations beneath plants by limiting availability of photosynthesis and/or meristematic tissues necessary for growth (Milchunas and Lauenroth, 1993; Briske and Richards, 1995) . Thrash (1997) reported that concentration of large herbivores around the troughs negatively impacted the infiltration rate of the soils, with implications for the rate of soil loss and the soil moisture regime. Elsewhere, grazing, trampling, and dung deposition by large herbivores often result in a zone of decreasing impact on many vegetation and soil parameters including herbaceous vegetation basal cover, soil bulk density, and penetrability away from water points (Andrew and Lange, 1986; Thrash et al., 1991) . The effect of trampling appears to be less severe on vegetated grasslands than on poor or bare soil (Warren et al., 1986) . Studies on grazing and soil compaction generally find that exposure to livestock grazing compacts soil and that soil compaction increases with grazing intensity. This pattern is reflected in reviews of the scientific literature on the subject (Fleischner, 1994; Lauenroth et al., 1994; Kauffman and Krueger, 1984) ."}, {"section_title": "Effects of forage type and harvest method on above", "text": "ground net production, N and P uptake, and soil C, P, and N dynamics in subtropical pastures\nThe productivity of any ecosystem depends on the amounts of nutrients stored in various compartments, such as vegetation, litter, soil, and animal biomass, and on the rates of nutrient cycling and transfer among those compartments. The cycling of nutrients in a given ecosystem is affected by a combination of biological and physical processes (Holt and Coventry, 1990) . The relative importance of these processes varies considerably between ecosystems as a result of differences between climate, soils, vegetation, and management practices. Nutrient dynamics in various agro-ecosystems are continually evolving in response to changing management practices. Soil dynamics may continue to change in response to external abiotic perturbations such as global changes in temperature, precipitation, and CO 2 concentration (Janzen et al., 1997 (Janzen et al., , 1998 .\nDifferent pasture species affect nutrient use and turnover due to seasonal timing of growth, root type, and forage types (Wedin and Tilman, 1990; Stout et al., 1997) . Other researchers (Anderson and Coleman, 1985; Dormaar, 1992) also have attributed the amount of grassland soil organic matter to the amount of root biomass. Vegetation grazed by livestock is rapidly decomposed during digestion and many nutrients are returned to the soil in readily available forms in feces and urine (Laurenroth et al., 1994) ."}, {"section_title": "CASE STUDIES: EFFECTS OF GRAZING ON SURFACE WATER/SHALLOW GROUNDWATER QUALITY AND SOIL QUALITY (FLORIDA EXPERIENCES)", "text": "3.1.

These lakes are associated with forage-based beef cattle operations. The lakes were (1) Monthly water quality monitoring of lakes associated with beef cattle pastures was begun in 1993 and continued until 2002 by the field staff of the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD). Monthly water samples were taken directly from the lakes using a water (Van Dorn) grab sampler. Water quality parameters monitored were Ca, Cl, NO 2 + NO 3 -N, NH 4 -N, total N, total P, K Mg, Na, Fe, and pH. All sampling, sample preservation and transport, and chain of custody procedures were performed in accordance with an EPA-approved quality assurance plan with existing quality assurance requirements (USEPA, 1979; APHA, 1992) . The SWFWMD Analytical Laboratory, using EPA-approved analytical methods, performed the chemical analyses of water samples from the lakes (USEPA, 1979) .\nTrophic state index development and calculation. Lake trophic state index (TSI) is understood to be the biological response of a lake to forcing factors such as nutrient additions. Nutrients promote growth of microscopic plant cells (phytoplankton) that are fed upon by microscopic animals (zooplankton). The TSI of Carlson (1983) uses algal biomass as the basis for trophic state classification (e.g. oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic, and hypereutrophic).\nThe Florida trophic state index of Brezonik (1984) , which was derived using data from 313 Florida Lakes, was modified in the study. The first step involved in assigning a TSI value was to assess the current nutrient status based on TN/TP ratio of the lake. The TN to TP ratios were classified into three categories namely: N limited (TN/TP < 10:1); P limited (TN/TP > 30:1); and balanced (10:1 \u2264 TN/TP \u2264 30:1). The TSI of each lake that we studied was calculated by entering key water quality parameters: total P (TP, ug L \u22121 ); total N (TN, mg L \u22121 ); chlorophyll a (CHL, mg m \u22123 ) for the measurements of planktonic algae density, and Secchi depth (SD, m) for measuring water transparency into an empirical formula (Eqs. (1) to (3)). Equation (1) (P-limited) was used to calculate the TSI values for Lake Lindsey and Spring Lake while equation (2) (N-limited) was used to calculate the TSI value for Bystere Lake. A novel paper on trophic state index for lakes written by Carlson (1977) was an excellent reference to explain the mathematical derivations of the 638 G.C. Sigua \nInstrumentation and water sample collection. Two adjacent 8-ha pasture fields were instrumented with a pair of shallow wells placed at different landscape positions. The different landscape positions are top slope (TS; 10-20% slope, 2 ha; middle slope (MS; 5-10% slope, 2 ha and bottom slope (BS; 0-5% slope, 2 ha). The wells were constructed of 5 cm schedule 40 PVC pipe and had 15 cm of slotted well screening at the bottom. During installation of wells, sand was placed around the slotted screen, and bentonite clay was used to backfill to the soil surface to prevent surface water or runoff from moving down the outside of the PVC pipe and contaminating groundwater samples. A centralized battery-operated peristaltic pump was used to collect water samples. Wells were completely evacuated during the sampling process to ensure that water for the next sampling would be fresh groundwater. Water samples were collected from the groundwater wells every two weeks. However, there were periods when ground water levels were below the bottom level of the wells and samples could not be obtained. In addition to ground water samples, surface water samples were collected in the pasture bottoms or the seep area when present, by taking composite grab samples on the same schedule. The seep area, which is located at the lower end of BS is a remnant of a sinkhole formation and became a small scale lake with varying levels of surface water. The seep area of about 2 ha in size is where runoff and seepage from higher parts of pasture converge.\nWater sample handling and analyses. Water samples were transported to the laboratory following collection and refrigerated at 4\n\u2022 C. Water samples were analyzed for NO 3 -N and NH 4 -N using a Flow Injector Analyzer according to standard methods (APHA, 1989)."}, {"section_title": "Highlights of research results", "text": "Status of water quality in lakes. Assessment of water quality data from 1993 to 2002 confirms that water-quality variations (temporal and spatial) existed in lakes associated with beef cattle pasture systems in Central Florida. The lakes were found to differ from each other in Ca, NO 2 +NO 3 -N, TN, TP, K, Mg, Na, and Fe. Significant temporal variations were observed for NH 4 -N, TP, and Fe while significant interaction effects (lakes \u00d7 year) were only noted for NH 4 -N, TP, Mg, Na, and Fe.\nThe levels of NO 2 +NO 3 -N and NH 4 -N in lakes did not show any significant differences from 1993 to 2002 while TN of Bystere Lake declined from 1.12 to 0.76 mg L . With the continuous conversion of cropland and pastureland to residential use (although at slow pace), contribution of nutrients from anthropogenic sources is becoming a big concern environmentally over time for lakes associated with forage-based pasture systems.\nTotal nitrogen (TN)/total phosphorus (TP) ratio. Nitrogen and P are the primary crop nutrients that can impact the environment. When applied in excess of crop needs, nutrients can run off into surface waters resulting in excessive aquatic plant growth and toxicity to certain fish species. The TN/TP ratio may be a useful method to establish the N and P reduction targets in the environment . The ratio of TN to TP is one of the important components in calculating the TSI of lakes.\nSeveral studies have shown that a TN/TP ratio \u2264 10:1 appears to favor algal blooms, especially blue-green algae, which are capable of fixing atmospheric N (Schindler, 1974; Chiandini and Vighi, 1974; Sakamoto, 1966; . Figure 7 shows the TN/TP ratio of the lakes that were associated with beef cattle operations. Lake Lindsey and Spring Lake can be classified as P-limited lakes with TN/TP ratios of 41:1 and 51:1, respectively. Bystere Lake with a TN/TP ratio of 9:1 was classified as an N-limited lake and may have higher probability for algal bloom compared with Lake Lindsey and Spring Lake because of its higher P levels. From 1993 to 2002, the TP in Bystere Lake increased from 0.08 mg L \u22121 to 0.34 mg L \u22121 . Trophic state index of lakes (TSI). The Florida TSI was devised to integrate different but related measures of lake productivity or potential productivity, into a single number that ranges from 0 to 100. The measures included in the calculation of TSI are water transparency (Secchi depth), chlorophyll a (measurement of algae content), TN, and TP. The Florida TSI for Lake Lindsey, Spring Lake, and Bystre Lake were 35, 30, and 46, respectively (Fig. 8) . Based on this, the TSI of these lakes can be classified as \"good\" according to Florida water quality standard (TSI of 0-59 = \"good\"; TSI of 60 to 69 = \"fair\"; and TSI of 70 to 100 = \"poor\"). Although the TSI levels of the three lakes did not show any significant change from 1993 to 2002, TSI levels increased numerically for all lakes (Fig. 8) . This is reflected in a change in the trophic status of Bystere Lake. Lake Lindsey with TSI of 31 and 38 in 1993 and 2002, respectively, remained within the mesotrophic classification, while Spring Lake with TSI of 25 and 26 in 1993 and 2002, respectively, remained in the oligotrophic category. Lake Lindsey (mesotrophic lake) would normally have moderate nutrient concentrations with moderate growth of algae and/or aquatic macrophytes and with clear water (visible depth of 2.4 to 3.9 m).\nOligotrophic lake such as Spring Lake would normally have less abundance of aquatic macrophytes and algae, or both because nutrients are typically in short supply. Oligotrophic lakes tend to have water clarity greater than 3.9 m due to low amounts of free-floating algae in the water column.\nBystere Lake, which was at the upper end of the mesotrophic range in 1993 (TSI of 49), shifted into the slightly eutrophic state in 2002 with a TSI value slightly above 50. Eutrophic lakes normally have green, cloudy water, indicating lots of algal growth in the water. Water clarity of most eutrophic lakes generally ranges from 0.9 to 2.4 m. Generally, water quality in Lake Lindsey and Spring Lake was consis- tently good (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) while water quality of Bystere Lake ranged from good in 1993 to fair in 2002 (Fig. 8) .\n3.2.

These levels of NH 4 -N were lower than that of the surface Average concentrations of NO 3 -N in surface water and shallow groundwater (0.4 to 0.9 mg L \u22121 ) among the different sites did not exceed the drinking water standard for NO 3 -N (10 mg L \u22121 ). Nitrate levels in excess of 10 mg L \u22121 in drinking water can cause health problems for human infants, infant chickens and pigs, and both infant and adult sheep, cattle and horses. The relatively constant concentration of NO 3 -N in the shallow groundwater over the three years (2004) (2005) (2006) could be due to the combined effects of precipitation, N fertilization, and leaching from plant decomposition and animal feces and urine.

Thus, the establishment of complete, uniform stand of bahiagrass in a short time period is economically vital. Failure to obtain a high-quality bahiagrass stand early means the loss of not only the initial investment costs, but also both production and its cash value. Forage production often requires significant inputs of lime, N fertilizer and less frequently of P and K fertilizers. Domestic wastewater sludge or sewage sludge, composted urban plant debris, waste lime, phosphogypsum and dredged materials are examples of materials that can be used for fertilizing and liming pastures. Beef cattle producers throughout the United States need better forage management systems to reduce input costs and protect environmental quality.\nThe ability to reuse lake-dredged and domestic sewage sludge materials for agricultural purposes is important because it reduces the need for offshore disposal and provides an alternative to disposal of these materials in landfills that are already overtaxed. Often these materials can be obtained at little or no cost to the farmers or landowners. Thus, forage production offers an alternative to waste management since nutrients in the lake-dredged materials and biosolids are recycled into crops that are not directly consumed by humans. Results have shown the favorable influence that biosolids and lake-dredged materials had on bahiagrass during its early establishment in sandy subtropical beef cattle pasture areas in south central Florida.

Biosolids contain a substantial amount of N (typically 3 to 6 % by weight). The N is not immediately available to crops, but is released slowly by biological activity. Since biosolids are produce and handled by different processes at different treatment plants, it is important to know if those treatment processes affect how much N becomes available to plants. Nutrients in municipal residuals produced annually in the United States account for about 2.5% of the total N, 6% of the P, and 0.5% of the K applied on farms each year (Muse et al., 1991) .\nThe field experiment was conducted at the University of Florida Agricultural Research and Education Center, Ona, FL (27 1998, 1999, and 2000 , plots were mowed to 5-cm stubble and treated with the respective N source amendments. The experimental design was three randomized complete blocks with nine N-source treatments: ammonium nitrate (AMN), slurry biosolids of pH 7 (SBS7), slurry biosolids of pH 11 (SBS11), lime-stabilized cake biosolids (CBS), each applied to supply 90 or 180 kg N ha \u22121 , and a nonfertilized control (Control). Application rates of biosolids were calculated based on the concentration of total solids in materials as determined by the American Public Health Association SM 2540G methods (APHA, 1989) and N in solids. The actual amount of biosolids applications was based on the amount required to supply 90 and 180 kg N ha \u22121 . Sewage sludge materials were weighed in buckets and uniformly applied to respective bahiagrass plots.\nForage yield of bahiagrass was significantly (P 0.001) affected by the different biosolids in all years (1998 to 2002), but not by the interaction effects of year \u00d7 treatments.

Residual effects of AMN-90 (-6%), AMN-180 (-31%), SBS7-80 (-21%), and SBS7-180 (-17%) declined (negative) with time, but the residual effects of applied SBS11-180 (+13%), CBS-90 (+267%), and CBS-180 (+57%) were positive over time although sewage sludge application ceased after harvest in 2000. The percent forage yield change of bahiagrass fertilized with SBS11-180, CBS-90, and CBS-180 during years when sewage sludges were applied (1998) (1999) (2000) were 150%, 30%, and 70% compared with percent forage yield change of 170%, 110%, and 110% in 2002 (when sewage sludge applications ceased), respectively.\nThe residual effects on forage yield of applied CBS-90 (+267%) and CBS-180 (+57%) relative to the control increased with time although biosolids applications ceased after the 2000 harvest season. This was probably due to the higher concentration of organic N in addition to the liming property of CBS. Liming the field could have some direct and indirect effects on forage productivity and on the nutrient status of the soils. Perhaps the single direct benefit of liming is the reduction in acidity and solubility of aluminum and manganese (Peevy et al., 1972) . Some of the indirect benefits of liming pasture fields among others would include: enhancing P and microelement availability, nitrification, N fixation, and improving soil physical conditions (Nelson, 1980; Tisdale and Nelson, 1975; Russell, 1973) . Dried and composted biosolids have slower rates of N release and in case of CBS with much higher solids concentration (500 000 mg L \u22121 ); more N will be released in the second, third, or even the fifth year after the initial application due to higher amount of organic N than ammonium N. The proportions of ammonium and organic N in biosolids vary with the stabilization process."}, {"section_title": "Lake-dredged materials as nutrient source", "text": "The field study was adjacent to the Coleman Landing spoil disposal site in Sumter County, FL.

The development of effective grass-legume pastures for beef cattle production would improve nutritional value of the pastures, minimize N fertilizer input, and better manage nutrient cycling to enhance water quality. Improving the nutritional value of these grass pastures by the addition of legume will improve beef cattle gains in this region and impact both quantity and cost of the red meat supply in the United States and other parts of the world.\nThe establishment and maintenance of persistent grasslegume pastures is a key option to increase productivity and profitability of beef cattle production systems. Despite the great potential to improve sustainability of animal production, the adoption of technologies has been limited and slow. The integration of legumes (Arachis glabrata, Benth) and nonlegumes (bahiagrass, Paspalum notatum, Flugge) can produce synergistic effects that can minimize external inputs, particularly N fertilizers in agricultural ecosystems. There is a need to carry out research that will help to understand the different factors affecting the fixation and release of biologically fixed N to non-legume crops. The integration of legumes and non-legumes (grass) can produce synergistic effects that can minimize external inputs, particularly N fertilizers in agricultural ecosystems (Saikia and Jain, 2007; Rochester et al., 2001; Omay et al., 1998; Keisling et al., 1994; Oyer and Touchton, 1990) .\nSymbiotic N 2 fixation may provide N for the growth of legumes and eventually to intercropped plants, such as grasses through the transfer of N from the legumes. An increased understanding of the mechanisms of N transfer in grasslegume mixtures will help increase forage productivity. Nitrogen transfer if properly documented and quantified can lead to improved management systems and increased productivity of grass-legume mixtures (e.g., bahiagrass-peanut mixtures), while minimizing the use of inorganic N fertilizers. This will increase profits and decrease the impact of agriculture on the environment."}, {"section_title": "Managing nutrients across paddocks to improve water quality", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Nutrient balance", "text": "Nutrient balance in the ecosystem involves profitability of the agricultural enterprise and commitments to resource management to maintain quality of air, water and land resources. The role of nutrient management in livestock systems takes on new meaning as producers and the public together consider economic and noneconomic issues (Nelson, 1999) . The intensification of livestock production with its associated increased demand for fodder has encouraged farmers to rely more heavily on chemical fertilizers and imported feeds, and very often the waste is considered as a disposal problem rather than useful source of plant nutrients . It should be noted that for a farm to be sustainable, its P or N budget should balance, at least after soil reserves are brought up to desired levels for sustainable production. If there is a net loss of P or N, the farm's soils will eventually become depleted and if there is an excess, the likelihood of pollution is greater (Van Horn et al., 1996) . Effective use and cycling of P or N is critical for pasture productivity and environmental stability. Phosphorus or N (not shown) cycling in pastures is complex and interrelated and pasture management practices influence the interactions and transformations occurring within the P cycle (Fig. 11) . Increased loss of nutrients in agricultural runoff has potentially serious ecological and public health implications . Nitrogen and P are particularly important as both are implicated in aquatic eutrophication (Levine and Schindler, 1989) . Any approach that controls N and/or P losses from agriculture to water must begin with the long-term objective of increasing N and/or P efficiency by attempting to balance N or P inputs with N or P outputs within a watershed. Reducing N or P loss in agricultural runoff may be brought about by Best Management Practices (BMPs) that control the source and transport of N and/or P (Tab. VI).\nA review paper published by Shigaki et al. (2006) on animal-based agriculture options for the future contained excellent discussion on the source and transport management of nutrients in the watershed. Source management attempts to minimize the build-up in the soil above levels sufficient for optimum crop growth while transport management refers to efforts to control the movement of nutrients from soils to sensitive locations such as bodies of fresh water. As shown in Table VI , there are several measures available to minimize the potential for nutrient losses in agricultural runoff, which address sources and transport of P and/or N. Important measures to be considered are those that attempt to decrease the surplus of nutrients (P or N) in localized areas. Shigaki et al. (2006) suggested the following measures: (1) dietary P reduction; (2) feed additives that enhance P utilization by animals; (3) alternative uses for manure other than land application; and (4) transporting manure to P-or N-deficient areas."}, {"section_title": "Water quality best management practices (BMP) for Florida cow-calf operations", "text": "Although cow-calf operations in Florida are generally lowintensity agriculture with relatively low levels of pollutant discharged off-site, certain sites and management practices may contribute to violations of State water quality standards. Under these situations, cattle ranches may contribute elevated levels of P, N, sediments, bacteria and oxygen-demanding organic materials. The potential for discharges from cow-calf operations to cause water quality violations varies greatly, depending on soil type, slope, drainage features, stocking rate, nutrient management and other factors. In general, areas where cattle tend to congregate or have access to water bodies may have the greatest potential to contribute to water pollution (Sigua and Coleman, 2007) . Spearheaded by the Florida Cattlemen's Association (FCA) and drawn up in a unique partnership between producers and regulators, the BMP manual serves as both roadmap and vehicle to enhance and protect water quality in Florida.\nIn 1997, the Florida Cattlemen Association began drafting a common sense, economically-viable guidelines for production practices designed to protect water bodies and maintain compliance with the State of Florida water quality standards. The manual describes the water quality best management practices (BMPs) for beef cow-calf operations in Florida. The different practices are specifically targeted for beef cow-calf operations in Florida and the activities that normally occur in conjunction with beef cattle production. These are not rules or regulations, but voluntary best management practices for Florida ranches that consider good water quality conditions. The manual is heralded as a unique consensus document that outlines common sense, economically and technically feasible production and management practices that enhance and protect Florida's water resources. It is designed specifically for Florida's cow-calf operations; it does not apply to concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), which generally require a permit (see the 107-page BMP manual at http://jefferson.ifas.ufl.edu/old/agpages/cow_calf_bmp/ BMPManual.pdf). Although the manual was designed for statewide use in Florida, the general premise and principles can be adopted elsewhere."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Current pasture management including cattle rotation in terms of grazing days and current fertilizer (inorganic + manures + urine) application rates for bahiagrass pastures in subtropical regions of USA offer little potential for negatively impacting the environment. Properly managed livestock operations contribute negligible loads of total P and N to shallow groundwater and surface water. Overall, there was no buildup of soil total P and N in bahiagrass-based pasture. These observations may help to renew the focus on improving fertilizer efficiency in subtropical beef cattle systems, and maintaining a balance of P and/or N removed to P and/or N added to ensure healthy forage growth and minimize P or N runoff.\nContrary to early perception, forage-based animal production systems with grazing are not likely one of the major sources of non-point source P pollution that are contributing to the degradation of water quality in lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and ground water aquifers, but perennially grass-covered pastures are associated with a number of environmental benefits. Continuous grass cover leads to the accumulation of soil organic matter, sequestering carbon in the soil and thereby reducing the potential CO 2 accumulation in the atmosphere. The increase in soil organic matter is also related to soil quality, with improvements in soil structure, aeration and microbial activity. Effective use and cycling of N or P is critical for pasture productivity and environmental stability. In addition to speeding up N or P recycling from the grass, grazing animals can also increase N or P losses in the system by increasing leaching potential due to concentrating N into small volumes of soil under dung and urine patches, redistributing N or P around the landscape, and removal of N or P in the form of animal products.\nThe overall goal efforts to reduce N or P losses from animalbased agriculture should be to balance off-farm P inputs in feed and fertilizer with outputs to the environment. Source and transport control strategies can provide the basis to increase N and P efficiency in agricultural systems.\nOverall,\n\u2022 Forage-based animal production systems as suggested by regulators are not the major sources of non-point source nutrients pollution that are contributing to the degradation of water quality in lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and ground water aquifers; and \u2022 Properly managed cow-calf operations in subtropical agroecosystem would not likely be the major contributors to excess loads of N or P in surface water and/or shallow groundwater."}]
