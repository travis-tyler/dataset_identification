[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Most children enter kindergarten when they are 5 years of age and move into first grade when they are 6. This time period is marked by great developmental change (Sameroff and Haith 1996), and children differ in what they can and cannot do socially, physically, and cognitively. Therefore, parents and educators are concerned whether certain children will have the knowledge and skills at age 5 to succeed in kindergarten. Over the years, policies and practices have emerged that are intended to improve children's early school experiences by giving them more time to develop and mature (e.g., changing age of entry requirements, transitional grades, readiness testing). Two such kindergarten enrollment strategies are retaining children for a second year of kindergarten and delaying the start of their first year of kindergarten. This report uses data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) to examine the relationship between kindergarten enrollment status (e.g., repeating kindergarten or delaying entry into kindergarten) and children's spring first grade reading and mathematics achievement."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "For the most part, children must be 5 years old to enroll in kindergarten (Education Commission of the States 1999). Based on school regulation and the child's development, parents and schools make decisions about when children should begin kindergarten; a child may start kindergarten when age-eligible, wait a year, or start early relative to the age requirements. In addition to timing children's first entry into school, parents and educators make promotion decisions about children at the end of the school year; some children go on to the next grade while others repeat kindergarten. Given these factors, the U.S. kindergarten population can be grouped according to their enrollment status. \u2022 Every school year there are children who repeat kindergarten. Some children repeat due to academic and/or social concerns while others are in their second year of a 2-year kindergarten program (e.g., junior kindergarten, developmental kindergarten, kindergarten plus). 1 Children who repeat kindergarten are often older than most of their new classmates who are beginning kindergarten for the first time. \u2022 Some non-repeating children begin their first year of kindergarten a year later than is typical. These children were age-eligible for kindergarten the previous year and were likely held out by their parents to allow an extra year to mature or perhaps because of developmental difficulties. Delayed entry kindergartners are beginning their first year in formal schooling; however, since their entry was delayed, they tend to be older than their peers beginning kindergarten on time."}, {"section_title": "_____________________________________________________________________", "text": "1 At times, schools will refer to a second year of kindergarten with a school-specific term, such as \"transition K.\" If the parent reports this as repeating kindergarten (e.g., a second year of kindergarten) then the children are counted as repeaters in this report. \u2022 The majority of kindergartners (88 percent) begin formal schooling when they are old enough according to age requirements for their school or school district. These firsttime, on-time kindergartners tend to be born in the months that usually define age eligibility (e.g., the children are five years of age by September, October, November, or December, depending on the cut-off of the state) but could also include children who just missed most schools' or districts' age cut-off for the previous year (meaning, these children may be slightly older than their classmates, but are still considered first-time, on-time kindergartners). Both repeat (retention) and delayed entry practices are largely grounded in the belief that more time will allow children to arrive better prepared for school academically and socially (Ilg and Ames 1965;Kundert, May, and Brent 1995). For example, if kindergarten children do not achieve the knowledge, skills, and social maturity deemed necessary for first grade, attending a second year of kindergarten will allow them time to gain these skills. This is done in hopes that retaining them in kindergarten will prevent later school failure without negative social consequences (Dennebaum and Kulberg 1994;Shepard 1989). Some parents choose to delay their child's entry to kindergarten so that they will perhaps have an advantage over their on-time, younger classmates (Meisels 1992;Shepard and Smith 1988). The effectiveness of these practices, retention in particular, however, has been called into question (Dennebaum and Kulberg 1994;Kundert, May, and Brent 1995;Reynolds 1992). Some research has shown kindergarten repeaters perform worse in their second year of kindergarten than promoted peers who were recommended for retention in kindergarten (Dennebaum and Kulberg 1994), perform no differently than delayed-entry children later in school (e.g., second and fifth grade) (Kundert, May, and Brent 1995), and perform worse in reading and mathematics in fourth grade (Reynolds 1992). Other researchers suggest retention may have short-term benefits. Children appear to make larger cognitive gains in the year they repeat as compared to their first year through a grade (e.g., first-grade retention as studied by Alexander, Entwisle, and Dauber 1994). Recently, a review of the existing research note the need for future research that considers child and program characteristics when evaluating outcomes of retention and delayed entry practices (Jimerson 2001). These research findings have led many investigators to draw competing and even conflicting conclusions regarding grade retention and delayed entry."}, {"section_title": "Types of Comparisons", "text": "Conclusions depend on one's perspective on the practice's intended purpose (e.g., delaying for advantage versus retaining to allow the child to reach grade level achievement). The research on kindergarten retention and delayed entry usually takes one of two approaches-same age versus same grade comparisons. Same age comparisons examine the performance of retained or delayedentry children relative to \"promoted\" peers of the same age (i.e., in a different grade). Same grade comparisons investigate how retained or delayed-entry children are performing relative to their peers in the same grade. For example, one study, using both the same age and same grade approach, found that retaining children or holding them out a year does not produce lasting academic advantages, and retaining children may have potentially negative social consequences (Dennebaum and Kulberg 1994). Since these children perform no differently than children who are promoted or their current classmates, the study's authors concluded that retention and delayed entry practices should be discontinued. In another example, using the same age approach, researchers found that children who repeat a grade or whose entry is delayed perform similar to their on-time classmates and promoted peers, albeit 1 year later. In this case, researchers interpreted their findings as support for the effectiveness of these practices (Alexander, Entwisle, and Dauber 1994). This report uses the same grade approach. The same grade approach allows comparisons to children's current classmates with whom they will most likely spend future school years. This permits conclusions concerning the retained or delayed entry child's mastery of material for a given grade level as compared to the majority. The same grade approach can also be used to compare children to how their promoted peers did the year previously. If children who repeat kindergarten or whose entry is delayed perform similarly to promoted peers, this provides information on their achievement relative to a grade before moving on. Comparing children to promoted peers in another grade (i.e., same age approach) does not provide information on how well children mastered current grade skills. Same grade comparisons may be more appropriate than same age comparisons because they focus on achievement for the same type of material, but these comparisons still have limitations. In this approach, the children being compared are no longer the same age. The child repeating kindergarten or whose entry is delayed is generally 1 year older than his/her current classmates and generally 1 year older than their promoted peers were in the previous year when in that grade. The retained child has also had 2 years of exposure to the kindergarten setting and educational materials. Findings using this approach tend to find short-term benefits for retention (e.g., higher performance), with benefits diminishing over time (Peterson, DeGracie, and Ayabe 1987). This report takes a same grade approach by comparing children who repeat kindergarten and children whose entry is delayed to their classmates who are entering kindergarten for the first time, on time (i.e., when age-eligible)."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "This report is framed around the following research questions: \u2022 How prevalent is kindergarten retention? How prevalent is the practice of delayed kindergarten entry? \u2022 Do children in these different enrollment groups vary in terms of child and family characteristics (i.e., sex, age at time of assessment, children's race/ethnicity, presence of a diagnosed developmental difficulty, family poverty status, parental education, preschool experience, and kindergarten program type (i.e., half-day or full-day))? \u2022 What is the relationship between children's kindergarten enrollment status and children's first grade reading and mathematics achievement?"}, {"section_title": "Data Source", "text": "The ECLS-K is a nationally representative sample of approximately 21,000 children who entered kindergarten in the fall of 1998.

Sampling for the ECLS-K was based on a dual frame, multi-stage sampling design. The first stage of sampling involved the selection of 100 primary sampling units (PSU, counties or groups of counties) from a national sample of PSUs.

They are also more likely than children who entered on time to be in full-day kindergarten programs during their retention year (i.e., second year of kindergarten) (73 versus 56 percent). These findings are consistent with previous research (Zill, Loomis, and West 1997). While earlier research suggests that children who repeat kindergarten may be more likely to be racial/ethnic minorities, the current analyses found detected no differences in the extent to which Black children were represented among repeaters compared with the on-time group (table 1). 4,5 Children whose kindergarten entry was delayed are more likely than children who started on time to be male (60 versus 49 percent); more likely to be White (72 versus 64 percent) (consistent with earlier findings in Zill, Loomis, and West 1997); and are less likely to have attended preschool the year prior to kindergarten (65 versus 71 percent) (table 1).

Therefore, this part of the analysis focuses on children's spring first grade achievement by their kindergarten enrollment status. Achievement is measured by children's overall scale scores and three specific skills in reading and mathematics at the end of first grade. 8 In reading, children who repeated kindergarten 6 Over 90 percent of children were assessed in a 2-month period at each data collection.

Readers should not draw causal inferences from the regression results in this report, since apparent relationships can change based on the particular independent variables examined. Also, the current study does not allow the examination of how delayed-entry children would have performed in kindergarten one year earlier when they were eligible to start school. 8 The ECLS-K cognitive battery was designed as a kindergartenfirst grade assessment.

When such factors as children's initial achievement, sex, age, family poverty status, and kindergarten program type (e.g., full-day) are controlled, 9 children who repeated kindergarten demonstrate lower overall reading knowledge and skills (table 3). Children who repeated kindergarten also appear less likely to possess specific reading skills that are typical of first grade (i.e., understanding the letter-sound connection at the end of word, sight-word recognition, and understanding words in context) (table 3). Similar associations exist in mathematics by enrollment status (table 4). Children who repeated kindergarten demonstrate lower overall mathematics knowledge and skills (table 3). Children who repeated kindergarten also appear less likely to possess specific mathematics skills that are typical of first grade (i.e., ordinality, addition and subtraction, multiplication and division) (table 4).

Children whose kindergarten entry was delayed also appear more likely to possess certain specific reading skills, typical of first-graders (i.e., understanding the letter-sound connection at the end of word and understanding words in context) and less likely to possess others (i.e., sight word recognition) (table 3). In mathematics in the spring of first grade, opposite associations exist than described in reading.

Among the findings in this report are: \u2022 The percentage of children who repeat kindergarten or experience delayed school entry appears consistent with previous estimates (Graue and DiPerna 2000;Zill, Loomis, and West 1997), with approximately 5 percent of children repeating kindergarten and 6 percent starting kindergarten a year later when first age-eligible. \u2022 Children who repeat kindergarten, start kindergarten late, and who start on time differ in several important ways: -Children who repeat kindergarten are more likely to come from less advantaged backgrounds; more likely to have parents with less than a high school education; more likely to be living in poverty; less likely to have attended preschool; more likely to have attended full-day kindergarten programs during the 1998-99 school year; and, are more likely to have a diagnosed developmental difficulty than children who entered kindergarten on time (table 1). -Children who started kindergarten late (i.e., delayed entry) were more likely to be male; more likely to be White; more likely to have more educated parents (i.e., bachelor's degree or higher); and less likely to have attended preschool than children who entered on time (table 1). \u2022 At the end of first grade, children who repeated kindergarten have lower reading and mathematics knowledge and skills than those who started on time (tables 3 and 4). \u2022 At the end of first grade, children whose kindergarten entry was delayed demonstrate slightly higher reading knowledge and skills than those who started on time (table 3). In mathematics at the end of first grade, children whose kindergarten entry was delayed kindergarten are behind their classmates who began kindergarten on time (table 4). Retaining children for a second year of kindergarten is based on the belief that the additional time will allow children to gain the cognitive and social skills necessary for first grade and later elementary school. However, by as early as the end of first grade, children who repeated kindergarten demonstrate reading and mathematics knowledge and skills below their non-retained kindergarten classmates.

The assessment included two cognitive domains (reading and mathematics). The ECLS-K battery was a twostage assessment approach, in which the first stage in each domain contained a routing test that determined a child's approximate skills. According to the child's performance on the routing test, the child was administered the appropriate skill level assessment for that domain (the second stage). The reading and mathematics assessments had three skill levels. In each round, children were administered the routing stage and the appropriate skill level stage in the fall of kindergarten, the spring of kindergarten, and the spring of first grade. (For more information on the cognitive assessment refer to Rock and Pollack 2002). reading and mathematics in all three data collections are as follows (IRT-based theta): reading = .9, mathematics = .9. Proficiency probability scores. Proficiency scores provide a means of distinguishing status or gain in specific skills within a content area from the achievement measured by the IRT scale scores. Clusters of four test questions having similar content and difficulty were included at several points along the score scale of the reading and mathematics tests. A child was assumed to have mastered a particular level of proficiency if at least three of the four items in the cluster were answered correctly, and to have failed at this level if two or more items were wrong. Clusters of items provide a more reliable test of proficiency than do single items because of the possibility of guessing. It is very unlikely that a child who has not mastered a particular skill would be able to guess enough answers correctly to pass a four-item cluster. These scores are computed using performance in each subject. The nature of the two-stage test is that not all children receive all items. To calculate proficiency estimates for all children, an IRT model was employed. For the purpose of IRT calibration, the item clusters were treated as single items. The hierarchical nature of the skill sets justified the use of the IRT model in this way. Gains in probability of mastery at each proficiency level allow researchers to study not only the amount of gain in total scale score points but also where along the scale different children are making their largest gains in achievement during a particular time interval. In reading, the proficiency levels are named as follows: (1) letter recognition, (2) beginning sounds, (3) ending sounds, (4) sight words, and (5) words in context. Letter recognition is as it sounds-the ability of children to recognize their letters. Beginning sounds and ending sounds refer to children's ability to understand the letter-sound relationship at the beginning and at the ending of words. Sight words refer to children's ability to recognize whole words by sight and read them aloud. Words in context refer to children's ability to read simple short passages of text with a missing word, and insert the correct missing word. In mathematics, the proficiency levels are named as follows (their names reflect the most complex mathematical construct contained in the proficiency): (1) number and shape, (2) relative size, (3) ordinality and sequence, (4) add/subtract, and (5) multiply/divide. Number and shape refers to children's ability to recognize single-digit numbers and basic shapes. Relative size refers to children's ability to count beyond 10, recognize the sequence in basic patterns, and compare the relative size of objects. Ordinality and sequence means that children can recognize two-digit numbers, identify the next number in a sequence, and identify the ordinal position of an object. Addition and subtraction means children can perform simple addition and subtraction problems. Multiplication and division refers to children's ability to perform simple multiplication and division operations. The addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division items are presented in the form of word problems with picture support and in numerical statements."}, {"section_title": "Derived Variables", "text": "A number of variables used in this report were derived by combining information from one or more questions in the ECLS-K parent questionnaire or from other study sources.

For these first-time kindergartners, if parents reported waiting to enroll their child in kindergarten, the child's enrollment status was defined as delayed entry; if parents reported enrolling their child when old enough, the child's enrollment status was defined as on time. 16 [variable derived for this report, not presented on data file] Children's sex. This variable was constructed by comparing information provided by the parents as part of the parent interview and information from staff in the field (via the field management system) who administered the direct assessments. If parent interview information was missing, this variable was completed by relying on information from the field management system."}, {"section_title": "[GENDER]", "text": "Children's age at entry to kindergarten (fall 1998). This variable used two variables-month and year of birth-to determine the child's age at the beginning of the 1998-99 school year. For first-time kindergartners (i.e., those who entered on time or who experienced a delayed entry), this variable refers to their age at entry into kindergarten. For children repeating kindergarten, this variable refers to their age at the start of their second year of kindergarten. The month and year of birth variables were combined to form five categories: children age 4 16 Independent information collected from parents during the kindergarten year children's teachers provided information on their classrooms. One of the pieces of information the teacher provided was a description of the classroom in terms of grade. Teachers could indicate whether the classroom was a regular kindergarten classroom, the first year of a two-year kindergarten program, the second year of a two-year kindergarten program, transitional kindergarten, transitional first grade, ungraded class, and/or multigraded class. This report relied on parent information and did not include or exclude children from certain definitions the parent provided based on the teacher's description of the classroom. In terms of the analytic sample used in this report, of the 12,495 children, about 82 children (unweighted) were classified by the teacher as attending a transitional kindergarten program (first year of a two year program; second year of a two year program; a transitional program) or a transitional first grade program. Of these 82 children, 25 were classified by their parents as being retained, 7 as delayed, and 50 as on time. years, 8 months through 4 years, 11 months (born September-December 1993) when they entered kindergarten; children age 5 years, 0 months through 5 years, 3 months (born May-August 1993) when they entered kindergarten; children age 5 years, 4 months through 5 years, 7 months (born January-April 1993); children age 5 years, 8 months through 5 years, 11 months (born September-December 1992); and children age 6 years, 0 months through 6 years, 7 months (born January 1992-August 1992). When deriving this variable, September 1, 1998 was assumed to be the school start date for all children. [variable derived for this report, not presented on data file] Children's race/ethnicity. The race/ethnicity composite (RACE) was constructed from two parent-reported variables: ethnicity and race. New Office of Management and Budget guidelines (1997) were followed under which a respondent could select more than one race. Thus, each respondent had to identify whether the child was Hispanic, and then select one or more races. The following are the five composite race/ethnicity categories presented in this report: White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, Asian, and Other (which includes Pacific Islanders, American Indians, Alaska Natives, and multiracial children). When race/ethnicity differences are presented in this report, White refers to White, non-Hispanic and Black refers to Black, non-Hispanic. Each child belongs to only one of these five categories. [variable derived for this report, not presented on data file] Developmental difficulty. The variable used in this report is based on the recommended revision of the ECLS-K P4DISABL composite variable presented on the file. It was derived from information collected in the Child Health and Well-Being section of the spring first grade parent interview. Questions in the parent interview asked about the child's ability to pay attention and learn, overall activity level, ability to communicate, difficulty hearing and understanding speech, and eyesight if not correctable with eyeglasses. For each condition, a question was asked about whether a diagnosis was obtained. Additionally, a question was also asked about receipt of therapy services. The composite variable was coded 1 (Yes) if any of the diagnosis variables or therapy services were coded 1 (Yes). [variable derived for this report, not presented on data file] Poverty status. In this report, poverty status reflects being below the federal poverty threshold in both the kindergarten (WKPOV_R) and first grade (W1POVRTY) years. The poverty variables were created using household income and family size. Income was compared to Census poverty thresholds, which vary by household size. Households whose income fell below the appropriate threshold were classified as poor. The thresholds in the kindergarten year were based on 1998 Census information, where a household of four with a total household income below $16,655 was considered to be in poverty. The thresholds in the first-grade year were based on 1999 Census information, where a household of four with a total household income below $17,029 was considered to be in poverty. If children were living below the federal poverty threshold in both kindergarten (WKPOV_R=1) and first grade (W1POVRTY=1), their poverty status was defined as below poverty threshold. If children were living at or above the threshold at either kindergarten or first grade or at both rounds, children's poverty status was defined as at or above poverty threshold. [variable derived for this report, not presented on the data file] Parental education. This variable was constructed using the questions on the highest grade the child's mother or female guardian or father or male guardian had completed, and whether the mother or female guardian or father or male guardian had obtained a high school equivalency degree if he or she did not complete high school. This report uses the data gathered during the kindergarten year as analyses included children's achievement during the kindergarten year. This information was collapsed into four categories: less than high school, high school or equivalent, some college including vocational/technical training, and bachelor's degree or higher. [WKPARED] Preschool experience. This variable was created through information in the fall kindergarten Child Care section of the parent interview. Preschool experience was defined as children's participation in either a center-based arrangement or Head Start program in the year prior to kindergarten. The preschool experience variable was coded yes if either one or both of the child care variables (P1CPREK, P1HSPREK) were yes (1). [variable derived for this report, not presented on data file] Fall 1998 kindergarten program type. This report refers to two types of kindergarten programs: full-day (or all day) and half-day (AM only or PM only). This variable was created using two composites that collected information on class type (AM, PM, or all-day). One composite derived class type from the fall kindergarten teacher questionnaire part A (A1CLASS). A second composite derived class type from the field management system that was used by field staff to schedule in-school child assessments (F1CLASS). Fall kindergarten program type was coded full-day if A1CLASS was 3 (all-day kindergarten) and was coded halfday if A1CLASS was 1 or 2 (AM or PM kindergarten). If A1CLASS was missing for a child, then F1CLASS was used to code fall kindergarten program type. If A1CLASS was missing and F1CLASS was 3 (all-day), kindergarten program type was coded full-day. If A1CLASS was missing and F1CLASS was 1 or 2 (AM or PM), kindergarten program type was coded half-day. [variable derived for this report, not presented on data file] 1 For children who repeated kindergarten in the 1998-99 school year, estimates for age of school entry and kindergarten program type are for the year they repeated kindergarten, not their first year in kindergarten. 2 A child with a developmental difficulty is defined as one whose parents noted by first grade obtaining a diagnosis from a professional for problems related to attention, activity, communication, hearing, or sight that could not be corrected with eyeglasses. 3 Poverty status here refers to the child's family status for both kindergarten and first grade. Below poverty threshold includes children whose family household income is below the federal poverty threshold in both the kindergarten and first-grade years. 4 Preschool experience was defined by children's attendance in either a center-based arrangement or in Head Start during the year prior to kindergarten. NOTE: Estimates are for kindergartners from the 1998-99 school year who did not enter school early that year and who were promoted to first grade. Estimates are based on only those children who were given the ECLS-K direct cognitive assessment in English. Details may not sum to totals because of rounding.
