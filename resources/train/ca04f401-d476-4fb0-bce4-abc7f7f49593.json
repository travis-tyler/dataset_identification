The purpose was to investigate which combination of factors was the best predictor of students' scores and the differences between male and female students' performance. Only intelligence, as measured by the Raven Standard Progressive Matrices test, correlated with the scores on the PSU. Males from voucher schools outperformed females on the PSU.

The acquisition of high-order skills and knowledge to succeed at a professional level has been a growing demand in globalized societies.\nAccess to higher education has been a matter of concern for many developing countries that wish to diminish the performance gap between students who come from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Students in countries such as Chile have significantly increased their access to college over the past 20 years; for example, in 2006 in Chile, 561,000 more students entered college than in 1980 (OECD, 2009) . From the population of students who have taken the official university selection test (Prueba de Selecci\u00f3n Universitaria, or PSU), 60% came from families in the lowest socioeconomic levels (monthly income equal to or below US$215). However, these students did not achieve the necessary scores to have access to high-quality colleges and universities.\nThe relationship between socioeconomic status and scores attained on the PSU is shown in Table 1 . From the students in the lowest socioeconomic status (B1) who took the test, 42% achieved less than 450 points; with such a low score, a student could not apply to any traditional university (i.e. public and renowned institutions). Only 8.7% of the low-income students attained more than 600 points and 0.7% of them achieved over 700 points. Scores are indeed relevant considering that students would be able to select the college and major of their choice only if they have achieved a score between 550 and 600 (OECD, 2009) . Below that average score, students were placed on waiting lists and sometimes they had to choose a major that required lower PSU scores (but was not their first choice), had to postpone their entrance to college or had to choose a private university in which students did not need a minimum entrance score. However, tuition rates in these institutions were considerably higher than in public universities, making them a non-viable option for students from a low SES. On the other side, only 7% of students from families with a high SES did not achieve the minimum scores required for college entrance, which meant that 93% of these students had access to higher education in public and renowned institutions.\nSocioeconomic status has been one of the factors affecting students' entrance to college. This variable could jeopardize the access that a student could have to higher education, even if he or she had the needed academic capacities or talents (Perna, 2006) . Therefore, gifted students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, for example, could have fewer chances to attend college than their gifted peers from higher socioeconomic backgrounds. 42  25  14  7  450-600 points  49  56  24  41  601-700 points  8  16  57  39  Over 700 points  1  2  5  13  Total  100  100  100  100 Factors affecting college readiness College admission tests A topic that has been investigated by several authors as affecting students' performance on admission tests has been the significant performance gap among students who attend private, voucher (charter), and public schools (Brunner, 2008) . This has been more evident in Latin American countries, such as Chile, where the achievement gap between public and private education has been extremely large. It has been discussed that teachers in public schools did not address the minimum curricular content that students needed to succeed on a content-based assessment such as the PSU. For example, even if a student was gifted, the lack of academic preparation in his or her public school could become an obstacle preventing admission to college. Therefore, curriculum and instruction could be critical, given that quality of high school preparation was one of the most important factors for a successful transition from high school to college (Adelman, 2006) ."}, {"section_title": "Contextual variables", "text": "In Chile, educators, practitioners, and politicians have debated for several years about the quality of public, voucher, and private schools. Public schools have been defined as entities administered by local governments to provide free education for all students. Voucher schools received government funding but included a co-payment for students' tuition. Finally, private schools did not receive public funding, and the students' families paid for the complete tuition. Approximately 40% of the families of students who attended public schools were from a low or medium-low SES (Brunner and Elacqua, 2003) . Students educated in private schools have had higher scores on achievement tests than their counterparts from public schools. Some examples of this disparity have been the scores achieved by students on international tests such as the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) (OECD, 2009) , and national test scores, for example the national measurement system of the quality of education, Sistema de Medici\u00f3n de Calidad de la Educaci\u00f3n (SIMCE). Several complex factors contributed to this achievement gap. The cultural capital of the students has been defined by authors as one of the critical components of school success, meaning that students from advantaged backgrounds (i.e. educational advantage) tended to have better academic performance than their peers who were less educationally advantaged (Wildhagen, 2009) .\nAnother factor that affected the gap between private and public schools has been the appropriateness of the school curriculum (Contreras et al., 2007) . One of the reasons for the academic disadvantage of students in public schools has been that the national curriculum could not be fully addressed. In the case of private schools, students not only completed the national curriculum, but they also did it earlier than students in public schools, which left them more time to prepare intensively for the university admission test (OECD, 2009) than their counterparts from public schools.\nIncome level has been conceptualized as a socioeconomic variable that has been explored widely in several studies of student achievement. Researchers have concluded that the socio-cultural and family context where the student develops also could have a strong influence on student achievement (Brunner and Elacqua, 2003) . Parental involvement, such as showing an interest in students' activities and providing support without overcontrolling, was a variable that appeared to be related significantly to student achievement (Jeynes, 2005) . Additionally, parental beliefs and expectations about academic success, judgments made by families about academic achievement, and families' use of methods to encourage students' motivation were environmental variables related to achievement and also to students' self-concepts (Parsons et al., 1982; Woon and Chee, 2007) . Verna et al. (1997) studied a population of high-achieving students and the relationship between contextual and individual variables and achievement. The authors concluded that excessive parental pressure and exaggerated expectations had a negative influence on both male and female students."}, {"section_title": "Individual variables", "text": "The relationship between intelligence and achievement has been investigated and some authors have conceptualized both constructs as identical and/or causally related (Watkins et al., 2007) , mainly because, by measuring intelligence through different instruments, one also could measure reasoning skills that supposedly predicted academic achievement (Parker and Benedict, 2002) . However, some researchers have found quite the opposite. Measures of intelligence and achievement frequently included items, tasks, and abilities that have been influenced by school experiences and learning (Lubinski and Davis, 1992) . Moreover, researchers have found that even non-verbal tests that were built to measure fluid intelligence-a construct generally explained by physiological rather than cultural factors-such as the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices test, could be influenced by students' schooling (Fry and Hale, 2000; Stelzl et al., 1995) .\nOther researchers have shown that intelligence did not have a causal and direct relationship to achievement. Mediating factors such as personality (Furnham and Monsen, 2009) , motivation, and self-esteem also can have an influence on student achievement. Di Fabio and Palazzeschi (2009) conducted a correlational study with high school students and analyzed different individual variables, such as fluid and emotional intelligence, and personality traits. The authors concluded that fluid intelligence influenced achievement because of its impact on comprehension and learning. However, they also concluded that a high level of emotional intelligence was a variable that predicted students' academic performance.\nThe ability to believe in one's own capacities, usually conceptualized as self-concept or self-esteem, has been a factor investigated as influencing students' academic achievement (Marsh and Craven, 2006; Marsh et al., 2008) . Marsh and Craven (2006) , through a longitudinal study, found that academic self-concept and achievement were two constructs that were mutually reinforced. They specifically stated that each one directly affected the other. Swann et al. (2007) , in a review of the literature, found that academic self-esteem was subject related, that is students could have different academic selfconcepts according to the subject matter in which they felt more confident and perceived that they had more academic competencies than their peers.\nMotivation, specifically motivation to achieve, has also been a construct related to students' academic performance (Story et al., 2009) . Achievement motivation has been defined as the ability to work toward the attainment of personal goals (Cassidy and Lynn, 1989) . Eppler and Harju (2007) , in a study of achievement motivation using selfreporting questionnaires, found that academically successful students had clear learning and performance goals, and that they were motivated to achieve them.\nThe relationship between gender and achievement has been investigated extensively, especially because of the existing difference between males' and females' performance on intelligence and achievement assessments. Many investigators have found that, even though females were more self-disciplined, had lower drop-out rates, were less like to be retained by one or more grades, and had better grades throughout their school lives than their male counterparts, male students still achieved higher scores on achievement tests such as the SAT than female students (Buchmann et al., 2008; Duckworth and Seligman, 2006) , especially in mathematics and science subtests. Unfortunately, this gender difference has remained stable, which has been particularly true for the USA during the past 30 years (Hedges and Nowell, 1995) . Some of the variables that have been investigated to explain this gap include biological and environmental factors. Among the several factors that different authors have investigated (Buchmann et al., 2008; Dee, 2005; Mandara, 2006; Steele, 1997) were the following: teachers' and parents' expectations; teachers' gender; gender stereotypes; test anxiety; parental involvement in school activities; family background and parent education; and parenting styles. Despite the existing gender differences related to test scores, female students tended not to delay college entrance, had low drop-out rates, and were more likely to finish college and complete a degree than their male counterparts (Freeman, 2004; Snyder et al., 2007) ."}, {"section_title": "College admission", "text": "Admission to college historically has been determined by the use of standardized measures, such as aptitude or achievement tests. Until the 1920s, researchers within universities created and applied their own admission tests; however, owing to the large array of measurements, practitioners in many countries decided to create a single and universal achievement test (Syverson, 2007) . On the other hand, the use of a single standardized measure has been a matter of discussion, mainly because the scores of tests such as the SAT correlated significantly only with early college performance (Sternberg, 2007) .\nIn 2003, one of the main goals of the Chilean government and the Ministry of Education was to put pressure on schools to improve the quality of education, with a special emphasis on high school education. Therefore, a major change was made in the official college entrance test, from an aptitude test, the Prueba de Aptitud Academica (PAA), to a content-based assessment similar to those that have been used frequently in developed countries (Hawes, 2004) . The aim for the creation of this new instrument was to combine cognitive skills and different curriculum areas that were covered during high school. The four main areas assessed were language and communication; mathematics; history and social sciences; and sciences (biology, chemistry, and physics). The score that students needed to achieve to have access to higher education depended on the type of university and career chosen. For most renowned universities, high scores were between 680 (e.g. psychology) and 750 points (e.g. medicine). Low scores ranged from 450 to 550 points, which in many cases allowed students to apply only to private universities or careers that have low score requirements.\nResearchers have shown that the PSU was statistically adequate to measure students' knowledge of high school curricular content (i.e. item difficulty and item discrimination) (Hawes, 2004) ; however, the main controversy has been related to the difference between scores of students from different socioeconomic and academic backgrounds. The change in the assessment procedure was intended to make high school education more comparable; however, Brunner (2008) found that the gap was wider than with the use of the previous test. It has been argued previously that the minimum curricular content assessed under the new test was not fully addressed in public high schools, where most low-income students could be found."}, {"section_title": "Gifted students' college readiness", "text": "Gifted students, especially those from families from low socioeconomic backgrounds, could have difficulties in admission to higher education. Even if students were gifted in one or more areas, they were not identified successfully nor received an appropriate or differentiated curriculum, which could have a negative impact on their academic futures. Van Tassel-Baska and Wills (1987) conducted a three-year study with a population of gifted students attending a special program. She found disparities between the SAT scores of economically disadvantaged gifted students (i.e. income level below US$20,000) and their advantaged counterparts' scores. She concluded that high-income gifted students performed significantly better on the SAT than the low-income gifted group. Specifically, the greatest disparity was observed on the mathematics subtest.\nThe purpose of this study was to determine what factors were influential on gifted students' achievement on the PSU in Chile. Particularly, the goal of the study was to analyze the performance on the PSU of gifted students who were part of an extracurricular university-based enrichment program. Three research questions guided this study:\n1. What was the relationship between intelligence, motivation, and academic self-esteem of gifted students and their scores on the PSU? 2. What combination of factors were the best predictors of gifted students' performance on the PSU? 3. What were the differences in students' performance on the PSU according to their gender and type of school attended?"}, {"section_title": "Method Context", "text": "Students participating in this study were part of a university-based enrichment program: Buenos Estudiantes con Talento Acad\u00e9mico (BETA), in the city of Valparaiso, Chile. The program began in 2005 as part of a series of enrichment programs created in the country. The BETA program's theoretical and curricular foundations have been based on Gagn\u00e9's Differentiated Model of Giftedness and Talent (Gagn\u00e9, 2009 ) and the concepts of (1) enrichment developed by Reis and Renzulli (1984) and (2) problemsolving and creativity (Maker, 2005) . The goal of the BETA program has been to provide educational opportunities and talent development for gifted students coming from public and voucher schools. Students accepted at BETA were part of traditionally underserved populations without academic opportunities to develop their talents. The program's goals have been to expand the cultural capital of gifted students, strengthen their cognitive skills, and increase their motivation to learn. Students first were nominated in ninth grade by their school teachers. Each group of students (approximately 20 students per school) went to the university where they took two assessments: the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices and a motivation test specially created for recruiting gifted students to participate in the BETA program.\nStudents began BETA in tenth grade, and had the option of being part of BETA until the completion of their high school studies (senior year). The program included enrichment sessions on Fridays and Saturdays during the whole academic year, plus a summer session (two weeks in January). Students were able to choose topics of interest and take two courses and one workshop each semester."}, {"section_title": "Instruments", "text": "Teachers used the Individual Guideline of Criteria for the Nomination of Students with Academic Talent to nominate potentially gifted students. This assessment was created for the first university-based enrichment program in Chile, the Programa de Estudios y Desarrollo de Talentos (PENTA) (Arancibia and Flanagan, 2005) . The instrument had a general scale that was composed of knowledge and learning skills, creativity, productivity, and socioaffective characteristics. The scale also included four subscales of specific skills, such as language and writing, logic and mathematics, science, and social sciences.\nThe Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM) was the instrument used for the selection of students to the BETA program, and has been defined as a non-verbal assessment of analytic intelligence (i.e. fluid intelligence). This test has been used commonly in school contexts to measure cognitive skills such as observation and reasoning, and to identify gifted students. This test was chosen for the selection procedure because it was an assessment that, according to several studies, was not culturally or socially biased and allowed practitioners in the field of education of the gifted to select students from underserved populations (Mills and Ablard, 1993) . The reliability coefficient for the SPM ranged from 0.76 to 0.91. To determine validity, several researchers have compared the SPM with other cognitive measures in Western populations, reporting correlations higher than 0.75 (Burke, 1985) . No national norms for the SPM have been created in Chile. However, the BETA program did not use international norms; instead, local norms were created for the SPM: students' scores have been compared with the total group of students who applied to the program each year.\nThe Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI) is an assessment with four subscales: 26 items relate to global self-esteem, eight items to social self and peers, eight items for school and academic matters, and, finally, eight items that comprise a lie scale. The items were statements that students answered on a two-point scale (i.e. 'like me' and 'unlike me') (Coopersmith, 1959) . The SEI was administered to students during their first year in the program. This test had 58 items that were divided into four subscales related to four areas of self-esteem: general, social, academic, and home. The test-retest reliability was 0.73 (Francis, 1997) , and some authors reported correlations between 0.58 and 0.62 (Chiu, 1985) . Johnson et al. (1983) conducted regression analyses to determine the validity of the SEI. They concluded that the SEI had convergent validity with the Harris Children's Self-concept Scale (p < 0.01) and the Coopersmith Behavioral Academic Assessment Scale (p < 0.01) and had discriminant validity when compared with the Children's Social Desirability Scale (p > 0.05).\nThe Motivation Scale is an assessment created by the PENTA program that contains several statements about how students perceive themselves academically, their school interests, and the type of academic activities they enjoyed most. Students answered each statement on a four-point Likert scale; some examples of the statements were the following: 'I am very interested in the causes and consequences of events,' 'I like learning new things that are interesting to me,' and 'I like the type of problems that make me think.' This scale was specially designed to select gifted students for university-based enrichment programs; however, no reliability or validity studies have been conducted on this instrument.\nThe PSU is the official Chilean standardized test for admission to college. The PSU includes several subtests that measure different areas of the high school curriculum. The subtests of language and mathematics were mandatory for every student who took the test. Two other subtests (history and science) were included in the PSU, and the students had to choose only one according to the specific requirements of the university and career (major) they wanted to select for their tertiary studies. Each of the subtests included approximately 80 multiple-choice items.\nResearchers have found that the PSU was highly reliable, with reliability coefficients of the subtests ranging from 0.72 to 0.92 (Donoso and Contreras, 2006) . Also, researchers found that the PSU subtests had predictive validity for academic achievement during the first year of college (Manzi et al., 2008) ."}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Sixty-six students who participated in the university-based enrichment program for gifted students, BETA, and took the PSU in 2008 and 2009 were included in this study.

Researchers have stated that these variables as a whole (predictor variables) can predict achievement on a college entrance test (criterion variable). Because at least 20 observations have been recommended for multiple regression models for each independent variable to avoid type I error (Brace et al., 2006) , only the three selected variables were used for this model, because the sample number was equal to 66 (n \u00bc 66). For the categorical data, a two-factor (gender, type of school) analysis of variance (ANOVA) was chosen to analyze the effects and interactions of the factors on the performance on the PSU."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "A multiple regression analysis was conducted to predict students' performance on the PSU. The predictive variables that were considered for the study were students' scores on the SPM, motivation, and SEI tests. The variables as a whole helped to explain only 41% of the variance in the PSU, which meant that the model was marginally meaningful (R 2 \u00bc 0.413; F(3,62) \u00bc 14.53; p < 0.001). However, when the behavior or predictive capacity of each individual variable was analyzed, the Raven's score was the only variable that was positively correlated with the PSU scores (b \u00bc 0.639; p < 0.001). A summary of the multiple regression analyses is shown in Table 4 . Data on PSU performance were analyzed using a two-factor, between-subjects ANOVA, with gender (male/female) and type of school (public/voucher) as the two factors. The sample sizes, means, and standard deviations per cell are shown in Table 5 . Only the main effect of school was significant, with boys from voucher (charter) schools performing better in the PSU; however, neither gender nor the two-way interaction was significant (school: F(1,62) \u00bc 29.4, p < 0.001, gender: F(1,62) \u00bc 2.82, p > 0.05, school by gender: F < 1)."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Specific SES information other than the one available for this study could not be included for the analysis. Variables such as parent and mother educational levels, family's monthly income, and parents' working situation were factors defined by authors as influencing college entrance scores. The fact that this was a sample of gifted students from a specific enrichment program also must be taken into consideration, because the weight of the factors influencing PSU scores could be different in a more heterogeneous sample than the one studied for this investigation."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The relationship found between students' scores on the SPM and the PSU is consistent with what other authors have established about general intelligence and standardized assessments, such as the SAT (Frey and Detterman, 2004) . One of the plausible explanations for this relationship is that both tests-intelligence and college entrance-are partially measuring the g factor (general intelligence). Another explanation is that intelligence tests (even non-verbal tests such as the Raven's) are highly influenced by academic exposure; therefore, the reason why some students outperform others on both tests (Raven's and PSU) might be because of their previous school learning experiences (Fry and Hale, 2000; Stelzl et al., 1995) . Motivation and self-esteem were not closely correlated with the results on the PSU, which can mean that, for this particular sample, they were not attributable factors when explaining students' performance on the PSU. Authors have investigated the relationship between motivation and self-concept as related to specific achievement assessments (Marsh and Craven, 2006; Trautwein et al., 2008) ; however, we found that for the achievement test used for this study, the PSU, the cognitive skills measured by the SPM had a greater weight than other individual factors.\nThis finding is consistent with other studies about the lack of academic opportunities and preparation faced by students from different socioeconomic backgrounds ( Van-Tassel Baska, 1987) . On the PSU, students need to master the content of almost 100% of the minimum mandatory curriculum that the Chilean Ministry of Education establishes as the baseline for all high schools to achieve during secondary education (Koljatic and Silva, 2007) . However, researchers have found that in many public schools this content is not being addressed, with teachers covering only 50% of the mandatory curriculum.\nThe ANOVA results are consistent with previous findings about male students performing better than female students on college entrance tests (Buchmann et al., 2008; Duckworth and Seligman, 2006) . However, not only males, but males from voucher (charter) schools have better scores on the PSU. Many different variables have been associated with the gender gap in achievement tests (Buchmann et al., 2008; Dee, 2005; Mandara, 2006; Steele, 1997) . The association between gender and type of school has been explained by some authors as being related to the different gender expectations that are held depending on the type of school the student attends, and ways these expectations are reinforced by teachers. Expectations seem to be higher for male students in charter schools because of the more rigorous academic demands made by teachers for male students (Bifulco and Ladd, 2006) .\nEven though gifted students may have high academic potential, if they are not exposed to the required curricular and academic content they cannot succeed on a content-based assessment such as the PSU. The aim of this test was to improve access to higher education under the assumption that a content-based test was a better predictor of college success during the first years of study than were more traditional types of tests. Also, the PSU was supposed to be an assessment based on meritocracy, because students' knowledge acquired through their years of study as a result of their personal effort and preparation (OECD, 2009) is being assessed. However, differences seem to be accentuated with the PSU scores, mainly because of the differences that exist between students who come from different types of schools. The acquisition of knowledge and cognitive skills to address the PSU depends on the preparation provided by the schools; however, this academic preparation is unequal and 43% of public schools in Chile are not implementing the mandatory curriculum. For example, while students from private schools have an average of 37 correct answers in the mathematics section of the test, students from public schools have an average of only eight correct answers (Bayer, 2004) . Therefore, these differences reduce students' opportunities to have access to a high-quality tertiary education."}, {"section_title": "Implications for practice", "text": "In Chile, the graduation rate of high school students is significantly higher than the admission rate to college. Inequities between students who attend public and private schools are shown to be greater during the process of admission to higher education (OECD, 2009 ). Admission to college depends on the scores achieved on the PSU, and performance on the test seems to be highly related to the type of school the student attended. Therefore, the academic preparation that students from different backgrounds receive must be taken into consideration. Nunez and Millan (2002) found that students who underwent an intensive training on the necessary content for the PSU accomplished better results than their counterparts with no specific training. Academic preparation, along with training in test-taking skills, are factors that can increase students' performance on a college admission test. Improving the minimum coverage of basic content is a current and long-term challenge for the Chilean Ministry of Education. However, creating opportunities for students to access extracurricular academic preparation is a suitable short-term option. For example, PSU preparation centers, called Preuniversitarios in Chile, have proven to be a powerful tool for students to acquire the skills necessary to perform well on the test. Creating more centers or promoting free access to existing ones can be a suitable option for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds who do not have these opportunities."}, {"section_title": "Implications for further research", "text": "Investigators in the field need to consider and widen the analysis of individual and contextual factors that might affect gifted students' performance on a college entrance test. Factors such as socioeconomic status, parent education, and parental support, among many others, can be included for further analysis. Studies with larger samples and comparative samples (e.g. gifted and non-gifted students) could also be appropriate for this type of research. Finally, analyzing the suitability, adequacy, validity, and reliability of the PSU in Chile since its first implementation and over the last eight years can contribute to the advancement of research in the field and improve the quality of education in the country.\nIn summary, the results of this investigation helped us shed light on how gifted students' readiness for college is affected by environmental factors, the most salient being students' educational and academic background. Giftedness has been defined in many different ways; however, most of the researchers agree that is a combination of heredity and environment. In this study, even though every single participant has been identified as gifted, the role the environment has played is indisputable. For gifted students from voucher schools undergoing a rigorous academic preparation, they are able to achieve on the Chilean college entrance test and probably will be able to select the major of their choice in any renowned university. On the other hand, students who are gifted but have not had adequate educational opportunities to succeed tend to have lower scores than their counterparts from voucher schools. Even though gifted students have potential, background and cultural capital matters for achievement and readiness for college. How these students can have access to the necessary content knowledge they need to succeed in college entrance tests is a question that still remains unanswered among Chilean educators and needs to be addressed by practitioners and researchers."}, {"section_title": "Funding", "text": "This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors."}]
