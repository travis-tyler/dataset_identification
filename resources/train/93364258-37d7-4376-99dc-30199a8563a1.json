[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The betacoronaviridae are non-segmented single-stranded positive sense viruses with an RNA genome of approximately thirty kilobases in length. This family poses a significant threat to human health. In addition to causing approximately 30% of annual upper respiratory infections (Stadler et al. 2003; Su et al. 2016) , it is responsible for three major outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, MERS, since the turn of the century (Drosten et al. 2003; Ksiazek et al. 2003; Zhong et al. 2003; Zaki et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2020) . COVID-19 is a unique form of pneumonia characterized by high fever, dry cough, and occasionally catastrophic hypoxia. It was first described in the city of Wuhan, Huibei Province, in the fall of 2019 Li et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020) . A novel virus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of this disease Wu et al. 2020) . The rapid spread of the virus led to a global pandemic that caused significant morbidity and mortality and disruption of daily life for millions of people. The extraordinary impact of this virus fueled strong interest in understanding its pathophysiology and epidemiology with the hope of developing new treatments and approaches to limit its spread.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle is similar to that of other betacoronaviridae (Zheng 2020) . Following attachment of the virus to the host cell and membrane fusion, viral genomic RNA is introduced to the host cell where it is translated to produce a polyprotein encoding the viral replicase, proteases, and several accessory proteins. The replicase is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that produces full-length antigenomic sequence that serves as a template for the production of additional copies of the viral genome and several nested subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) that encode the structural components of the virion. Conserved stem loop structures are present in both coding and noncoding regions the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome (Ramya Rangan 2020). They cluster in the 5\u00b4UTR, the N-terminal portion of ORF-1a, at the junction of ORF1a and ORF1b, and in the 3\u00b4UTR. While their precise role is not known, their function can be inferred from studies of related elements in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and other coronaviridae Madhugiri et al. 2016) . The structured elements have regulatory roles in various aspects of viral replication, sgRNA synthesis, and translation.\nThough they are divergent in sequence, the structures appear to be conserved, and in some cases elements from SARS-CoV can functionally substitute for those in MHV with little impact on viral replication. (Goebel et al. 2004; Kang et al. 2006a; Kang et al. 2006b; Zust et al. 2008; Chen and Olsthoorn 2010; .\nDNA sequencing technology has progressed remarkably since the SARS outbreak of 2003 (Geoghegan and Holmes 2018; Zhang et al. 2018) . It is now routine to determine the sequence of the ~30 kilobase viral genome using high throughput sequencing technology . As a result, scientists and medical professionals from around world have sequenced the SARS-CoV-2 genome from patient isolates and disseminated their findings through data repositories (e.g. the GISAID EpiCoV database) at unprecedented speed (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett 2017; Shu and McCauley 2017; Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of 2020; Wu et al. 2020 ). This has enabled the construction of molecular phylogenies that have guided our understanding of the virus transmission history, its basal mutation rate, and its potential to evade emerging therapeutics and vaccines (Bedford et al. 2020; Chu et al. 2020; Forster et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2020b; Lv et al. 2020; Pachetti et al. 2020; Pinto et al. 2020) . At the time of this writing, almost 25,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been deposited in the GISAID EpiCoV database (www.gisaid.org) and are available through a database access agreement Buckland-Merrett 2017; Shu and McCauley 2017) . Over 3500 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been deposited into the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Genbank (ncbi.nih.nlv.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs) and are freely available to the public.\nHere, we analyzed both cohorts to identify and characterize rapidly emerging variations within the cis-regulatory RNA structures of the virus genome. Our analysis reveals twenty rapidly emerging variants including two that likely arose through RNA editing. The data identify SL1 of the 5\u00b4UTR as a hot spot for viral mutation, where most mutations stabilize the stem loop structure. The data also show that structured elements in the 3\u00b4UTR hypervariable region, including the enigmatic S2M loop, contain rapidly emerging variations predicted to be destabilizing. The results provide insight into the relevance of the proposed viral RNA structures, and present a roadmap to avoid potential confounds to RNA therapeutic development."}, {"section_title": "Identification of rapidly emerging variants in structured regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome", "text": "The genome sequence for viral isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (Genbank MN908947) was used as a reference genome . The 5\u00b4UTR (1-265), the structured region of ORF1a (266-450), the frameshifting pseudoknot (13, 546) , or the 3\u00b4UTR (29, 903) were used as queries in a BLASTn search of the NCBI Betacoronavirus database filtered for SARS-CoV-2 (Altschul et al. 1990; Camacho et al. 2009 ). An average of 3600 \u00b1 160 hits were recovered from each query. The sequences recovered from BLASTn were aligned with MAFFT using the FFT-NS-2 algorithm to produce a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) (Katoh et al. 2002) . The MSA was then input into WebLogo 3 to calculate the positional occupancy, entropy, and allele frequency for each query (Supplementary Table 1 ) (Crooks et al. 2004) . The occupancy defines the number of A, C, G, or U bases observed at each position (denoted as weight in the WebLogo3 output), the entropy defines the positional information content (lower value equals more variation), and the allele frequency defines the fractional occupancy of each nucleotide at each position. The results reveal high occupancy (>90%) from position 57 of the 5\u00b4UTR through position 29,836 of the 3\u00b4UTR, but the occupancy drops off significantly near the 5\u00b4 and 3\u00b4 ends of the genome (Fig. 1A) , dipping below 20%. This is presumably due to difficulty of capturing the ends of the genome in sequencing library production.\nNevertheless, even the extreme termini have coverage of more than 300 genomes. The positional entropy scores identify multiple variations in both low and high occupancy regions suggesting that variant entropy is not overly skewed by the terminal deficiencies in the genomic sequencing data. In total, fourteen variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of greater than 0.005 (0.5%) were identified by this approach.\nTo extend this analysis, we repeated the study with a second cohort of SARS-CoV-2 sequences recovered from the GISAID database on May 13, 2020 (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett 2017; Shu and McCauley 2017) . All sequences were downloaded from the database, converted into a blast library, then queried and analyzed as above with the NCBI cohort. An average of 23,900 \u00b1 630 hits were recovered from each query. As with the NCBI cohort, occupancy is high (>90%) from position 55 through position 29,829 Table 1 ). Due to the large size of the GISAID cohort-6.6 times the size of the NCBI cohort-the termini are covered by thousands of genomes despite the relatively low occupancy. In total, seventeen variants with a MAF of at least 0.005 were identified in the GISAID cohort, eleven of which were also identified in the NCBI cohort ( Fig. 1C, Supplementary Table 2 ). Combining the two analyses yields a total of twenty rapidly emerging variants in the structured regions of the viral genome. Of these, thirteen are transversions and seven are transitions. Eighteen are in noncoding regions (2.9%, 18/602 positions evaluated), and the remaining two are silent mutations within the coding sequence of ORF1a or ORF1b (0.7%, 2/275 positions evaluated). Considering the larger GISAID cohort, there are 80 invariant residues (30.1%) in the 5\u00b4UTR, 90 (48.9%) in the ORF1a structured region, 58 (64.4%) in the frameshifting pseudoknot, and 131 (38.9%) in the 3\u00b4UTR. Thus, as expected, structures in the coding region seem to show a higher degree of conservation and fewer rapidly emerging alleles than noncoding regions, presumably due to the selective pressure of maintaining the protein coding sequence."}, {"section_title": "Variations in SL1 through SL4 of the 5\u00b4UTR", "text": "In MHV, stem loop 1 (SL1) plays a critical role in virus replication and is proposed to form long-range interactions with the 3\u00b4UTR (Zuniga et al. 2004; Li et al. 2008) . Stem\nLoop 2 (SL2) contains a highly conserved sequence and structural elements thought to play a role in sgRNA synthesis (Liu et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2009; Chen and Olsthoorn 2010; Lee et al. 2011) . The structure of Stem loop 3 (SL3) is less well conserved, but it contains the leftmost transcription regulatory sequence (TRS-L) required for template switching in sgRNA production (Zuniga et al. 2004; Sola et al. 2005; . Stem loop 4 (SL4) contains an upstream open reading frame (uORF) that could reduce translation initiation at the ORF1a start codon and/or act as a spacer between 5\u00b4 structured elements and ORF1a (Raman et al. 2003; Yang et al. 2011; Wu et al. 2014 ).\nThe precise role of these structures in SARS-CoV-2 infection is not known, but recently released structural predictions reveal all four stem loops are present in the SARS-CoV-2 genome ( Fig. 2) kcal/mol) (Fig. 2E ). The second most frequent combination (U 34 U 35 U 36 A 37 ) is present at an allele frequency of UUUA=0.003/7795 (GISAID) and UUUA=0.018/1350 (NCBI). This variant extends the SL1 lower stem by yet another base pair, increasing its overall stability by 3.4 kcal/mol (\u0394G=-11.9 kcal/mol). Of these four positions, only C36U frequently exists as a single variation (U=0.013/7967 GISAID, 0.071/1400 NCBI).\nRNAfold analysis reveals no change in the stem loop structure or stability for the C36U variant."}, {"section_title": "Ryder -9", "text": "Both combination variations are only found in samples sequenced from the United States, with the majority of them coming from the state of Washington. To better assess the relatedness between genomes containing U 34 U 35 U 36 C 37 and U 34 U 35 U 36 A 37 variants, we recovered the entire genomes of each example containing either extended SL1 stem variation from the GISAID cohort and aligned them using MAFFT (Katoh et al. 2002) . The reference genome (Wuhan-Hu-1) was used as an outgroup. A radial maximal likelihood phylogenetic tree was calculated using the Tamura-Nei model in MEGAX, and the results plotted (Supp. Fig. 1 ) (Tamura and Nei 1993; Stecher et al. 2020 ). The phylogenetic relationship shows that both variants are represented in two different branches, but the variants tend to cluster separately within those branches. In one case, thirteen U 34 U 35 U 36 A 37 genomes cluster within a node that is otherwise occupied U 34 U 35 U 36 C 37 , suggesting that U 34 U 35 U 36 variation arose first, and A 37 arose as a secondary mutation. The impact of these variations on viral fitness or patient outcomes is not known.\nMost of the rapidly emerging variants in SL1 enhance the stem loop structure.\nThis suggests that SL1 stabilization is not overly deleterious to virus replication. In MHV, by contrast, destabilizing mutations of the lower stem are well tolerated in a cell model of virus replication, but mutations that increase the stability the lower stem block replication (Li et al. 2008) . It is important to note that there is significant sequence divergence in this region between the two viruses that may explain this apparent dichotomy. Interestingly, the combination U 34 U 35 U 36 C 37 variation co-occurs with the destabilizing A31U mutation 48.5% of the time, suggesting a potential compensatory role. Consistent with this hypothesis, the extension in SL1 rescues the destabilizing A31U variation by 2.1 kcal/mol (\u0394G=-7.5kcal/mol). However, we note that none of the combination U 34 U 35 U 36 A 37 variant genomes harbor A31U, so it is clear that the SL1 extension can exist in the absence of a compensatory destabilizing mutation. There are no rapidly Ryder -10 emerging variations within the upper stem or the loop of SL1, suggesting this region could be important to infection. Consistent with that hypothesis, mutations that destabilize the upper stem of MHV SL1 block virus replication (Li et al. 2008) .\nVariations in SL5 through SL10 at the 5\u00b4UTR/ORF1a junction A large branched helical structure termed Stem Loop 5 is predicted to form at the interface between the 5\u00b4UTR and the N-terminal region of ORF1a ( Fig. 2B ) (Ramya Rangan 2020). This region contains three stems (SL5a, SL5b, and SL5c) connected by a helical junction. There is considerable sequence divergence among the coronaviridae in this structure, but the overall fold is largely preserved (Chen and Olsthoorn 2010) . In SARS-CoV-2, the SL5a stem occludes the initiation codon for ORF1a, suggesting this structure must open prior to translation initiation. However, the SL5a stem is essential for virus replication in a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) model (Brown et al. 2007 ). The role of SL5c is more controversial, with one study demonstrating that the stem is dispensable , while a previous study showed that it is required (Brown et al. 2007 ).\nWe observed two rapidly emerging variants within the SL5 structured region with a minor allele frequency of greater than 0.005. The first, A187C (C=0.007/23832 GISAID, C=0.003/3407 NCBI), occurs within a bulged nucleotide of SL5a and is therefore not expected to alter the structure. (Brown et al. 2007; . There is one rapidly emerging variant within this region. C313U occurs within an internal loop region of SL6. The minor allele frequency of this variant is U=0.011/24227 GISAID, U=0.007/3732 NCBI. The variant is a silent mutation, converting a CUC Leu codon to a CUU Leu codon. As it occurs in an internal loop, it is expected to have no impact on the stem loop structure."}, {"section_title": "Variations in the 5\u00b4UTR that could have arisen through RNA editing", "text": "The two most abundant variants in the 5\u00b4UTR are both C to U transitions. C36U is observed in 2.8% of the sequences from the GISAID cohort, and C241U is observed in 68%. Excluding singletons, the average frequency of C to U transitions at all other positions in the 5\u00b4UTR is 0.04%. It is possible that the C36U and C241U variations arise repeatedly during virus replication, or they may have occurred early during the outbreak, or both. The type of transition and the relative abundance of the C36U and C241U variations suggest they might be hot spots for viral genome editing by host defense enzymes. The apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) enzymes are host encoded cytidine deaminases that edit cytidine to uridine in host nucleic acids (Lerner et al. 2018; Silvas and Schiffer 2019) . They also target single stranded RNA and DNA virus genomes to affect an antiviral response.\nIf C36U and C241U substitutions arose at such high frequency because of C to U RNA editing, it might be possible to observe both nucleotides in the same sample of genomic RNA. cDNA produced from a mixed population of viral RNA harvested from an individual would be expected to include a weighted average of C and U in the sequencing reads that could be indicated as a degenerate Y (pyrimidine) in sequencing data, especially if there are near equal reads of each variation. Because WebLogo3 does not consider degenerate sequencing calls in its calculation of allele frequency (Crooks et al. 2004 ), we used SNP-sites v2.5.1 and VCFtools v0.1.7 to recalculate the allele frequency inclusive of degenerate bases (Danecek et al. 2011; Page et al. 2016 ).\nWe calculated the average frequency of all C to Y transitions in the 5\u00b4UTR using the larger GISAID cohort, excluding the two candidate editing sites (C36U and C241U) and\nsingletons. The average C to Y transition frequency is 0.014%. By contrast, the frequency of C36Y is 0.063%, 4.5-fold greater than the average, and the frequency of C241Y is 0.18%, 12.9-fold greater than the average. This apparent increase in pyrimidine degeneracy is consistent with the possibility that APOBEC enzymes edit both positions. However, we cannot formally rule out the possibility that some people were co-infected with both variants leading to the degenerate base call, or that C36U and C241U frequently arise via some other mechanism during viral replication. The impact of either variation on viral fitness remains to be determined."}, {"section_title": "Variations in the frameshifting pseudoknot at the ORF1a/ORF1b junction", "text": "An RNA pseudoknot is found at the junction of ORF1a and ORF1b ( Fig. 3A) (Ramya Rangan 2020). This structure is involved in -1 programmed ribosome frameshifting, where translating ribosomes shift frame by one nucleotide to the left. Efficient frameshifting requires both a \"slippery\" sequence and a downstream stable RNA structure (Brierley et al. 1989; Brierley et al. 1992) . Like SARS-CoV and MHV, the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot has three stems instead of two typically found in pseudoknot structures (Brierley and Dos Ramos 2006; Giedroc and Cornish 2009) . A previous study comparing SARS-CoV, MHV, and hybrid variants found that both viral pseudoknots led to approximately the same extent of programmed frameshifting (~20%), but hybrid mutant variants in loop 3 that stabilize the pseudoknot structure increased frame shifting up to 90% (Plant et al. 2010) . The same study revealed that silent mutations in the SARS-CoV slippery site reduced programmed frame shifting by three-fold and also blocked viral infection in a cell culture model. Thus, the function of the slippery sequence and the pseudoknot structure is to ensure that production of ORF1a and ORF1ab polyproteins occurs at appropriate stoichiometric ratios, critical to viral fitness.\nWe identified one rapidly emerging variant in the frameshifting pseudoknot. C13536U (U=0.015/23306 GISAID, U=0.003/3440 NCBI) is a silent mutation (UAC Tyr :UAU Tyr ) located within stem 2 (Fig. 4) . C13536 normally forms a Watson-Crick pair with G13493. Mutation to U is expected to cause the formation of a U13536:G13493 wobble pair, which has comparable stability to a Watson-Crick pair but alters the backbone geometry shifting the G residue into the minor groove. To get a better understanding of how this U-G pair might impact the tertiary structure and thus the function of the frameshifting pseudoknot, we used RNAcomposer to build a threedimensional model of the reference sequence and the C13536U variant ( Fig 4B) ( Popenda et al. 2012) . In the reference model, G13485 forms a base triple with the C13536:G13493 pair (Fig. 4A) . The exocyclic amine of C13536 donates a hydrogen bond to the O6 of G13485 in loop 1. In the C13536U model, this base triple cannot form as the hydrogen bond donor is lost. This could conceivably reduce the stability of stem 2, which would be expected to cause less efficient -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting.\nMore work will be necessary to define exactly how this variation perturbs the structure and if it alters the stoichiometry of viral protein synthesis."}, {"section_title": "Variations in the 3\u00b4UTR in the BSL and PK", "text": "Betacoronaviridae 3\u00b4UTRs contain a bi-stable molecular switch formed by two mutually exclusive structural conformers, including one that extends the lower stem of the bulged stem loop (BSL), and a second that folds into a pseudoknot (PK, Fig. 3B ) (Goebel et al. 2004) . Both structured elements are present in MHV, SARS, and MERS, though the sequence diverges significantly between them (Hsue and Masters 1997; Hsue et al. 2000; Goebel et al. 2004) . In MHV and BCoV, the BSL and the PK structure are required for viral replication (Hsue and Masters 1997; Williams et al. 1999; Hsue et al. 2000; Goebel et al. 2004) . Mutations that stabilize one form over the other prevent replication. It is proposed that competition between the two structures plays a regulatory role in antigenomic RNA synthesis, but the exact mechanism remains to be determined (Goebel et al. 2004 ).\nThere are two rapidly emerging variants in the 5\u00b4 portion of the 3\u00b4UTR. G29540A is present at a MAF of A=0.008/24313 (GISAID) and A=0.014/3550 (NCBI). This variant lies within a single-stranded region that precedes the BSL structure and as such is not predicted to affect the structure or the molecular switch. In contrast, the G29553A variant (A=0.012/24216 GISAID, A=0.064/3551 NCBI) disrupts a G:C pair in the extended BSL molecular switch conformer that could potentially favor the alternate PK structure.\nAlternatively, the A substitution may pair with the otherwise bulged U29607 nucleotide, partially compensating for the loss in of the G:C pair. Consistent with the latter possibility, RNAfold predicts that the stability of the reference BSL conformer is -20.20 kcal/mol, while the stability of the G29553A variant conformer is -18.30 kcal/mol and includes a newly formed A:U pair. It remains to be determined how modulation of the internal equilibrium of the molecular switch affects SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.\nRNA editing by APOBEC enzymes could lead to rapidly emerging G to A transitions if the antigenomic strand is edited during viral replication. Antigenomic cytidine deamination recodes C to U, which would be read as an A during replication of the genomic strand. To assess this possibility that the G29540A and G29553A variations arose through RNA editing, we looked for the degenerate base \"R\" (either purine base) in both sequencing cohorts using SNP-sites and VCFtools as described above (Danecek et al. 2011; Page et al. 2016 ). There were no degenerate R alleles in the GISAID or NCBI databases at either position, suggesting that neither is produced through frequent APOBEC-mediated editing of the antigenomic strand."}, {"section_title": "Ryder -15", "text": "Variants of the hypervariable region, the S2M structure, and the S3 and S4 stems An extended multiple stem loop structure exists downstream of the 3\u00b4UTR pseudoknot ( Fig 3C) (Ramya Rangan 2020). This structure contains a hypervariable region (HVR) that folds into a bulged stem loop. The HVR is highly divergent in coronaviridae with the exception of a strictly conserved single-stranded 8-mer sequence referred to as the octanucleotide motif (Goebel et al. 2007; Madhugiri et al. 2014) . The function of this region is not well understood, but deletion of the HVR including the conserved 8mer element has no effect on MHV replication in cultured cells (Goebel et al. 2007 ). An apparent selfish genetic element, termed S2M, exists within the bulged stem loop of the HVR (Ramya Rangan 2020). This element is found in many but not all coronaviridae, and is also found in many other families of positive ssRNA viruses, suggesting it can be horizontally transferred (Tengs et al. 2013; Tengs and Jonassen 2016) . The sequence is highly conserved in all viruses where it is found. This element is not present in MHV, and its function (if any) is unknown. Two shorter stems, termed S4 and S3, are also present. Mutations that disrupt S4 have no effect on MHV replication, but S3 appears to be important (Liu et al. 2013) . tetraloop structure in the loop of the HVR bulged stem structure, and is predicted to modestly destabilize the fold (\u0394G = -23.5 kcal/mol G29711U ). The presence of multiple disruptive variations in this region of the SARS-CoV-2 3\u00b4UTR, coupled to previous reports that the HVR is dispensable for MHV replication, suggests that structures are not critical to viral replication. More work will be needed to understand whether the structures in the HVR contribute to SARS-CoV-2 replication or viral fitness.\nThe presence of the rapidly emerging A29700G transition suggests the possibility that it might arise through adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) RNA editing activity. ADARs convert adenosine residues to inosine in double stranded regions of RNA (Keegan et al. 2017 ). As such, they can play an important role in antiviral response, targeting double stranded RNA viruses and other viruses (including betacoronaviruses) that go through a double stranded RNA intermediate (Tomaselli et al. 2015) . During viral replication, inosine residues in the genomic strand would template the incorporation of a C in place of a U during minus strand synthesis, leading to A to G transitions during viral replication. As above, we used SNP-sites and VCFtools to measure the frequency of the degenerate R base at A29700G (Danecek et al. 2011; Page et al. 2016) . No degenerate R nucleotides are present in the GISAID cohort, suggesting that frequent RNA editing by ADAR enzymes is not responsible for rapid A29700G emergence.\nThe final two rapidly emerging variations lie within the enigmatic S2M loop. The structure of the S2M loop from SARS-CoV has been solved by X-ray crystallography ( Fig. 5) (Robertson et al. 2005) . Its prevalence in positive strand ssRNA viral genomes, its position near the 3\u00b4-terminus, and its high degree of sequence conservation all imply a functional role (Tengs and Jonassen 2016) . However, not all betacoronaviruses have the S2M loop, and swapping an S2M-containing region from the SARS-CoV 3\u00b4UTR with an S2M-deficient MHV region did not alter or improve virus replication in vitro (Goebel et al. 2007 ). As such, its role in viral replication is unclear."}, {"section_title": "Ryder -17", "text": "The first rapidly emerging variation in S2M is G29734C (C=0.008/23285 GISAID, C=0.003/3525 NCBI). In the SARS-CoV S2M crystal structure, this position forms a noncanonical G:A pair (Fig. 5B) (Robertson et al. 2005) . The N2 exocyclic amine donates a hydrogen bond to the N1 position of its adenosine partner, and the 2\u00b4-hydroxyl group donates a hydrogen bond to the N3 moiety. Substitution of a C in place of G is incompatible with the hydrogen bonds formed in the G:A pair and as such is likely to destabilize the S2M tertiary structure. The second rapidly emerging variation in S2M is G29742U (U=0.009/28235 GISAID, U=0.019/3526 NCBI). This base is involved in a base quadruple, pairing through its Watson-Crick face with a cytidine residue, but also interacting with the C of a parallel G:C pair packed tightly into its minor groove (Fig. 5B ) (Robertson et al. 2005) . The U variation is incompatible with both the canonical and noncanonical pairings at this position and is likely to be highly destabilizing to the fold.\nTo evaluate the effect of both of the rapidly emerging variations on the structure of the S2M loop, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the S2M loop from SARS-CoV and of both variants. The X-ray structure of the SARS-CoV S2M loop served as initial conformation for all simulations (Robertson et al. 2005) . The results confirmed our predictions: both variations destabilize the structure of the S2M domain. In each case we observed that the structure of the S2M loop undergoes a transition quickly after equilibration (within the first 60 ns) to a less compact conformation as shown in Figure 6A -F. To quantify the extent of the transition, we measured the length of the maximum dimension of the S2M loop and observed an extension (Fig. 6I-K) .\nSurprisingly, we observed that the S2M loop of SARS-CoV also samples similarly extended conformations (Fig. 6I) , although this happens more slowly and with a lower frequency than in the other two variants, in only two out of the four trajectories that we collected (Supplemental Fig. 3A-C) . Analysis of the MD trajectories showed that one important element for the stability of the overall structure of the S2M loop is the stabilizing interaction between G29734 and A29756. When these two nucleotides are in close proximity to one another, the stem tertiary structure is reorganized by bending.\nThis interaction is destabilized in the G29734C variant because C cannot form hydrogen bonds with A29756. However, we observed that the formation of an A-G base pair is not stable in all three sequence variations (Fig. 6G) . In the absence of this base pair, A29756 can move far from G/C29734 (Fig. 6L-N) leading to the sampling of more extended conformations of the loop as shown in figure Fig6 C-F. With the exception of the tails that unfold and refold, the secondary structure of the S2M loop is generally well preserved throughout the simulations, even when sampling more extended conformations as a result of the loss of tertiary interactions (Fig. 6G) . A major difference between these variants is that the base pairing is not as stable in the stem-loop structure in the presence of the G29742U variation ( Fig. 6G-H) . This variation in sequence affects the stability of the base quartet described above (Fig. 5A) , and ultimately impacts the stability of the adjacent base pairs (Fig. 6H) . The base quartet is at the junction between the two helices and is important to set their relative orientations. The G29742U variation causes a local melting of the secondary structure and a disruption of this junction, ultimately destabilizing the compact conformation of the S2M loop (Fig. 6C )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to an explosion in whole genome sequencing of naturally occurring viral isolates. These data have been useful in the identification of rapidly emerging variations that impact viral protein structure and function (Kim et al. 2020b; Pachetti et al. 2020) . They have also been used to monitor the spread of the virus through molecular phylogeny ; Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of 2020; Forster et al. 2020)."}, {"section_title": "Ryder -19", "text": "Here, we have used available data to investigate how rapidly emerging variants could impact structured cis-regulatory elements in the virus genome. These elements govern viral replication, subgenomic RNA synthesis, and translation control in other betacoronaviruses Madhugiri et al. 2016) . Rapidly emerging variants could enhance or dampen viral pathogenesis and overall fitness, which could affect the extent and duration of the outbreak. As such, it is critically important to genome has many structured elements that could be targeted, including SL1-SL4 in the 5\u00b4UTR, the frameshifting pseudoknot at the ORF1a and ORF1b boundary, and the molecular switch in the 3\u00b4UTR. The results presented here suggest that the hypervariable region, including the S2M structure, might be less well suited to targeted drug development. Structures with rapidly emerging variations are problematic for drug development as well, as the relatively high viral mutation rate, coupled to its potential to be edited by APOBEC and ADAR enzymes, could lead to the rapid evolution of resistant variants.\nSimilarly, hybridization-guided therapeutics, such as antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs, and CRISPR-derived drugs could potentially be targeted to the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Unstructured regions in noncoding regions of the viral genome make particularly compelling targets, as access will not be blocked by RNA structure or Ryder -20 transit of the ribosome. However, because these strategies rely on base complementarity to achieve target specificity, rapid virus evolution could prove their Achilles' heel. The data presented here identify regions less prone to variation, making them better candidates for RNA-guided therapeutics.\nThe observation that SL1 is prone to rapidly emerging variations is interesting, as this region is not only present on the positive strand of the viral genome, but is also found on all subgenomic RNAs (Kim et al. 2020a) . Moreover, the complement to SL1 in antigenomic RNA is likely recognized by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) to produce genomic copies of the viral RNA. As such, it could make a good target for therapeutic development. However, the presence of multiple variations, often in combination, makes strategies that rely upon base pairing unlikely to be effective for all virus subtypes. The diversity of variations that enhance the stability of SL1, including variations that lengthen the stem, suggests that SL1 stability is important to SARS-CoV-2 replication. But if stability matters more than sequence identity, we can expect the evolution of rapid resistance to therapeutics designed to modulate SL1 stability.\nThe bi-stable molecular switch in the 3\u00b4UTR is potentially the most compelling structure for targeted drug discovery. It is conceptually straightforward to design antisense oligonucleotides that lock the switch into one conformer or the other. Both conformers are necessary for MHV replication, and only one rapidly emerging variant of minimal consequence was identified in this region. It is likely that this switch plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 replication, as has been observed in other betacoronaviruses. More work will be necessary to assess its potential as a drug target.\nRNA editing appears to play a role in two rapidly emerging variations near stem loop structures in the 5\u00b4UTR. The prevalence of RNA editing of the viral genome is not known, and it remains unclear whether editing affects viral fitness or pathogenesis. It will Ryder -21 be interesting to assess the extent of RNA editing during active infection, a task that would probably be best achieved through direct RNA sequencing (Kim et al. 2020a ).\nThe analyses presented in this study will only improve as more sequencing data are added to available repositories (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett 2017; Shu and McCauley 2017) . It is possible that identification of more rapidly emerging variants will clarify some of the remaining ambiguities. The results presented here highlight the power of highthroughput sequencing of viral genomes to define viral cis-regulatory elements, and stand as a testament to the researchers collecting, sequencing, and sharing viral genomic data to help quell the impact of this tragic and overwhelming pandemic."}, {"section_title": "Calculation of allele frequency and occupancy", "text": "The Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank Accession Number MN908947) was used as a reference genome.

Searches were performed using the web portal with default parameters except \"max target sequences\" was set to 20,000. BLAST hits were filtered by organism for \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\", and the remaining hits were downloaded as a hit table and aligned sequences.

In VMD, each structure was solvated with a water box with explicit TIP3P (Jorgensen et al. 1983; MacKerell et al. 1998 ) solvent and an ionic concentration of 0.15 M NaCl. The box was much larger than the initial structure (cubic box of 106 \u00c5) to allow for extension of the RNA. Four independent trajectories of each system (WT, G11C, and G19U) were generated with the following procedure. The solvated structures were first minimized using the conjugate gradient method for 500 steps to relax any high energy contacts or unphysical geometries. An additional 2,000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization were performed with the heavy atoms of the RNA and the two Mg 2+ ions restrained with a harmonic constraint force of 10 kcal/mol -1 \u00c5 2 . Next, particle velocities were randomly assigned from the Maxwell distribution and equilibration was performed in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble gradually decreasing the restraints to zero (using 9 stages of 50 ps each).
