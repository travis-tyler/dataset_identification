As foam has an elevated albedo, open-ocean albedo parameterizations include whitecapping effects through a wind-based foam fraction. However, surfzone depth-limited wave breaking does not require wind. Surfzone albedo observations are very rare, the variability of surfzone albedo is not known, and parameterizations are not available. New, year-long upwelling and downwelling shortwave radiation observations were made from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography pier spanning the surfzone and inner-shelf. Surfzone albedo was elevated due to foam with mean observed albedo of \u03b1 = 0.15 and one-minute average albedo as high as \u03b1 = 0.45, far exceeding expected albedo (0.06) from standard parameterizations. Using a pier-mounted GoPro camera, an image-based albedo parameterization is developed that estimates the fractional foam area to derive albedo. This parameterization has high skill (r 2 = 0.90) on time scales as short as a wave period (9 s). A second wave-model based parameterization for (hourly) averaged albedo is developed relating the non-dimensional roller energy dissipation to the mean foam fraction and thus albedo. The parameterization has good skill (r 2"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The nearshore region (\u2264 7 m water depth) is critical both economically and ecologically. The region is a center for tourism, recreation, and commercial use, and is also home to a wide variety of fish, birds, plants and invertebrates. Water temperature is an important ecological aspect, affecting growth rates, recruitment rates, egg-mass production, pathogen ecology and many other factors (e.g., Phillips, 2005;Fischer and Thatje, 2008;Broitman et al., 2005;Goodwin et al., 2012;Halliday, 2012). In this sensitive region, incident shortwave solar radiation entering the ocean (Q sw ) plays an important role in both the temperature variability (Sinnett and Feddersen, 2014) and pathogen mortality through UV-B photobiological damage (e.g., Sinton et al., 1994Sinton et al., , 2002. Shortwave solar radiation entering the ocean is defined as where Q d is the total downwelling (downward) component of solar shortwave radiation, and Q u is the upwelling (upward) component of shortwave radiation reflected from the ocean surface. The albedo \u03b1 (surface reflection coefficient) is defined as making Under direct sun, open ocean albedo \u03b1 depends on the solar zenith angle \u03b8 s (the angle of sun declination from vertical) and has a daily average of \u03b1 \u2248 0.06 (Payne, 1972;Briegleb et al., 1986;Taylor et al., 1996). Under cloudy (diffusely lit) skies, open ocean albedo is near 0.06 and is independent of \u03b8 s (Payne, 1972). However, wind generates ocean whitecaps (foam) (e.g., Monahan, 1971; Monahan and Muircheartaigh, 1980) associated with elevated albedo. Wind also enhances the sea-surface slope variability (e.g., Ross and Dion, 2007), which affects albedo at large solar zenith angles (e.g., Saunders, 1967). Laboratory measurements indicate that pure foam has albedo \u03b1 = 0.55 (Whitlock et al., 1982). For a fractional surface coverage of foam \u03b6 , the combined effects of foam and open water on albedo are often (e.g., Koepke, 1984;Frouin et al., 1996;Jin et al., 2011) represented as where \u03b1 f is the foam albedo, and \u03b1 \u03b8 is the parameterized solar zenith angle dependent open ocean albedo (e.g., Taylor et al., 1996). The foam fraction \u03b6 from open ocean whitecapping has been parameterized using a surface wind speed |u w | dependence (e.g., Hansen et al., 1983;Jin et al., 2004Jin et al., , 2011, but has a negligible effect on albedo (less than 0.002) for winds |u w | < 12 m s \u22121 (Payne, 1972;Moore et al., 2000;Frouin et al., 2001). In the surfzone, foam is generated by depth-limited wave breaking regardless of wind, potentially elevating surfzone \u03b1 and reducing Q sw . Nearshore temperature evolution (e.g., Sinnett and Feddersen, 2014; Hally-Rosendahl et al., submitted for publication) depends strongly on Q sw in the surfzone and inner-shelf, the region just seaward of the surfzone. Elevated surfzone albedo may also help explain reduced surfzone pathogen mortality relative to the inner-shelf (e.g., Rippy et al., 2013a,b) making the surfzone albedo an important factor controlling the ecology of the region. Limited (21 min) surfzone albedo observations at 440-650 nm wavelengths reported elevated albedo up to 0.4-0.6, compared to 0.06 observed in the inner-shelf (Frouin et al., 1996), potentially influencing the surfzone heat budget (Sinnett and Feddersen, 2014). However, no other surfzone albedo observations have been published (to our knowledge) and depth-limited wave-breaking albedo parameterizations do not exist. Thus, the magnitude and variability of surfzone albedo are not known, nor are its impacts on nearshore temperature and pathogen mortality. Making surfzone albedo observations is difficult, thus surfzone albedo parameterizations are needed. Results from a year-long experiment at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) pier measuring nearshore albedo under a wide variety of conditions are presented here, together with tests of two surfzone albedo parameterizations. As surfzone foam is visible in both time-elapsed (e.g., Lippmann and Holman, 1990;Holland et al., 1997;Almar et al., 2010) and snapshot (e.g., Stockdon and Holman, 2000;Chickadel et al., 2003) optical images, the first parameterization uses optical images to estimate foam fraction and albedo. The second parameterization uses a wave and roller transformation model to estimate foam fraction and albedo. The experiment methods and observations are described in Section 2. Results and the two parameterizations are presented in Section 3, discussed in Section 4, and summarized in Section 5."}, {"section_title": "Methods and observations", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Experiment description", "text": "Shortwave solar radiation, wave statistics, winds, and water depth were measured between October 25th, 2014 and October 25th, 2015 at the SIO pier ( Fig. 1(a)), La Jolla, California (lat 32.867, lon \u2212117.257). Cross-shore (x) bathymetry profiles were made at 0.5 to 1 month intervals (see dots in Fig. 3(a)) between x = 0 m (the cross-shore location of the shoreline extents at mean tide at the start of the experiment) and the pier end at x = \u2212270 m. NOAA tide gauge station 9410230 at the SIO pier end (in \u22487 m water depth) measured the water level at 6 min intervals. A representative crosssectional view (Fig. 1(b)) shows the mean bathymetric profile, the Mean Tide Level (MTL) reference height (h = 0), and tidal standard deviation (\u22480.5 m). Downwelling, Q d and upwelling, Q u shortwave solar radiation was measured by a Campbell Scientific NR01 research grade four-way radiometer (Fig. 2(b)) having two shortwave radiation sensors (wavelengths from 305 nm to 2800 nm) with 2.9 s response time and cosine angle spatial response over a 180\u00b0field of view. The sensor noise level is <1.5% of the signal, instrument drift is expected to be <1% per year, and instrument tilt errors are expected to be <2%. Both radiometer sensors were calibrated within one year of their deployment according to ISO 9847. The NR01 radiometer was attached to the end of a custom designed boom arm (Fig. 2(b)) and fitted to the south side of the SIO pier at x R = \u2212100 m. The cross-shore deployment location was chosen so that the radiometer would observe the surfzone roughly two-thirds of the time depending on the tidal depth and wave height. The radiometer was mounted 6.5 m above MTL to avoid significant spray from breaking waves, while assuring that more than 90% of the upwelling signal was confined to a 14 m radius watch circle beneath the instrument. The mounting boom was hinged at the pier end and midboom arm (Fig. 2(c) arrows) allowing it to swing parallel and pivot up to the pier deck for cleaning at roughly 5 day intervals. Generally, the radiometer sampled Q d and Q u continuously at 1 Hz, storing the 1 min mean and standard deviation. On 9 days, a GoPro camera with a 72\u00b0vertical and 94\u00b0horizontal field of view was mounted on the pier deck approximately 2.5 m above the radiometer looking down at the water at \u224845\u00b0from horizontal. The camera captured images of the surfzone conditions at two second intervals with a 1/4000 s shutter speed, f/2.8 aperture value and ISO 100 speed rating. During this time the radiometer stored 1 Hz samples directly, allowing image and albedo comparison. At pier-end, hourly significant wave height H (p) s and peak period T p were estimated by the Coastal Data Information Program wave gauge. During times when the wave gauge was offline (July 29 to August 20, 2015) a realtime spectral refraction wave model initialized from offshore buoys (O'Reilly and Guza, 1991, 1998) with very high skill was used. Winds were observed by the NOAA station at the pier end 18 m above MTL and reported as six-minute averaged values. The experiment site latitude and local time were used to calculate solar zenith angle \u03b8 s based on Reda and Andreas (2008)."}, {"section_title": "Observations", "text": "At x R , the water depth h R varied due to tidal changes in sea surface elevation and on longer time scales due to bathymetry changes ( Fig. 3(a)). Beach profile evolution followed a wintertime (defined here as day 26 on November 20, 2014 to day 126 on February 28, 2015) erosion and summertime (day 212 on May 25, 2015 to day 312 on September 2, 2015) accretion pattern, characteristic of southern California beaches (e.g., Ludka et al., 2015).

(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) seasonally with typically stronger wintertime and weaker summertime wave events ( Fig. 3b). Winds were typically calm, with average wind speed |u w | of 2.25 m s \u22121 having diurnal variability and occasional peaks above 10 m s \u22121 , particularly in winter ( Fig. 3(c)). Solar zenith angle fluctuated diurnally with daily minimum \u03b8 s varying on an annual time-scale between 56.31\u00b0and 9.43\u00b0near the winter and summer solstice respectively ( Fig. 3(d)). Foam-free albedo depends on \u03b8 s in direct light (clear sky) but not in diffuse light (cloudy skies) (Payne, 1972). Lighting conditions are characterized with the atmospheric transmittance T r defined as the ratio of the observed downwelling radiation Q d to the theoretical maximum Q d , where S is the solar constant and \u03b3 is the ratio of the actual to mean earth-sun separation distance. Direct light conditions are defined when T r > 0.6, and diffuse light conditions are defined when T r < 0.3. The observations were made in 58% clear sky, 16% cloudy sky and 26% mixed sky (0.3 < T r < 0.6) conditions. Both Q d and Q u observations were removed during rain or heavy fog events when the radiometer was affected by moisture. In addition, Q d and Q u observations were removed when \u03b8 s > 60\u00b0to avoid nighttime and times when the sun was behind a coastal bluff or very near the horizon. The radiometer was too close to the cross-shore location of exposed sand when, at x R , the depth h R < 1.3 m (approximately 38% of the time). These observations were also removed. The boom arm extended 6.35 m to the south of the pier to avoid pier shadow under clear skies, when the vast majority of light arrives from the southern sky. However, when the solar azimuth angle \u03c6 < 109\u00b0(<0.1% of the time), pier shadows were cast under the radiometer and these observations were removed. In total, \u224850% of daytime data was retained. For pure diffuse light conditions, the true Q u is slightly underestimated primarily due to pier deck shadow reducing the available downwelling light and also due to pier pilings directly blocking a fraction of the upwelling light from the north. This effect is corrected following Payne (1972) so that the upwelling shortwave radiation is where Q mu is the measured upwelling shortwave radiation, T r is the atmospheric transmittance, and pier geometry sets the coefficient (0.15). This correction has no effect on the results. Downwelling shortwave radiation Q d had a predominantly diurnal pattern with seasonal longterm variability and short (<6 h) time-scale variability due to clouds (red in Fig. 3(e)). Clear-sky daily maximum Q d varied between 610 W m \u22122 in wintertime to 1064 W m \u22122 in the summer. Clouds typically reduced Q d , but also increased Q d for short periods (seconds to minutes) due to magnification caused by the ''edge-of-cloud'' effect (e.g., Davies, 1978;Coakley and Davies, 1986). Reflected shortwave upwelling radiation Q u (blue in Fig. 3(e)) also varied on diurnal time scales, but contained variability on shorter time scales as well. A time series of over 70,000 one-minute averaged observed albedo observations \u03b1 o was generated from the retained Q d and Q u with (2). Observed albedo \u03b1 o varied from 0.04 to 0.45 on a range of timescales from minutes to many days ( Fig. 3(f))."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Albedo dependence on \u03b8 s and waves", "text": "Here, the one-minute averaged observed albedo \u03b1 o is directly compared to solar zenith angle (\u03b8 s ) dependent parameterizations that assume no foam (e.g., Taylor et al., 1996). Observed one-minute averaged albedo \u03b1 o are significantly elevated from a solar zenith angle dependent parameterization \u03b1 \u03b8 (compare dots to red dashed in Fig. 4) for both clear and diffuse light conditions. For cos |\u03b8 s | > 0.5, \u03b1 o varied from near 0.04, typical of \u03b1 \u03b8 , to 0.45, far exceeding \u03b1 \u03b8 (Fig. 4). Over all conditions spanning both the surfzone and inner-shelf, the mean albedo was 0.11, nearly twice previous estimates of openocean daily averaged albedo (e.g., Payne, 1972). Although the minimum \u03b1 o values are consistent with \u03b1 \u03b8 under both light conditions, the binned mean \u03b1 o is roughly one \u03b1 o standard deviation higher than \u03b1 \u03b8 for all \u03b8 s in both clear and diffuse light conditions (compare red diamonds and vertical bars to red dashed curve, Fig. 4). Depth-limited wave breaking is often well determined by the ratio of local wave height to water depth H s /h (e.g., Thornton and Guza, 1983). To investigate whether the elevated \u03b1 o is due to breakingwave generated foam or rather due to surface wind speed (as in open ocean parameterizations), the relationship between \u27e8\u03b1 o \u27e9 (where \u27e8\u27e9 denotes an hourly average) and H (p) s /h R is examined, where H (p) s is the pier-end (x = \u2212270 m) significant wave height and h R is the water depth at the radiometer (x R = \u2212100 m). Hourly-averaged \u27e8\u03b1 o \u27e9 varies between 0.04-0.33 and is strongly related to H (p) s /h R (Fig. 5(a)) with r 2 = 0.64. Wind speeds at this location were typically weak; mean winds were \u22482 m s \u22121 , and sustained winds over 4 m s \u22121 were observed less than 12% of the time. As expected, winds were not correlated with \u27e8\u03b1 o \u27e9 (Fig. 5(b)) since total ocean reflectance when winds are less than 8 m s \u22121 is negligible (Koepke, 1984) and whitecapping due to winds below 15 m s \u22121 has not been observed to enhance albedo (Payne, 1972;Frouin et al., 2001). The relationship between \u27e8\u03b1 o \u27e9 and H (p) s /h R demonstrates that for larger incident waves H (p) s or smaller local water depth h R , \u27e8\u03b1 o \u27e9 is elevated in a consistent manner and confirms that the breaking-wave foam strongly contributes to the observed albedo, motivating the following two parameterization approaches. Fig. 4. One-minute averaged observed albedo \u03b1 o versus cos(\u03b8 s ) under (a) clear sky conditions (T r > 0.6) and (b) diffuse light conditions (T r < 0.3). Binned means (red diamonds) and \u00b1 one standard deviation (red vertical lines) of \u03b1 o are mostly elevated over the \u03b8 s -only based Taylor et al. (1996) parameterization \u03b1 \u03b8s (red dashed). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Fig. 5.

Correlation between albedo and wind speed at this site (r 2 = 0.06) is not significant from zero at the 95% confidence interval, however albedo is correlated with H"}, {"section_title": "Image-based parameterization", "text": "Following open-ocean whitecapping parameterizations (e.g., Hansen et al., 1983;Jin et al., 2004Jin et al., , 2011, surfzone albedo is expected to depend on \u03b8 s and the breaking-wave generated foam fraction \u03b6 w . Time-averaged and snapshot images of the surfzone have successfully been used to identify areas with elevated foam (e.g., Lippmann and Holman, 1990;Stockdon and Holman, 2000). Here, images from the pier-mounted GoPro camera are used to estimate \u03b6 w and compared to 1-Hz sampled \u03b1 o to derive an image-based albedo parameterization. For a broken wave with extensive foam (Fig. 6(a)), the 1-Hz sampled \u03b1 o = 0.33, elevated above \u03b1 \u03b8 = 0.06. In contrast, for foam-free conditions (Fig. 6(b)), \u03b1 o = 0.05, consistent with expected \u03b1 \u03b8 . The images were cropped and converted to 0-255 count grayscale G (Fig. 6(c)  and g are the red, blue and green components respectively, retain luminance while removing hue and saturation. Elevated G can result from foam (white areas in Fig. 6(c) upper left Fig. 6(d)). Typically, sun glint is brighter than foam, which is brighter than foam-free areas, allowing for differentiation between regions using grayscale values. For the breaking case, the probability density function (PDF) of grayscale pixel values p(G) contains three peaks near 100, 190 and 255 ( Fig. 6(e)), corresponding to areas of open water, foam and sun glint in Fig. 6(a). For the non-breaking case, p(G) only has two peaks near 100 and 255 ( Fig. 6(d)) corresponding to open water and sun glint. The peak near 190 associated with foam ( Fig. 6(c)) is not present. To quantify image area containing open water, foam and sun glint, all grayscale PDFs are first averaged together forming a mean p(G) (not shown). Similar to Carini et al. (2015), PDF curvature p \u2032\u2032 (G) maxima define cutoff values between open water, whitewater and sun glint (lines on Fig. 6(e), (f)), here found to be G = 170 and G = 230. As foam is not a specular reflector (Monahan et al., 1986), sun glint must be from foam free regions and is thus classified as open water. The pixel fraction (as a proxy for surface area) of foam \u03b6 w is then calculated. For the breaking case ( Fig. 6(e)), the pixel fraction attributed to foam was \u03b6 w = 0.55, and for the non-breaking case (Fig. 6(f)) \u03b6 w = 0.03. This approach is applied to all images, creating a time series of foam fraction \u03b6 w (t) at x R . Similar to open ocean whitecapping albedo formulations (4), the image-derived albedo \u03b1 I is where \u03b1 \u03b8 is the \u03b8 s dependent parameterization for foam-free water, \u03b6 w is derived from the images, and the foam albedo \u03b1 f is considered a free parameter. The 1-Hz \u03b1 o varied over 0.02-0.45, spanning a broad range of solar zenith angle (13.7\u00b0< \u03b8 s < 56\u00b0), depth (1.3 < h < 2.6 m) and wave height (0.45 < H s < 1.21 gm) conditions. Minimizing the rms error between \u03b1 I and \u03b1 o results in a best fit \u03b1 f = 0.465 and a surfzone albedo parameterization with high skill (r 2 = 0.90 with binned-mean r 2 = 0.97, Fig. 7). The high skill of the parameterized \u03b1 I is highlighted with a ten-minute example including several breaking wave events from larger wave-groups at 1-2 min intervals (Fig. 8). Breaking waves caused observed albedo \u03b1 o (black line, Fig. 8) to increase sharply (in a few seconds), well above \u03b1 \u03b8 (black dotted). Individual \u03b1 o peaks during a large wave-group event (around 200 s) were spaced near T p = 9 s. The highest \u03b1 o values, near 0.35, occurred after two or more successive breaking waves almost completely covered the radiometer's field of view. Smaller \u03b1 o peaks occurred when breaking events partially filled the field of view or did not break as vigorously. After the initial step-like increase lasting a few seconds, the albedo decayed toward \u03b1 \u03b8 with time scales \u224820 s as the bubbly foam outgassed (e.g., Ma et al., 2011). The asymmetry of the observed albedo \u03b1 o rapid increases and slower outgassing decay are well represented by \u03b1 I (red curve, Fig. 8), and \u03b1 I tracks \u03b1 o at both wave group and individual-wave timescales. At \u03b1 o peaks (particularly >0.2), after a rapid increase, parameterized \u03b1 I tends to have a high bias (Fig. 8). This elevated \u03b1 I bias for \u03b1 o > 0.2 is also seen in the scatterplot (Fig. 7) and is discussed further in Section 4. Overall this image-based parameterization predicts the foam-induced elevated \u03b1 o unexplained by \u03b1 \u03b8 (Fig. 4), and the good \u03b1 I and \u03b1 o time-series agreement ( Fig. 8) is also seen at other times and over a wide variety of surfzone conditions."}, {"section_title": "Wave model based albedo parameterization", "text": "Although the image-based parameterization has very high skill, a camera is required, which often is not available. However, given knowledge of one dimensional h(x), wave transformation models have high skill in predicting the cross-shore evolution of wave height (e.g., Ruessink et al., 2001Ruessink et al., , 2003. This motivates a second albedo parameterization that utilizes a wave model to relate roller dissipation to foam fraction and albedo through (4). Assuming normally-incident narrow-banded waves on alongshore uniform beaches, onedimensional wave and roller transformation models (e.g., Thornton and Guza, 1983;Battjes and Stive, 1985;Ruessink et al., 2001) relate wave energy flux gradient to wave-energy dissipation, where E is the wave energy density, C g is the group velocity given by linear theory, and \u27e8\u03f5 b \u27e9 is the bulk breaking wave dissipation. The wave energy density is E = 1/16\u03c1gH 2 s where \u03c1 is water density, g is gravity and H s is the local significant wave height. The breaking wave dissipation \u27e8\u03f5 b \u27e9 is given by Church and Thornton (1993) with standard breaking parameters (B = 0.9 and \u03b3 = 0.57). The roller energy equation is (e.g., Ruessink et al., 2001) where E r is the roller energy density and c is the linear theory phase speed. Roller dissipation is defined as (Deigaard, 1993)  with slope \u03b2 = 0.1 (e.g., Walstra et al., 1996). The coupled Eqs. (8) and (9) are solved with the specified h(x) and offshore (pier-end) boundary conditions of observed H s and T p , with E r = 0. Example output from the wave and roller model characterizes the cross-shore evolution of H s (Fig. 9(a)) due to the bathymetric profile ( Fig. 9(e)). As waves shoal onshore, wave height increases to H s = 1.5 m at x = \u2212170 m where breaking occurs, roller dissipation becomes non-zero ( Fig. 9(b)) and wave height decreases. The terraced, non-monotonic bathymetry create undulating regions of elevated \u27e8\u03f5 r \u27e9 (e.g., near x = 140 m, x = 90 m, Fig. 9(b)) and weaker \u27e8\u03f5 r \u27e9 (e.g., near x = 125 m and x = 65 m). To develop a wave-model based albedo parameterization \u03b1 w , the average foam fraction \u27e8\u03b6 w \u27e9 is hypothesized to depend linearly on non-dimensional (\ued4a) wave roller dissipation \u27e8\ued4a \u03f5 r \u27e9 as where \u27e8\ued4a \u03f5 r \u27e9 is non-dimensionalized by wave-dissipation scaling (e.g., Battjes, 1975;Feddersen and Trowbridge, 2005;Feddersen, 2012a,b) as and m is a fit parameter found by minimizing rms error between \u03b1 o and \u03b1 w . The hourly averaged wavemodel based albedo is found from (4) using \u27e8\u03b6 w \u27e9 and \u03b1 f = 0.465 as in Section 3.2.

The wave model was initialized with one-hour averaged H s = 1.3 m and T p = 13.4 s measured at the pier-end (assuming incident waves). Modeled quantities are not shown for h < 0.5 m. albedo with the parameterized albedo, \u27e8\u03b6 w \u27e9 is also area-averaged with an identical cosine weighted response centered at x R . The resulting foam fraction \u27e8\u03b6 w \u27e9 is both time and area averaged (where denotes an area average) and the resulting time and area averaged wave-model based albedo \u27e8\u03b1 w \u27e9 is found from (4). When the radiometer sampled the surfzone (at x R , H s /h \u2265 0.57), the mean observed surfzone albedo \u03b1 o was 0.15, over twice the daily average open ocean albedo parameterization of 0.06. The observed hourly averaged albedo \u27e8\u03b1 o \u27e9 varied between 0.04 and 0.33, greater than the open ocean albedo parameterization more than 80% of the time. The parameterized \u27e8\u03b1 w \u27e9 was a good predictor of \u27e8\u03b1 o \u27e9 with significant skill (r 2 = 0.68) when best fit parameter m = 398 (dots in Fig. 10). The parameterized binned mean \u27e8\u03b1 w \u27e9 (red diamonds in Fig. 10) has high skill (r 2 = 0.94) over these widely ranging and elevated albedo conditions. Factors contributing to variance in the binned quantities are discussed in Section 4. Although \u27e8\u03b1 w \u27e9 is generated from hourly-averaged wave statistics, \u27e8\u03b1 w \u27e9 is able to track albedo changes on time scales related to \u03b8 s , h and H s (Fig. 11). For example, over six days, the combined effects of \u03b8 s and wave energy at x R cause the daily average of both \u27e8\u03b1 o \u27e9 and \u27e8\u03b1 w \u27e9 to vary between 0.06 and 0.18. Albedo also varied by 0.16 in only 4 h on day 2 associated with changes in H s /h, yet there is still good agreement between \u27e8\u03b1 w \u27e9 and \u27e8\u03b1 o \u27e9. Albedo estimation at specific cross-shore locations is also possible. The parameterized cross-shore foam fraction \u27e8\u03b6 w \u27e9 varies from zero offshore to local maxima of \u27e8\u03b6 w \u27e9 = 0.3 and \u27e8\u03b6 w \u27e9 = 0.5 at x = \u2212140 m and x = \u221290 m, respectively (Fig. 9(c)), consistent with the range of image inferred \u03b6 w . The resulting \u27e8\u03b1 w \u27e9(x) ( Fig. 9(d)) is frequently above the \u03b8 s dependent parameterization at this time (\u03b1 \u03b8 = 0.06) which is only valid in locations where there is no breaking. Surfzone albedo can also be parameterized with non-dimensionalized roller-energy instead of roller dissipation, with similar skill."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Elevated surfzone albedo can impact heat budgets (Sinnett and Feddersen, 2014) and pathogen mortality (e.g., Sinton et al., 2002). Water-entering short-wave solar radiation Q sw is the largest surfzone heat budget term (Sinnett and Feddersen, 2014). An average surfzone albedo increase from \u03b1 = 0.06 to (as observed) \u03b1 = 0.15 would reduce Q sw so that cross-shore advection or wave heating are relatively more important. For example, Sinnett and Feddersen (2014) found a residual surfzone heat export of 5.2 \u00d7 10 3 W m \u22121 . Revising the heat budget using \u03b1 = 0.15, reduces the residual heat export by 30%. Dye tracer can linger in the surfzone for >12 h (Hally-Rosendahl et al., submitted for publication), indicating the time-scales pathogens can remain in bathing waters. Increasing albedo from 0.06 to 0.15 roughly doubles fecal coliform bacterial survival rates (Sinton et al., 2002), increasing potential human health risk if not appropriately accounted for. The observed albedo \u03b1 o is a space and time-average over the radiometer's 14-m radius cosine response and 2.9 s time constant. With propagating breaking waves which continuously outgas bubbles, the radiometer will never instantaneously sample pure foam over its entire field of view. This may explain why the best-fit foam albedo \u03b1 f = 0.465 is less than the laboratory observed maximum value of 0.55 (Whitlock et al., 1982). Although the image-based \u03b1 I predicts \u03b1 o with high skill (Fig. 7), for \u03b1 o > 0.2, \u03b1 I is biased high particularly when a breaking wave front passes and d\u03b1/dt is large (Fig. 8). The 2.9 s radiometer response time, relative to the near-instantaneous camera response time, may explain this bias at times of step function-like changes in albedo. The specific grayscale PDF cutoff limits for open water, foam, and sun glint, derived from p extrema, are the result of the lighting and fixed camera settings at this location. To apply this parameterization with another camera or at another location, one must first establish the relevant p \u2032\u2032 (G) based cutoff limits. This method can also be applied to time-averaged images. Good agreement between \u03b1 I and \u03b1 o was found with a constant foam albedo \u03b1 f applied to grayscale values within the foam cutoff limits. The fit may be improved if \u03b1 f is a function of G. Furthermore, images were not georectified. The images were cropped to limit the field of view to a relatively small area beneath the radiometer, and the 45\u00b0camera angle caused the imaged pixel area to have a similar spatial response as the radiometer. For example, the pixels near the top of the image cover roughly 35% more area than the pixels near the bottom, and the radiometer cosine response reduces the signal by roughly 40% near the top of the image. As the camera and radiometer were sampling with similar spatial weights, image rectification was not needed. However, image rectification may be required if this parameterization technique is applied to images covering a wider area (e.g., ARGUS), or to images taken at shallower angles. When breaking occurs, \u27e8\u03b1 o \u27e9 is elevated above \u03b1 \u03b8 (Figs. 3 and 4), and the wave-model based parameterization has good skill (r 2 = 0.68) in predicting \u03b1 o (Fig. 10), although significant unexplained variance remains. Waves were assumed to be normally-incident (as expected for long-period waves in h < 6 m), and standard wave and roller model coefficients were used. The bathymetry near piers is often scoured (Elgar et al., 2001), which may result in pier-based bathymetry measurement errors. Depth h errors and wave model errors would induce roller energy dissipation \u27e8\u03f5 r \u27e9 errors, and eventually \u27e8\u03b1 w \u27e9 errors, potentially contributing to the unexplained variance in Fig. 10."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Breaking-wave induced foam elevates albedo \u03b1 relative to foam-free ocean. Open-ocean albedo parameterizations account for foam through a wind speed dependent whitecapping foam fraction \u03b6 w . However, surfzone depth-limited wave breaking does not depend on wind, and wind-based foam fraction parameterizations are inaccurate in the surfzone. Measuring albedo in the energetic surfzone environment is difficult, and observations of surfzone albedo are very rare. The variability of surfzone albedo is not known, and parameterizations have not been available. Ocean-entering shortwave solar radiation Q sw depends on albedo and affects both temperature variability and pathogen mortality. This motivates new observations of surfzone albedo and the development of two surfzone albedo parameterizations based on camera images and a wave model. A year-long experiment at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography pier observed upwelling Q u and downwelling Q d shortwave radiation spanning the surfzone and inner-shelf over a range of wave and depth conditions. A two-way radiometer was mounted 6.5 m above the mean ocean surface and 6.35 m away from the pier, limiting pier shadow effects. Additional wave, wind, tidal and bathymetric observations were collected. On nine days, a downward-looking GoPro camera fixed above the radiometer location continuously captured water surface images. For solar zenith angle \u03b8 s < 60\u00b0, one-minute averaged observed albedo (as large as \u03b1 o = 0.45) far exceeded the open ocean solar zenith angle parameterized albedo of 0.06. The elevated observed albedo was related to breaking wave conditions under the radiometer and observed albedo was not related to the wind speed. A surfzone albedo parameterization is developed using images to estimate foam fraction \u03b6 w , identified by the distribution of grayscale pixels values. This image-based parameterization has high skill (r 2 = 0.90), with a best-fit parameter for foam albedo of \u03b1 f = 0.465, slightly less than laboratory maximum of 0.55 likely due to radiometer finite time and spatial response. This parameterization captures albedo variability on the time-scales of individual waves (9 s) and wave groups (minutes). A wave-model based parameterization relates non-dimensionalized wave roller energy dissipation to the hourly-averaged foam fraction \u27e8\u03b6 w \u27e9 and, thus, to albedo. The wave model is initiated with bathymetry and incident wave conditions. This parameterization predicts hourly averaged observations from the radiometer, has good skill (r 2 = 0.68), and can resolve cross-shore albedo variations. Bathymetry or wave model errors may contribute to unexplained variance. These new parameterizations are applicable where imagery (e.g., ARGUS) or nearshore wave models are available, and can be used to constrain local heat budgets and pathogen mortality estimation."}]
