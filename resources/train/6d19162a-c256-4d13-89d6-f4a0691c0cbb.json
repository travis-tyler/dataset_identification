Information elicited included farm work characteristics, prevention practices, and demographics. Results showed that women working 1 to 20 hours per week were less likely to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) than women working more than 20 hours per week. This included wearing seat belts on tractors; using hearing, eye, or breathing protection; and wearing gloves or boots. No differences were found between groups for use of skin protection, hair holders, or helmets on all terrain vehicles (ATVs). The researchers concluded that if nursing interventions such as teaching and counseling related to prevention methods could be provided, the incidence of acute and chronic illnesses and traumatic injury would decline. W ithin the farmin g indu stry and community, women have been considered \"invisible supporters\" of the male role as farm worker and manager. For many years, the female role has been accepted as \"farmer's wife\" or \"homemaker\" (Engberg, 1993) . Currently, this is not the situation becau se many farms are family owned. An increasing number of women are directly involved in the farming operation as managers by marketing farm products, making purchases of necessary farm materials, managing computer records, and assisting with long term planning (Taylor, 1997) . Women play an important part in managing the farm and performing many of the farm duties either alone or with a family member.\nThe trend has shifted to larger farms and smaller familie s. Thu s, even more daughters have entered the Farm women notonly take care of the household functions, but assist in farm management activities, such as marketing farm products, purchasing materials, and financial planning. Thus, occupational health nurses need to develop strategies for targeting groups of women who may be at risk for health hazards related to participation in various farming operations. Interventions such as counseling and teaching related to prevention methods that could lead to a reduction in illnesses and injury are needed. Occupational health nurses need to collaborate with various community leaders to provide education about the operation of farm equipment and appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). This can be achieved by working with the local Cooperative Extension Agency.\nfarming business as either a partner or the independent franchise manager (Henderson, 2000 ; United States Department of Agriculture [USDA], 1999) . Therefore, women can be exposed to many potential health hazards that can result in chronic illnesses, debilitation, or death.\nSpecifically, women living and working on dairy farms or cattle ranches are at high risk for exposure to various environmental hazards. Not only are women working with livestock, but also they are involved with hay and grain production. Many factors should be considered when addressing health hazard exposure and women farmers, including inhaled grain dust, pesticides and other chemicals, and animal waste (Engberg, 1993) . One important factor that easily can be controlled to prevent acute and chronic health problems is the length of time an individual is exposed to a specific hazard. If women who farm are exposed to various health hazards on a daily basis, many health problems can be prevented by consistently using proper protective equipment (PPE).\nThe concern about women farmers' exposure to health hazards raises the following research question: Is protective equipment being used [by women] when performing farm work based on various length of exposure time? This study explored and described health hazards affecting southeast Louisiana women working on farms, preventive measures used by them, and the consistency with which women with varying levels of time commitment toward farm operations use protective equipment."}, {"section_title": "REVIEW OF LITERATURE", "text": "Although exposure to various health hazards, length of time exposed, and prevention methods related to farm work have been reported in the literature, minimal investigation into the effect of behavior on health has been conducted. Reed (1999) examined the role of farm women in Kentucky and Texas. It was reported that although 46% of women in both states described themselves as farm homemakers, they engaged in farm tasks on a regular basis. The tasks includ-ed work with various animals, field irrigation, farm equipment operation, and general farm management.\nThe investigators concluded that farm women view themselves as homemakers and may not perceive themselves as at risk of exposure to health hazards, such as poisoning, accidents, and sun exposure. Therefore, when farm women seek health care attention for cold and flu symptoms, cuts and bruises, and sunburn, they do not see these as hazardous or life threatening problems resulting from performing farm chores. Direct contact in farm work exposes women to potential injury and illness. Some studies have reported a variety of chores in which farm women engage. Chores most frequently mentioned include (Boyle, 1997; Reed, 1999 Differences in health hazard exposure to farm work are directly related to farm chores and exposure to chemicals and biological sources. For example, the literature reports information related to a high incidence of spontaneous abortions in female farm workers exposed to pesticides (Werner, 1993) . Other literature reports various hazards involving accidents; bodily injury from constant physical strain; and exposure to chemicals, grain dust, and biological sources, especially for women living and working on dairy farms (Ahonen, 1990; Boyle, 1997; Sachs, 1996) . In one study of injuries to dairy farmers, 52% of those injured were women involved in milking and feeding the livestock (Boyle, 1997) .\nExposure to pesticides, animal waste, and grain dust often can have a long term effect on the body. Symptoms sometimes remain dormant and may not appear for months or years later. By then the individual may have developed infections, respiratory disease, cancer, pesticide toxicity, dermatitis, or blindness. As a result, short or long term exposure can lead to disability or death, and, therefore, greatly decrease quality of life (Mullan, 1996; Pel!, 1997; Van Essen, 1999) .\nFarm workers, especially women, are exposed to a variety of chemicals and inhalation substances on a daily basis. Fertilizers and pesticides often come in dry form and must be mixed prior to application. If proper equipment is not used, acute and chronic poisonings, respiratory disease, and cancer can occur because of exposure to mucous membranes (Shapiro, 1980; Wright, 1993) .\nExposure to livestock waste can result in respiratory tract irritation and diseases of the bone, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and liver. In addition, mycotic zoonoses can cause systemic fungal infections of the epidermis, hair, and nails (Haas, 1995) .\nAnother major hazard category for farm workers is accidents, especially from equipment such as tractors and three or four wheeled all terrain vehicles (ATVs). These machines often are used for farm work, such as transporting small farm equipment, animals, and feed when a trailer is attached. Also, the power take off device used by tractors, hay balers, and bush hog machines can cause scalping if long hair gets caught in the device (CDC, 1992; Roerig, 1993 With a better understanding of these issues, nurses can more effectively educate farm women about preventing illness, accidents, and disability."}, {"section_title": "Respiratory Problems", "text": "Some believe that because farmers work in the country, they breath more fresh air than the workers in the smog filled, crowded city. This is a misconception. Various tasks increase the farmer's likelihood of harmful exposure to the respiratory tract, especially when proper preventive measures (e.g., wearing a mask) are not used (Langley, 1998) .\nRespiratory responses to various irritants depend on factors such as the intensity and duration of exposure, characteristics of the product, and the individual's susceptibility (Ehlers, 1993) . The farm family experiences firsthand frequent exposure to these dusts, chemicals, and gases that lead to potential respiratory hazards.\nDiseases resulting from exposure to respiratory hazards have been described. For example, Farmer's Lung (i.e., a form of hypersensitivity pneumonitis from minute inhaled antigens created by fungal spores in moldy hay and grain) and Silo Filler's Disease (i.e., a chemical pneumonitis from nitrogen oxides found in grain silos) are two diseases specific to this population. Confinement house gases from dairy cattle are a buildup of waste products resulting in the formation of toxic carbon dioxide gases. They cause severe debilitating respiratory function (Donham, 1982; Werner, 1993; Wright, 1993) ."}, {"section_title": "Biological Sources", "text": "Frequent exposure to animal waste products, especially in the humidity of southeast Louisiana where dairy farming is common, can contribute to infectious zoonotic diseases. These diseases can be contracted through direct or indirect contact with infected livestock on dairy or cattle farms (Donham, 1982) .\nCattle can transmit approximately 40 infectious organisms to humans (e.g., salmonella) affecting the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems. In farm families, diseases can occur when infected farm animals, especially cattle, contaminate the barnyard with uterine discharges and placentae. Organisms remain dormant on the ground for months, but, when inhaled, cause infection (Haas, 1995) . Many of these infections are difficult to diagnose because symptoms mimic influenza (Haas, 1995; Werner, 1993) . Using protective equipment (e.g., gloves, rubber boots) along with proper hygiene, reduces the transmission of infectious diseases that lead to illness. "}, {"section_title": "Pesticides", "text": "Pesticide exposure is a great contributor to farm family health problems and occurs mostly because of inaccurate mixing and careless use. Studies suggest that proper mixing and careful use with protective equipment such as masks, eye wear, and gloves can prevent potential health hazards (Henry, 1997; Lusk, 1996; Winstead, 1993) .\nMost of this information has been reported in a general manner. It projects \"the farmer\" as a family, encompassing man, woman, and child. Therefore, any of these health hazard concerns related to accidents and exposure to various chemicals, toxic dust, and biological waste products can affect any member of the farm worker team, especially women."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "Factors contributing to occupational illness and injury prevention behavior among farm women were investigated as part of the Louisiana Farm Family Injury Prevention and Health Initiative (LAFFIP+HI). This cross sectional study included women older than 18 whose family participated in farming operations, spoke English, and had a telephone in the home. Participants were chosen from a sampling pool of 4,808 farms in Louisiana. The names of farm owners were obtained from mailing lists maintained by the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center and the Farm Service Agency for 10 parishes in southeast Louisiana.\nA stratified, random sample design with parishes comprising the strata and simple random selection without replacement within each stratum was used to select addresses. Sampling was proportional within parish to provide representative participation in keeping with population density. Trained callers conducted 30 to 45 minute telephone interviews. In the event two women at an address were engaged in farming operations, the woman most involved was asked to participate.\nTelephone interviews proceeded in two phases. The first phase determined household eligibility and solicited study participation. During the second stage, eligible women who agreed to participate were interviewed to collect project data. Closer examination identified occupational illness and injury prevention behaviors among participants completing the eligibility screen.\nOf those who completed the eligibility screen, 657 participants (57.6% participation rate among known eligible farms) completed full interviews.

The major commodities were beef cattle, dairy cattle, and hay."}, {"section_title": "Occupational Related Risk Factors", "text": "More than half (70.5%) of the sample worked 1 to 20 hours toward the farming operation, and 153 women (29.5%) worked more than 20 hours.

Table 3 indicates preventive behaviors engaged in by farm women contributing to the farm operation by time commitment.\nProportionally, women working more than 20 hours per week consistently engaged in farm tasks more often than women who contributed fewer than 20 hours per week.

This sample consisted of 519 women who live or work on family owned cattle and dairy farms.\nThe mean age of farm women was 53.5 years. This finding was consistent with findings by Reed (1999) and the 1997 Census of Agriculture (USDA, 1999) for mean age in male farm owners. The occupation of farming is unique because the exposure risks are consistent throughout time. Farming is often multigenerational, with extended retirement age. Farmers engage in repetitious activities throughout time, and, therefore, are exposed to the hazards and risks other occupations may not experience. As women continue to participate in farming, they too may be exposed to the hazards on a farm during the course of their life.\nWomen in this study tended to work on and off the farm, with the majority of women (58%) reporting working off the farm. In addition, more than half the women reported working fewer than 20 hours per week on the farm. This is consistent with Reed (1999) , who found women in Kentucky and Texas often work on and off the farm. Women in this study also were found to engage in multiple tasks and roles in addition to home and family responsibilities.\nWomen in this study, regardless of time commitment, were engaged in a multitude of farm tasks, including: However, the women did not usually attend farm meetings. The complexity of activities performed by these women was consistent with other research examining women's performance of tasks in agricultural operations (Reed, 1999) . Women engage in physically demanding farm tasks in addition to their administrative roles (Reed, 1999) . This could explain why women do not attend farm meetings, thus missing opportunities to learn important safety information.\nWhen comparing the women who worked on the farm fewer than 20 hours per week with those who worked more than 20 hours per week, the researchers found unanticipated patterns of preventive behavior. Women who worked fewer than 20 hours per week were less likely to wear seat belts on tractors, hearing or eye protection, and gloves or boots. In addition, these women were less likely to use a mask for breathing protection. Although these women spend less time working on the farm, their behaviors put them at greater risk for injury, chronic illness, debilitation, and death than women who spend more time working on the farm and use protective equipment. This was the first known study addressing preventive behaviors in relationship to exposure risks.\nNo significant differences were found between the groups of women participating in the preventive behaviors of wearing helmets on ATVs, wearing hair holders, or using skin protection. The researchers contribute this to the small number of women in each group reporting adequate use, and to the fact that an equal number in each group have learned throughout time to protect themselves from some dangerous behaviors. This is consistent with findings reported by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC, 1992) and Roerig (1993) .\nA majority of the women (n = 274, 74.9%) working fewer than 20 hours per week indicated they did not apply pesticides. However, these same women were less likely to engage in preventive behaviors, such as:\n\u2022 Wearing breathing protection, X 2 (I, n =444) = 5.01, p = .02. \u2022 Wearing eye protection, X 2 (I, n =442) =3.76, p = .05. \u2022 Wearing gloves, X 2 (I, n =474) = 3.8, p = .04.\n\u2022 Wearing rubber boots, X 2 (I, n = 475) = 13.23, p = .0001.\nIn many instances, individuals believe PPEs are used to prevent immediate injury. However, PPEs may help protect against the known long term occupational health risks associated with farm work, including spontaneous abortions, respiratory diseases, cancer, dermatitis, blindness, pesticide toxicity, or death (CDC, 1992; Haas, 1995; Langley, 1998; Roerig, 1993; Shapiro, 1980; Wright, 1993) . Future research to determine the dose effect of exposure to hazards and incidence of illnesses among women is needed. The results could help validate the need for PPE use.\nIn this study, the researchers examined tasks and preventive behavior activities based on time commitment to the farm operation. Women contributing to the farm operation more than 20 hours per week proportionally engaged in farm tasks more often than those women working fewer than 20 hours per week. This finding suggests that greater time commitment contributes to an increased number and complexity of tasks.\nConsistent with other research findings (Reed, 1999) , many women in this study drove tractors. Driving a tractor (n =205, 56.1%) was reported less often by women working I to 20 hours per week than women working more than 20 hours per week. Women working I to 20 hours per week were significantly less likely to wear seat belts on tractors, X 2 (I, n = 394) = 7.47,p = .006. Regardless of time commitment, women who do not wear seat belts are at greater risk of serious and possibly fatal injury because of trauma from tractor rollovers.\nUse of PPEs is needed to prevent a variety of occupational illness and injury. For example, wearing gloves prevents transmission of diseases and hand trauma. Noise associated with dairy pumps, ATVs, tractors, and heavy equipment all exceed 110 decibels, posing an occupational risk for hearing loss. Slips, falls, transmission of diseases, and risk of electrocution are associated with environmental exposure to the elements. In this study, women working I to 20 hours per week for the farm operation were significantly less likely to use PPEs that would reduce risk of injury associated with these hazards.\nAlthough women working I to 20 hours per week reported wearing sunscreen and helmets on ATVs more often, the proportion of use was not significantly different between the two groups. The researchers conclude that a high percentage of both groups wore sunscreen because of many years of public health messages targeting individuals exposed to sun. On the other hand, both groups did not engage in use of helmets when riding ATVs. It is speculated that this behavior is prevalent because helmets are inconvenient, costly, and cumbersome. Although many of the currently reported ATV injuries occur during recreational use, ATVs are used extensively on farms for rounding dairy herds, hauling, and spraying fence rows. Therefore, occupational health nurses need to educate farm women about the need for helmets and other PPE while riding ATVs.\nLittle information is available about women working in farm operations. Thus, findings from this research add to the body of knowledge related to the need for primary prevention for women who work on farms. However, this study had a few limitations. Data were collected through interviewer administered, 30 minute telephone surveys, which may have led some women to give erroneous information. With this in mind, the response rate was higher than many studies using paper and pencil methods. Additionally, missing data were minimized because a computer program assisted prompting during interviews.\nParticipants were predominately White, high school graduates who were married, and lived on a family owned farm in Louisiana. Therefore, the findings cannot JULY 2002, VOL. 50, NO.7 be generalized to women from different backgrounds and ethnicities, different work roles, different types of farms, or in different locations. It is possible that women self selected to participate in the study because they were more educated and worked fewer hours, thus increasing their interest and availability and biasing the results. Women in this study were at risk because of the tasks they perform and their pattern of PPE use. Nevertheless, a major finding of this study was the actual amount of time women perform various duties on the farm. Women who work I to 20 hours per week tend to use fewer preventive measures. The combination of not using PPEs and exposure to many potential health hazards can result in chronic illnesses, debilitation, or death."}, {"section_title": "WORKPLACE IMPLICATIONS", "text": "Occupational health nurses need to develop strategies for identifying at risk individuals. If interventions such as counseling and teaching prevention methods could be provided, this could lead to a reduction in acute and chronic illnesses and traumatic injury. Nurses in the workplace are in a unique position to identify farm women at risk for exposure to potential health hazards and chronic health problems. For example, education and counseling are needed to help agricultural communities become more aware of the need to use PPEs. Nurses should collaboratively explore with farm families the importance of reducing health hazards and promoting the use of safety features and PPEs, such as seat belts and helmets.\nThe results of this study indicate women who work on a part time basis in a farm operation may be at greater risk for preventable injuries and illnesses. Therefore, even though all women need to be targeted, the occupational health nurse should be aware of women less involved in farm work on a regular basis because they may lack the proficiency necessary to perform complex tasks. To promote safe and consistent use of farm equipment within agricultural communities, relationships should be developed with county extension agents and public health departments to develop written materials and oral presentations related to wearing: \u2022 Skin protection. \u2022 Helmets on ATVs. \u2022 Seat belts on tractors. \u2022 Gloves. \u2022 Rubber boots. \u2022 Hair holders. \u2022 Hearing and eye protection.\nBecause many women do not attend farm meetings, creative methods of dissemination must be developed. Nurses and other community leaders could conduct presentations at various community farm meetings targeted at discussion of health risks for women. Also, because the average age of farm women in this study was 53, education related to proper use of farm equipment could be provided by representatives at farm equipment stores and through focus groups at county fairs, churches, and other community venues. Many other ideas for primary prevention can be formulated because it has been demonstrated the problem exists.\nBecause farm related injuries and illnesses among women is an emerging issue, this study needs to be replicated to investigate other important variables. These include barriers to PPE use, appropriate educational strategies specifically targeting women, use of PPE by size of farm in addition to hours of work, and minority status of farm families in Louisiana, along with family income levels.\nThis project is supported through a cooperative agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute for Occupational and sponsored by the Southwest Center for Agricultural Health, Injury Prevention. and Education."}]
