[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Risk of weight change and fluctuation for type 2 diabetes was studied in a prospective study among 20,952 Finnish male smokers aged 50-69 years. Baseline data on lifestyle and medical history were collected, and height and weight measured. Weight was measured thrice after the baseline, 1 year apart. Weight change was defined as the slope of the regression line fitted to the four measurements and weight fluctuation as the root-mean-square-error deviation from this line. Incident cases of diabetes were identified from a national medication reimbursement register; 535 cases up to 9 years' follow-up. The Cox proportional hazards model served to estimate relative risk [RR, 95% confidence interval (CI)]. Weight gain and fluctuation associated with higher risk for diabetes, multivariate RR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.44-2.17, for weight gain of at least 4 kg compared with those of weight change less than 4 kg, and RR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.24-2.17 in the highest weight fluctuation quintile compared to the lowest. These RRs remained similar when weight change and fluctuation were adjusted for each other. Large weight fluctuation increased the risk of diabetes both in men who gained weight (C4 kg), had stable weight (\u00b1 \\4 kg), and lost weight (C4 kg); RR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.60-2.94, RR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.14-1.91, and RR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.47-2.83, respectively, compared to those with stable weight and moderate fluctuation. Short-term weight gain and large weight fluctuation are independent risk factors for diabetes."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Obesity, physical inactivity and smoking are established and modifiable risk factors for type 2 diabetes [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . The risk for developing type 2 diabetes also increases with age [3, 4, 6] . When dietary and lifestyle factors were analysed simultaneously in the Nurses' Health Study, the most important risk factor for type 2 diabetes was a higher body mass index (BMI, weight (kg)/height (m)\n2 ) [11] . Weight gain has been associated with the risk for type 2 diabetes [10, [12] [13] [14] [15] .\nWeight loss can prevent or delay the progression to diabetes in obese patients [16, 17] , though some studies have linked weight loss to increased risk for diabetes [18, 19] . Unintentional weight regain frequently follows intentional weight loss, thus leading easily to weight cycling, which appears to enhance subsequent weight gain and may predispose one to obesity [20] [21] [22] [23] . Findings concerning the association between weight fluctuation or cycling and the risk for type 2 diabetes remain controversial; three studies have found weight fluctuation to increase the risk for diabetes [16, 18, 24] , but other three studies have found no significant association [23, 25, 26] .\nWe studied the association of various weight change patterns, specified as weight gain, weight loss, and weight fluctuation, with the risk for type 2 diabetes in Finnish male smokers who participated in the Alpha-Tocopherol, BetaCarotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC Study)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The ATBC Study", "text": "The primary aim of the ATBC Study was to examine whether supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, or both would reduce the incidence of lung cancer and other cancers. The study was a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with a 2 9 2 factorial design [27, 28] . The participants were screened from among the total male population between the ages of 50 and 69 living in south-western Finland (n = 290,406). Men were excluded if they smoked fewer than five cigarettes per day, had prior cancer or a serious disease limiting longterm participation or used vitamin E, vitamin A or betacarotene supplements in excess of predefined doses or anticoagulants. A total of 29,133 eligible men were enrolled from 1985 through 1988, and the trial continued until April 1993 (median intervention time: 6.1 years), with the cohort followed up through national registers thereafter. The institutional review boards of the National Public Health Institute, Finland, and the U.S. National Cancer Institute approved the ATBC Study.

This requires a medical certificate from the attending physician. The certificate of every case is verified to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for diabetes at the Social Insurance Institution which maintains a central register of all patients receiving drug reimbursement.\nThis study included those men (n = 20,952) who had their weight measured at baseline and three times thereafter, 1 year apart after which the follow-up for diabetes began (Fig. 1) . During a follow-up period of up to 9 years, 535 incident cases of diabetes were diagnosed."}, {"section_title": "Data collection", "text": "At baseline, data on medical history, smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity were collected with questionnaires. Height and weight were measured, and BMI was calculated. Blood pressure was measured with a mercury sphygmomanometer from the right arm with the subject sitting, and the lower reading of the two measurements taken at least 1 min apart was recorded. A blood sample was drawn and serum stored at -70\u00b0C. Serum glucose was determined with the enzymatic hexokinase method using an Optima analyzer (ThermoFischer, Vantaa, Finland). Serum total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations were determined enzymatically [29, 30] .\nThe participants made a follow-up visit three times annually, and weight was measured once a year."}, {"section_title": "Statistics", "text": "Person years were calculated from the date of the fourth annual weight measurement to the date of diabetes occurrence, death, or the end of the follow-up period (December 1997), whichever came first. The average trend in weight change was assessed through the slope of the regression line fitted to four weight measurements taken 1 year apart. 1.33 kg/year corresponded to an average weight change of 4 kg over 3 years. This was similar to a 2-year net weight reduction of 2.7 kg, which associated with a 58% reduction in diabetes risk in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study [31] .\nTo examine the association of risk for diabetes with weight fluctuation, we calculated the root mean square error (RMSE) using annual weight deviations from the corresponding estimated regression line [18, 32, 33] . This variable was divided into quintiles. Weight fluctuation and weight change were also considered as combined variable, in which case the weight fluctuation was categorized into two classes: Q1-Q4 for minor fluctuation and Q5 for large fluctuation.\nThe association between weight indicators (short-term weight change and weight fluctuation) and the incidence of type 2 diabetes was estimated with the Cox proportional hazards regression as relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The basic model was adjusted for age and supplementation group. The model was further adjusted for BMI, years of smoking, number of cigarettes smoked daily, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum total and HDL cholesterol, alcohol consumption and leisure time physical activity (sedentary and moderate-heavy).\nStratified analysis was performed in order to assess the possible effect modifications, and the significance of interactions was tested using the likelihood ratio test.\nDifferences between the groups were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Analyses were carried out with the R statistical program [34] . All P values were two-sided."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "At baseline, men who gained on average at least 4 kg of weight during the subsequent 3 years, were slightly younger and had a lower serum total cholesterol concentration than did those whose weight was stable or who lost at least 4 kg of weight (Table 1) . Men whose weight fluctuated the most during the subsequent 3 years (fifth quintile) were younger and less physically active during leisure time, had a higher BMI, but lower serum total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels than did men of the four lowest quintiles.\nThe multivariate-adjusted risk for diabetes was higher in men who gained at least 4 kg during 3 years than in those whose weight was stable (RR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.44-2.17) (Fig. 2) . When compared to those with stable weight, weight loss of at least 4 kg was not associated with the risk for diabetes (RR = 1.17, 95% CI 0.90-1.53). Neither BMI, number of cigarettes, years of smoking, alcohol consumption nor physical activity modified the association between short-term weight change and the risk for diabetes. Age, however, did modify the risk for diabetes (P = 0.0067 for weight gain and P = 0.0036 for weight loss). Among those 60 and older at baseline, weight gain as well as weight loss were associated with higher risk for diabetes than among those of stable weight (RR = 3.42, 95% CI 1.70-6.88, and 2.07, 95% CI 1.08-3.99, respectively), whereas among those younger than 60, no association was observed (RR = 1.25, 95% CI 0.90-1.73 and RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-1.01, respectively). The risk for diabetes in the four lowest quintiles of weight fluctuation was similar, whereas in the highest quintile the risk was higher than in the lowest quintile (RR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.24-2.17) (Fig. 2) . Neither age, BMI, nor number of cigarettes significantly modified the association between short-term weight fluctuation and the risk for diabetes. Leisure time physical activity did modify the risk of diabetes with weight fluctuation (P = 0.02); among those of light leisure time physical activity, large weight fluctuation was associated with increased risk for diabetes (RR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.28-2.98 for the highest vs. lowest quintile), whereas among those with moderate or heavy leisure time physical activity we found no such association (RR = 1.38, 95% CI 0.95-2.00). In addition, years of smoking modified the risk for diabetes (P = 0.04); among those who had smoked less than 36 years, large weight fluctuation increased the risk for diabetes (RR = 1.91, 95% CI 1.27-2.88), whereas among those who had smoked at least 36 years, the association was weaker (RR = 1.43, 95% CI 0.98-2.09). Finally, the association of weight fluctuation to diabetes risk was stronger in men who consumed on average 11 g or more of alcohol daily (RR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.36-3.45) than in men consuming less alcohol (RR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.10-2.28; P = 0.0001).\nBoth short-term average weight change (slope) and weight fluctuation remained independent risk factors for diabetes when simultaneously adjusted for in the multivariate model: RR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.37-2.07, for a weight increase of at least 4 kg compared with stable weight, and RR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.17-2.06, for the highest vs. lowest weight fluctuation quintile, respectively. Weight gain of at least 4 kg in 3 years, either steady or fluctuating, increased significantly the risk of diabetes about twofold compared with those whose weight changed less than 4 kg and fluctuated only moderately (Table 2) . Among men whose weight changed less than 4 kg, large weight fluctuation increased the risk of diabetes 1.47-fold, 95% CI 1.14-1.91. Steady loss of weight of at least 4 kg was associated nonsignificantly with decreased risk of diabetes, RR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.47-1.15. However, if weight loss was associated with large weight fluctuation, the risk of diabetes was twofold compared with those of stable weight and moderate fluctuation, RR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.47-2.83 ( Table 2) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Short-term weight gain and fluctuation associated with a higher risk for diabetes. The observation is in line with those of other epidemiological studies [10, 15] . In the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, weight gain during the preceding 10 years was associated with a 1.9 times higher risk for diabetes (95% CI 1.4-2.7) among those who gained 9 kg or more of weight than among those with a stable weight (\u00b12 kg) [15] . A parallel observation resulted in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study, where participants who gained weight at least 5 kg during 9 years had up to 3.85 times the risk for diabetes compared with participants whose weights remained relatively stable [10] .\nAn average weight loss of 4 kg in 3 years was not associated with a lower risk for incident diabetes. This differs from the findings of several prospective cohort and intervention studies where even modest weight loss was associated with a significantly reduced risk for diabetes [12, 31, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . In the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study a net loss of 3.5 \u00b1 5.5 kg by the end of the second year decreased risk of diabetes for 58% [31] . In the Nurse's Health Study women who lost more than 5.0 kg reduced their risk for diabetes at least 50% compared to those who maintained a steady weight [12] . In the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study, a 5 kg weight loss accounted for a 55% reduction in risk of incident diabetes over the mean of 3.2 years of follow-up [38] . Participants with intentional weight loss in the Cancer Prevention Study had a reduction of incident diabetes of about 25% compared with participants with no-intentional weight loss [39] . The unintentional weight loss may be an effect of diabetes per se, not a cause of diabetes.\nWe found that age did modify significantly the association between weight loss and risk of diabetes. Among men 60 years or older weight loss is associated with increased risk, whereas among men younger than 60 years no such an Adjusted for age, intervention (alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, both, and placebo), body mass index, smoking, blood pressure, serum total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, alcohol consumption and leisure time physical activity. The root mean square error (RMSE) is calculated using annual weight deviations from the corresponding estimated regression line and this variable is divided into quintiles (Q). Q1: -0.54, Q2: 0.55-0.84, Q3: 0.85-1.17, Q4: 1.18-1.67, Q5: 1.68 association was evident. In the Iowa Women's Health Study of women aged 55-69 years and in a Swedish study of middle-aged women, weight loss associated with increased risk of diabetes, but effect modification by age was not studied in these materials [18, 19] .\nThe association of weight loss in our study was, however, different depending on whether the weight decreased smoothly or fluctuating. If the weight diminished smoothly, the risk of diabetes was decreased, though not significantly (RR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.47-1.15), which is in line with other studies. The small number of men with smooth weight loss may be the reason why the decrease in risk remained non-significant. If the weight loss was associated with large weight fluctuation, it was associated with increased risk of diabetes.\nOur results support the hypothesis that weight fluctuation is associated with higher risk for diabetes. In the Iowa Women's Health Study, weight cycling (an increase of C10% of body weight during a 10-year period and a loss of C10% of weight during another 10-year period, regardless of order) increased significantly the risk for diabetes (RR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.25-2.29) [18] . A similarly increased risk was found in an adult community where the adjusted rate ratio for diabetes risk was 1.7 (P \\ 0.01) for the weight fluctuation (both weight gain and losses of 4.5 kg between ages 40 and 60 vs. all others) [16] . In an other cohort study among women, an index of weight fluctuation based on weights in different phases of life associated with diabetes with standardized odds ratio of 1.10 (95% CI 1.07-1.14) [24] . Supportive evidence comes from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, where body weight variability associated with a decrease in glucose tolerance [32] .\nSome studies, however, have found no association between weight fluctuation and the risk for diabetes. In a 6-year follow-up of the Nurses' Health Study II, neither mild nor severe weight cycling predicted diabetes [23] . In a prospective study among Pima Indians in Arizona, weight fluctuation was not associated with the incidence of diabetes in either sex [25] . In the Johns Hopkins Precursors Study the variability in BMI before age 50 predicted incident diabetes only marginally [26] .\nLeisure time physical activity modified the association between weight fluctuation and risk of diabetes. Large weight fluctuation increased the risk of diabetes twofold if only light exercise were taken during leisure time whereas no association was found if exercise was moderate or heavy. This is in keeping with the knowledge that physical activity can prevent diabetes. Regular exercise induces various adaptations in the body resulting in improved muscle and whole body insulin sensitivity, fuel partitioning and cardiovascular function leading to prevention of metabolic disease [40, 41] .\nThe strengths of our study include the prospective study design, with up to 9-year follow-up for incident diabetes, and data available for several possible risk factors. Weight and height were measured by trained staff at study centres, not self-reported. The cases were retrieved from a nationwide register with strict criteria for inclusion. The trial supplementation had no effect on the incidence of diabetes [42] .\nSome limitations should be kept in mind, however, when interpreting these results. We were able to identify only patients receiving medication for treatment of diabetes, not individuals treating their disease with dietary changes. This will attenuate our estimate between weight indicators and risk of diabetes towards unity. The drug reimbursement register for diabetes contains no data on the type of diabetes. However, almost all of our diabetes cases would be of type 2 diabetes based on the age of the participants at baseline: 50-69 years [43] . Some [44, 45] but not all studies [46] suggest that smoking cessation may associate with lower risk of diabetes. About 21% of the ATBC participants stopped smoking during the trial [28] . But we do not have smoking data from drop-outs and posttrial follow-up. Thus the possible effects of smoking cessation on our results remain unclear.\nFor short-term weight change, we had only four weight measurements at intervals of 1 year and were thus unable to detect weight variations occurring over a shorter period of time. No information on intentionality of weight changes was recorded. In addition, RMSE may have misclassified participants with continuous non-linear weight gain without real weight fluctuation [47] . The ATBC Study was designed to test whether alphatocopherol or beta-carotene could reduce the incidence of lung or other cancers in male smokers, thus our results may not be generalizable to women or non-smokers.\nGlobally, over one billion adults are overweight, of whom at least 300 million are obese [48] . If epidemic obesity increases worldwide, the disease burden of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases will be enormous. Our results confirm that even a short-term weight gain is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. They also contribute to previous work by demonstrating a significant association between weight fluctuation and higher risk for diabetes. The association between weight fluctuation and risk for diabetes may raise concerns about health-promoting weight-control programs that could result in such cycling. A key target could then be to maintain not only a normal, but a stable body weight in order to optimally lower the risk for diabetes."}]
