However, the association between AAI and the long-term cognitive outcome of TBI is debatable. On one hand, the AAI was not associated with the cognitive outcome measured within the first year after TBI for children who sustained TBI before 6 years of age [2] . The AAI was also not an effective predictor for the long-term cognitive outcome in patients with a history of severe TBI when they were evaluated at an average of 14 years after TBI [3] . On the other hand, pediatric TBI patients with a younger AAI (,8 years old) were associated with a worse cognitive outcome when they were tested at least 6 years after TBI [4] . Moreover, a younger AAI was reported to be associated with a better long-term cognitive outcome of TBI in a study with a follow-up duration of 30 years [1] . Although the AAI has been studied with regard to its effects on cognitive performance in young patients with TBI [4] [5] [6] [7] , no study has been done to compare the long-term cognitive outcome between patients sustained with childhood TBI (cTBI) and adult TBI (aTBI). In this report, the AAI was investigated for its relationship with the long-term cognitive outcome of TBI by analyzing the cognitive performance of elderly participants enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

For multiple traumatic brain injuries with the same severity (mild vs. moderate or severe), the date for the first injury was used to determine the AAI. When one TBI was more severe than the other ones, the date for the most severe TBI was used to derive the AAI.

The ECog ratings cover multiple cognitive domains, including language, memory, visual spatial ability, and executive function, including planning, organization, and divided attention. The BNT is a language function test sensitive to both aphasia and object recognition deficit with a maximum score of 30 points.

The participants with a TBI history were divided into cTBI and aTBI groups based on the sustaining age of TBI. The cognitive performance on ECog ratings, BNT and RAVLT, was compared between the two groups of participants.\nThe mean lag time was more than 39 years in the present study. This is the longest follow-up duration for studying the long-term cognitive outcome of TBI in the literature. The bimodal distribution of AAI was expected because the youngest and the oldest members of a population are always at the greatest risk for sustaining TBI [17] .\nThe cTBI group has higher ECog scores than the aTBI group in all domains, although the difference in the memory domain does not reach significance (Table 1) . In general, a higher ECog item assessment score represents more subjective complaints. However, the ECog rating differences seen "}, {"section_title": "A B", "text": "BNT Assessment Score in this report are probably not clinically significant due to the small differences between the aTBI and cTBI groups. The absolute ECog rating values are below 2 for both cTBI and aTBI groups (2 5 occasionally performs the task worse but not all of the time), suggesting minimal subjective complaints in these groups. However, the cTBI group has a significantly better performance on both the BNT and RAVLT recognition scores than the aTBI group. The results suggest that immature brains are more resilient for maintaining the episodic memory/recognition and language functions than mature brains. The findings are consistent with those from a previous report that adult TBI patients with a relatively younger AAI (55-64 years old) were suggested to be more resilient to dementia development than those with an older AAI (65-74 years old) [18] . However, the convergence of subjective ratings (more complaints in cTBI) and objective performance (better performance in cTBI) is interesting and should be further investigated.\nThis study has several limitations. Preinjury social economic status (SES) has been shown to be associated with the long-term cognitive outcome of TBI [3] . Preinjury ability was also identified as a significant predictor of postinjury cognitive status in those patients with cTBI [19, 20] . However, neither preinjury SES nor preinjury ability was controlled as potential confounding factors in the present study due to unavailability of information. In addition, the history of TBI was based on self-report information from either participants or informants, which may bring some inaccuracy. Although injury severity has been reported to be associated with the long-term cognitive outcome of TBI [3, [21] [22] [23] , the role of TBI severity was not investigated in this study because of the self-reported medical history. Finally, participants with a history of TBI were divided into the cTBI and aTBI groups using an arbitrary age of 21 years old. Because a significantly higher rate of cognitive dysfunction is only seen in patients with TBI sustaining after age 11 years than in the general population [24] , it might be more reasonable to group patients by brain maturation phases in future studies [25] .\nIn summary, the findings from this study showed that age at injury is associated with the long-term cognitive outcome of individuals with a history of TBI. People with TBI occurring before age 22 years had better cognitive performance in language and episodic memory/recognition than those with aTBI, despite an increased level of self-perceived cognitive decline in all cognitive domains on the ECog assessments.

Systematic review: The association of age at injury (AAI) with the long-term cognitive outcome of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) is debatable. The authors reviewed the effects of AAI of TBI on the longterm cognitive outcomes using PubMed as the main literature source. The relevant citations are appropriately cited.\n2. Interpretation: AAI was demonstrated to be associated with the long-term cognitive outcome of individuals with a history of TBI. People with childhood TBI showed better cognitive performance in language and episodic memory/recognition than those with adult TBI.\n3. Future directions: Studies with large samples and a prospective design are needed to replicate the current findings. The present study can be deepened by investigating the role of the following factors: (1) TBI severity; (2) preinjury economic status and ability; (3) a logical classification of TBI based on the brain maturation process."}]
