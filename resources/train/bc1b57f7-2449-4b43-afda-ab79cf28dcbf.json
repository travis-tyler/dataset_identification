[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: Genetic data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) have been crucial in advancing the understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. Here, we provide an update on sample collection, scientific progress and opportunities, conceptual issues, and future plans. Methods: Lymphoblastoid cell lines and DNA and RNA samples from blood have been collected and banked, and data and biosamples have been widely disseminated. To date, APOE genotyping, genome-wide association study (GWAS), and whole exome and whole genome sequencing data have been obtained and disseminated.\n1 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni. loni.usc.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data, but many of them did not participate in analysis or writing of this report. A complete listing of ADNI investigators can be found at: http://adni.loni.usc.edu/wpcontent/uploads/how_to_apply/ADNI_Acknowledgement_List.pdf. *Corresponding author. Results: ADNI genetic data have been downloaded thousands of times, and .300 publications have resulted, including reports of large-scale GWAS by consortia to which ADNI contributed. Many of the first applications of quantitative endophenotype association studies used ADNI data, including some of the earliest GWAS and pathway-based studies of biospecimen and imaging biomarkers, as well as memory and other clinical/cognitive variables. Other contributions include some of the first whole exome and whole genome sequencing data sets and reports in healthy controls, mild cognitive impairment, and AD. Discussion: Numerous genetic susceptibility and protective markers for AD and disease biomarkers have been identified and replicated using ADNI data and have heavily implicated immune, mitochondrial, cell cycle/fate, and other biological processes. Early sequencing studies suggest that rare and structural variants are likely to account for significant additional phenotypic variation. Longitudinal analyses of transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenomic changes will also further elucidate dynamic processes underlying preclinical and prodromal stages of disease. Integration of this unique collection of multiomics data within a systems biology framework will help to separate truly informative markers of early disease mechanisms and potential novel therapeutic targets from the vast background of less relevant biological processes. Fortunately, a broad swath of the scientific community has accepted this grand challenge."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was initiated in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations as a public-private partnership. The first phase (ADNI-1) launched a cohort study of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal (CN) older adult controls. A second, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 sponsored, \"Grand Opportunity\" phase (ADNI-GO) followed, and introduced the concept of early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI). ADNI is now completing its third phase (ADNI-2), which also assesses individuals with early or late MCI (LMCI), mild AD, cognitively normal controls, and a new group of older adults with significant memory concerns (SMCs) but whose psychometric performance is within normal limits [1] , consistent with the recent consensus concept of subjective cognitive decline [2] . Detailed information on ADNI is found on the study Web site (http://www.adni-info.org/). The primary goal of ADNI has been to establish the optimal panel of clinical assessments, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging measures, as well as other biomarkers from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), to inform clinical trial design for AD therapeutic development. At the same time, ADNI has been highly productive in generating a wealth of data useful for elucidating disease mechanisms occurring during early stages of preclinical and prodromal AD. For a comprehensive summary of ADNI results, see the article by Weiner et al. [3] and the other articles in this special issue.\nGenetics has played an increasingly important role in AD research over the past few decades, starting with the discoveries of rare mutations in APP (amyloid precursor protein), PSEN1 (presenilin-1), and PSEN2 (presenilin-2) that cause early-onset autosomal dominant forms of the disease (see the study by Bateman et al. [4] for review) and continuing with the association of the common APOE (apolipoprotein E) \u03b54 allele with sporadic or late-onset AD (LOAD). Until recently, only APOE on chromosome 19 had been robustly replicated as a LOAD susceptibility gene. With the advent of large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted by multistudy consortia, a current \"top 20\" or more list of replicated genes has emerged, which are now undergoing further investigation to identify the biological basis of their risk or protective roles in LOAD [5] . In ADNI, APOE genotype was determined and DNA and cell lines were banked from the beginning of the study. Genomewide genotyping was also completed, enabling ADNI data to be included in several large and important GWAS studies. Notably, most of these large well-powered meta-analytic GWAS studies are restricted to binary categorical phenotypes, such as clinical diagnosis, and usually only include AD cases and controls.\nA relatively unique aspect of ADNI is the systematic longitudinal collection of biomarker data that can serve as quantitative endophenotypes for genetic association studies. In fact, using quantitative endophenotypes as target measures has been found to improve power relative to case-control techniques, as well as to avoid using arbitrary or potentially error-prone cutoffs to define case status [6, 7] . Recognizing the value of these quantitative trait loci (QTL) investigations in AD, the ADNI Genetics Core was established at the beginning of the GO phase [8] with the goals of: (1) blood sample processing, genotyping, and dissemination; (2) genome-wide analysis of multidimensional phenotypic data collected on the ADNI cohort; and (3) serving as a central resource, point of contact, and planning group for genetic studies in ADNI. The first GWAS of an ADNI quantitative phenotype was published in 2009 [9] , and progress has been rapid as groups worldwide analyzed the publicly available ADNI genetic data. Shen et al. [10] provided a detailed review of results from ADNI genetic studies through 2012. Here, we provide an updated review of these results through 2014, summarize the evolving set of ADNI genetic data, and discuss future directions to maximally leverage these data that we hope will be incorporated in the proposed next phase of ADNI.\nThe main goal of this update was to describe the genetic data and highlight results generated to date as part of the ADNI study. First, we describe the samples, methods, and basic analysis of the different types of genetic data available in ADNI, including APOE, TOMM40 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog) poly-T repeat, GWAS, whole exome sequences, whole genome sequences, and microarray-based RNA gene expression profiles. This documentation of techniques which have evolved over time should assist the many users of ADNI genetic data to better understand the processing pipelines. Second, we discuss how and the extent to which the various ADNI genetic data sets have been used so far. Third, we highlight novel and important findings generated by relating quantitative phenotypes to the ADNI genetic data. Fourth, we discuss the findings from the ADNI data in the context of a systems biology framework. Fifth, we describe how ADNI genetic findings could inform drug development, as well as clinical trial design and execution. This is followed by a discussion of the potential for understanding disease biology using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Sixth, we describe how ADNI and other genetic data relate to ethical, legal, and social implications of genetic testing, for example, in returning genetic results on disease risk. Finally, we discuss future directions proposed by the Genetics Core that we hope will be investigated in the proposed next phase of the ADNI study."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample storage and processing", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample storage summary", "text": "Blood samples are collected at each visit for all participants (i.e., CN, SMC, EMCI, LMCI, and AD) according to ADNI protocol for the particular study phase (http://www. adni-info.org/Scientists/ADNIStudyProcedures.aspx).

APOE genotyping APOE genotyping was done using DNA from blood samples from 818 ADNI-1, 128 ADNI-GO, and 778 ADNI-2 participants. For ADNI-1, APOE genotyping was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, Hhal restriction enzyme digestion, and subsequent standard gel resolution and visualization processes [11, 12] . For ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 DNA samples, genotyping was performed by Prevention Genetics (Marshfield, WI, USA) and LGC Genomics (Beverly, MA, USA). Prevention Genetics used array processing using allele-specific PCR with universal molecular beacons [13, 14] . At LGC, assays were performed using competitive allele-specific PCR, enabling biallelic scoring of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Assay kits were added to DNA samples, followed by thermal cycling reaction and an end-point fluorescent read. Genotypes were called using LGC Genomics' in-house Kraken software (http://www.lgcgroup.com/ products/genotyping-software/kraken/) and were returned to the ADNI Genetics Core after manual quality control (QC). All APOE genotype data underwent further QC checks, including sex and identity checks, and potential problems were identified and corrected through communication with NCRAD and other cores.

Detailed genotyping protocols were described previously [8] . All assays were performed according to manufacturer protocols. Bead intensity data were used to call genotypes using BeadStudio 3.2 (Illumina) for the first release of ADNI-1 data, GenomeStudio v2009.1 (Illumina) for the second release of ADNI-1 data, and GenomeStudio v2011.1 (Illumina) for ADNI-GO/2. All genotype data were quality controlled, including checks for sex and identity, and the quality-controlled data were released on the ADNI LONI Web site (http://adni.loni.usc.edu) in Final Report and/or PLINK data formats. Of note, samples from the 818 individuals in the whole genome sequencing (WGS) substudy described below (Section 2.2.5) underwent genome-wide genotyping using the Illumina Omni2.5M BeadChip performed by Illumina.

Participants were selected for a small extremetrait design. Specifically, nine age-and education-matched pairs of non-Hispanic Caucasian, male, right-handed participants with amnestic MCI were selected on the basis of rapid versus slow hippocampal volume change on MRI over 2 years (nine participants with rapid rates of atrophy and nine with slow rates of atrophy) [16, 17] . All participants had APOE \u03b53/\u03b53 genotype, as one goal of this small study was to identify coding variants other than the APOE \u03b54 allele that are associated with the rate of hippocampal volume loss.

The Agilent kit captured an exome that was approximately 50 Mb in size, covering w21,000 genes. These samples could then be sequenced together on one lane of the flow cell and segregated later for analysis using their molecular bar codes as tags. Samples were sequenced across multiple flow cell lanes to account for any possible lane effects. These libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2000 using paired-end read chemistry and read lengths of 105 bp.

This research sequencing was performed in a non-CLIA (see Section 4.4) laboratory at Illumina. Eight hundred ten of the ADNI WGS data sets were released in August 2013. Samples were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2000 using pairedend read chemistry and read length of 100 bp at 30-40! coverage. The resulting BAM and VCF files generated by Illumina using the CASAVA software were archived at three physical locations, including LONI at the University of Southern California, Indiana University, and the Broad Institute. QC steps included participant sex check, participant identity check, and variant quality check of the Illuminagenerated VCF files. The participant sex check was conducted by comparing sex estimated using Illumina Omni2.5M GWAS data and self-reported sex information from the ADNI database. Participant identity was cross-checked by determining: (1) concordance of a subset of fingerprint SNPs between prior genotype data and Omni2.5M genotype data; and (2) concordance of all quality-controlled SNPs between Omni2.5M genotype data and WGS VCF data. The quality of variants passing sequencing QC in the WGS VCF files was assessed by comparing with Omni2.5M genotype data. Because Illumina's CASAVA software calls variants on a single sample only, the Broad Institute converted the BAM files into original FASTQ files, a text-based format for storing both sequence reads and their corresponding quality information in Phred format, and realigned and recalled the variants using Broad GATK. Briefly, short-read sequences were mapped to the reference human genome using BWA-mem, and potential PCR duplicates were removed. After completing initial alignment, the alignment was further refined by locally realigning any suspicious reads. The reported base calling quality scores obtained from the sequencer were recalibrated to account for covariates of base errors such as sequencing technology and machine cycle. Finally, the realigned reads were written to a BAM file for further analysis. The analysis-ready BAM files were assessed to identify all variants with statistical evidence for an alternate allele present among samples using GATK HaplotypeCaller for multisample variant callings. Variants that passed recommended variation quality criteria were assessed by comparing with the Illumina Omni2.5M genotyping data to estimate the concordance rate for each individual.

The Affymetrix Human Genome U219 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used for expression profiling. Peripheral blood samples were collected using PAXgene tubes for RNA analysis. Total RNA was extracted using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit, following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The quantity and quality of extracted RNA were assessed using the NanoDrop and the Agilent Bioanalyzer, respectively. Blood RNA samples from 64 participants did not pass QC and were excluded. Samples were randomized to plates, with checks to ensure sex and diagnosis balance, and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U219 array plate. Array hybridization, washing, staining, and scanning were carried out in an Affymetrix GeneTitan system. The quality of gene expression data, including sample quality and hybridization and overall signal quality, was analyzed using Affymetrix Expression Console software and Partek Genomic Suite 6.6, according to standard QC criteria provided by each software package.

[49] performed the first connectome-wide and genome-wide association study and identified an association between a variant in SPON1 (spondin 1; rs2618516) and brain anatomic fiber connectivity. Warstadt et al. [50] fitted a multilocus genetic model within white matter areas associated with serum cholesterol and identified that CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein, plasma; increased rs5882 G-allele dosage) was associated with higher fractional anisotropy and lower radial and mean diffusivity on DTI. Several publications also proposed new methods to boost the power to detect genetic associations with diffusion imaging measures in ADNI, by using bivariate genetic analysis of MRI and DTI and an approach called \"seemingly unrelated regression\" which integrates genetic information from different imaging biomarkers [51] [52] [53] [65] , predict cognitive decline [66] , or predict MCI to AD conversion [67] ."}, {"section_title": "Fluid biomarkers (CSF and plasma)", "text": "Fluid biomarkers are another frequently analyzed category of quantitative phenotypes used in ADNI genetic studies. Kim et al. [28] examined the influence of genetic variation on plasma protein levels using the multianalyte Rules Based Medicine (RBM) panel and identified multiple novel associations. For example, the CFHR1 (complement factor H-related 1; rs7517126) and CFH (complement factor H; rs6677604) genes were discovered to be very highly associated with plasma complement factor H-related protein 1 (CFHR1) level. This study also confirmed previously identified gene-protein associations for the interleukin-6 receptor, chemokine C-C motif (CC) ligand 4, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and angiotensinogen. Cruchaga et al. [68] performed a GWAS of CSF tau/pTau 181 levels and identified three loci: one between GEMC1 (geminin coiled-coil domain containing; also known as GMNC) and OSTN (osteocrin), one within GLIS3 (GLIS family zinc finger 3), and one within the TREM gene cluster. Chouraki et al. [69] performed a genome-wide meta-analysis of plasma Ab peptide levels and found a significant association between the CTXN3 (cortexin 3) gene and plasma Ab 1-42 levels. Kauwe et al. [70] performed a GWAS of CSF levels of 59 AD candidate proteins and identified genetic associations with CSF levels of five proteins, including ACE, chemokine CC ligand 2, chemokine CC ligand 4, interleukin-6 receptor, and matrix metalloproteinase-3. As mentioned earlier, Hohman et al. performed two ADNI studies [38, 39] to examine genetic modification of relationship between CSF biomarkers and MRI-based neurodegeneration and identified rs4728029 from the POT1 gene that modifies the relationship between pTau 181 and ventricular dilation [38] and several SNPs that modify the relationships between amyloid or tau positivity and neurodegeneration [39] . Ramirez et al. [71] performed a GWAS of CSF Ab 1-42 and pTau 181 levels and found an association between Ab 1-42 level and rs62256378 in SUCLG2 (succinate-CoA ligase, GDPforming, b subunit), as well as an interaction between APOE \u03b54 genotype and this SNP. In the aforementioned study by Risacher et al. [1] , individuals with SMC who were APOE \u03b54 carriers showed lower Ab 1-42 and higher tau and pTau 181 levels than SMC APOE \u03b54 noncarriers. A recent cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis [72] of the relationship between CSF and PET amyloid biomarkers by Toledo et al. [72] found that APOE modified the relationship between these AD biomarkers and suggested that they measure different aspects of Ab pathology in AD. Finally, as mentioned previously, Apostolova et al. [48] found that pTau 181 was the best predictor for MCI to AD conversion in APOE \u03b54-negative participants, whereas hippocampal volume was the best predictor in APOE \u03b54-positive MCI participants."}, {"section_title": "Cognitive performance", "text": "Studies including ADNI data have established that the effect of APOE on cognitive performance is more complex than a simple extension of its association with AD risk [60, [73] [74] [75] [76] . For example, one study demonstrated an interactive effect of APOE and amyloid pathology on cognitive decline, characterized by APOE \u03b54 carriers with high amyloid burden exhibiting greater cognitive decline [76] . This finding was consistent with an earlier analysis in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging that suggested that APOE isoforms modify the association between amyloid load and cognition [77] .\nOther genetic analyses of cognition have expanded the scope beyond APOE to study other known AD risk loci [74, 78] and to discover novel associations. Sherva et al. [79] reported that the SPON1 gene was associated with longitudinal global cognitive decline. This SPON1 finding is notable in view of the aforementioned report of an association of SPON1 with cerebral connectivity in both ADNI and a young twin cohort [49] . Ramanan et al. identified an association between the proapoptotic gene FASTKD2 (fasassociated serine/threonine kinase domains 2) and crosssectional episodic memory performance [80, 81] . The memory GWAS by Ramanan et al. [80, 81] is noteworthy for its large sample consisting of data from the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS), ADNI, AddNeuroMed, the Religious Order Study, the Rush Memory and Aging Project, and the IMAS yielding a total discovery and replication sample of 14,781 individuals. The novel SNP discovered in this study exhibited a protective effect on memory performance and hippocampal structure (volume and gray matter density on structural MRI) and was associated with decreased CSF levels of apoptotic mediators, consistent with a neuroprotective effect of this gene variant. In related work, the ADNI data set contributed to the large-scale genome-wide screens of brain measures conducted by the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium [82] . In one analysis of GWAS data and MRI measures from .50 cohorts worldwide, the ENIGMA consortium, in partnership with ADNI, discovered eight common genetic variants associated with the volume of subcortical brain structures, including the hippocampus; several of the implicated genes are associated in aggregate with disease risk and have known roles in cell guidance, apoptosis, and other physiological processes.\nOther studies have related genes to cognition after the discovery of a primary association with a noncognitive phenotype, including ASTND2 (astrotactin 2) and GRIN2B (glutamate receptor, ionotropic, N-methyl D-aspartate 2B) with hippocampal and temporal lobe atrophy on MRI [83, 84] , PSEN1 (presenilin-1) with CSF amyloid levels [85] , and DAT1 with AD case-control status [40] . Alternatively, pathway analysis has been used to elucidate collective effects of multiple genes on memory [86] , executive functioning [87] , and depressive symptoms [88] . Notably, pathway analysis of memory in the ADNI-1 sample (N 5 742) [86] displayed substantial overlap of underlying mechanisms (particularly of pathways related to cholinergic neurotransmission, cell adhesion, and inflammation) with a subsequent pathway analysis of memory in the populationbased HRS sample (N 5 6705) [80] , highlighting the potential utility of pathway-based approaches [34, 89] to yield replicable associations from otherwise diverse studies.\nOverall, these findings provide a foundation for meeting the broader ADNI aim of enhancing clinical trial design and interpretation. Cognitive phenotypes are thought to have substantial heritability (up to 80%) based on twin studies, but a substantial portion of this heritability is still uncharacterized, and known genes appear to exhibit modest individual effect sizes [90] [91] [92] . Although APOE has shown the most consistent relationship with cognition in AD and non-AD settings, its effects depend on interactions with other factors such as age [73, 93, 94] and biomarker status [60, 75] , so accounting for these interactions might facilitate risk enrichment and stratification in clinical trials [95] . The use of genetic profiling for risk stratification to enhance clinical trial design is discussed in greater detail in Section 4.2. Other heavily investigated genes, such as BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) [96] [97] [98] and KIBRA (WWC1; WW and C2 domain containing 1) [99] [100] [101] [102] , have displayed inconsistent relationships with cognitive outcomes, potentially due to the complexity of the cognitive \"phenome\" where individual cognitive domains may have distinct genetic and molecular architectures. Furthermore, cognitive tasks vary in their domain specificity and domain overlap [90, 91] . Integrative analytic methods, as discussed in Section 4.1, may be useful for untangling this complex phenotypic architecture [103] . In addition, low-frequency, rare, and copy number variants may now be readily analyzed using the recently available ADNI WGS data allowing assessment of contributions of these features in cognitive performance."}, {"section_title": "Multidimensional data mining", "text": "Besides examining genetic effects of different ADNI phenotypes, some studies have integrated ADNI genetic data with multidimensional phenotypic data sets to jointly predict outcomes of interest. For example, Trzepacz et al. [ [65] , predict cognitive decline [66] , or predict MCI to AD conversion [67] ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Overall, the many reports evaluating ADNI genetic data using multidimensional phenotypes from rich ADNI data sets confirmed key findings in the genetics of AD and also identified novel candidate genes that deserve further investigation and replication in independent cohorts. In the following sections, we discuss several key themes related to the significance and implications of genetic studies using ADNI data and plans for the ADNI Genetics Core going forward."}, {"section_title": "Toward a systems biology of AD: integrating multiomics data at the pathway and network level", "text": "LOAD is thought to have a complex etiology, with multiple genetic and environmental factors presumed to influence susceptibility [106] . This complex model of susceptibility can pose conceptual challenges to the \"one-gene/oneenzyme/one-function\" paradigm that has been used to characterize disorders with more simple genetic architectures [107, 108] . In response to such challenges, systems biology approaches have been developed that attempt to model complex and interactive multilevel biological systems using a range of advanced computational and experimental tools. These approaches are based on the hypothesis that complex genetic architectures can only be appropriately characterized through analytic strategies designed to capture this complexity [109] [110] [111] . In practice, these approaches rely on two fundamental premises, namely that (1) genes and their variants are not isolated inciting entities but rather exist within broader functional pathways and networks [89] and that (2) diseases and their endophenotypes are not isolated end points but rather are collections of perturbations at multiple biological levels, including the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome [103, 112] . Fig. 3 illustrates the landscape of multiple \"-omics\" domains relevant to AD. It is striking that ADNI has collected data spanning a broad range of these domains (indicated by asterisks in the figure).\nOne systems biology approach that has been applied to AD starts with an initial discovery of a gene in one \"-omics\" realm and progresses to test the effect of this gene in complementary biological systems. This strategy can be particularly effective in characterizing the downstream consequences of a genetic variant to fill in knowledge gaps native to most genotype-phenotype associations. There are emerging proof-of-concept examples of this approach that have used ADNI data, and it seems likely that this approach could be productively extended to other AD-related genes. One integrative functional genomics report followed up on the immune system gene CD33, which was previously implicated in AD through GWAS [113, 114] , by demonstrating SNP-associated changes in CD33 expression (protein), phagocytic performance of CD33-expressing monocytes (cellular function), and amyloid accumulation measured by PET imaging (brain pathology) [55] . It is notable that CD33 is expressed selectively in microglia in AD brain tissue [115] , is a modulator of microglial activation, and also constitutes a druggable target that has been investigated in acute myeloid leukemia and very recently in AD [116] . Another example, discussed in Section 3.3.7, used GWAS to discover a novel association of the proapoptotic gene FASTKD2 with better episodic memory performance and subsequently related the memory-associated SNP to lower FASTKD2 mRNA expression (transcript), lower CSF levels of fas-mediated apoptotic factors (protein), and higher hippocampal volume and gray matter density (brain structure) [80] . Like CD33, FASTKD2 also shows promise as a druggable target based on earlier work in oncology [81] . Future extensions of this systems biology strategy might additionally leverage the ADNI WGS data, as AD-associated genes are likely to contain rare variants with functional implications in addition to the common variants detected by GWAS [117] .\nAlternatively, systems biology approaches can start with larger gene sets (pathways or networks) identified through \"-omics\" analysis and subsequently use the known biological relationships within those groups to converge on one or more gene targets. Two recent examples of this approach, including one using ADNI data [118] , identified novel regulatory gene targets through network analysis of postmortem brain tissue transcriptome data. In one report, a network enriched with immune system and microgliarelated genes that is upregulated in postmortem AD brain tissue was found to contain TYROBP (TYRO tyrosine kinase-binding protein) as a common regulator of many of the genes in the network [119] . Another report identified networks with perturbed gene expression in AD and APOE \u03b54 carriers and discovered RNF219 (ring finger protein 219) as a key mediator of these transcriptomic changes [118] . Variants in RNF219 were additionally found to be related to increased amyloid deposition by in vivo PET imaging [118] . Overall, the network strategy is particularly attractive for its ability to highlight broad ensembles of genes serving as effectors that drive key disease mechanisms and, thus, may hold strong potential for identification of promising therapeutic targets [120] .\nWith rich phenotype and genotype data now available for participants spanning the continuum from normal aging to clinical AD, the next phase of ADNI described below (Section 4.5) will provide an ideal setting for systems biology approaches to elucidate missing pieces in the understanding of AD pathophysiology and to potentially expand the scope of AD diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. From a risk prediction standpoint, networks exhibiting coexistent genetic variation and biological perturbation would represent prime targets in the development of personalized, burden-based genetic susceptibility tests [121] . For therapeutic development, pathways and networks displaying multiomics relationships with AD would reduce the search space for rational drug design and may highlight \"hub\" genes for therapeutic cocktail approaches, such as in the polypharmacy strategies successfully used for AIDS and various cancers [34, 112] ."}, {"section_title": "Implications for clinical trial design and precision medicine 4.2.1. Use of genetics in clinical trial design", "text": "The prospect of a personalized or precision medicine for AD, and for its incorporation in therapeutic trial design, is predicated on the ability to use an individual's genetic profile to refine predisposition to disease, characteristics such as likely rate of progression, and predicted therapeutic and side effect responses to various therapeutic strategies. At present, the utility of genetic data with regards to AD clinical drug development has been largely limited to APOE. Unfortunately, the past decade of clinical drug development programs for AD-modifying therapies has been burdened with failures. Although these failures may be a result of lack of drug efficacy, the inability to measure drug response in homogenous patient populations has contributed an unquestionable source of variability in these programs. APOE's strong and well-replicated associations with multiple clinical and functional disease end points and quantitative traits such as brain volume, age at disease onset, amyloid deposition, and disease risk provide sufficient effect size and predictive value to serve utility in clinical development programs [5, 56, 122, 123] . APOE is commonly used in clinical trial analyses as a stratifying factor or covariate to adjust for heterogeneity, although independently it has failed to show consistent therapeutic effect on drug response within this context [124, 125] . However, APOE did predict dose-related side effects (vasogenic edema and stroke). APOE is also being used to select patients for two large drug trials targeting at-risk but CN individuals, the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative APOE and TOMMORROW trials, where this genotype provides an inexpensive and minimally invasive biomarker to identify individuals with high risk of AD. Both APOE and the adjacent TOMM40 gene are being used for patient selection in the TOMMORROW trial. The small effect sizes of the other .20 confirmed markers from large GWAS studies have to date limited their utility for trial design and stratification. Polygenic scoring and related risk aggregation strategies may prove useful in addressing the cumulative contributions of multiple genes and pathways [126, 127] . Similarly, analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, while increasing complexity, is likely to provide important insights relevant for trial design and analysis. As additional information becomes available from multiple sources, the combinatorial roles of genes in targeted pathways are expected to become increasing important for trial design."}, {"section_title": "Use of genetics in therapeutic target identification", "text": "Sources of human variability (genotypic and phenotypic) continue to be characterized in extraordinary detail, scale, and speed, presenting unprecedented opportunities for discovery and development of novel and targeted therapeutic hypotheses. This requires robust insights into relevant human biology. Fig. 4 provides an overview of the path from genetic signal detection to targeted therapeutics, including methods and tolls, as well as implications for trial design, as discussed previously. The value of genetic and related data in medicine development has been exemplified by a new paradigm for novel and targeted drug discovery in oncology [128, 129] . Three critical tipping points appear to have now been reached for the key principles of this paradigm to be extended to drug discovery and development in neurodegeneration: (1) unprecedented technologies to characterize genotypic and phenotypic causes and consequences of human disease variability; (2) dense genotype-phenotype data being generated by largescale public and private sector investments; and, (3) translational systems available to derive novel insights into disease biology and pharmacology from genetic signals. Considerable effort is being invested to leverage and translate human genetic and related data into opportunities for target discovery and validation, understanding disease biology, and patient stratification and enrichment.\nRetrospective analyses of drug discovery pipelines indicate that novel therapeutic hypotheses supported by robust human genetic data have a greater likelihood of successfully delivering new, impactful medicines [130] . Strategically, premising drug discovery pipelines on a foundation of robust human data provides an opportunity for smaller, focused research portfolios of higher confidence targets (contrasting with historical \"shots on goal\" strategies of pursuing a large number of lower confidence targets with a high rate of attrition [131] ). Moreover, advances in approaches to integrate genetic, intermediate trait, and clinical outcome data provide opportunities to distinguish causal relationships from correlative associations based on the principles of Mendelian randomization [132] . Within the drug discovery industry, two applications of such integrated data are to identify opportunities for target discovery (forward genetics: where a new therapeutic hypothesis is developed subsequent to identification of robust genetic signal) and target qualification (reverse genetics: where human genetic data are used to \"validate\" a therapeutic hypothesis based on nongenetic data, such as preclinical animal models).\nThe growing list of genes identified as being robustly associated with AD has recently identified several potential novel therapeutic targets and target pathways. ADNI data have contributed significantly to such findings. For example, recent genetic association findings highlight autoimmune and inflammation-related mechanisms as being potentially causal in AD [133] . Autoimmune mechanisms may provide opportunities for novel therapeutic targets for the treatment or prevention of AD, especially as such mechanisms may provide additional therapeutic value beyond established target pathways such as Ab and tau [134] . Specific examples of immune-related genes associated with AD risk and/or related intermediate traits include TREM2 and CD33 [55, 135] . The dense genetic, multimodal phenotypic, and clinical data (including in a longitudinal setting) in ADNI have contributed to better understanding of associations of these genes with AD, including the potential pathways and mechanisms involved [55] . As the number of genes and pathways identified as being associated with neurodegenerative diseases grows [34] , ADNI provides an important resource to better understand such associations and help contribute to the translation of such associations into therapeutic hypotheses. This contribution may be enhanced given the potential to incorporate functional genomic and mechanistic data in the future."}, {"section_title": "Use of genetics in novel biomarker identification", "text": "Genetic studies are instrumental in elucidating the pathways involved in the etiology of AD and in discovering and validating drug targets. A parallel approach can also be used to identify disease biomarkers. Identification of the TREM2 rare variant and its association with AD risk has sparked renewed interest in the field in understanding the role of inflammation [135] . As this mutation is relatively rare, it likely has little clinical utility as a biomarker of disease heterogeneity. However, in part because of this and other immune-related genetic findings, there is renewed appreciation of the need for finding blood biomarkers or imaging methods that track neuroinflammation. Pathway analysis approaches can be used to identify such biomarker targets, as was demonstrated by Zhang et al. [119] . As our understanding of disease complexity in AD matures, genomic science can help to elucidate underlying biology, bringing together multiple levels of \"-omics\" data to the level of individual variability to uncover novel signals and biomarkers that may segregate with disease subtypes."}, {"section_title": "Understanding AD biology through iPSCs", "text": "Cancer research has benefited from renewable sources of cell lines derived from tumors carrying alterations of major oncogenic pathways to enable drug screening and characterization. By contrast, drug discovery in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD has mostly relied on animal models. Advances in iPSC technology have opened new opportunities for creation of novel human-derived in vitro models to help bridge the gap between animal models and clinical development.\niPSCs can be generated from various adult cell types such as skin fibroblasts, hair follicle keratinocyte, or liver or blood cells. Similar to embryonic stem cells, iPSCs can self-renew and be differentiated into all three germ layers to allow further investigations in relevant tissue/ cell types [136] . The first iPSCs for AD were generated from fibroblasts of familial AD patients carrying mutations in PSEN1 or PSEN2 [137] . Neurons differentiated from these iPSCs have elevated Ab 1-42 secretion, which can be modulated by gamma-secretase inhibitors. A later study by Israel et al. [138] created iPSCs using fibroblasts from familial AD, sporadic AD, and nondemented controls. Similar to the earlier report, differentiated neurons from iPSCs from familial and sporadic AD showed higher levels of Ab and pTau 181 compared with those from controls. These studies indicated that it is possible to generate iPSC-derived neurons from elderly patients that capture basic biochemical changes associated with disease states yielding potential in vitro systems for compound screening. Promising recent technical developments also suggest the feasibility of producing iPSCs with appropriate disease phenotypes from LCLs [139] . This could be very important in maximizing the value of ADNI data as LCLs are available for almost every participant from all study phases (ADNI-1/GO/2).\nThe vast majority of AD cases are sporadic with contributions from multiple genetic and environmental factors. Although individuals with AD share similar pathologic changes, the patient population is highly heterogeneous. The preliminary comparison reported by Israel et al. showed that only one of the two sporadic AD iPSC-differentiated neurons shared similar phenotypes with those from familial AD participants, indicating that sporadic AD patients may have different degrees of similarity to familial AD phenotypes. A larger panel of iPSC lines derived from sporadic AD patients may provide further information related to disease heterogeneity and help define potential disease subtypes within sporadic AD. Recent work from the University of California, San Diego group suggests the potential of iPSC studies to identify molecular phenotypic signatures associated with established AD candidate genes such as SORL1 [sortilin-related receptor, L(DLR class) A repeats containing] [140] .\nADNI has stimulated international efforts to characterize AD phenotypes across a number of technology platforms including imaging, biochemistry, and genetics. iPSC lines derived from these cohorts, including prodromal dementia participants and cognitively normal at-risk participants with rich characterizations, will enable linking in vitro molecular profiles (e.g., epigenetic changes) with other relevant disease phenotypes. In fact, the next phase of ADNI would be well positioned to collect samples for iPSC development on a large series of older adults at risk for MCI and AD with highly detailed phenotypic characterization that could help to determine the relationship between clinical and pathophysiological phenotypes and cellular/molecular phenotypes. Recent developments in three-dimensional culture systems may permit capture of additional disease features such as neurofibrillary tangles [141] . This will provide better in vitro model systems to understand disease mechanisms that, combined with improved phenotypic characterization of disease heterogeneity, can be expected to advance AD therapeutics and move the field closer to the goal of precision medicine."}, {"section_title": "Return of research results to participants", "text": "The topic of return of research results (RORR) to research participants and/or their physicians has been a source of considerable interest and controversy across the entire spectrum of the research enterprise [142] [143] [144] , but particularly in the domains of imaging [145] [146] [147] and genetics [148] [149] [150] . In brief, as human studies systematically collect information on participants, participants may request the information, and arguments may be made for participant benefit of receiving this information. Discussions of RORR sometimes differentiate information that is relevant to the disease in question and the aims of the study (sometimes called \"incidental research findings\") versus information unrelated to the purpose of the study (sometimes referred to as \"incidental findings\"). The discussion also sometimes differentiates RORR that are aligned with clinical standards of care (e.g., returning an unexpectedly elevated blood pressure or the presence of an unexpected mass on an imaging study) versus returning results that are not yet part of expected standards of clinical care where the implications of the results may not yet be well understood (such as new assays or novel imaging modalities).\nThere have been active discussions about RORR within various ADNI committees and within the ADNI Genetics Core. Institutional review boards (IRBs) at various ADNI clinical sites have also raised questions with regard to how both imaging and genetic RORR issues should be handled. In ADNI, the issue has arisen in two principal areas: amyloid PET imaging and genomics."}, {"section_title": "RORR for amyloid PET imaging", "text": "A large subset of ADNI participants received amyloid PET scans as part of the ADNI research protocol. In some of these instances, either the participants themselves have requested their amyloid PET results or their clinicians (who are sometimes also the ADNI investigators at that particular site) have requested the results of the amyloid PET scans to influence the clinical care of these participants-particularly among CN participants who are found to have positive amyloid PET scans. Arguments against disclosing these data were that they were ordered outside of the clinical work stream, often in situations (such as in unaffected individuals) that were outside the scope of current medical practice, and that they were not all necessarily read in a standardized way by interpreters who had been trained to render a clinical report. A further argument against disclosing these results was that a major component of the scientific value of ADNI is in the correlative analyses between cognitive testing, biomarker collection, structural and functional imaging, and longitudinal outcome. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that simply learning that one has a neurocognitive diagnosis [151] , or that one is at increased genetic risk for AD dementia [152] , can have a deleterious effect on neurocognitive performance. If the results of amyloid PET scans performed under a research protocol were prematurely fed back into the clinical work stream, the choices of clinicians and the reactions of participants could be altered in ways that could diminish the scientific validity of the results.\nArguments for RORR to participants and their clinicians are predominantly focused on the autonomy of participants and the rights of participants to learn information about themselves that could influence their health [142, 150] . There is also the universal appetite among research participants of all types for the return of health-related research information [153] . In just the arena of dementia, a nationally representative survey of US adults [154] , and an entirely separate survey of adults in the United States and four European countries [155] , showed that nearly 70% of those queried would take a test to learn more about their risk of AD, even if no preventative treatment was available. In a 2012 survey of 260 academic physicians specializing in dementia care and research, 135 (52%) responded, and of those, 24% reported that if amyloid scans were FDA approved and covered by insurance, they planned to use this technology for screening asymptomatic individuals [156] . Since that time, published guidelines have recommended against amyloid scans in CN individuals [157, 158] , and US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a decision denying payment for clinical use of this technology [159, 160] . Of note, CMS approved coverage with evidence development for amyloid PET in which patients meeting appropriate use criteria can receive coverage if they are enrolled in an approved comparative effectiveness trial designed to clarify the benefit to clinical care. In our 2012 survey of ADNI investigators asking respondents to assume FDA approval of [ 18 F]florbetapir over half of the 159 respondents indicated that CN study participants had requested the results of their amyloid scans and nine respondents (6%) reported that they had already disclosed amyloid imaging results to these participants [161] .\nWithin ADNI, there was a considerable range of opinion regarding the policy that should be adopted for RORR of amyloid PET scans, and in 2012, a policy was adopted that recommended against the RORR for this modality (http://www. adni-info.org/scientists/doc/10_Green_RORR.pdf). These issues are likely to be revisited periodically in this rapidly evolving area."}, {"section_title": "RORR for biomarkers and genetic variants", "text": "In addition to imaging studies, ADNI generates individual-level data on a variety of serum, plasma, and CSF biomarkers (see ADNI Biomarker Core report in this special issue), as well as the genotype and sequencing results described earlier in this article. In the areas of biomarkers and genetic variants related to AD, the arguments for and against disclosure are similar to those made about research imaging results, that is, respect for participant autonomy and possible benefit to ongoing and future medical care versus the possibility that longitudinal measures of important outcomes could be biased by RORR or by actions taken in response to RORR. In the area of laboratory tests, there is another consideration, which is that most of the biomarker and genetic data are generated in laboratories that are not CLIA certified. CLIA is the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments certification by CMS that regulates quality assurance in human clinical laboratory testing in the United States. The position of CMS, and of most IRBs, is quite unambiguously that no health-related laboratory results should be returned to participants unless those results are generated (or replicated) in a CLIA-certified laboratory [162, 163] .\nAs large-scale studies such as ADNI collect and analyze genomic information, the societal trends toward RORRs and individual empowerment are encouraging extensive discussion about whether specific processes should be put in place to return incidental or secondary genomic findings of medical importance [150, 164] . Similar discussions have been occurring in the clinical realm as WES and WGS are increasingly being used in clinical diagnosis [165, 166] , sparked in part by the recommendations of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) that were published in 2013 and updated in 2015 [167, 168] . The ACMG recommended that an explicit panel of mutations in specific genes should be routinely assessed when sequencing is performed for clinical purposes. The ACMG recommendations recognized that this area is evolving and suggested a need for regular reevaluations of the minimum list, as well as the importance of clear communication with the patient, but attempted to place the return of secondary findings in clinical sequencing squarely within existing traditions of clinical medicine [169] . These discussions in the clinical arena have prompted extensive considerations by researchers and IRBs about the distinctions between the clinical and research domains [162, 163] , but consensus recommendations appear to be evolving toward the position that genomic results of medical importance and medical actionability should be shared with research participants and after the death of participants, with their families, particularly if the consent forms are clearly written to include this contingency [150, 170] .\nLarge-scale genotyping and sequencing in a dementia study raises a number of other issues. Many individuals and families are interested in learning their APOE genotype, as this is a risk marker for AD that has become widely recognized throughout society. APOE genotype is a robust marker for AD risk but does not meet the criteria for medical importance and medical actionability that have been described in the aforementioned referenced discussions of RORR. Thus, although clinical trials have demonstrated that APOE genotype can be returned without undue distress [171] [172] [173] [174] , this is not typically included in discussions of possible genomic RORR.\nBoth imaging and genome-scale testing also raise issues of reidentifiability. With high-resolution MRI scanning, it is theoretically possible to reconstruct faces to the point where they might be identifiable. There have also been well-publicized accounts in which de-identified genomes could be linked to specific surnames, and potentially to specific individuals, through linkage to publically available databases [175] . In this regard, ADNI genomes are as vulnerable, or protected, as other genomes that are being made available to qualified researchers through various sharing mechanisms such as dbGaP. Although reidentification through imaging or genomic information is therefore possible, it is strictly prohibited by ADNI policies and by IRBs, and any attempt to do so by investigators would be in clear violation of these policies.\nIn summary, the RORR to participants in ADNI has not been pursued to date because ADNI consent forms do not promise that incidental findings will be returned and, in some cases, are explicit in noting that they will not be returned. It remains to be seen if IRB policies toward return of incidental genomic information will request or require ADNI sites to revisit this question in the years ahead."}, {"section_title": "Future plans, related initiatives, and conclusions", "text": "ADNI-2 is now about to enter its final year, and plans are being finalized for the ADNI-3 proposal to continue and extend this research in important new directions. Tau PET imaging studies, computer-based cognitive assessments, and other new features will be added this year and hopefully carried forward into the next phase of ADNI. From a genetic perspective, these novel phenotypes will be important topics for future association studies. In addition to continued banking, dissemination, and assays on longitudinal genetic biosample data, major plans include analysis of existing baseline and follow-up visit data and similar collection and analysis of new participants to be recruited in the future. Most resources available to the Genetics Core are for sample collection and processing. However, analysis of existing data on the association of genetic variation and key clinical/cognitive, imaging, and biomarker phenotypes is a priority.\nLongitudinal blood RNA and epigenetic markings (including but not limited to methylation) in DNA will be important and potentially highly informative. As discussed previously, a longitudinal convergent \"multiomics\" collection and analysis strategy will continue, along with the challenge of finding resources for complete analysis and dissemination of all biosample results. Partnerships with the Alzheimer's Association, other foundations and donors, and ADNI's industry partners via the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health have made possible the early ADNI-1 GWAS, the recent WGS on .800 samples, and the RNA expression profiling using blood samples from most of the same participants.\nThe ADNI Genetics Core hosts an extended working group that holds conference calls monthly or more often as needed. The Genetics Core also sponsors an ad hoc RNA working group to support collaborative expression profiling and transcriptome analysis. Furthermore, the Genetics Core has recently established an ADNI systems biology working group to enhance the potential contributions of this specialized area for analysis of ADNI data and for collaboration on analyses that span multiple data types and cohorts. Thought leaders in systems biology and network medicine from academia, foundations, and industry are engaged in determining the key scientific questions, opportunities, and priorities that these areas of science can contribute to ADNI.\nThe ADNI Genetics Core has served as a liaison to relevant consortia, including the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium/Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project, Religious Order Study/Rush Memory and Aging Project, AddNeuroMed, World-Wide ADNI, ENIGMA, MultiInstitutional Research in Alzheimer's Genetic Epidemiology, IMAS, and HRS investigators, as well as other cohort studies that could serve as replication samples or collaborate in other synergistic research activities. Various inquiries about ADNI genetic data within and outside of ADNI have been addressed to encourage the individual and collaborative investigation of ADNI genetic data. Current plans also include direct comparisons between ADNI and the autosomal dominant form of AD seen in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network consortium. One limitation of ADNI genetic analyses is the absence of large data sets for replication with the vast array of imaging and fluid biomarkers available in ADNI. To date, some studies have used local data sets not publically shared, as well as some partially publically available data sets. Additional open data sharing in the future will assist in providing replication samples for ADNI genetic analyses. Furthermore, when genetic data become available for the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing study and other publically available cohorts in the World-Wide ADNI consortium, there will be tremendously enhanced power to detect associations and replicate ADNI genetic findings.\nAs promising leads are discovered using ADNI genetic and phenotypic data, there is potentially very high scientific and translational value to be gained from follow-up with functional genomics experiments (as illustrated in Fig. 4) . One particularly promising direction for functional genomics follow-on studies is creation of iPSCs from blood or fibroblast samples collected from the ADNI cohort. iPSCs coupled with other clinical and imaging information from the same individual would help to construct \"dementia-on-a-chip\" models for assessing candidate diagnostic and therapeutic agents. Although it is beyond the scope of ADNI to follow-up all promising leads, the Genetics Core will continue to facilitate and coordinate with partners and the research community to enable these experiments to be conducted and results shared expeditiously. Finally, given the complexity of rich longitudinal \"multi-omics\" phenotypes, intelligent analytic strategies closely linked to biological knowledge need to be adapted and applied to ADNI data. Fortunately, the computational science community is stepping up to this challenge with dozens of publications using advanced strategies to interrogate ADNI data, and the Genetics Core looks forward to supporting and collaborating with such efforts to extract biologically significant and clinically relevant information from the proverbial haystack of information.
