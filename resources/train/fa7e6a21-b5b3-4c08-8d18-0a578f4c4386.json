[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Alcadein \u03b1 (Alc \u03b1 ) is a neuronal membrane protein that colocalizes with the Alzheimer's amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP). Successive cleavage of APP by \u03b2and \u03b3-secretases generates the aggregatable amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2), while cleavage of APP or Alc \u03b1 by \u03b1and \u03b3-secretases generates non-aggregatable p3 or p3-Alc \u03b1 peptides. A\u03b2 and p3-Alc \u03b1 can be recovered from human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We have previously reported alternative processing of APP and Alc \u03b1 in the CSF of some patients with sporadic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD (SAD). Results: Using the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system that detects total p3-Alc \u03b1 , we determined levels of total p3-Alc \u03b1 in CSF from subjects in one of four diagnostic categories (elderly controls, MCI, SAD, or other neurological disease) derived from three independent cohorts. Levels of A\u03b240 correlated with levels of total p3-Alc \u03b1 in all cohorts.\nWe confirm that A\u03b240 is the most abundant A\u03b2 species, and we propose a model in which CSF p3-Alc \u03b1 can serve as a either (1) a nonaggregatable surrogate marker for \u03b3-secretase activity; (2) as a marker for clearance of transmembrane domain peptides derived from integral protein catabolism; or (3) both. We propose the specification of an MCI/SAD endophenotype characterized by co-elevation of levels of both CSF p3-Alc \u03b1 and A\u03b240, and we propose that subjects in this category might be especially responsive to therapeutics aimed at modulation of \u03b3-secretase function and/or transmembrane domain peptide clearance. These peptides may also be used to monitor the efficacy of therapeutics that target these steps in A\u03b2 metabolism."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Alcadeins (Alcs) represent a family of neuronal type I membrane proteins (designated as Alc \u03b1 , Alc \u03b2 , and Alc \u03b3 ) that are encoded by independent genes [1] . In neurons, Alc forms a tripartite complex with Alzheimer's amyloid \u03b2protein precursor (APP) via the crosslinking action of the neural adaptor protein X11-like (X11L) [2, 3] . In the absence of X11L, both the free Alc proteins and the free APP are subjected to coordinated proteolytic cleavage through similar mechanisms: APP and Alc are both cleaved by the identical \u03b1-secretase at the juxtamembrane region. This cleavage of Alc causes release of N-terminal soluble Alc ectodomain (sAlc) and leaves behind a C-terminal cell-membraneassociated AlcCTF. APP can undergo either an identical \u03b1secretase cleavage (thereby generating a cell-associated APPCTF\u03b1) or instead (and unlike Alc) APP can undergo \u03b2secretase cleavage leading to generation of sAPP \u03b2 and a cell-associated APPCTF\u03b2 [4] . All three CTFs (APPCTF\u03b1, APPCTF\u03b2, AlcCTF) are subjected to regulated intramembranous cleavage by the \u03b3-secretase complex, in which presenilin 1 or 2 (PS1, PS2) functions as the catalytic subunit [2] . Mutations in PS1 and PS2 are known to cause early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). The \u03b3-secretase reaction involving APPCTF\u03b1 generates the p3 fragment, while the reaction involving APPCTF\u03b2 generates the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) [4] . Cleavage of AlcCTF by \u03b3secretase liberates a small peptide named p3-Alc (a named selected to be symmetrical with the name of the APP p3 peptide). The p3-Alc peptide is detectable in CSF, while the APP p3 peptide is very labile and difficult to detect in CSF [2, 5] .\nMost patients with FAD carry one of over 200 pathogenic mutations identified in the coding sequence of PS1 or PS2. These mutations alter intramembranous cleavage of APP so as to increase production of A\u03b242, the most aggregation-prone, oligomerogenic, and fibrillogenic species of A\u03b2 [6] [7] [8] . Other patients with FAD may carry pathogenic mutations in the coding sequence of the APP gene, all of which promote the accumulation of A\u03b2 [4] . Furthermore, Down syndrome (DS) patients carry three copies of chromosome 21 which includes the APP gene locus, and therefore, DS patients have a \"genetic overdose\" of APP, leading them to develop AD by middle age [9] . Therefore, alterations in the generation of A\u03b2, in both quality and quantity, are considered to be causes of AD pathogenesis in genetic forms of the disease.\nIn the more common sporadic forms of AD (SAD), the molecular pathogenesis remains unknown. A\u03b242 levels are reduced in the CSF of SAD patients [10] [11] [12] , but the use of CSF A\u03b242 as an in vivo marker for APP metabolism is complicated by its deposition in brain and cerebral vasculature as the disease progresses. Recent evidence suggests that a disturbance in an apolipoprotein E (APOE)-isoform-dependent step in A\u03b2 clearance plays a role in the pathogenesis of SAD [13] , although these data could not exclude the possibility that A\u03b2 oligomerization or fibrillization (and not a defect in some clearance pathway alone) may also play a role, since apoE also plays a role in A\u03b2 aggregation (Caesar et al., unpublished observations).\nWe recently reported that the CSF of subjects with sporadic MCI and early AD showed a relative overrepresentation of a minor p3-Alc \u03b1 species, p3-Alc \u03b1 38, raising the possibility that \u03b3-secretase dysfunction can exist even in the absence of an FAD-linked genetic mutation [14] . The previous study [14] was performed using immunoprecipitationmass spectrometry which, as performed, is considered to be a semi-quantitative method. Therefore, we have begun moving toward the development of sensitive ELISAs that will permit convenient, reliable, and sensitive quantitation of total p3-Alc \u03b1 and selected minor species (with p3-Alc \u03b1 38 being the top priority in that respect). Here we report the application of a recently developed ELISA system (antibody and assay development described elsewhere) [15] that can quantify total p3-Alc \u03b1 in the range of 40 to 600 pg/mL. Using this system, we have quantified total p3-Alc \u03b1 levels in the CSF of three independent cohorts that consist of subjects with MCI/CDR 0.5 or AD (CDR 1-3), as well as subjects that are either cognitively intact, age-matched controls or suffer from frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). This latter population served as other neurological disease (OND) controls."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "CSF p3-Alc \u03b1 levels in elderly nondemented subjects and in subjects with MCI, or mild or moderate SAD in Cohort 1 (Japan) and Cohort 2 (US).\nWe first examined p3-Alc \u03b1 levels in the CSF of subjects with MCI (CDR 0.5), mild or moderate AD (CDR 1 and CDR 2) and age-matched elderly nondemented controls (CDR 0) in Cohort 1 (Japan) ( Table 1 ). The p3-Alc \u03b1 levels in subjects were compared according to CDR ( Figure 1A , left panel). Subjects with MCI (CDR 0.5, n = 20) showed a trend toward higher levels than controls (CDR 0, n = 18), but the trend did not reach statistical significance. p3-Alc \u03b1 levels in subjects with mild AD (CDR 1, n = 13) were significantly higher than those in controls (p < 0.05; Tukey-Kramer's multiple comparison test). Interestingly, p3-Alc \u03b1 levels in AD subjects with moderate dementia (CDR 2, n = 13) were indistinguishable from those observed in non-demented controls. When the p3-Alc \u03b1 levels of the CDR 1 and CDR 2 subjects were compared, these groups were also significantly different (p < 0.05).\nIn Cohort 1 (Japan), we observed a significant increase in A\u03b240 levels in subjects with MCI/CDR 0.5 (p < 0.05) and mild AD (CDR 1, p < 0.01), while A\u03b242 levels did not significantly change as a function of disease progression ( Figure 1A , middle panels). Furthermore, the total p3-Alc \u03b1 levels significantly correlated with the levels of A\u03b240 (R 2 = 0.536, p < 0.0001) in subjects with CDR 0.5, 1 and 2 ( Figure 2A ). The A\u03b242/40 ratio was reduced in MCI and AD subjects as compared to the A\u03b242/40 of non-demented controls (CDR 0) ( Figure 1A , right panel). This is a standard effect and is believed to be a consequence of reduced A\u03b242 levels due to its deposition in cerebral vessels and parenchyma [16, 17] . No differences between male and female subjects were detected for p3-Alc \u03b1 and A\u03b240 levels (Additional file 1, Figure S1 ).\nWe next analyzed p3-Alc \u03b1 levels in the CSF of subjects in Cohort 2 (USA) ( Figure 1B ), in subjects with very mild dementia (CDR 0.5) (N.B., in this cohort, the term MCI is not utilized) and mild dementia due to AD (CDR 1) ( Table 1 ) [18] . CSF from Cohort 2 (USA) showed the expected relatively stable levels of A\u03b240 in very mild dementia (CDR 0.5) and mild AD (CDR 1) subjects when compared to those of non-demented controls. In this cohort, both p3-Alc \u03b1 levels and A\u03b240 levels remained relatively stable in the subjects with CDR 0.5 and 1, and the levels of the two peptides did not show the direct correlation observed in Cohort 1 (R 2 = 0.07922, p = 0.1126) ( Figure 2B ). It is worth noting that, in this cohort, semiquantitative data on amyloid deposition were available on all subjects, based on [ 11 C] Pittsburgh compound B ([ 11 C] PiB) amyloid imaging. No differences between male and female subjects were detected for p3-Alc \u03b1 and A\u03b240 levels (Additional file 1, Figure S1 ).\nIn Cohort 1 (Japan), we noticed that the A\u03b242 levels in MCI and AD subjects appeared to be dimorphic, and we suspect that this may reflect differential levels of A\u03b242 deposition (i.e., subjects with low A\u03b242 may have more amyloid deposition than those with normal levels of A\u03b242), but no [ 11 C]PiB data were available to enable us to assess this possibility. Using an A\u03b242 cut-off value [19] of 500 pg/ml, we divided the subjects in Cohort 1 (Japan) into two populations and analyzed the level of p3-Alc \u03b1 and A\u03b2 in the levels were increased in MCI and AD subjects when compared to the corresponding levels in the CSF of non-demented controls (CDR 0) ( Figure 3A -C). Therefore, the overall profiles of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels in this low A\u03b242 subpopulation of Cohort 1 (Japan) closely resembled those of Cohort 2 (USA) (compare Figure 3A -D with Figure 1B ). In this low A\u03b242 subpopulation of Cohort 1 (Japan), the correlation between CSF A\u03b240 levels and CSF p3-Alc \u03b1 levels observed for the entire cohort was no longer evident.\nThe second subpopulation of Cohort 1 was composed of MCI and AD subjects who showed relatively higher A\u03b242 levels (>500 pg/mL). In this high A\u03b242 subpopulation, we observed an increase in levels of both A\u03b240 and p3-Alc \u03b1 in MCI and AD subjects ( Figure 3E-H) . These data suggest that there might be subpopulations of MCI and SAD subjects that exhibit relatively higher CSF levels of both A\u03b2 and p3-Alc \u03b1 . These subpopulations might represent differential depletion of CSF A\u03b242 by progressive cerebral and cerebrovascular amyloid deposition. We would tentatively propose that the subjects distinguished by their high (vs low) A\u03b242 levels might define separate endophenotypes that might be useful for understanding the heterogeneity in causes and/or progression of SAD. For example, the low A\u03b242 subpopulation might have a relatively greater proportion of their A\u03b242 in fibrillar form, while those normal or high A\u03b242 might have a relatively greater proportion of their A\u03b242 in nonfibrillar, soluble oligomer form. . Non-demented healthy controls (CDR 0, n = 23), MCI subjects (CDR 0.5, n = 9), AD subjects with mild dementia (CDR 1, n = 13) and AD subjects with moderate and severe dementia (CDR 2-3, n = 12), and FTLD subjects (n = 37) of Japanese cohort (Cohort 3) were analyzed for levels of p3-Alc \u03b1 (left) and A\u03b240 (middle left), A\u03b242 (middle right) and A\u03b242/40 ratio (right). Statistical analysis was performed using the Dunn's multiple comparisons test following the Kruskal-Wallis test. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. CSF p3-Alc \u03b1 levels in elderly non-demented subjects and in subjects with MCI, AD and FTLD in cohort 3 (Japan)\nIn an effort to confirm the observations described above, we next analyzed another cohort (Cohort 3; Japan), which is independent of Cohort 1 (Japan). This Japanese cohort (Cohort 3) includes non-demented controls (CDR 0; n = 23), MCI/CDR 0.5 (n = 9), mild AD (CDR 1; n = 13), moderate and severe AD (CDR 2 + CDR 3; n = 12), and FTLD (n = 37) subjects ( Table 1 ). There were no significant differences across the various subject groups with respect to average ages or age range ( Table 1) . Cohort 3 (Japan) showed typical profiles for CSF A\u03b2 levels ( Figure 1C) ; CSF A\u03b242 levels were decreased and CSF A\u03b240 levels did not change in MCI/CDR 0.5 and AD subjects as compared with the corresponding values from non-demented controls ( Figure 1C , middle panels). A\u03b242/40 ratios were decreased in MCI and AD, consistent with the typical pattern for those diagnostic groups ( Figure 1C , right panel). FTLD subjects (OND controls) also showed the typical trends in A\u03b2 levels. In Cohort 3 (Japan), no significant increase of CSF p3-Alc \u03b1 levels in AD was observed as compared to non-demented controls, although the CSF of FTLD subjects showed a significant reduction in the p3-Alc \u03b1 levels as compared to non-demented controls and MCI/ AD subjects ( Figure 1C , left panels). In this cohort, a strong correlation of p3-Alc \u03b1 with A\u03b240 (R 2 = 0.8483, p < 0.0001) was observed in subjects with CDR 0.5, 1 and 2-3 as was observed in Cohort 1 ( Figure 2C ). No differences between male and female subjects were observed for the p3-Alc \u03b1 levels or for the A\u03b240 levels (Additional file 1, Figure S1 ).\nCSF samples in Cohort 3 (Japan) (like Cohort 1) appeared to be dimorphic with regard to levels of CSF A\u03b242. Therefore, we again divided subjects into two populations with a cut-off value of CSF A\u03b242 (500 pg/mL), and we again analyzed CSF p3-Alc \u03b1 levels and A\u03b240 levels as shown in Figure 3 (compare Figure 3 vs Figure 4 ). In samples from the low A\u03b242 subpopulation of MCI/CDR 0.5 and AD (CDR >1) subjects, CSF levels of A\u03b240 and p3-Alc \u03b1 were indistinguishable from the corresponding values from non-demented controls and were not correlated ( Figure 4A-D) . On the other hand, CSF from a subpopulation of MCI (CDR 0.5) and AD (CDR >1) subjects who showed high A\u03b242 levels (>500 pg/mL) showed high p3-Alc \u03b1 and high A\u03b240 levels when compared with nondemented controls and FTLD subjects ( Figure 4E-H) ."}, {"section_title": "Correlation of p3-Alc \u03b1 levels between CSF and plasma in same individuals", "text": "We previously reported that plasma p3-Alc \u03b1 levels are increased in AD patients [15] .

Thus, we used samples from a fourth cohort which includes pre-clinical stage subjects without significant impairment for memory and recognition (MMSE average score 28.5, Table 1 ), but who show a slight lower score of California Verbal Learning Test. Such subjects are currently the targets for various early intervention trials [20] . For this population, we had access to plasma and CSF from the same individuals taken at the same time. We examined p3-Alc \u03b1 levels in plasma and CSF of aged population (n = 57), and sought potentially relevant correlations. We identified a significant positive correlation between plasma p3-Alc \u03b1 levels and CSF levels (p = 0.032 and R 2 = 0.0809 by Pearson's correlation coefficient test). The results suggest that CSF p3-Alc \u03b1 levels can correlate with plasma levels (Figure 5 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In our previous studies, we demonstrated that the products of alternative cleavage of non-APP substrates (known as Alcs) by \u03b3-secretase gave rise to a modified p3-Alc \u03b1 peptide profile in media conditioned by transfected cells expressing an FAD-linked mutant PS1 and a similar modified profile was also identified in the CSF of subjects with sporadic MCI (known as CDR 0.5 in Cohort 2 and recently renamed \"prodromal AD\" in the revised lexicon for dementia syndromes [21] ), and mild AD [5, 14] . In order to quantify these peptides reliably and conveniently, we have recently developed an ELISA for p3-Alc \u03b1 [15] . This ELISA system quantifies total p3-Alc \u03b1 levels, but does not specifically measure the individual species of p3-Alc \u03b1 . In the current paper, we have employed this ELISA to quantify total p3-Alc \u03b1 levels in the CSF of three independent cohorts of subjects who were categorized as either nondemented controls, sporadic MCI, sporadic AD, or FTLD.\nInterestingly, applying our new, quantitative p3-Alc ELISA to CSF for the first time, we were surprised to observe in two cohorts of Japanese subjects the apparent existence of subpopulations of sporadic MCI and AD subjects in whose CSF there was differential elevation of the levels of the reaction products generated by \u03b3-secretase cleavage of multiple substrates; i.e., APP and Alcadein. Since A\u03b240 and total p3-Alc \u03b1 were highly correlated in these cohorts, the current data support the use of p3-Alc \u03b1 as a surrogate for total APP-derived \u03b3-cleaved products. Elevated levels of p3-Alc \u03b1 and A\u03b2 were also observed in plasma samples of some female AD patients [15] . However, in CSF, we did not detect any differences in levels between male and female subjects. In another independent cohort study with plasma samples, we confirmed the significant increase of p3-Alc \u03b1 levels in MCI and AD patients, but we observed no systematic differences between male and female subjects [22] . Therefore, it is worth noting that the observation of a sex specific increase in p3-Alc \u03b1 levels in plasma of female AD patients has not been consistently observed in all cohorts studied.\nThe increase in p3-Alc \u03b1 level could arguably be caused by (1) increased primary \u03b1-cleavage by \u03b1-secretase; (2) increased intramembranous \u03b3-cleavage by \u03b3-secretase and/ or (3) diminished clearance of transmembrane-derived fragments such as p3-Alc \u03b1 . Because A\u03b2, a product of primary \u03b2-cleavage of APP by \u03b2-secretase, is also increased in this subpopulation, and because we have previously linked PS1 mutations to variant p3-Alc speciation [5] , we have argued on the basis of parsimony, that the molecular pathology was more likely attributable to dysfunction of \u03b3secretase. However, in light of the new data herein, it is possible that both p3-Alc \u03b1 speciation and also p3-Alc \u03b1 levels may be affected. When these observations are taken together with the model of altered CSF peptide clearance [23] , and the evidence that clearance of A\u03b2 from CSF is modulated in an APOE-isoform-specific manner [13] , we now must consider it equally likely that altered p3-Alc \u03b1 levels and speciation could be attributable to a defect in clearance from CSF of transmembrane domain metabolite peptides.\nA stratification of the current (this paper) and prior data [14] according to APOE genotype, followed by reanalysis, is underway. We have attempted a preliminary APOE genotype-dependent analysis using cohort 3 samples. ApoE4 carriers tended to show higher values of both p3-Alc \u03b1 and A\u03b240 in MCI (CDR 0.5) and AD (CDR 1) patients but not in more advance AD (CDR 2-3) or in FTLD patients (Additional file 3, Figure S2 ). However, the increase of p3-Alc \u03b1 and A\u03b240 in APOE4 carriers did not reach statistical significance when compared to the Figure 5 Positive correlation of p3-Alc \u03b1 levels in CSF with those in plasma of same subjects. Correlation of CSF p3-Alc \u03b1 levels with plasma p3-Alc \u03b1 levels were examined in same subjects of pre-clinical stages for dementia, whose MMSE score did not decrease remarkably (n = 57, Table 1 ). The relation between CSF p3-Alc \u03b1 levels and plasma levels was investigated by Pearson's correlation coefficient test (Graph Pad Prism 5) (R 2 = 0.0809; *p = 0.032).\ncorresponding levels in non-APOE 4 carriers. Because this was a small scale pilot analysis, we consider unresolved the issue of whether APOE4 genotype influences the level of p3-Alc \u03b1 in AD. In order to address this issue directly, analysis of the p3-Alc \u03b1 levels in the identical samples studied by Castellano et al. [13] is under consideration.\nIt is interesting to note that both the quality and quantity of p3-Alc \u03b1 accumulation in CSF may be transient, occurring in MCI and mild AD but not evident in later stages (see ref 14 and this paper). Serial examinations of CSF from the same subjects at different stages of AD will be required in order to establish whether or not such a phenomenon truly exists within the same individual. The Biomarker Core of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [24] should be a useful resource in pursuing this hypothesis.\nSince p3-Alc \u03b1 is not incorporated into cerebral or cerebrovascular amyloid, the decrease in p3-Alc \u03b1 levels in later stage AD subjects (CDR 2 or more) may be due to progressive neuronal degeneration, thereby eliminating the main cellular source of p3-Alc peptides. This is also consistent with other data suggesting that AD may be divisible into an early A\u03b2-driven phase (beginning presymptomatically and extending into mild stages of dementia) and a later phase that may be driven by inflammation and/or tauopathy [25] . Consistent with this formulation are the recent reports that fibrillar amyloid burden, as indicated by [ 11 C]PiB signal, begins accumulating perhaps 10-15 years before symptoms are evident [26] and then plateaus [27] . This reformulation of AD pathogenesis also fits with recent data from Rinne and colleagues, showing that a reduction in the fibrillar amyloid burden caused by~1.5 yrs of bapineuzumab infusion had no obvious impact on cognition [28] .\nIf the apparent transient elevation of levels of p3-Alc \u03b1 and/or A\u03b2 is due, at least in part, to transient \u03b3-secretase dysfunction, the identification of this \"spike\" of dysfunction could be important for the timing and nature of interventions aimed at this enzyme. For example, elevated CSF p3-Alc \u03b1 levels (or the coordinate elevation of CSF A\u03b240 and p3-Alc \u03b1 levels) could be used as an endophenotype that marks a subpopulation of sporadic MCI/ CDR 0.5/prodomal AD and mild AD subjects that might be especially amenable to \u03b3-secretase modulators [29] . Again, serial CSF examinations of normal elderly and presymptomatic and prodromal AD (such as those performed by the ADNI [24] ) will be required in order to determine precisely if and when any CSF p3-Alc \u03b1 spike exists and whether the beginning of the p3-Alc \u03b1 spike heralds the onset of the A\u03b2 accumulation phase. If so, then periodic determination of a panel of CSF biomarkers (including A\u03b242, A\u03b240, and p3-Alc \u03b1 ) in populations at risk might be useful in determining when to initiate clinical trials of A\u03b2\u2212lowering agents [25] . This concept dovetails well with recent evidence showing that dramatic changes in CSF A\u03b242/A\u03b240 are observed in some subjects, and these dramatic outlier values can be used to reveal subjects with spontaneous PS1 mutations [30] . Plasma levels of p3-Alc \u03b1 were parallel to CSF levels in preclinical stages of disease of subjects ( Figure 5 ). Therefore peripheral sampling may be informative, thereby avoiding the inconvenience of serial CSF sampling, although we have not examined the correlation in MCI/ CDR 0.5/prodromal AD and AD subjects. Finally, if the addition of CSF p3-Alc \u03b1 determination turns out to contribute useful information about clinical state or pathogenesis, one might consider adding additional \u03b3secretase reaction products to the panel (e.g., ephrin B [31] , ephrin B receptor [32] ) in order to establish whether many or all \u03b3-secretase substrates are implicated in this putative stage in the molecular pathogenesis of AD that is characterized by \u03b3-secretase dysfunction, impaired transmembrane domain peptide clearance, or both."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The causes of sporadic AD may be various, and some clinical populations with sporadic mild cognitive impairment (also known as CDR0.5 and prodromal AD) and mild AD showed an increase in the CSF levels of transmembrane domain peptides derived from integral membrane proteins such as Alc and APP. The CSF p3-Alc \u03b1 levels paralleled the plasma levels, indicating that peripheral information might reflect the pathological state in brain, at least where \u03b3secretase malfunction is concerned. This endophenotype may caused by (1) disturbed processing of APP and Alc by \u03b3-secretase; (2) a reduction in clearance mechanism of these peptides; or (3) both. Patients in this category might be especially responsive to drug therapeutics aimed at modulation of \u03b3-secretase function and/or transmembrane domain peptide clearance."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "CSF collection", "text": "CSF collection was approved by the ethical board at each institution, and each subject underwent a standard lumbar puncture (LP) while in the lateral decubitus position.

Alzheimer's disease was clinically diagnosed based on two major criteria: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Disorders; 4th Edition (DSM-IV) and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicational Disorders and Stroke -Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria. In one US cohort (Table 1 ; Cohort 2), complete details of collection protocols were provided in a previous report [14] . CDR 0 subjects in this US cohort were verified as controls with CSF A\u03b242 >500 pg/mL, which suggests absence of amyloid plaques [19] . In cohort 3 (Table 3) , the clinical diagnoses of patients with FTLD were made on the basis of established clinical criteria [7] .\nSubject characteristics and data are summarized in Table 1 . A detailed description of all subjects (including their clinical descriptions and raw values for p3-Alc \u03b1 , A\u03b242 and A\u03b240) are provided in the (Additional file 3, Tables S1, Additional file 3, Tables S2, Additional file 3,  Tables S3, Additional "}, {"section_title": "Quantification of p3-Alc \u03b1 and A\u03b2 in CSF with ELISA", "text": "We used a quantitative ELISA system for total p3-Alc \u03b1 as described [15] . In brief, a 25 \u03bcL aliquot of CSF was diluted 10-fold for the measurement of p3-Alc \u03b1 and A\u03b242, and 10 \u03bcL of CSF was diluted 25-fold for measurement of A\u03b240. Diluent was PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA and 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20. To remove debris, the samples (250 \u03bcL) were centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 10 min. The supernatant (100 \u03bcL) was assayed in duplicate using synthetic p3-Alc \u03b1 35 peptide as a standard. A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels were measured according the instructions of the respective manufacturers (IBL, Fujioka Japan for cohort 1; INNOTEST, Innogenetics, Ghent Belgium for cohort 2; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka Japan for cohort 3). All analyses were performed with operators blinded to diagnosis until data tables were generated. Diagnoses and data tables were exchanged among the authors at the time of unblinding."}, {"section_title": "Additional files", "text": "Additional file 1 Figure S1 .
