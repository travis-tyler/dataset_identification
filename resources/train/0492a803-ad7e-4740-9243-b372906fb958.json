[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Their fears were expressed vividly in their eyes. They came from across America and from around the world. They had widely different educational backgrounds, and they spoke several languages. I thought about how we could make these new students feel at home as I registered them in our junior high school and crafted their individualized class schedules. Although we made considerable efforts to ease their apprehensions, I knew that their transition would be difficult. Socially, emotionally, and academically they faced great obstacles in addition to the normal turbulence of adolescence. A buddy system helped with the orientation of new students, but language often was a barrier. A survey of our 1,300 students revealed considerable language diversity which allowed for buddy matching based on language. This system worked reasonably well until it was foiled by the mischievousness of a teenager. I will never forget the reaction of a student, who had jokingly reported his fluency in Korean on our survey, when I brought a newly-arrived Korean boy to his homeroom as his new buddy. Nor shall I forget the great lesson taught by a wise homeroom advisor who made this assignment of unlikely buddies work.\nThese memories are from my experiences as a secondary school administrator almost two decades ago. Today we are confronted by even greater and ever growing challenges created by increasing student mobility. What are the challenges of student mobility for educators, and how can school administrators best meet these challenges?"}, {"section_title": "Educational Challenges Related to Student Mobility", "text": "Mobility has become a way of life in American society. The United States, with about one fifth of the population moving annually, has one of the highest national mobility rates in the world. As a result student mobility is widespread. It is increasingly less common for children to attend school from kindergarten through high school in the same district or even the same state. Most students make at least one nonpromotional school change while in basic education. About 15 to 18% of schoolage children change residences each year. A higher percentage of students actually change schools, however, because residential change accounts for only 60 to 70% of student mobility. Research suggests that school change may affect students psychologically, socially, and academically (Rumberger, 2002) . Transience and high student mobility may create distractions and disruptions that impact classrooms negatively, limit continuity of instruction, and diminish student engagement (Smrekar & Owens, 2003) .\nStudent mobility creates many challenges for students, for their parents, and for educators. These challenges, such as transferability of school records and credit hours, are exacerbated by the great diversity among states, school districts, and schools across America. Similar but different standards have been adopted by 49 states. There are 48 different state assessments which measure student achievement. Age requirements vary for entering school and for leaving school before earning a high school diploma. Curriculum differences result in a possible loss of credit. There are grading system differences which affect class rank. Schools have schedules which are not standardized and widely different calendars. Credit variations occur because of block scheduling, combined courses, and other factors. Graduation requirements differ because of credit and exit examination variations (Keller & Decoteau, 2000) . Highly mobile students and their parents are confronted by a virtual obstacle course created by an American system of education which is based on state responsibility and local control. These challenges persist because state standards, local curricula, and other educational policies too often assume a static student population.\nThe ages for compulsory school attendance range from 5 to 18 years of age across the United States. School starting age varies from 5 to 8 years old, and this is complicated by different birth date rules. The age at which students are allowed to drop out of school before earning a high school diploma varies from 16 to 18 over the 50 states. Mobile students who are eligible to enter or to exit school in one state, may not have the same eligibility in another state (National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 2004) .\nAll states, except for Iowa, which uses norm-referenced testing, use criterionreferenced assessments aligned to state standards. All states use some form of minimum competency testing either for school accountability, student accountability, and/or instructional purposes. Grade levels for competency testing range from kindergarten through 12th grade. The number of years in which students are tested with state assessments range from a low of 2 years to a high of 11 years (NCES, 2004) . In some states assessments include high-stakes exit examinations.\nExit examinations are tests that students must pass to receive a high school diploma, even if the students have earned the credits required for graduation. In 2005 diplomas were withheld from students who did not pass exit exams in 19 states that enroll 50% of our nation's students. By 2012 mandatory exit exams are planned in 26 states that enroll 72% of U.S. public school students. Each state either develops or purchases its own exit exam, so exams vary widely. All states with exit exams test their students in mathematics and English language arts. Many states also test science, social studies, computer literacy, and/or other subjects. Three different types of exit exams are given by these states. Minimum competency exams focus on basic skills below the high school level. Standards-based exams are aligned with state standards and generally include material at the level of 9th or 10th grade. End-of-course exams are standards based and are taken to assess student mastery after students have completed each high school course (Center on Education Policy, 2005).\nState credit requirements for high school graduation, measured in Carnegie units, also vary greatly from state to state. Credits for required courses range from a low of 10.25 to a high of 24, and in some states graduation requirements are determined by local school boards. Local school districts frequently impose other graduation requirements which go beyond required state testing and credits; and some states have different diploma types, such as college or career preparatory (NCES, 2004) . Earning a high school diploma is more difficult for students who are mobile, and it is not expected to become any less difficult for them in the foreseeable future.\nTo better prepare students for college and for the workplace, most states are making high school more rigorous. Eight states have adopted stricter high school graduation requirements with 4 years of rigorous academic course work, including mathematics through at least Algebra II. A total of 35 states are in the process of adopting higher standards for high school graduation which will meet the expectations of employers and postsecondary educators. Other states are planning to adopt tougher standards for graduation (Peterson, 2006) ."}, {"section_title": "Mobile Students", "text": "Students are mobile for many reasons, mostly related to family moves resulting from job changes, divorce, or family separation. Students are displaced by natural disasters. Homeless students move from shelter to shelter. Children of migrant farm workers move with the harvests. Students placed in foster care often change schools. The children of immigrants enroll in a new school as they enter a new land. The children of diplomats, missionaries, military personnel, and executives of international companies are mobile on a global scale. While facing multiple other life challenges, many of these highly mobile students also are living below the poverty level (Popp, Stronge, & Hindman, 2003) .\nMuch can be learned about student mobility from the experiences of more than 200,000 students from Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi who were recently displaced by Hurricane Katrina. School districts from across the United States responded immediately and generously to help children from affected areas continue their education. Although most school moves are difficult for students, officials with experience handling natural disasters and other emergencies urge educators to give special consideration to the mental health and emotional needs that follow a crisis (Wilcox, 2005) . Although standard procedures for processing new students are very helpful, displaced students are in need of additional, special care.\nLafayette, Louisiana, high school English teacher Melinda Mangham (2005) , in an interview published in Teacher Magazine, described ways in which her school helped students displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Lafayette High, as part of a districtwide relief effort, accommodated some 300 students and several teachers displaced from their schools and homes. Students at Lafayette High School organized relief efforts to help students. They formed an ambassador's club which matched new students with Lafayette students. This gave displaced students someone to eat lunch with and to accompany them to extracurricular events. In a situation described as \"devastatingly surreal,\" Lafayette High School tried to make the lives of displaced students as normal as possible. Mangham believes that \"what they need most is to know that there is someone on the school campus whom they can trust, who truly cares, and who recognizes the horror they are going through\" (p. 1).\nHomeless students are in many ways similar to students displaced by natural disasters, many of whom are themselves homeless. The needs of children and youth in homeless situations are addressed in the No Child Left Behind Act. It is estimated that more than one million children will experience homelessness each year. About one third are in shelters and another one third in shared housing. Some 100,000 youth may experience homelessness on any given night. Yet homelessness, which can be invisible, has been a challenge for educators to identify. The McKinney-Vento Homeless Education Assistance Act specifically addresses their need for stability by allowing students to remain in their school of origin, even if they no longer reside in the attendance area, with transportation provided by the school districts. This law also requires schools to enroll students immediately who are experiencing homelessness. Mandated local homeless education liaison persons are given the responsibility of building awareness throughout the community and school district. The first critical step for local liaisons is collaboration with shelter workers and other service providers who work with homeless families (Popp et al., 2003) .\nApproximately 1% of children are identified as migratory because they are the children of migrant workers. About 750,000 students participate annually in U.S. Migrant Education programs. The states of California, Texas, and Florida account for almost one half of migratory students served in the United States. More than three fifths of migratory farm worker households are living below the poverty line, and children from these families often lack health care, school supplies, and access to computer technology and other educational resources. Disruptions which accompany the migratory lifestyle have long been recognized as negatively influencing the academic achievement of children. Hispanic migratory students, who make up 80% of migratory children and have a 50% drop out rate, are the students least likely to complete high school in the United States. (Popp et al., 2003) .\nSome migratory families stay in the United States and become part of the increased immigration which has brought so many children of immigrants into our schools over the past two decades. About 11% of the U.S. population is foreign born. More than one half of our immigrants are from Latin America, and more than one forth are from Asia. Immigrant families may be here with legal documentation, or they may be undocumented. Language is the most common challenge for these immigrant children. In the decade from 1990 to 2000 the number of students in basic education with limited English proficiency doubled from 2.2 million to 4.4 million. For these new immigrants, entering a different system of education, acquiring a new culture, and understanding American school policies and procedures can be daunting (Popp et al., 2003) .\nMany American students experience mobility on a global scale. With globalization the number of children experiencing the benefits and challenges of growing up in multiple cultures continues to expand. It is estimated that some 300,000 American students in basic education are living overseas each year. About 100,000 return and enter U.S. schools each year. These students tend to be worldly and either bilingual or multilingual. They are also more likely than other U.S. students to pursue higher education. Some of these students face a number of challenges, including a sense of rootlessness and difficulty in finding personal identity. Unfortunately, there seems to be a general lack of awareness and sensitivity in the education community about these children and their needs. However, the International Baccalaureate (IB) program, initially designed to ease transitions for these global students, is gaining in popularity in American high schools (Popp et al., 2003) .\nChildren in military-connected families who are stationed abroad fall into the global student category. For the military child, mobility is the rule rather than the exception. Military-connected children face frequent moves and/or separations from family members. These children, on average, experience school transition six to nine times from kindergarten through high school graduation (Military Child Education Coalition [MCEC], n.d.). Fortunately for children in military-connected families, the U.S. Department of Defense provides a school system which serves them well. The overall high academic achievement of children in military families, and of other global American students, demonstrates that high student mobility does not always diminish student academic success."}, {"section_title": "Department of Defense Schools", "text": "Although children in military families gain more than half of their formal basic education in U.S. public schools, during their school years most of these children also attend schools operated by the U. Military families spend on average 3 years at one military post before they are reassigned. As a result the student population turnover rate is about 37% each year for children in military families (Smrekar & Owens, 2003) . This high student mobility rate prompted DoDEA administrators to institute a standardized transition system to help transferring students and a system of uniform curriculum with standardsbased instruction. Standardization allows DoDEA schools to quickly process students who are coming and going; when students arrive from other DoDEA schools their teachers know what content they have covered (Delisio, 2002) . In an attempt to create a world-class education system, DoDEA has developed rigorous curriculum standards which specify what students should know and be able to do. These are national standards developed by organizations representing professionals who teach the major academic subjects in basic education. Curriculum content standards adopted by DoDEA are produced by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the National Council for Teachers of Social Studies, the National Council of Teachers of English, the International Reading Association, and the National Research Council's National Science Education Standards (DoDEA, n.d.).\nGraduation requirements for DoDEA schools are at least as stringent as those of any state. For students to receive a diploma from DoDEA high schools through June 2007, 24 credits in Carnegie units are the standard. Required courses account for 19.5 of those credits, and elective courses make up the other 4.5 credits. Four credits are required in English language arts; 3 credits each in mathematics, science, and social studies; 2 credits in the same second (foreign) language; 1 credit each in career education, fine arts, physical education, and computer science/technology; and 1/2 credit in health. DoDEA high school diplomas in 2008 and beyond will require a total of 26 credits, with 20 required and 6 elective credits. Physical education will be increased to 1.5 credits; career education and computer science will be combined as 2 credits of required professional technical studies (DoDEA, n.d.).\nStudent progress is monitored by DoDEA through the use of standardized assessments. On the Terra Nova Achievement Test, a norm-referenced test for students in grades 3 through 11, students in DoDEA schools score well above the national average every year, in every subject area, and at every grade level tested. On the National Assessment of Education Progress, The Nation's Report Card, students in DoDEA schools consistently score at or near the top of the scale when compared to scores from other participating states and jurisdictions. More than 70% of students in the 5th, 8th, and 10th grades score \"proficient\" or \"distinguished\" on writing assessments. Students in DoDEA schools in 2005, with a 67% participation rate, scored above average on both the verbal and math sections of the SAT I, Scholastic Achievement Test. Despite high mobility, the overall academic achievement of students in DoDEA schools, as measured by a battery of tests, is among the highest in the nation. For African American and Hispanic students, it is the highest in the nation (DoDEA, n.d.) .\nAn analysis by Smrekar and Owens (2003) of testing measures used by DoDEA schools yielded \"compelling evidence of the benefits of linking assessment with strategic intervention for school improvement and system-wide reform against the backdrop of high student mobility\" (p. 5). Assessments link instructional goals with accountability systems and are supported by professional development programs. Smrekar and Owens found that the high achievement levels of mobile students in DoDEA schools may be related to several factors. Teachers in DoDEA schools create a foundation of stability amidst an environment of student mobility because they are career teachers who tend to stay in one school. Licensed teachers fill almost every position, and most teachers have advanced degrees and extensive work experience. Teachers' expectations of students, reported by students as part of a school climate survey, are considerably higher than the national average. A computer-based diagnostic program, used to assess reading and mathematics skill levels, typically is administered to new students within 48 hours of their arrival. When school records do not arrive with students, staff members respond immediately to student needs by conducting a standardized interview to assess student academic standing. A guidance counselor conducts a brief orientation for each incoming student and assigns an experienced student in the same grade level as a partner through a formalized buddy system. Continuity and seamless transition between schools has been institutionalized for students in DoDEA schools through strategic planning, centralized direction setting, and local decision making.\nIn selected excerpts from the 2001 report to the National Education Goals Panel, March Toward Excellence, DoDEA director Joe Tofoya emphasizes that the high mobility index of 35% for students within DoDEA schools is not used as an excuse for underachievement. With a normal 3-year tour of duty for military parents, there is a sense of urgency among teachers who understand that their time with each individual student is limited. Eight factors which account for high academic achievement by students in DoDEA schools are identified as\n\u2022 Centralized direction setting with local decision making.\n\u2022 Policy coherence and regular data flow regarding instructional goals, assessments, accountability, and professional training and development.\n\u2022 Sufficient financial resources linked to instructionally relevant strategic goals.\n\u2022 Staff development that is job-embedded, intensive, sustained over time, relevant to school improvement goals, and linked to student performance.\n\u2022 Small school size, conducive to trust, communication, and sense of community.\n\u2022 Academic focus and high expectations for all students.\n\u2022 Continuity of care for children in high quality preschools and afterschool programs.\n\u2022 A corporate commitment to public education that is material and symbolic and that is visible and responsive to parents within the school community (Smrekar et al., 2001, p.10) .\nDoDEA schools are models of integration with high academic achievement for a mobile student population, but they do enjoy some advantages which may contribute to their success. DoDEA spends almost $2,000 more per pupil than the national average (Tofoya, 2001) . Teachers earn on average nearly $10,000 more annually than their public school peers. Schools are small with state-of-the-art computer labs. At least one parent in each military family has a high school diploma and a full-time job. Since DoDEA schools around the world share a common curriculum, students who transfer within the DoDEA system do not have to adjust to a new course load. Military parents report that, even in the most tumultuous times, DoDEA schools give their children a sense of stability (Schouten, 2004) ."}, {"section_title": "Curriculum and Instruction", "text": "High student mobility rates relate significantly to low achievement test scores. One explanation for this significant relationship is curricular inconsistency. To remedy this curricular inconsistency some recommend a strong, coordinated core curriculum among schools. Others suggest that school choice, by allowing some students to remain at one school despite changing residences, could break the link between a child's home address and school assignment (Skandera & Sousa, 2002) .\nContinuity of instruction for all students is a basic tenet of the movement for high academic standards. Unfortunately for mobile students, state standards and their alignment to local curricula and instruction assume a relatively static student population (Keller & Decoteau, 2000) . The Military Child Education Coalition (MCEC), a nonprofit organization formed in 1998, serves as an advocate for all military-related and other mobile students in public, private, DoDEA, host nation, and home schools. MCEC, which expresses the conviction that both academic rigor and stability will benefit military-related and other mobile students, has developed a recommended 4-year plan which is intended to increase the educational continuity for highly mobile students in secondary education. This plan calls for four credits in English, mathematics, and science (three lab), three credits in social studies, two foreign language credits, and one credit in computer science. The MCEC-recommended 4-year plan for high school students is in line with the IB diploma program which provides an international secondary education credential for highly mobile students. IB, supported by the many services of the MCEC, encourages its family of more than 1,700 IB world schools located in 122 countries to facilitate student transfers wherever possible. Of the more than 600 IB schools in the United States, 85% are state public schools (MCEC, n.d.).\nThe International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) and MCEC are working together to help mobile students. The original purpose of IBO, a nonprofit educational organization established in Switzerland in 1968, was to facilitate the international mobility of students preparing for postsecondary education by providing schools with a curriculum and diploma recognized by universities around the world. Its mission has since expanded to make an IB education available to students at all grade levels. The IBO mission is to develop inquiring, knowledgeable, and caring young people who help to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect. Core values of the IBO include high standards embracing diversity, working together through partnerships, innovative pedagogy, and the active involvement of stakeholders. The IB program emphasizes critical thinking and a global worldview (MCEC, n.d.; International Baccalaureate Organization [IBO], n.d.).\nThe IB program is, however, not without its critics. The Upper Saint Clair, Pennsylvania, school board recently voted five to four to eliminate their IB diploma program, despite efforts by parents and students. While financial reasons were cited by some board members for the cut of IB, questions about whether the IB program is contrary to American values were raised. Similar issues have surfaced in several districts across the United States where IB was called anti-American, anti-Christian, and even Marxist. Although IB does promote global, international education which seeks to develop the ability of students to understand and communicate with people from other countries and cultures, there is no evidence to substantiate these charges (Chute, 2006) .\nThe IB diploma program offers a mobile and truly international credential which allows students the flexibility to matriculate at universities all over the world, including Western Europe, Australia, and all of North America. IB, a challenging program of international education, is based on a rigorous and portable broad-based humanities curriculum which emphasizes transdisciplinary learning. Six subject groups include native language, second language, sciences, the arts, mathematics and computer science, and individuals and societies. The IB diploma program has three required core elements: extended essay, theory of knowledge and creativity, and action and service. IB students can readily move among IB schools with the assurance that they are being prepared for the same exams with common curriculum and program standards in place. The MCEC strongly encourages military-connected students to enroll in rigorous curricula and to become involved in programs that are portable and widely available. The IB diploma program, which fits both of these criteria, is recommended as an option to be explored by military and other mobile families for their students (MCEC, n.d.). For educational institutions that want to globalize the curriculum while helping mobile students, IB should be given strong consideration. Secondary schools that wish to offer the IB diploma program must receive authorization from the IBO. To gain eligibility to offer the IB diploma, schools must successfully complete a feasibility study and identification of resources along with an IBO team visit (IBO, n.d.)."}, {"section_title": "Relationship Between Student Mobility and Achievement", "text": "Student mobility is a significant factor which can affect students who change schools and their classmates. High student mobility is associated with lower academic achievement for transient students, and a highly mobile student population creates stresses in classrooms and in schools. For entering students teachers must spend more time on review, and for highly mobile student populations teachers tend to favor short-term teaching strategies which are less integrated. Additional record keeping and information exchange require resources not needed in more stable schools. Because of changing and unpredictable enrollments, staffing decisions also are more difficult. When students in whom teachers have invested considerable effort depart, teachers can feel a loss of accomplishment. Although attempts to assess school performance become meaningless when the student population tested changes dramatically from year to year, schools are being held accountable for the academic achievement of students who have received much of their education elsewhere. Despite the challenges created by student transience, many schools have not yet implemented procedures to minimize the adverse effects of student mobility (Wasserman, 2001 ).\nResearch evidence reveals that student mobility during both elementary school and high school diminishes graduation prospects. Only frequent family moves of three or more, however, predict retention in grade. The impact of student mobility depends on factors such as the number of school changes, when school transfers occur, reasons for school changes, and the family and personal situations of students (Rumberger, 2002) .\nA 2001 study conducted in Alberta, Canada, by David Wasserman revealed a strong and clear correlation between the number of school changes and student performance on achievement tests. This relationship was evident for students in all courses and at all grade levels tested. Students who more often changed schools had lower average scores in nearly direct proportion to the number of school changes. Data analyses revealed a correlation between student mobility index values and the percentage of students meeting standards. Data from a study by Sanderson (2004) collected in a school district outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with a highly transient student population, also reveals that the higher the rate of mobility for students, the lower their academic test scores. Some of the achievement differences noted in these studies, however, may have been the result of student ability differences and socioeconomic factors.\nIn a creatively designed longitudinal study involving 764 sixth-grade students from a New York City school district with high student mobility, Heinlin and Shinn (2000) investigated the relationship between student mobility and academic achievement with and without controls for third-grade achievement. When prior achievement was not controlled for, they found that high total student mobility was strongly related to lower sixth-grade achievement, a finding consistent with most studies of student mobility. Early mobility which occurred prior to the third grade was, however, a stronger predictor of sixth-grade achievement than school transfers after third grade. When third-grade student achievement was controlled for a strikingly different picture emerged, one which was consistent with the findings of two other longitudinal studies which were conducted in Europe. When longitudinal data were used which controlled for gender, socioeconomic status, and third-grade achievement, mobility after third grade was not related to sixth-grade achievement. Students' sixth-grade achievement was predicted by their performance in third grade.\nBecause of the many confounding variables which must be considered, investigating the relationship between student mobility and educational attainment is a complex problem. There may be other variables, contained in family background, which explain both family mobility and the achievement of their children. Children who move with greater than average frequency do have lower overall academic achievement levels than their more stable peers. But these highly mobile students also are more likely to come from single-parent homes, more likely to be poor, more likely to be ethnic minorities, and more likely to come from a household where the parent is unemployed and/or failed to graduate from high school. Therefore, controls for socioeconomic status are critical in studies of the effects of student mobility (Heinlin & Shinn, 2000) .\nSeveral studies (Heinlin & Shinn, 2000; Popp et al., 2003; Sanderson, 2004; Skandera & Sousa, 2002; Wasserman, 2001) , which have examined the potential effects student mobility may have on schools and on students, indicate generally a negative relationship between academic achievement levels and the frequency with which students move from school to school. Mobile students also have increased risk of behavior problems and graduate from high school at a lower rate. When researchers control for poverty, ethnicity, and prior performance, however, the effects of mobility are mitigated and much of the suspected effect is lost (Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, 2004) . Since studies of student mobility have not been experimental, no cause-and-effect relationship has been established between mobility and student achievement. The correlational relationship which has been established does, however, allow for prediction. Although we are not yet certain about the causes, we can predict that on average students who are highly mobile will not do as well as their more stable counterparts. Mobile students do have special needs which must be addressed if they are to reach their full potential.\nResearch on student mobility reveals that the more frequently students change schools for reasons other than grade promotion, the more likely they are to drop out, to have lower achievement, and to have behavioral problems (Rumberger, 2002; Smrekar & Owens, 2003) . In assessing factors related to student achievement, however, some studies have found that mobility is unrelated to achievement when family income, ethnicity, and prior achievement are controlled for. The limited research on student mobility suggests that high student mobility rates, which are strongly related to low family income, are more of a symptom than a cause of low achievement (Research Corner, 2005) . But because highly mobile students do tend to have lower academic achievement, they do need special attention to help them succeed in school. They also encounter many other obstacles to their educational progress created by the great diversity of standards, curriculum, programs, graduation requirements, high-stakes testing, and policies concerning school entry and exit. Because of the chaotic home lives of children who are highly mobile, they are the students most in need of a stable school environment to balance their lives. Fortunately for educators there are organizations and agencies, dedicated to easing the transition of highly mobile students, which provide valuable information and resources to the school community."}, {"section_title": "Accommodations and Resources for Mobile Students", "text": "It is possible to reduce student mobility through school reforms. States and school districts can limit policies, such as redistricting and changing attendance areas, that contribute to student mobility. School districts can be flexible with district and attendance area boundaries, provide transportation to help students remain in their schools, and cooperate with each other to support students who are transferring. When families move substantial distances to new jobs and residences, however, little can be done to prevent student mobility. Students who do transfer and their parents need to be better informed about the problems often encountered when changing schools and about how to minimize those difficulties (Rumberger, 2002) . Given the dynamics of our educational governance, it is unlikely that the problems for mobile students will be alleviated in the near future. To better serve mobile students, advance preparation must be made for student arrivals and departures at the school level.\nHow mobile students are accommodated by a school will greatly affect how they succeed in that school. Usually student success is measured in terms of academic achievement, but social and emotional well-being are also important concerns. Because of transition stress some mobile students experience downshifting, a psycho-physiological response to a perceived threat or unpleasant experience which impedes or diminishes learning after a move (Keller & Decoteau, 2000) .\nThere are many possible interventions which can increase the support of students and staff and lessen the negative impact of school mobility. Popp and colleagues (2003) recommend using Maslow's hierarchy of needs as a tool for developing strategies for welcoming new students. Their strategy emphasizes meeting the basic human needs first before gradually moving up the needs hierarchy to meet higher-order needs. School administrators should provide leadership, guidance, and resources to staff. They also can build bridges with the community and solicit support from human service providers, housing agencies, local governments, and the business community. MCEC (n.d.) promotes partnerships and networking to address transition and other educational needs related to student mobility. MCEC seeks to include military installations, their supporting schools, other concerned organizations, and caring individuals. Through networks and partnerships among schools and military installations, MCEC establishes support systems for students and for their parents and transition processes for schools and the children they serve. Some states have responded to the needs of highly mobile students through the use of technology for distance learning and for the transfer of records.\nFlorida and Texas have developed electronic portfolios for migrant students that can be accessed and updated as the student moves from one school to the next. Over the past decade advances in technology have led to improvements in computerized record transfer, and the No Child Left Behind Act has renewed the commitment of the U.S. government to developing a national system for electronic transfer of student records. Distance learning is another technology-based strategy to address gaps in student learning and the changing curriculum standards as students move from one venue to another. The Opti School software developed by the Florida Anchor School Project stores student records to assist receiving schools in making appropriate placement decisions and to allow teachers to align standards, requirements, and curriculum across states (Popp et al., 2003) .\nTo better understand the challenges faced by military-connected high school students when transitioning from one school system to another, the MCEC (n.d.) conducted the United States Army's Secondary Education Transition Study (SETS). Although SETS research focused on military-connected students, the knowledge gained from SETS has the potential to help all mobile students regardless of the service affiliation or occupation of their parents. From the SETS findings MCEC developed a framework of suggestions for possible courses of action. To ease the hardships for students inherent in school transitions, MCEC formulated suggestions for local consideration. Highest priority was given to formal and informal articulation of courses, credits, and reciprocal avenues to fulfill graduation requirements. Also emphasized were formally developed procedural, policy, curriculum, and extracurricular participation links. To help mobile students transition more smoothly, specific suggestions in the form of \"Best and Promising Practices\" grew out of SETS. Those suggestions include\n\u2022 Timely transfer of student records.\n\u2022 Checklist for student transfers.\n\u2022 Immediate new student orientation which includes a transition buddy.\n\u2022 Access to extracurricular programs.\n\u2022 Communication of variations in school calendars and schedules.\n\u2022 Staff professional development targeted toward mobile students.\n\u2022 Reciprocal graduation requirements for course substitutions, waivers, and testing.\nWithin schools administrators, counselors, and other school personnel can ease the transition for students who are anticipating a school change. Students can be counseled to remain in their schools if at all possible and helped to remain if they desire to stay. Schools can prepare in advance to accommodate students who are transferring. To smooth the transition for incoming students, procedures can be implemented which address the needs of new students on arrival. Since students who are mobile tend to have, on average, lower achievement than their more stable counterparts and many additional problems, the educational progress of highly mobile students should be monitored closely (Rumberger, 2002) . To ensure that mobile high school students will meet the different graduation requirements, they should be encouraged to earn the most possible credits in the most rigorous coursework available. Popp and colleagues (2003) have developed a comprehensive handbook for educators who are interested in better meeting the needs of their mobile students. Students on the Move: Reaching and Teaching Highly Mobile Children and Youth (Popp et al., 2003) is free and available in full text on the Education Resources Information Center database. This handbook, which is organized around case studies, addresses issues concerning different groups of students who move frequently. The handbook synthesizes research on various subpopulations of students who tend to be highly mobile, explores common characteristics and significant differences among these subgroups, and identifies strategies used to meet the needs of this diverse population of students. This handbook, which is designed for professional development use by educators, includes a PowerPoint presentation for staff development and recommended programs for schools who wish to better support mobile students. Through its Web site the MCEC provides a wealth of information and resources which can help to smooth the transitions of mobile students. A Checklist for Student Transfers includes procedures for both sending and receiving schools which will minimize disruptions in the education of mobile students. Chart Your Course Academic Passport, a booklet designed to help highly mobile students maneuver their way through the intricacies of secondary education and postsecondary choices, is a valuable resource for counselors, teachers, parents, and others who care about the education of highly mobile children. Chart Your Course Road Map, a poster based on extensive research, features a grades 6 to 12 map for academic planning for high school graduation and beyond. MCEC also has developed a Web-based Interactive Counseling Center which schools can subscribe to through the MCEC Web site. This video-conferencing system allows families and educational counselors to exchange information in real time between sending and receiving schools (MCEC, n.d.) .\nWith the many resources now readily available for schools to help mobile students with their transitions, schools can easily join networks and implement programs to accommodate a mobile student population. If educators wait for the national, state, or local levels of school governance to agree on common standards for mobile students, these students will continue to suffer. Although educators should work toward national standards that will ease transitions for mobile students, only immediate action at the school level will help mobile students now. Individual schools can join established coalitions and utilize the many resources available to them to put in place educational policies and programs which accommodate the special needs of mobile students. This will create a win-win situation in which both mobile students and their schools will reap the benefits. Mobile students will experience greater academic achievement, and the schools held accountable for their educational progress will share in their success."}]
