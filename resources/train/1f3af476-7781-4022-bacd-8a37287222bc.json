[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objective: Damage to the cerebral tissue structural connectivity associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which extends beyond the motor pathways, can be visualized by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The effective translation of DTI metrics as biomarker requires its application across multiple magnetic resonance imaging scanners and patient cohorts. A multi-centre study was undertaken to assess structural connectivity in ALS at a large sample size.\nMethods: Four-hundred-and-forty-two DTI data sets from patients with ALS (N=253) and controls (N=189) were collected for this retrospective study from eight international ALS-specialist international clinic sites. Equipment and DTI protocols varied across the centres. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps of the control subjects were used to establish correction matrices to pool data, and correction algorithms were applied to the FA maps of the control and ALS patient groups.\nResults: Analysis of data pooled from all centres using whole-brain-based statistical analysis of FA maps confirmed the most significant alterations in the corticospinal tracts, and captured additional significant white matter tract changes in the frontal lobe, brainstem and hippocampal regions of the ALS group that coincided with post mortem neuropathological stages. Stratification of the ALS group for disease severity (ALS functional rating scale) confirmed these findings.\nInterpretation: This large-scale study overcomes the challenges associated with processing and analysis of multi-platform, multi-centre DTI data, and effectively demonstrates the anatomical fingerprint patterns of changes in a DTI metric that reflect distinct ALS disease stages. This success paves the way for the use of DTI-based metrics as read-out in natural history, prognostic stratification and multi-site disease-modifying studies in ALS."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The use of advanced magnetic resonance imaging (M RI) techniques, in particular diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of white matter tracts, has greatly improved the understanding of the in vivo cerebral and spinal neuropathology of the adult neurodegenerative disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] DTI can quantify the integrity of large white matter tracts in vivo using metrics such as fractional anisotropy (FA). [6] A DTI-based in vivo imaging concept has also been applied to the recently introduced neuropathological staging system, indicating that ALS may disseminate in regional patterns. [7, 8] ALS overlaps with frontotemporal dementia both clinically and pathologically. While the majority of ALS patients do not develop a frank dementia, a large proportion show cognitive impairments on the same spectrum, and DTI has demonstrated extension of white matter changes into frontal and temporal lobes accordingly. [9, 10] Imaging biomarkers are urgently required for future pharmaceutical trials to be used as objective study end-points. The development of robust prognostic and diagnostic markers has become a major research priority in this notoriously heterogeneous disorder. [11, 12] Effective biomarkers, particularly those integrated in therapeutic studies, need to be applicable across multiple international centres that, in case of M RI, may vary in their scanner hardware and sequence acquisition parameters.\nThe Neuroimaging Society in ALS (www.nisals.org) was established in 2010 and developed a roadmap for the standardisation and harmonisation of advanced M RI data in ALS. [13] The most sensitive cerebral pathology found in cross-sectional M RI studies in ALS patients has been in the white matter tracts, [14] in contrast to the characteristic hippocampal atrophy that largely defines Alzheimer's Disease. To date, there have been few large-scale multi-site DTI studies, and none in ALS. Data analysis of such studies may be hampered by differences in scanning protocols, [15, 16] thus an approach to pool DTI data acquired with different protocols was sought. The objective was to identify ALS induced alterations in the white matter structural connectivity in a large scale patient cohort from multiple sites spread across the world.\nTo this end, a new strategy has been developed that paves the way to use the large numbers of DTI data sets from local data bases of different study sites for comprehensive large-scale multicentre imaging studies."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "S ubject populations and scanning protocols", "text": "Four-hundred-and-forty-two DTI data sets from patients with ALS (N=253) and control subjects (N=189) from eight ALS-specialist clinic sites (tertiary referral centres) were selected ex post facto for this retrospective study (Dublin, Ireland; Edinburgh, UK; Jena, Germany; M iami, USA; M ilano, Italy; Oxford, UK; Rostock, Germany; Ulm, Germany).

Furthermore, centrespecific sources of variability on DTI metrics, e.g. scanner specific variability, environmental noise, specific factors such as scanning time might be present in single centre studies but will only slightly influence comparisons at the group level.\n[240] Therefore, a strategy to regress out confounders in a two-step procedure was applied to controls' data.\nFirst, the covariates age, voxel size, TE, number of GD, and B0 were regressed out in FA maps of controls, and a corrected FA-map set consisting of FA maps of all controls was derived (Figure 1) .\nCorrections for asymmetrical voxel size were not performed as the orientation of the scans in different sites was not identical.

After regressing out these covariates, only small clusters of significancte correlation to the aforementioned covariates remained. The application of the correction matrices to FA maps of ALS patients also reduced the dependency on the covariates voxel size, age, number of GD, B0field strength, and TE (S upplementary Figure 1A, lower panel) .

WBSS of \"uncorrected\" FA-maps (approx. 140,000 m 3 ). AThe split-half stability test (splitting the eight centres to reach almost a split-half for ALS patients and controls) was performed, comparing the results clusters of centres 03, 04, 06, 07, 08 (128 ALS patients vs. 98 controls) and\nthe results clusters of centres 01, 02, 05 (125 ALS-patients vs. 91 controls), revealinged a similar number of difference cluster voxels for both groups (Figure 2C) . The split-half test as well as the whole group analysis showed basically the same brain regions to be affected (although with a different number of cluster voxels): Wwith respect to the tract specific analysis, [8] major significances were found along the corticospinal tracts (CST, corresponding to neuropathological stage 1 [7] ), including the \"horseshoe\" configuration (in coronal slicing) reflecting superior CST and transcallosal interconnecting fibres,[303] frontal involvement including areas crossed by the corticopontine and corticorubral tracts (neuropathological stage 2), and the corticostriatal pathway (pathological stage 3), pathways to brainstem (pontine/rubral involvement, pathological stage 2), and hippocampal areas including the proximal portion of the perforant path (pathological stage 4) ( Figure 43A) .\nWith the application of more lenient thresholding, a pattern resembling the neuropathological spreading could be demonstrated, beginning with highest significances (corrected p < 0.00005, N=23500) in the upper CST, followed by clusters along the CST (corrected p < 0.00015, N=46000), then including frontal areas (corrected p < 0.0015, N=83500), and, at lowest significances level at (corrected p < 0.005 (N=162200) also including brain stem as well as hippocampal areas ( Figure   43B ). This pattern could also be replicated by uncorrected data with a reduced number of significant results voxels, i.e. at corrected p < 0.00005: N=15300, at corrected p < 0.0005: N=34300, at corrected p < 0.005: N=61600, and at corrected p < 0.05: N=134600 (S upplementary Figure 3) .\nFollowing the theory of spreading patterns that could be expressed by ALS-stages [7, 8] , relations were investigated between the FA values and a clinical disability score, i.e. the ALS-FRS-R. For Common acquisition protocols but involving different subjects were investigated for groupwise FA differences between patients and controls on systematic between-centre differences.\n[374] During the pooling process, a number of well-defined parameters that confound the FA results could be regressed out. Nevertheless, to some extent, residual centre-specific FA-influencing factors might be identified. That way, matrices for regressing out FA-influencing factors could be applied in the identical manner to FA-maps of ALS-patients. The comparison between the analysis of corrected and the analysis of uncorrected data showed a difference of about 20% in the number of significant voxels. However, as in this study the ratio patients/controls was approximately equal between the centres, the correction effects were less prominent as it could be expected if the ratio patients/controls had differed more between the centres. Furthermore, this study shows that affectations could be observed at the multicentre level with high subject numbers that would not have been possible to show in single centre studies with low subject numbers.Furthermore, this study shows that at the multicentre level with high subject numbers affectations appeared that would not have been possible to show in single centre studies with low subject numbers.\nThis methodological framework could easily be adapted to further DTI metrics, e.g. radial, axial, or mean diffusivity.\nIn summary, this study has demonstrated that it is possible to meaningfully interpret combined DTI data from different M RI manufacturers and software platforms after application of appropriate compensations for centre-specific differences. This might pave the way to repurpose larger numbers of DTI data sets of ALS patients for more clinically comprehensive large-scale multicentric imaging studies.\nA limitation of this study compared to other multicentre studies of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g.\nthe PADDINGTON study in Huntington\u00b4s Disease or the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [4138, 4239] ) is the heterogeneous nature of DTI data resource in terms of magnetic field strength and acquisition sequence parameters used across the centres. It would be advantageous in a future prospective multi-site study to try to harmonise as many data acquisition sequence parameters as possible. A further potential limitation of the current approach is the limited number of control data sets per centre which may be not homogeneous over centres, and might lead to false or over-correction. However, N=20 (which is the case in seven out of the eight centres) has been a standard control sample size in single-centre studies.[330,403,414] As the ratio patients/controls did not differ strongly between different centres, a systematic centre difference would be averaged out in the multi-site group comparison.\nBy this multi-centre approach involving DTI datasets from more than 250 patients, it was possible to reveal the in vivo pathoanatomy of ALS non-invasively; the alteration pattern was found to be in agreement with post mortem neuroanatomical studies [3842, 425] represents a framework for mapping ALS-specific white matter tract alterations using DTI, and provides encouragement for its extension to other neurodegenerative diseases. In other diseases with emerging evidence of a consistent pathological pattern of spread,[4550] the white matter tract pathology will be closer to the underlying pathology than clusters of regional atrophy, and thus the DTI metrics have the potential to serve as read-outs and biomarkers of disease and its progression for future clinical trials."}]
