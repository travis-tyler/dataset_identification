[{"section_title": "", "text": "We use the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) to investigate lightning strike variations in eight years of category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones. A cross correlation analysis is performed between the lightning and maximum sustained wind variations, giving lag and lead times related to the peak linear correlation for each tropical cyclone. There is a moderate to strong correlation between lightning and wind variations. Using a lightning collection window of < 500 km, we confirm the general results of previous studies that lightning can be used on a \u223c1 day timescale to predict the evolution of the winds in tropical cyclones. Investigation of different lightning collection window sizes indicates the lightning lead times are highly dependent upon the window size. Smaller collection windows have modal lightning lead times of \u223c2.75 and 0 days, indicating that the lightning location inside the cyclone is as important as the total lightning variation. 1. Introduction"}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones is of great importance for communities where landfall might occur. The most likely future path of a tropical cyclone can be modeled [e.g., McAdie and Lawrence, 2000] with low error (160 nautical miles for the North Atlantic in 2000-2005). Improvements to these forecasts has meant that the lead-time for hurricane warnings issued by the National Hurricane Center increased from 3 days to 5 days in 2003, with the incorrectly modeled cyclones being monitored and tested [e.g., Brennan and Majumdar , 2011]. However, while the global forecasting models are successful at predicting the track of the cyclone, they are not as good at predicting the wind intensities [Rappaport et al., 2009;. Early studies on tropical cyclones gave no detail of their electrical activity [e.g., Simpson and Riehl , 1981], while later studies observe lightning activity mainly in the rainbands with occasional eyewall activity linked to supercell development [Lyons and Keen, 1994]. Lightning in the eyewall was later characterized as rare, requiring updrafts stronger than 10 ms \u22121 [Black and Hallett, 1999]. Willis et al. [1994] showed that a rapid electric field gradient is formed when the tropical cyclone exhibits strong vertical velocities with charge separation forming from the interaction of graupel and small ice particles. Recently researchers have been investigating the lightning within tropical cyclones in an attempt to better understand storm structure and the changes in wind intensity [e.g., Thomas et al., 2010;Fierro and Reisner , 2011;Reinhart et al., 2014] Abarca and Corbosiero [2011] showed that lightning flash density is higher when tropical cyclone wind speeds are increasing, leading to a study of rapid intensification changes by DeMaria et al. [2012], who concluded that lightning can be used to improve short term (24 hour) predictions of wind intensification. Our paper re-examines the study of Price, Mustafa and Yair [2009] and we aim to test the validity of their conclusions and extend their method to a much larger storm dataset. In this study we will henchforth refer to all high category tropical storms as tropical cyclones, regardless of their basin of origin and thus include hurricanes and typhoons."}, {"section_title": "Data sources", "text": "We are using data from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS v03r05), a World Meteorological Organization Tropical Cyclone Programme endorsed database for the wind, pressure and location of the tropical cyclones [Knapp et al., 2010]. We restrict our observations to those recorded by WMO endorsed stations. We use lightning data (version Reloc-B) from the ground based World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN). WWLLN is a global network consisting of over 65 detection stations using Very Low Frequency (3-30 kHz) receivers to detect lightning flashes using a to a category 4 classification with a lower limit of 81 kts). However, we note that the magnitude differences between Price and IBTrACS are not important in this study as the cross correlation procedure to determine peak lag and lead times involves subtracting the mean from each data set, centering the data around 0 regardless of its original magnitude. We begin, in a similar style to Price, with Hurricane Dennis. This tropical cyclone was tracked between 5-15 July 2005. To perform the running average we initially attempted using the average of 4 time bins (a 24 hour period), however an even number of bins requires an interpolated time value to be used. This interpolation was tested and did not X -7 reproduce the Price wind and pressure results. The number of bins was increased to 5 (a hour period), allowing use of whole time bins and correctly reproducing the wind and pressure variation. The wind and pressure variation in Hurricane Dennis is shown in panel a) of Figure 1. However, the lightning strike variation using the same 30 hour average approach produces different results from Price as shown in panel b) of Figure 2. We see a similar shape in the smoothed lightning activity with the second peak at approximately the same activity rate as Price. However, the initial lightning activity peak is lower than Figure 2c in Price and the third peak is much higher. We have attempted multiple dashed (median) lines. As a final test the three cyclones with statistical significance less than 90% are removed and the averages recalculated, giving little change to the mean lag (+24 hours) and providing a median lag of +24 hours. Smoothing the lag distribution data across 5 bins (30 hours, solid blue line) produces a distribution which looks closer to Price's Figure 3. We conclude that while there appear to be issues in the results presented by Price, their approach does indicate that there is a moderate to strong correlation between lightning and wind variations, with the lightning leading the wind by approximately 1 day. 3. Repeating the method for a larger subset of storms"}, {"section_title": "Identifying tropical cyclones", "text": "The Price analysis approach is now extended to a larger and longer tropical cyclone (1 to 4, 5(i), 5(ii) and 6) for tropical storms. These have been matched up to be consistent with those of other agencies in Table 1. For our larger cyclone dataset only category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones (equivalent to 5(ii) and 6 in the case of those with Indian Ocean basin of origin) will be included. The basin of origin is determined by the latitude and longitude of the first maximum sustained wind speed data point in the IBTrACS database for each cyclone. We find 144 tropical cyclones which can be classified as category 4 or 5 between January 2005 and February 2013 (\u223c20% of the tropical cyclone list for these dates). The initial position of the 144 tropical cyclones are shown in panel a) of Figure 2. The color of each start position represents the peak maximum sustained wind speed of the cyclone ranging from 85 to 160 kts. All 58 cyclones in the Price dataset passed the minimum sustained wind speeds to be classed as a category 4 or 5 tropical cyclone using the classifications in Table 1 and are included in this 8 year dataset."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of the 8 year tropical cyclone dataset", "text": "Panel b) of Figure 2 shows the 8 year dataset in a similar style to panel c) of Figure 1. The x -axis indicates the start date of the tropical cyclone instead of the name of the storm. "}, {"section_title": "Lightning strike collection window", "text": "To collect the 6 hour lightning strike totals, Price used a 10 \u2022 x 10 \u2022 square window. Up to now we also used the same window size and shape but now investigate a window more suited to the shape of a tropical cyclone. The 10 \u2022 x 10 \u2022 square is changed to a circular window with a radius set in km rather than degrees. At the equator 10 \u2022 is \u223c1100 km so we rerun the analysis on the 8 year dataset for radii ranging from 500 km down to 100 km in 100 km increments as well as a 50 km radius. A range of toroidal rings were also calculated. A comparison of the circular to square window is performed by investigating the 500 km radius circular window centered on the cyclone. As expected there are only small changes in the results between the 500 km radial and 10 \u2022 square window. The circular window giving both mean and median lags of 30 hours (in comparison to 29 and 30 hours from the square window) and the median linear correlation was 0.76. In Section 2.2 we described an initial condition limiting the cross correlation to +6 and -3 days to match the Price approach. We now remove this limitation for analysis of the individual circular lightning collection windows, the lag distribution smoothing (e.g., panel c of Figure 2) is also reduced to a more conservative 3 bin distance (18 hours). The cross correlation and linear correlation was performed for each cyclone and lightning radial distance window "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We find broadly similar results to Price when we extend their approach to a longer 8 year dataset of tropical cyclones. However, while the typical linear correlations give values in the range of 0.7 to 0.8, this does not necessarily indicate a true ability to match the evolving wind and lightning variation. Visual inspection of each of the 144 cyclones was performed to investigate the accuracy of the cross correlation procedure. We plotted: the lightning against winds in a similar style to panel b) of Figure 1, the lag times against cross correlation value, and the time shifted lightning data with wind data to determine the accuracy of the variation matching process. This inspection found 3 cyclones where the wind and lightning variation show no similarities and a further 8 instances of the cross correlation performing poorly, giving a failure rate of \u223c8%. The two sources of cross correlation failure were; double peaked winds with the lightning peak(s) linked to the wrong wind peak, and lightning data which had a sharp lightning strike gradient at the beginning or end of the data (an example is shown in the supplementary material). This large gradient in the 6 hour lightning strike total forced the cross correlation procedure to match poorly and resulted in lags > 84 hours and < -84 hours (3.5 days). In Section 3.3 we noted that a 300 km radius resulted in the best median linear correlation, shown in panel a) of Figure 3. While the mean and median lags show a value similar to that quoted by Price, the lags show a double peak distribution at +66 hours (2.75 days) and 0 hours, with these average values sitting between them. Taking the average provides little to no information in this specific case. We further investigate these peaks by looking at radial distances smaller than 300 km. Panel b) of Figure 3 shows the < 50 km radial distance which has only a single clear peak between 0 and +6 hours. Molinari et al. [1994], used a distance less than 40 km as corresponding to eyewall lightning in hurricane Andrew, while Zhang et al. [2012] determined lightning at < 60 km was eyewall lightning. We can therefore assume that our < 50 km radial window is providing correlations predominately for eyewall lightning. Molinari, Moore and Idone [1999] showed that lightning density lightning outbreaks are \"a signal that an intensification is coming to an end\", (i.e., the peak winds have been reached)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We have recreated the Price approach for a set of 58 tropical cyclones but were unable to duplicate the exact results that were found in this study. However, we confirmed their broad conclusions that lightning variability seems to be correlated to wind variability and that on average, the lightning variation leads the wind variation by \u223c1 day. The Price approach has been extended from the original 3 years of data to an 8 year dataset which returns broadly similar lag and correlation results when using a lightning collection window of 10 \u2022 square or of 500 km radius. The cross correlation matching between wind and lightning only has an \u223c8% failure rate. We have calculated both the 10 \u2022 x 10 \u2022 square lightning detection window, a radial distance in kilometers, and performed the lightning to wind cross correlation for a range of circular distances including toroidal rings. The highest correlations were found for the < 300 km radial window with a median linear correlation of 0.8. The calculated lag time for each tropical cyclone using this < 300 km collection window, shows a double peak distribution at 0 and +66 hours, at this smaller radius a median or mean lag is not appropriate. The eyewall lightning at distances < 50 km from the center of the storm provides only a single peak around a zero time lag. These results suggest that the predictive timescale of lightning is highly dependent upon which region of the cyclone is investigated. When using a spatially large lightning collection window our results agree with other studies of high category tropical cyclones [e.g., Price, Mustafa and Yair , 2009;DeMaria et al., 2012;Pan, Qie and Wang, 2014] of a \u223c1 day value. When we look at the region containing the eyewall we find a 0 day value, indicating that eyewall lightning cannot be used to predict the wind evolution. When we consider the < 300 km region (rainband and eyewall) we find a double peaked structure at \u223c3 days (agreeing with Pan, Qie and Wang [2014] for weak tropical cyclones) and 0 days. This 0 day lag is independent of the eyewall correlation peak, confirmed by the 150-300 km window showing the same double peak structure. Acknowledgments.
