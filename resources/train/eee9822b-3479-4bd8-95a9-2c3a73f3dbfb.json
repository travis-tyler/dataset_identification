[{"section_title": "", "text": "In the sixth annual State of American Education Address, former U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley announced that \"over the next ten years the nation will need to hire more than 2.2 million teachers, most new to the profession, and it is imperative that they be well trained for the challenges of the modern classroom\" (1999, p. 1). Accordingly, Riley called for the development of a \"coordinated infrastructure\" for addressing the challenges of preparing and deploying a new supply of qualified teachers who would enter professional practice in regions of the country where dire and often chronic shortages of teaching personnel exist. One critical factor in developing such a coordinated infrastructure is that of ensuring a sufficient supply of qualified teacher education faculty who will, in turn, prepare tomorrow's teachers. Whereas there has been considerable attention given to the shortage of K-12 teachers, there has been almost no attention to the pool of teacher educators. The authors' own school of education's (in a research university) recent experience in conducting faculty searches that resulted in many fewer applicants than in previous years suggests that education personnel shortages may extend beyond the K-12 classroom and into the professoriate itself. For example, a search for a language arts education position had to be reopened and still resulted in very few qualified candidates. In addition to a high demand for faculty in this field (a high number of positions) there was believed to be a shortage of qualified applicants relative to the number of positions available (a small number of qualified candidates). Another search for an elementary math educator yielded six applicants of whom two were interviewed, and a search for a secondary math educator produced no qualified candidates. The authors' experience is not unique for at least some curriculum areas within the teacher education labor market. Specifically, two recent studies of the faculty labor markets for special education and mathematics education highlight the mismatch between supply and demand (Reys, 2002;Smith, Pion, Tyler, Sindelar, & Rosenberg, 2001). Smith et al. (2001) conducted interviews with search committee chairs for special education searches. Results of the Smith study revealed that 30% of special education departments were unable to find candidates to fill tenure-line positions. Smith et al. noted that although the number of faculty openings remained relatively stable since 1992 the pool of applicants decreased from an average of 35 per position in 1988 to nearly half that, or an average of 19 per position, in 1998. Likewise, the number of successful searches was lower in 1998 than in 1988. Reys (2002) focused his research on mathematics education positions advertised between October 2000 and April 2001. One hundred and nineteen institutions, representing 134 positions, responded to Reys's survey. He obtained interesting data about the positions themselves (e.g., 80% indicated that research was essential for promotion and tenure and 51% of the positions were in mathematics departments) as well as information about the applicant pools and hiring success rates. The number of applicants per search ranged from 0 to 60, with 2 to 10 being a typical pool. The majority of applicants held a PhD in mathematics. The typical number of candidate interviews was 2. Of the 134 positions, 66 (49%) were not filled. Not surprisingly, one third of the hires were in comprehensive college and university mathematics departments and another third were in research university schools of education. Reys looked at whether an institution filled a position or not by institution type. Only doctoral and researchextensive universities filled more positions than not (25 hires to 21 no hires). In each of the other institutional types, more positions went unfilled than filled (e.g., at master's colleges, 29 positions were filled compared to 32 left unfilled). Another way to look at the supply of faculty is to examine the Survey of Earned Doctorates to ascertain the size of the potential pool. Research on the number of doctorates in education is mixed. Leatherman (2001) reported that the number of individuals earning doctorates in all fields dropped significantly in 1999. In fact, the drop was the second largest in the 40 years the survey data have been collected. Education was one of the areas that experienced the smallest decrease. However, although the number of doctorates in all fields increased again in 2000, the number of doctorates awarded in education fell to 6,420, the lowest number since 1991 and a decline of 3.5% (Farrell, 2001). These studies do not report how many of those who earn doctorates in education intend to pursue careers as teacher educators, which is one of the questions we address in this study. With a growing demand for teacher educators and a declining pool of doctorates, the question is: Will there be enough appropriately trained people to prepare future teachers in schools of education? Other factors impinge on the supply and demand for faculty in teacher education programs. Faculties in all fields are becoming more diverse as doctoral graduates from traditionally underrepresented groups enter the professoriate in larger numbers. Teacher education is no exception (National Center for Education Statistics, 2002;Smith et al., 2001;Tierney, 2001). This should result in a positive increase in the number of persons of color with doctorates available to seek faculty positions in the field of education. Another factor influencing the potential applicant pool is age. Smith et al. (2001) reported that, compared to their senior faculty counterparts, junior faculty in special education are older when starting and completing their doctorates, spend more money to complete their programs, and are less willing to relocate for faculty jobs at other universities. New doctoral recipients in education are older compared to doctoral graduates from other fields, which may serve as a disincentive for graduates to pursue tenure-track positions (Farrell, 2001). Thus, the potential education faculty pool may be limited although a large number of education doctorates are conferred (Survey of Earned Doctorates, 1991). The shrinking pool comes at the very time when large numbers of faculty will be retiring (Finkelstein, Seal, & Schuster, 1998). Furthermore, a booming economy during the past decade may have resulted in expanded career options for doctorate-level educators and may partially account for the fact that the pool of qualified teacher education faculty is shrinking (Smith et al., 2001). Simultaneously, institutions of higher education are restructuring faculty jobs and replacing full-time faculty with part-time, non-tenure track positions (Finkelstein et al., 1998;National Center for Education Statistics, 2002). Perhaps most significant is that institutional criteria for tenure and promotion are ratcheting up in research universities and some comprehensive colleges and universities, potentially clashing with state and national expectations for teacher educators (Finnegan, 1993). Ever-changing state licensure or certification standards and university promotion and tenure standards also pose a dilemma for hiring teacher educators. For example, attempting to hire individuals with doctorates and significant public school teaching experience may pose particular problems in certain fields. Likewise, research universities may find it difficult to balance increasing needs for traditional forms of research and publication with demands to offer more intensive teacher education programs. Consequently, one of our long-term goals in this project is to examine the relationship between institution type as a proxy for institutional expectations, required qualifications, and professional standards. All of these factors point to a potential crisis that is all the more critical given recent initiatives to prepare teachers in settings outside of higher education. Certainly, if institutions of higher education are unable to hire qualified teacher educators and assume the lead in preparation of teachers, others are waiting in the wings to take over such preparation. Attention to the labor market and employment conditions for teacher educators is long overdue."}, {"section_title": "PURPOSE", "text": "This specific research project focuses on recent hiring trends to assess the current demand for education faculty, the qualifications being sought, and adequacy of the supply of faculty for faculty positions in teacher preparation fields. It is guided by the following questions: In relation to demand This study is part of a larger project to assess the pipeline and working conditions for teacher educators and how these conditions have changed over time."}, {"section_title": "CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK", "text": "Various theories have been used to explain different aspects of faculty labor market behavior. As this is an exploratory study, we are not guided by one specific theory. Faculty recruiting, hiring, and departure occur in the context of a labor market that determines how and where positions get advertised and filled, with what kinds of people, and at what price. Burke (1988) identified several critical characteristics of the faculty labor market. These include (a) unique factors that influence a particular labor market (e.g., state standards), (b) the dominant culture of the institutions composing that market (e.g., research vs. liberal arts), (c) the effect that dominant culture has on defining the best faculty, (d) the nature and size of the applicant pool, (e) institutional policies and procedures that intervene in the labor market; and (f) at the heart of the academic labor market is the search-the process through which faculty members are recruited and selected into academic positions. We focus on searches because the search process is the critical process though which prospective faculty members are linked with jobs (Granovetter, 1974). Searches involve several important activities: origination or opening of a position, creation of a job description, recruiting and screening of applicant pools, and selection. Choice involves decisions by both the institution or department and the prospective faculty member. Through studying the various search stages and decisions, one learns much about what institutions value. Understanding how faculty replicate themselves is therefore critical to understanding institutions of higher education themselves. The most common and steadfastly held beliefs about the academic labor market in the United States have been dominated by the status or prestige system first described by Caplow and McGee (1958). In this view, colleges and universities, departments, and programs are aligned in a status hierarchy with research universities at the top, securing the best candidates, and teaching colleges at the bottom, employing less qualified faculty. Quality is determined by prestige factors such as status of the degree granting institution, recognition of a mentor, and so forth. An alternative, referred to as the contest model, presumes that all searches are open contests in which the winners are determined on the basis of achievement (Rosenbaum, 1979). The queuing or job competition model combines aspects of the prestige and the contest models (Youn, 1988). In this model, quality candidates (often determined by prestige factors) are matched with the highest quality institutions or departments, leaving the rest to be sorted among the lesser quality institutions. According to queuing or job competition theory, one would expect research universities to fill faculty positions more easily and with higher quality candidates than would regional comprehensive colleges or small, nonselective liberal arts colleges. These theories guide our exploration of the teacher education labor market by identifying sources of information and some context within which we can make sense of our findings."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH METHOD", "text": "To answer Questions 1 and 2, and to develop a sample population for Question 3, we identified all advertisements for teacher education positions, excluding health education, listed in the Chronicle of Higher Education between August 1, 2001, and May 31, 2002. While we counted all positions, particular attention was paid to positions listed as assistant and assistant/associate professorships. Once we identified positions, we created a database consisting of institutional name, field or discipline, and the educational level (elementary education, middle school education, secondary education, early childhood education, and K-12). We conducted a content analysis of required and preferred qualifications for each advertisement. Using fall 2000 data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, institutional characteristics including Carnegie Classification (research-intensive universities, research-extensive universities, master's colleges and universities, baccalaureate colleges, and other), institutional control (public or independent), and highest degree granted were merged with the position database. To answer Question 3, we used two data sources. First, we analyzed data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates, which collects data from all individuals who earned doctorates from a graduate school in the United States. 1 The Survey of Earned Doctorates is administered through the National Research Council and enjoys nearly a 100% response rate. The National Research Council granted us permission to use data pertaining to education doctoral recipients (both EdD and PhD) from 1990 through 2000. The data we received includes information on degree focus and pregraduation and postgraduation plans. It was necessary to interpret the data we reported from the Survey of Earned Doctorates with care. When completing the Survey of Earned Doctorates, students may or may not choose a major that is the \"official\" major indicated by the granting university. For example, our own university only offers a doctoral degree in curriculum and instruction. However, students whose focus is mathematics education may choose to indicate that their doctorate is in mathematics education even if the official degree is curriculum and instruction. The second source of data on demand comes from a 27-item survey that we developed and sent to search chairs or an institutional contact for each search listed in the Chronicle of Higher Education in the 2001-2002 academic year. The survey asked questions about the position being filled, the qualifications sought and which qualifications were most important in evaluation of candidates, the applicant pool and individual selected, and the position of the individual filling out the survey. Appropriate descriptive statistics as well as chi-square contingency table analyses were used to answer all three research questions. Based on the population of 1,027 advertisements, we were able to find e-mail addresses for 593 search committee chairs. Of those, we received 111 surveys back for a response rate of 19%. Such response rates are typical of Web-based surveys (Manfreda & Vehovar, 2003) but we felt it necessary to compare the responders with the nonresponders based on institutional type to determine the extent to which our sample was representative of the larger population. We determined that 52% of the advertisements in the Chronicle were from master's granting institutions, and 53% of our survey respondents were from these types of institutions. Furthermore, doctoral research universities (intensive and extensive) account for 33% of the advertisements and they account for 30% of our sample. Despite the response rate, the relative representativeness of the sample enhances the validity of our findings."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "There are several limitations to this study that are worth mentioning at the outset. First, we counted only advertisements listed in the Chronicle of Higher Education. As a result, this study will underrepresent the number of positions in any area that advertises in venues other than the Chronicle. For example, institutions seeking faculty in bilingual education may advertise in the Modern Languages Association newsletter rather than in the Chronicle. Also, it is important to note that we recorded the positions as they were listed in the advertisement. If an institution listed a position for teacher education, then we counted it in the curriculum and instruction or general teacher education category. Furthermore, in some cases the advertisement did not specify a grade-level focus but other advertisements specified that the focus was K-12. In both of these cases, the advertisements were listed as having a K-12 emphasis. In some cases, we lumped subfields together to run statistical analyses. Where we have done so, we identify the areas making up the categories. Where we found no statistically significant differences we have included only descriptive data by as fine a distinction among subfields as possible. The low response rate for the survey is a potential problem and can be attributed to the time between the initial employment search and the date the contacted received the survey. Furthermore, the manner in which individual institutions coordinate search processes complicated the survey procedure. Some institutions may have listed a department chair as contact and other institutions may have listed the institution's human resource offices or other identified administrative offices as the contact. Another problem was that the search chair might have left the institution. Thus, the data collected may not necessarily be representative of the total population but it does provide some interesting insight into the current state of the academic labor market in teacher education."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Demand", "text": "Review of all teacher education advertisements placed in the Chronicle of Higher Education between August 1, 2001, and May 31, 2002, excluding health education, produced a sample of 1,233 positions. Based on our interest in the assistant and assistant/associate positions, the sample size was reduced to N = 1,039. Table 1 reports the frequencies and percentages associated with the sample of advertised position by field sought. As Table 1 illustrates, many of the advertisements did not specify a particular content area within teacher education (34.5%). Special education searches were the next most common (23%) followed by reading education (12%). Table 2 reports the frequencies and percentages on the grade-level focus of the positions. Approximately 48% of the positions were listed as the K-12 level and 22% as elementary education. The remaining positions were relatively evenly distributed across secondary education (9%), early childhood (12%), and middle school (9%). Table 3 represents the frequencies and percentages related to the types of institutions advertising positions. Institutional type was defined using the current Carnegie classification system. Based on analysis of the advertisements, 52% of the positions offered were at master's colleges and universities (n = 545). The combination of doctorate research extensive (n = 128) and doctorate research intensive (n = 210) institutions account for 33% of all advertised positions. This is potentially due to the size and breadth of the educational training programs at these institutions and the number of full-time students enrolled in these programs. Required and preferred qualifications. We analyzed each position advertisement for required and preferred qualifications. These qualifications are represented in Table 4 and Table 5. For analysis purposes, preferred qualifications were defined as including the required plus the preferred qualifications. The most frequently listed required characteristic was a terminal degree (84%), which was followed by public school teaching experience (65%) and research and publication experience (25%). The criteria listed in the advertisements and on our tables are fairly self-explanatory except for \"acceptance of institutional belief,\" which basically translates into institutions requesting that applicants agree to the specific mission requirements of the institution-this was most typical at religiously based institutions. Table 5 reports both the preferred and required qualifications together. The pattern established for required characteristics holds when looking at both required and preferred together. Specifically, terminal degree was the most commonly required and preferred qualification (93.4%), followed by public teaching experience (70%), research and publication experience (31%), and  higher education teaching experience (25%). Experience with instructional technology (19%) and diversity (18%) were also quite important as preferred qualifications. Looking at differences between required and preferred traits by teacher education discipline yielded no significant differences. As demonstrated in Table 6, there were, however, some significant differences in required characteristics by grade-level emphasis (the plus signs indicate a significant difference, the minus signs indicate no difference). Specifically, diversity experience is more likely to be required in K-12 and elementary positions than at other levels. Public school teaching experience and teaching certification are more likely to be required by positions in PreK, elementary, and middle school levels. Table 7 demonstrates that diversity experience is most likely to be a required or preferred characteristic for positions in middle and secondary level teacher educator positions. Table 8 demonstrates significant relationships between institutional type (Carnegie classification) and required characteristics of teacher educators. Not surprisingly, research intensive and extensive institutions are more likely to require research experience and higher education teaching experience than are other institutional types. Research intensive institutions are the most likely to require evidence of grantsmanship. Master's colleges and universities and bachelor's colleges were most likely to require applicants to agree to accept the institutional culture and surprisingly were also more likely to require that applicants have a set research agenda. Table 9 looks at both required and preferred characteristics by Carnegie classification. These results demonstrate that bachelor's institutions are the most likely to prefer diversity experience. Master's-and bachelor's-granting institutions are most likely to prefer public teaching experience and acceptance of institutional culture. Higher education teaching experience and having a set research agenda were more likely to be preferred by research intensive and extensive institutions than by other institutional types.  "}, {"section_title": "Supply", "text": "To assess supply of teacher educators, we used the Survey of Earned Doctorate database as well as responses to our survey. The Survey of Earned Doctorates provides a comprehensive picture of the number, fields, and work plans of individuals earning doctorates in education. In Table 10 we report the number of education doctorates by subfield. These figures are based on self-report data. A graduate might have checked that he or she earned a doctorate in science education when the actual degree code might have been curriculum and instruction. Thus, some caution must be used in interpreting the data. Nevertheless, these are the best, most comprehensive, national data available on education doctorates. As Table 10 shows, the number of doctorates in certain education fields has increased (foundations, social science education, and reading) while production in most areas, including general curriculum and instruction, has decreased. Doctoral production is, however, only one piece of the supply puzzle. Table 11 shows the numbers and percentages of doctoral recipients who intend to work as faculty members in higher education. So, for example, although 259 individuals received doctorates in special education in 2000, fewer than half (105) intended to seek a higher education faculty job. This dramatic drop-off is seen in almost every discipline. When examining the academic labor market for teacher educators, it is important to note that many doctoral students in education work as faculty while earning their degrees. Table 12 reports the numbers and percentages of individuals who were employed full-time as college or university faculty during the year immediately preceding the award of their degree. The general pattern shown in Table 12 is that about one third to one half of the number seeking positions in higher education after earning a doctorate had positions as faculty in higher education while they were engaged in their doctoral work. Not surprisingly, those who work as faculty members in higher education while in graduate school are those most likely to want to continue working as faculty (34%). The next most likely group to pursue faculty positions consists of those who worked as graduate research or teaching assistants (21%) followed by those who held part-time positions in an unspecified field (13%). Obviously, these experiences provide positive socialization for those seeking the professoriate. Other predoctoral  career experiences, such as working as a teacher or administrator in a K-12 setting, seem to inhibit individuals from seeking faculty positions. Looking at the data from a different angle, 84% of individuals who worked in the K-12 setting (either as teachers or administrators) prior to completing their doctoral degrees desire to continue working in the K-12 sector. Such findings do not bode well for increasing the supply of qualified teacher educators. Data from our survey provide further information about the supply and demand of teacher education faculty. We received a total of 111 surveys, of which 107 dealt with positions ranked as assistant/associate professorships. Responses indicate that there is a shortage of qualified applicants for teacher education faculty positions. For example, when questioned about the number of applicants for the advertised positions, the range was quite disparate, between 1 and 130, with a mode of 12 and a mean of 17. The three institutions that garnered more than 100 applicants were all very prestigious academic institutions and posted advertisements seeking very general characteristics (i.e., they were seeking generalists in teacher  education with interest in all grade levels). These institutions were clearly outliers. The number of applicants considered to have met the required qualifications posted in the position announcements ranged from 0 to 60, with a mode of 3 and a mean of 7. The largest number of applicants interviewed was 8, with a mode of 3. A total of 67 of the survey respondents reported that they had filled the position, although 45 of these did not provide further information regarding the person hired. Of the 22 who provided data about the individual hired, 17 indicated that they filled the position with their first-choice applicant. When asked to rank the quality of the applicant pool on a scale of 1 to 6, with 6 indicating exceptional, the mean rating was 3.5 (between fair and good). When asked to rate the finalists on the same scale, the mean rating was a 2.4 (between marginal and fair). Clearly, those who completed the survey were distressed not only by the number of applicants but by the quality of the applicant and finalist pool. Study participants were asked to describe the current academic labor market for teacher education faculty in general and in their subfield in particular. Comments were overwhelmingly negative. The fields of special education, reading, mathematics, science, early childhood education, and elementary education were highlighted by respondents as experiencing particularly grave shortages of qualified faculty members. Respondents reported experiencing difficulties in finding qualified applicants with present conditions being described as \"a very tight market,\" \"abysmal,\" and \"in grave trouble.\" The most common factor mentioned as possibly contributing to the \"downward trend\" was salary levels that are low when compared to those in public schools. Comments were uniform across respondents. As one respondent stated, We typically have difficulty getting a significant number of candidates with exceptional or very good qualifications. We closed our search this year due to budget cuts, but also due to lack of high quality candidates in elementary education. We typically \"make it fit,\" with fairly good results. In the sub-field of middle level education generalist, we have had NO candidates with middle level generalist as their area of \"specialization.\" The candidates are typically Educational Leadership or Literacy Education majors . . . even a work experience/area of interest in one of these categories is the best we can usually find."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We draw several conclusions about the demand and supply for teacher educators from this study. It appears that teacher education programs face personnel shortages as serious as those in K-12 education. Moreover, because national and state accreditation policies (e.g. Education, 2002) prompt teacher education programs to hire faculty with K-12 teaching experience, shortages in teacher education are apt to be linked to those in K-12 education and will, in turn, reduce the nation's capacity for producing new teachers. More than 1,000 teacher education positions were listed in the Chronicle of Higher Education during the 2001-2002 academic year. The largest percentage of these positions was in special education and curriculum and instruction or general teacher education areas. The majority of the positions were for K-12 positions although 224, or about one fifth of the total 1,039 positions, were for elementary teacher educators. As expected, about half the positions were in comprehensive colleges and universities, one fifth were in research-intensive institutions, and approximately 25% were split between baccalaureate and research-extensive institutions. To the extent that master's and comprehensive colleges and universities train a large percentage of this nation's teachers, a shortage is likely to affect these institutions particularly hard."}, {"section_title": "National Council for Accreditation of Teacher", "text": "We noted a couple of interesting things about required and preferred qualifications. Nearly all institutions either required or prefered the terminal degree, which is interesting in light of the fact that a relatively high number of doctoral recipients held faculty positions while working on their doctoral degrees. Approximately two thirds of the positions required elementary or secondary school teaching experience. It is perhaps surprising that approximately one third of all searches did not require K-12 teaching experience. Although there were no significant differences between disciplines on this required qualification, there were significant differences when grade level was considered. Positions advertised as general K-12 were less likely to expect public school teaching experience or certification than were positions at the other grade levels. Most notable are differences by institutional type. As expected, research universities are more likely to require research experience and higher education teaching experience. Only research intensive universities are more likely than expected to require grant activity. Perhaps the overall conclusion is that only two characteristics are sought by the majority of searching institutions: the terminal degree and K-12 teaching experience. This holds even when the preferred qualifications are added. This suggests that, as labor market specialists argue, when demand exceeds supply some aspect of the labor market will adjust (Youn, 1988). One adjustment hiring institutions can make is lowering or widening required qualifications to attract the widest possible pool. A second adjustment involves raising salaries to the point that will make the academic profession more desirable. It does appear that institutions are taking a somewhat broader approach in their searches. We do not know about salaries and hope to learn more about that through future research. Calculating the supply of teacher educators is complicated. The data we report here suggest that the supply is not adequate even if we assume that everyone who earns a doctorate in a relevant field is deemed qualified. The best way to think through the supply issue is to use a couple of examples. Before doing so it is important to note that in 2000 1,296 individuals reported earning doctorates in curriculum and instruction. This is a catch-all category that includes generalist positions. Because the Survey of Earned Doctorates relies on self-report information about degree, individuals may concentrate on reading but report the actual degree is in curriculum and instruction. Conversely, the actual degree may be in curriculum and instruction but the graduate may report a degree in reading. There is also not a one-to-one correlation between advertisements and doctorates produced because the advertisements are from the 2001-2002 academic year and the last year from which we have earned doctorate information is 2000. As such, for the sake of this discussion we are assuming that doctoral production in 2000 was similar in 2002. Using reading as an example, we identified 129 reading positions advertised at the assistant or assistant/associate level. In 2000, 89 doctorates in reading were produced. Of these, 39 indicated an interest in pursuing faculty jobs in higher education and 16 reported holding a higher education faculty position before they got their degree. Given these figures, we could anticipate at best that approximately 90 positions would go unfilled. Of course, there would likely be some movement between institutions of people already in the system and surely some of the 480 general curriculum and instruction graduates were qualified to teach reading, but we do not know how many. In the next phase of this study we will use the National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty to assess movement of education faculty across institutions. Special education illustrates the situation a bit more clearly. In 2002-2003, 257 special education positions were advertised, and 259 doctorates were granted in 2000. Of those, 105 were seeking higher education faculty positions and 37 already held higher education faculty positions while working on their doctorates. This leaves 115 positions to be filled by mobility or to go unfilled. Of course, mobility within the system will create other vacancies. Thus, the shortage would appear to be even greater in special education. If we do this same calculation for fields such as mathematics education, we actually find a sufficient number of individuals earning doctorates seeking or holding higher education faculty positions to meet the advertised demand of 71 positions-just barely. However, in social studies only 11 of the 40 doctoral recipients targeted higher education teaching as a career. Again, in mathematics and social studies, we can assume that some of those who reported general curriculum and instruction degrees are qualified to teach mathematics education and social studies education. Interestingly, foundations is one area in which the supply exceeds the demand, suggesting that it will continue to be difficult for foundations graduates to obtain faculty positions. Results from our survey confirm our hypotheses that teacher education programs face small applicant pools, that they are often unable to hire their first choice, and that search committees are unhappy with the quality of the applicant pool. One respondent from the survey explained that the quality of teacher education faculty candidates varies. Most are generalist. Those who transfer from other universities seem to be more qualified [than do those with no higher education experience]; however, if they did not receive tenure at their prior institution, they are weak candidates. The respondent continued to explain that applicants with expertise in the content area often lack pedagogy courses and experience in K-12 teaching and that individuals with the pedagogical experience often are weaker in the content area. The conclusion to be drawn from these responses is that finding individuals with both areas of expertise is difficult."}, {"section_title": "IMPLICATIONS", "text": "The implications for individuals seeking faculty positions are clear: This is a good time for teacher educators to be looking for positions except in foundations of education. Required qualifications do vary somewhat by institution type and level but they do so in predicted ways. It is surprising that diversity and technology experience are not required by the majority of institutions but, again, with such a shortage of qualified individuals, institutions cannot afford to be too restrictive when they identify required and preferred qualifications. There are several implications for institutions of higher education. First, although doctoral programs in curriculum and instruction or the teacher education disciplines may be conflicted about not wanting to entice highly qualified graduate students away from the public schools, they will have to do so if they want to be able to hire qualified teacher educators. That is, they have to be more proactive in encouraging individuals to choose higher education as a career and then mentor them to have the experiences and qualifications necessary to succeed as academics. Second, search committees may have to rethink their requirements to obtain adequate pools of candidates who are qualified to work in the specific institutional setting. For example, can research universities continue to require K-12 teaching experience for their teacher education faculty? Third, institutions may have to increase salaries to be competitive with the types of jobs individuals with doctorates can hold in the public schools. Many of the respondents to the survey indicated that K-12 teaching and administrative salaries are such that individuals have to \"take a HUGE pay cut to come to us and they often have better benefits in teaching.\" Salary is not the only disincentive to pursuing an academic career over remaining in the public school system. Doctoral degree holders in education may be wary of the stress of the tenure clock, the requirement to be mobile to find a position, and the requirement to conduct research (at some institution types). These may be factors that persuade individuals with doctorates in education to pursue other career options. These disincentives suggest implications for the field as a whole. These barriers are exacerbated by the fact that doctoral recipients in education tend to be older than are graduates in other fields and thus are often less mobile, less willing to begin a new career, and less able to accept decreases in their standard of living. If the situation does not change (the demand diminish or the supply increase), teacher education programs may be forced to rethink how and who trains teachers and in what settings. They may need to rethink the qualifications that are necessary for effective teacher educators and how higher education institutions balance institutional faculty performance demands with those qualifications. In examining this issue, we see parallels between schools of education and other professional schools such as in dentistry, veterinary medicine, and so forth, all of which have trouble attracting and retaining qualified faculty. Faculty members at professional schools face a dilemma because there is a potential mismatch between the demands of the field and the expectations of the college or university. Some of the questions that may need to be addressed include the following: Does everyone who is a faculty member in a professional school need to publish and conduct research? Would a clinical model of preparation respond more to the needs of the field and, if so, how does one balance that with university requirements without making clinical faculty feel like second-class citizens? If, in fact, it is the responsibility of universities to prepare future educators and that such preparation is best provided by faculty with terminal degrees who have K-12 teaching experience, then schools have an obligation to actively engage in recruiting doctoral students into the field and providing them with the skills to be successful in the institutions within which they will work. Based on what we know about labor markets, it is likely that faculty positions in teacher education will be filled although those holding the positions might not be qualified based on accepted standards. For example, one respondent to our survey suggested that his institution's response to the shortage of faculty was to hire retired public school teachers who do not possess doctoral degrees. Another market option is that part-time faculty may gradually replace full-time positions. Our argument here is that if the field does not purposefully respond to the potential shortage of teacher educators, it may find itself changing in unpredictable, unplanned, and maybe undesirable ways. The shortage of teacher education faculty could have serious ramifications for the capacity of colleges and universities to produce teachers. And as Tierney (2001) has argued, if colleges and universities cannot meet the demand for qualified teachers, others will step in to do so. In spite of the potential urgency of this phenomenon, an ERIC search reveals no research on personnel supply and demand for teacher education faculty that spans curricular content areas. The study reported here is a first step at providing a base of information that can be used to better plan for recruitment, support, and preparation of doctoral students for teacher education roles."}, {"section_title": "NOTE", "text": "1.
