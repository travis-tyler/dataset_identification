In addition, few studies report a significant volume reduction in the cholinergic nuclei of the basal forebrain in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients. 3, 4 These gray matter changes are closely associated with the clinical presentation of AD dementia. 5, 6 However, in vivo white matter changes in these brain region tracts have been less extensively characterized. 6, 7 There is increasing evidence that white matter pathology plays an important role in the development of AD dementia."}, {"section_title": "8Y10", "text": "Because gray matter atrophy and white matter changes are typically found together radiographically in AD dementia, it has been suggested that white matter damage may secondarily result from neuronal loss. 11 In addition, white matter lesions are found independently from atrophic gray matter regions in patients with MCI and AD. This indicates that neurodegeneration may begin in axons and dendrites. 11Y14 Given these findings, it is important to explore the role of white matter lesions in the pathogenesis of AD.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has proven to be a powerful tool to investigate the microstructural integrity of white matter. 15 Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) are 2 measures of DTI that detect summative directional and random diffusion of water molecules in brain tissue. Component analysis of the diffusion tensor parallel to (axial diffusivity, AxD) and perpendicular to (radial diffusivity, RD) the principal diffusion direction provides more detailed information about white matter tract microstructure. 16 Decreased FA, increased AxD, and increased RD have been reported in selected brain regions in patients with MCI and AD.\n6,16Y19 However, global microstructural changes of white matter are still under investigation in these patients. 20 Studying the process of white matter disruption in MCI and probable mild AD due to AD pathophysiology will increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying patients' clinical symptoms as they progress from MCI to AD dementia.\nIn this study, we investigated how whole-brain white matter microstructural integrity differs among normal controls (NCs) and MCI and AD patients by comparing global FA, AxD, and RD measurements reported in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We compared the regional FA, AxD, and RD of 52 tracts of NCs with those of the MCI group and with those of the AD group. On the basis of these comparative analyses, we formulated conclusions about the radiographic manifestation of clinical progression from MCI to mild AD dementia, as a probable evolution of DTI findings from decreased regional microstructural integrity in specific white matter tracts to globally reduced microstructural integrity.\nTo our knowledge, this study is the largest sample size to date of DTI investigations of MCI and AD dementia. Our study confirms previously described anatomic locations of cerebral white matter abnormalities in MCI and AD dementia. Furthermore, our study extends previous in vivo findings of cholinergic tract abnormalities in MCI and mild AD dementia by demonstrating DTI abnormalities of the external capsule, through which the lateral cholinergic pathway travels. Accumulating evidence of disrupted cholinergic pathway white matter tracts in MCI may provide a rational basis for the use of cholinesterase inhibitor therapy in the MCI stage of AD."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI Study", "text": "Data used in this study were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

We did not find a significant decrease in global FA in MCI patients compared with NCs, consistent with previous findings. 20 With regard to diffusivity, increased global RD and global AxD were readily found in MCI patients compared with controls in our study. One possible explanation is that FA is a less sensitive method for the detection of early AD pathology, as reported by other studies. 17, 22 However, our results can also be interpreted as clinically meaningful. The reduced global FA of white matter in AD dementia patients may be the radiographic representation of dementia. In line with this interpretation, a significant correlation between measures of white matter abnormality and dementia severity has been reported by others. Our results, along with those of other investigators, suggest that it may be possible to use quantitative radiographic measures of white matter destruction as surrogate markers for monitoring the clinical progression of AD. 33, 34 In this study, we also investigated DTI measures of specific white matter tracts in AD dementia and MCI. Our study extends previous in vivo findings of cholinergic tract white matter abnormalities in MCI and AD dementia.\n3,4,35Y38 To our knowledge, this is the first report of increased RD and AxD in the external capsule in MCI and AD dementia patients. The external capsule and uncinate fasciculus comprise the capsular division of the lateral cholinergic pathway. The capsular division of the lateral cholinergic pathway innervates frontal, parietal, and temporal neocortices. 39 The finding of damage in the lateral cholinergic pathway in MCI and AD dementia is consistent with AD pathology, given that degeneration of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain is a distinctive neuropathological feature of AD.\nEvidence of damage to the cholinergic pathway in MCI patients is supportive of early medical intervention with cholinesterase inhibitors in the MCI stage of AD in clinical practice. In Likitjaroen and colleagues' 40 longitudinal randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study of AD patients treated with the cholinesterase inhibitor galantamine, increased FA was found in AD dementia patients after 6 months of treatment with galantamine. In contrast, the AD dementia patients who received placebo had decreased FA in the posterior part of corpus callosum at the 6-month point of the study. 41 Such findings suggest that DTI measurements such as RD and AxD could potentially be used to monitor AD patients' response to treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors.\nCongruent with previously published studies, in the MCI patients, we found decreased FA, increased RD, and increased AxD in association fibers and commissural fibers involving the corpus callosum, hippocampus, and amygdala. White matter tracts associated with the hippocampus and the amygdala form part of the Papez circuit, 42, 43 and damage to the Papez circuit is known to be linked to episodic memory impairment. 44 Therefore, the in vivo radiographic finding of reduced FA and increased diffusivity in specific white matter tracts associated with the Papez circuit is consistent with the clinical presentation of MCI due to the AD pathophysiologic process.\nIn addition, our finding of reduced FA and increased diffusivity in the splenium of the corpus callosum in MCI patients is consistent with the postulation that the pathophysiological process of AD is partially a disconnection syndrome. 45 In AD dementia patients, we found widespread reduced FA and increased diffusivity, indicating a general disruption of connectivity not seen in the MCI patients. Disconnection of neuroanatomic structures due to damaged white matter tracts may be one of the mechanisms underlying the clinical presentation of the initial stage of AD. In this study, we observed the following pattern of damaged white matter tracts in AD: (1) in both the MCI and AD dementia patients, when the damage to white matter tracts is unilateral, the damaged tracts are more often in the left hemisphere than in the right. Of relevance to this finding, Thompson and colleagues 47 demonstrated that gray matter loss in AD is more prominent in the left hemisphere than in the right. (2) Damaged white matter tracts are limited primarily to the limbic region in the MCI patients, in contrast to the AD dementia patients, in whom damaged white matter tracts extend from the limbic region to the thalamic and cortical regions, consistent with the results of other published studies.\n19 (3) In the MCI patients, damaged white matter tracts are found primarily in posterior brain regions, whereas in the AD dementia patients, they are also found in the anterior and lateral brain regions. (4) Regarding fiber classification, association fibers and commissural fibers are damaged in the MCI patients, whereas in the AD dementia patients, there are also abnormalities in some projection fibers. All together, this anatomic pattern of white matter changes measured by FA and directional diffusivity may represent a temporal clinical progression from predementia to dementia in AD. 48, 49 The limitations of our study include the following. First, because this is a cross-sectional study, we are not able to use DTI to elucidate dynamic changes in AD progression, and the role of DTI in predicting disease evolution remains unknown. Second, in this study, we do not have data showing the relationship between white matter and gray matter in cerebral regions affected in AD. Further study of the relationship between white matter and gray matter changes could provide insights into the mechanisms of neurodegeneration underlying clinical manifestations of the AD pathophysiologic process. Understanding the role of damaged white matter in the development of AD clinically and pathophysiologically may lead to the identification of new targets for treatment."}]
