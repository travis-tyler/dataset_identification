[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract. We present a software toolbox that allows the efficient collection, management and maintenance of larger paleoceanographic data sets. The program combines a graphical user interface (GUI) with a simple document-based database and functionality for visualization, stratigraphy (visual alignment and radiocarbon calibration), age modelling and efficient ensemble time series generation to create larger homogenous data compilations. Data can be imported from Excel or text files, 10 are stored locally in netCDF format and can be easily exchanged between collaborating scientists. Within a data collection, data can either be imported to proxy-specific sub-collections or to a multi-proxy (\"miscellaneous\") sub-collection that allows to import and manage any downcore data. A single age model is shared among all proxies of a core within a collection. The stand-alone software can be used with Windows and macOS and does not require web access.\nPaleoenvironmental data provide valuable information on climate variability and the functioning of the Earth System on timescales not covered by instrumental data. Information on past climates is usually based on proxy data, parameters like stable isotope or elemental ratios of organism remains or sedimentary components that can be translated into climate variables via transfer functions (i.e. Wefer et al. 1999) . Proxies are usually measured on samples taken from stratified climate archives (e.g. marine sediments) that allow to derive a time scale through radiometric dating or other stratigraphic methods. Meanwhile 20 proxy data are available in large quantities and with considerable coverage in time and space which allows a detailed spatiotemporal investigation of paleoclimate evolution and variability. When compiled into homogenous and consistent data products with error estimates, paleoclimate data can provide useful information to benchmark climate model experiments."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "data base. Furthermore, compilations of paleoceanographic data are often somewhat intransparent and difficult to assess with respect to the quality, resolution and stratigraphic integrity of the included records. Here we provide an overview on the free open-access and cross-platform software tool PaleoDataView (PDV) that allows the efficient collection, homogenization and visualization of marine proxy data. Our primary intention is to support a workflow that allows the creation of continuously updatable and transparent data products, comparable to software (i.e. Ocean Data View, Schlitzer, 2019) or atlas products (i.e. 5 Levitus, 1982) in oceanography."}, {"section_title": "Description", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Software architecture", "text": "The program code has been developed in C++ computer language using the Qt Framework (http://www.qt.io/). This integrated development environment allows cross-platform development for Windows and macOS operating systems. A Linux version 10 would in principle be possible, but has not yet been compiled. PDV works with a document-oriented database. After import, data are locally stored in binary form as netCDF files (Rew and Davies, 1990) using the netCDF C++ library (https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/). This format is machine-independent and self-describing and allows the storage of meta-data. The use of a binary format is necessary to allow the fast reading/writing of data and the efficient storage of large amounts of data, i.e. the age ensembles resulting from Bayesian age-depth modelling. Data can be imported from 15 specifically formatted Excel (*.xlsx) or text files (Figure 1 ). For each imported record, two types of files are created: A file with the proxy data vs. depth and a file with the stratigraphic/age model data. PDV connects the two file types via the core name. An identical core name for the age model and the proxy file is guaranteed when simultaneously imported from Excel templates, but has to be ensured when files are added manually. Several proxy records can exist for the same core, but only one age/age model file. Hence, when the age model is changed, it changes for all proxy records connected to the age file. To 20 allow fast access to all data in the database (i.e. for plotting purposes), an inventory file containing the meta data of all records in the database is generated/updated at program start or when the proxy type is changed. Since all meta data are stored within the file header, netCDF files generated with PDV can also be added manually to the appropriate folder (i.e. when exchanged between collaborating scientists) and will be added to the inventory when the program is restarted. PDV comes with an installer that extracts the necessary resources to the appropriate folder on your hard disc, including a set of published proxy data for 25 testing purposes (see references and data sources in the data files). The source code of PDV is available under a GNU General Public License, Version 3 and can be unpacked during the installation process. The size of downloadable installers is ~120 MB and the installation of PDV requires about 1GB of free disk space, most of which is required for data resources (i.e. temperature and salinity fields from the World Ocean Atlas).\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2019-59 Preprint.

These include\n\u2022 the creation of multiple data collections. It is possible to create independent collections and to change between collections/proxy types when using PDV,\n\u2022 the import and export from/to specifically formatted Excel and text files. Proxy-specific template files are provided 5 with the distribution. Imported data are saved in netCDF files. These files can be exchanged between PDV users and included into other collections (also on other computers with PDV installed) by deploying copies in the respective folder of the PDV data collection,\n\u2022 an import helper for text files downloaded from the PANGAEA information system (https://www.pangaea.de/).\nMissing meta data can be added within the software, 10\n\u2022 a zoomable map interface to quickly explore the availability of data in specific regions. Raw downcore data are plotted when a core position in the map is selected (Figure 2 ). Alternatively, profile views with a similar functionality are available for major ocean basins,\n\u2022 an editor for meta data. Meta data can be corrected/added and saved in the netCDF file of the record,\n\u2022 the possibility to comment and flag individual downcore proxy data.

Proxy-specific tools will be activated when a proxy 30 is selected,\n\u2022 the calculation and visualization of time series ensemble statistics derived from BACON age models. Individual scientists usually collect their published and unpublished data on their personal computers often in form of Excel or text files, with arbitrary structure. However, the amount of data in Paleoceanography and Marine Geology is increasing exponentially due to more efficient measurement techniques, i.e. through non-destructive downcore scanners. This makes it 5 more and more difficult to keep track of the existing data and their characteristics. Published data should in principle be available in public databases, but these databases are usually static and preserve the state of data and research upon publication.\nData have to be downloaded before they can be investigated or modified, for example with respect to stratigraphy. Most scientists prefer to investigate and publish their data before deployment in public databases. This means that it can take years or even decades until newly produced paleoceanographic data are available in the public domain and there is the risk of 10 incomplete documentation or even data loss, i.e. if scientists retire. PDV combines a simple database with visualization and data analysis tools and helps to organize, document, compare and investigate individual data collections. PDV encourages the standardized storage of data at a very early state and thus increases the probability that unpublished data may finally end up in the public domain with the proper documentation.\nThe development of age models for sediment cores is a key technique to produce time series of past climate variability on 15 longer time scales. However, since calibration and reference curves are constantly improved, age models for individual cores need to be revised from time to time. PDV can be employed to efficiently create and update age models based on radiocarbon calibration or graphic alignment to standard reference curves. Ages/age errors from other events (i.e. tephras or biostratigraphic dates) can be added manually in the alignment tool. An added value of PDV is that these dating techniques can be combined and that all details of age model production are preserved. Using the \"Miscellaneous\" proxy category (see user manual), PDV 20 might be used as a simple dating tool for any downcore parameter."}, {"section_title": "Development and maintenance of proxy-specific databases", "text": "Millions of proxy measurements are available in public data libraries. For example, the databases PANGAEA (https://www.pangaea.de/) and NOAA (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/) host foraminiferal stable isotope and radiocarbon data 25 for thousands of cores, and this database is constantly growing. The combination of a simple document-oriented database with functionality for data processing and documentation allows the efficient collection and transformation of foraminiferal stable isotope and other proxy data into quality controlled and homogenous compilations. Since all modifications are preserved and documented, it is possible to efficiently update the proxy database and the resulting data product. A similar workflow is established in other instrumental data products such as the World Ocean Atlas, where the raw data (World Ocean Database, 30\ni.e., Johnson et al., 2009 ) and the resulting derived products (World Ocean Atlas, i.e., Antonov et al., 2009; Locarnini et al., 2009 ) are regularly updated as important resources for oceanography and neighbouring disciplines. Since PDV does not provide a complex relational database, very specific database queries are not possible. However, the advantage of a document-oriented database is the exchangeability of the files among personal computers operated with Windows and macOS. For example, netCDF files can be exchanged among cooperating users of PDV via e-mail or file server.\nThe netCDF format is platform independent and can also be processed with other software. If PDV data collections are published, they can be provided as a zipped collection and later easily be reviewed or extended by other scientists. 5"}, {"section_title": "Educational and explorational use", "text": "PDV also offers opportunities for educational purposes in Geoscience. Students can interactively explore the regional paleoclimate evolution, compare records from different locations and sedimentation regimes and test stratigraphic methods.\nFurthermore, PDV also comes with modern ocean atlas hydrographic data and allows to interactively explore the distribution 10 of sea water properties, including proxy-relevant parameters such as \u03b4 13 CDIC and \u03b4 18 O of sea water.\nPDV might also be used as a tool for site survey planning (i.e. at the proposal stage to identity sampling gaps) or to find suitable coring sites before or even during marine expeditions (PDV does not require any web access and does not communicate via the internet). Finally, PDV can be used as a tool to discuss data with fellow scientists on meetings and workshops. "}, {"section_title": "Concluding remarks and further developments", "text": "The combination of a proxy toolbox and a proxy database increases the transparency and reusability of proxy collections and increases the efficiency of the required homogenisation steps. The current version of PDV includes proxy-specific functionalities for foraminiferal isotopes, foraminiferal Mg/Ca and alkenones in addition to a \"miscellaneous\" proxy category for collections of unspecified downcore records. The \"miscellaneous\" category is relevant if the user aims at multi-proxy 20 studies on single cores or downcore-parameters for which no proxy-category exists. We plan to extend future versions of PDV to include modules and functionalities more proxies and downcore parameters. The built-in stratigraphic methods can also be extended and refined. The visual alignment with standard records might benefit from the inclusion of an automatic alignment algorithm such as Dynamic Time Warping (Rabiner et al. 1978) . Furthermore, a core-to-core alignment of downcore parameters like XRF elemental ratios or susceptibility would help to improve stratigraphies where radiocarbon or stable isotope 25 measurements are not available or associated with large errors. Our goal is to allow a workflow where the proxy values can be saved into organized and quality-controlled atlas products with the possibility to quickly review the raw data foundation. These atlases can then be very useful products for neighbouring disciplines such as paleoclimate modelling.\nCode availability. Installers of the current version of PDV for both Windows 10 and macOS including the C++ code can be 30 downloaded from https://www.marum.de/Stefan-Mulitza/PaleoDataView.html along with a detailed user guide that will be continuously updated. The source code and all resources needed for compilation can be unpacked during the installation process.\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2019-59 Preprint.

Data can be imported (1) from Excel or text files and are separated into a proxy netCDF file containing meta data and downcore proxy data (2) and a netCDF file containing all age-related data (3). An 5 inventory file is created (4) and constantly updated containing only the meta data of all records in the database. This file allows fast access to individual files in the database. Functionality within the toolbox includes proxy uncertainty modelling (5), commenting, flagging and documentation of data/meta data (6) and tools for visualization (7) and age modelling (8).
