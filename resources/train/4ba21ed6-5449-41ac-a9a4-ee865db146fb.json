[{"section_title": "", "text": "Recognizing the importance of this issue, the Congress, federal and state governments, and the private sector are encouraging and implementing initiatives to prevent teen pregnancies and births. The Congress recently enacted welfare reform legislation4 that contains provisions directed at reducing out-of-wedlock childbearing and welfare dependency and promoting abstinence education. In addition, the Department of Health and Human Services (ms) is developing a national strategy to prevent teen pregnancy; state and local governments are implementing new strategies that they believe hold promise for addressing the problem; and private entities, such as the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, are supporting actions related to teenage childbearing. A better understanding of the characteristics of teen mothers and antecedents of teen motherhood B-280170 could help these efforts as public and private entities try to develop and implement more effective prevention strategies. Because of the impact of teen pregnancies and births and your interest in teen mothers and their children, you asked us to provide social and demographic information about teen mothers. Specifically, we agreed to (1) show the trends in birth rates for teens; (2) provide a profile of teen mothers; and (3) identify factors, such as education or family background, that may influence the likelihood of teen motherhood. To provide this information, we relied on national birth certificate data and the most current analyses of four nationally representative surveys: the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (rasY), the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), and the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (misDA). Limitations and lack of comparability among the various data sources restricted our ability to make comparisons or report by race and marital status in some cases. (For more information on our methods and data, see the appendix.) We conducted our work between July 1997 and May 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Although the birth rate for teenage women decreased 41 percent from the late 1950s to 1995paralleling the decline in the U.S. birth ratethe number of babies born to teenagers is still high (about 512,000 in 1995). Births to unmarried teenage mothers, however, more than quintupled as a proportion of total teen births over the same period. As of 1995, the teen birth rate was about 57 per thousand; however, rates varied considerably by subgroup. The birth rates for black and Hispanic teenage women are more than twice those for white teens. In 1995, nearly half of teen mothers were white and most were aged 18 to 19 and unmarried. About two-thirds of recent teen mothers did not intend to get pregnant or have a child; however, about one-fifth of women who gave birth already had one child. Teenage mothers also graduate from high school at lower rates than all teen women. Sixty-four percent of teen mothers complete high school, compared with about 90 percent of all teen women. Research studies that have examined the antecedents of teen motherhood have shown that limited involvement in school and some family background characteristicssuch as family instability and declines in family incomeare associated with an increased likelihood of teen B-280170 motherhood. The effect of most other factors varies among racial and ethnic groups."}, {"section_title": "Teen Birth Rates Have Declined, but Proportion of Unmarried Mothers Has Increased", "text": "Since the late 1950s, the birth rate of women aged 15 to 19 has decreased by about 41 percent overall. (One substantial increase started around the mid-1980s, then reversed itself in the early 1990s). The overall decrease in the teen birth rate parallels the overall decline in the U.S. birth rate as a whole, which has fallen 47 percent over the same time period. In contrast, the proportion of teen births outside of marriage has steadily increased over the same period    Year Sources: Data were derived from information found in S.J.

The rate fell from 123 per thousand to 66 per thousand for women aged 15 through 44, a decline of 47 percent.\u00b0W hile the overall trend in the teen birth rate has been downward, fluctuations have occurred. The most dramatic increase began in 1986 after the teen birth rate had reached 50 per thousand, the lowest point in 40 years.

Black teen mothers were predominantly unmarried (95 percent), while 68 percent of white and 68 percent of Hispanic teen mothers were unmarried at the time of the birth.     Smoking during the pregnancy, by contrast, appears lower for teens than for their peers with children. Compared with the one-third of teen mothers aged 15 to 17 who smoke, about 17 percent of mothers that age who gave birth in 1995 reported smoking while they were pregnant. However, smoking cigarettes during pregnancy varied by race or ethnicity;25 about 28 percent of white teen mothers reported smoking during pregnancy, compared with about 5 percent of black or Hispanic teenage mothers.\nfamily stability, increasing family income, and higher standardized test scores were associated with a reduced likelihood of birth for each group studied. Staying in school and living in two-parent families were associated with a lower risk of birth for white and Hispanic teens but had no effect for black teens. Socioeconomic status (SES) also had a mixed effect across racial groups. Lower SES was associated with an increased likelihood of a teen birth for Hispanic teens, a decreased likelihood for black teens, and had no effect on white teens. Higher SES had the opposite effect. Living in female-headed single-parent families was associated with an increased likelihood of a birth for black teens but had no effect for white teens. And only white teens were more likely to become teen mothers if their mothers had also been teen mothers. (See fig. 6.)

Manlove, \"The Influence of High School Dropout and School Disengagement on the Risk of School-Age Pregnancy,\" Journal of Research on Adolescence (1998). School factors are based on an analysis of women who were in the eighth grade in 1988 (NELS:88 data), and most factors were measured in the eighth grade. By contrast, dropping out was measured over the school years before a school-aged pregnancy leading to a live birth. Teenage women who dropped out of school were more likely than those who stayed in school to become pregnant and give birth in their teens. However, an association between dropping out of school and teen pregnancy was observed only among whites and Hispanics. After controlling for family background and measures of school involvement and performance, white and Hispanic teens who dropped out of school were about 1.5 times more likely to become a teenage mother than white and Hispanic teens who stayed in school. For black teens, drop-out status had no effect on teen pregnancy. Moreover, of school-age teens who gave birth, more than one quarter (28 percent) dropped out of school prior to pregnancy; an additional 30 percent dropped out after the pregnancy or birth of a child, and 42 percent stayed in school. These findings are consistent with those of a study of teen experiences in the 1970s and early 1980s. Limited postsecondary education plans were associated with a greater likelihood of a school-aged birth for black and Hispanic teens. Descriptive studies have generally found a lower risk of teen birth in two-parent families than with other family types.35 A study of the effects of changes in family structuresuch as divorce, appearance of a stepparent, going to live with grandparents or in an institutionon teen women found that the greater the number of such changes, the greater the probability of an early teen birth, regardless of family income.31 (See fig. 6.) The impact of family structure or family instability, however, varied by race or ethnicity. For example, one study found that being born into and reared through early childhood in a single-parent family headed by a woman was associated with higher likelihood of a birth for black teens but not for white teens.32 Another recent study found that living in a two-parent \"intact\" family during the eighth grade was associated with less risk of birth for white and Hispanic teensbut not for black teens.33 (See fig. 6.) Another factor associated with teen births only among white teens was having a parent who was also a teenage mother.\nAn analysis of earlier data (1970s and early 1980s), which also controlled for a number of family background characteristics, found a relationship between a decline in family income and the risk of teen births. For example, job loss or other types of income losses were associated with a higher likelihood of a birth among black and white teens.36 (See fig. 6.)"}, {"section_title": "irths to Unmarried Teens Have Steadily Increased", "text": "The percentage of births to unmarried teen women has increased substantially over the past several decades.

Of teens who gave birth in 1995, almost half were white and most were age 18 or 19 and unmarried.

Generally, lower school involvement, unstable family structure, and declining family income are associated with an increased likelihood of teen births. According to one study, teens who experienced multiple risk factors such as early school failure, poverty, or family dysfunction were more likely to become teenage mothers.26 Beyond a few factors, which had similar effects across the groups studied, the impact of other social factors on the likelihood of teen births varied by racial or ethnic group. Family instability, such as divorce and remarriage; declining family income, such as with job loss; and lower standardized test scores were associated with an increased likelihood of a teen birth,27 while 25Ventura, \"Report of Final Natality Statistics, 1995.\" 26Child Trends, Facts at a Glance. A descriptive study of eighth-graders found that those who did not demonstrate any of these characteristics had the lowest probability of a teenage birth; as the number of risk factors increased, the probability of a teenage birth increased. Teenage women with three or more of the risk factors had a 50-percent chance of a teenage birth. 271.
