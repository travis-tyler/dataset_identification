Methods: Self-reported sleep disturbances and established risk factors for dementia were measured in men at ages 50 (n 5 1574) and 70 (n 5 1029) years. Dementia incidence was determined by reviewing their patient history between ages 50 and 90 years. In addition, plasma levels of b-amyloid (Ab) peptides 1-40 and 1-42 were measured at ages 70, 77, and 82 years.\nResults: Cox regression demonstrated that men with self-reported sleep disturbances had a higher risk of developing dementia (133%) and Alzheimer's disease (AD, 151%) than men without selfreported sleep disturbances (both P , .05). Binary logistic regression showed the increased risk for both dementia (1114%) and AD (1192%) were highest when sleep disturbance was reported at age 70 years (both P , .001). No group differences were found in Ab levels. Conclusion: Improving sleep quality may help reduce the neurodegenerative risk in older men."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Experimental studies in both animals and humans have demonstrated that insufficient sleep exerts considerable effects on brain health. When awake, there is a normal accumulation of toxic substances in the brain of mice. Using convective flow between the cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid, these toxic metabolites are removed from the murine brain during subsequent sleep, thereby ensuring that the neuronal exposure to neurodegenerative factors is kept at a minimum [1] . Of note, clearance during sleep was as much as twofold faster than during waking hours in this study [1] , indicating that a normal night's sleep may be critical for maintaining brain health in mice, and, most likely, also in humans. In line with these findings, we have recently demonstrated in healthy young men [2] that one night of total sleep deprivation increases morning blood concentrations of neuron-specific enolase (NSE)-an enzyme found in all neurons [3] and S100 calcium binding protein B (S-100B)-a protein which is mainly found in the glial cells of the peripheral and central nervous system [4] . As these brain metabolites typically rise in blood under conditions of neurodegeneration [5, 6] , these results also indicate that a lack of sleep may be harmful for the brain. Finally, in a cross-sectional study of 70 adults (mean age 76 years, range 53-91 years) from the neuroimaging substudy of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, it has been shown that selfreported shorter sleep duration was associated with greater b-amyloid (Ab) burden in the brain [7] . The aggregation of Ab in the brain is hypothesized to be linked to neurodegenerative processes, most notably in Alzheimer disease (AD) [8] .\nAgainst this background, the present study, involving 1574 men at age 50 years with a mean follow-up of w40 years, aimed to ascertain if reports of sleep disturbances were associated with an increased risk to develop all-cause dementia. In addition, we examined if reports of sleep disturbances were linked to changes in plasma levels of Ab peptides 1-40 and 1-42."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Patient population", "text": "The Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM) was initiated in 1970. All 50-year-old men born between 1920 and 1924 and living in Uppsala, Sweden, were invited to participate in a health survey aimed at identifying cardiovascular risk factors ( [9] ; see also http://www.pubcare.uu.se/ ULSAM). Of the 2841 invited men, 82% (2322 men) participated in the investigation. Following the baseline investigation at age 50 years, subjects were re-examined at ages 60, 70, 77, 82, and 88 years. To examine the associations of self-reported sleep disturbances with all-cause dementia risk, a total of 1574 participants who had available follow-up data were entered into the present analysis (w68% of the men who participated in the baseline investigation; Fig. 1 ). In a subsample of those 1574 men, plasma levels of Ab peptides 1-40 and 1-42 were determined at ages 70, 77, and 82 years (Fig. 1) . These data were used to ascertain the association between plasma levels of Ab peptides 1-40, 1-42, and their ratio, with selfreported sleep disturbance at age 70 years.

Answering \"yes\" to any of the three questions was herein considered to demonstrate that the participant at the time of the survey was likely to have a sleep disturbance. Thus, the three questions were combined into one variable (denoted \"sleep disturbance\"), which was given the value of 1 (present) if any of the three questions were answered as \"yes\" (i.e. a score of 1-3) and 0 (absent) otherwise (score 0).

Dementia was assessed as described earlier [10] . Briefly, the medical records of the ULSAM participants from all the clinics of Uppsala University Hospital, the Uppsala general practitioners and nursing homes, were reviewed until January 1, 2010. Practically all medical care for the participants had been provided in these settings. The diagnoses of dementia were assigned by two experienced geriatricians independently, blinded from the baseline data, using all available data from these records. In the case of disagreement, a third experienced geriatrician reviewed the case and the diagnosis was determined by majority decision. Dementia was diagnosed according to the criteria from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) [11] . A poststroke status with major motor sequelae and/or aphasia precluding neuropsychological testing and/or inferring a major impact on daily functions (stable over time) was not classified as dementia. AD was diagnosed according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke and the Alzheimer's disease and Related Disorders Association criteria [12] . A detailed description of cognitive decline over time (excluding deterioration in connection with possible brain ischemia) and relevant cognitive testing were mandatory prerequisites for a diagnosis of pure AD. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scanning showing either a normal picture or atrophy, no more than one clinically silent infarction, and no more than mild white matter lesion were required for a diagnosis of pure AD. Vascular dementia was diagnosed according to the Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Center (ADDTC) core criteria [13] , frontotemporal dementia according to the McKhann criteria [14] and Lewy body dementia according to the McKeith criteria [15] . A diagnosis of mixed dementia was made when both AD and cerebrovascular disease were considered to contribute to dementia.

In contrast, plasma levels of Ab peptides 1-40 and 1-42 were not different between those who reported to have a sleep disturbance and those who did not. These community-based data confirm and extend previous experimental and epidemiological research [1, 2, [18] [19] [20] that suggest that getting a regular good night's sleep may be a useful means for supporting long-term brain health in humans."}, {"section_title": "Comparison with literature", "text": "A recent longitudinal study using data from a populationbased sample of 214 Swedish adults aged 75 years and over demonstrated that reduced sleep duration was associated with a 75% increased all-cause dementia risk and double the risk of AD [20] . Similar but weaker associations were observed in the present study. That the strength of our association is less pronounced than that observed in the prior study by Hahn et al. may be explained by differences in the sample size (ours vs. Hahn's study: 1606 vs. 214), gender distribution (100% males vs. 80%/20% females/males), length of observation period (40 years vs. 9 years), the number of sleep disturbance assessments (baseline and age 70 years vs. baseline), clinical characteristics of the study samples, and age at entry (50 years vs. 83 years). Supporting the view that especially age may modulate the strength of the association between sleep disturbances and dementia risk, we found that men with self-reported sleep disturbances at age 70 years but not 50 years had a twofold higher risk to develop dementia and a threefold higher risk to develop AD, than those without any sleep disturbance. A possible explanation could be that the ability of the aged brain to clean itself from neurotoxic substances during sleep might be more attenuated than at a younger age when sleep is disturbed.\nAnother finding of our study is that reported sleep disturbance at age 70 years was neither linked to plasma levels of Ab peptides 1-40 and 1-42 measured at the same age, nor at a later time point. At first glance, these results contrast previous findings. For instance, by analyzing CSF from 145 cognitively normal individuals who were 45 years and older, researchers were able to demonstrate that CSF Ab 1-42 levels were lower in those who have objectively (i.e. measured by wrist actigraphy) lower sleep quality [19] . Moreover, as mentioned earlier, self-reported shorter sleep duration has been associated with greater Ab burden in the brain of 70 elderly subjects [7] . Several reasons may have masked possible effects on Ab peptides 1-40 and 1-42. First, plasma may be less sensitive than CSF to reflect a potential impact of perceived sleep disturbance on Ab peptides. Second, plasma levels of Ab peptides were measured at ages 70, 77, and 82 years. Bearing in mind that plasma Ab peptides usually increase before the onset of dementia but decrease thereafter [21] , we cannot rule out that the chosen blood sampling frequency may not have captured possible differences in plasma levels of Ab peptides 1-40 and 1-42 between the groups with and without reported sleep disturbances. Finally, it must be noted that the use of plasma Ab peptides 1-40 and 1-42 to predict reliably the transition of cognitive decline to AD is subject of ongoing scientific debate [22, 23] ."}, {"section_title": "Potential mechanisms for the observed associations", "text": "Our observational study is limited as we cannot yet establish causality. There are several potential pathways that may explain the association between reports of sleep disturbance and the risk to develop all-cause dementia and AD, respectively. Sleep represents a period during which brain glucose metabolism drops by w30%, compared with values obtained during wakefulness [24] . Substrate oxidation ultimately leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide [25] . Previous experiments have demonstrated that ROS can damage neurons and even induce cell death [26] . Another possible interpretation could be, as described earlier, that poor sleep may lessen the ability of the brain to remove toxic substances [1] , thereby increasing and prolonging the exposure of neurons to neurodegenerative factors, ultimately perhaps resulting in reversible or irreversible neuronal damage, depending on the length and degree of exposure to sleep deprivation. However, it is important to note that, as of yet, evidence is lacking that perceived lower-quality sleep may concur with a greater neurodegenerative load and/or a reduced ability of the brain to clear itself from toxic substances.\nImportantly, it must be borne in mind that self-reported sleep disturbances, unlike a nocturnal polysomnography (NSPG), do not allow one to draw firm conclusions as to whether an individual's sleep architecture is healthy or not. Thus, it cannot be ruled out that self-reported sleep disturbances in our study were related to age-related changes in sleep patterns, poor sleep hygiene, and/or environmental sleep issues. In addition, self-reported sleep disturbances may be secondary to a primary disease (e.g. depression), which by itself increases the risk for neurodegenerative processes. Finally, men with sleep disturbances had more often hypertension, diabetes, and a higher BMI than men without sleep disturbances. Similar medical conditions are found in patients with sleep apnea [27] [28] [29] . Interestingly, this sleep disorder has recently been linked to neurodegenerative processes [30] ."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and limitations", "text": "The major strength of our investigation includes the long follow-up period (w40 years). During aging, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, percentage of slow-wave sleep, percentage of rapid eye movement sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep latency all significantly decrease [31] , indicating that repeated measures of sleep disturbance-as collected in the present study-help minimize the confounding effect of age on sleep quality. However, there are also several limitations that apply: A history of chronic insomnia does not per se predict poor sleep as determined by NSPG [32] . That said, our findings must be confirmed by prospective studies utilizing objective measures of sleep quality (e.g. actigraphy, NSPG). Nevertheless, the consistency of the association between reports of sleep disturbance and risk to develop dementia would argue against the results as chance findings. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that medical conditions that were not entered in the present analysis as possible confounders can adversely impact human sleep architecture (e.g. depression, e.g. as found by Hahn et al. [20] ), and may therefore partly account for the observed association between sleep disturbance and dementia risk. Another limitation is the unknown generalizability to females and other geographical and ethnic groups. Finally, confounds by other factors, such as genetic background (e.g. apolipoprotein E [33] ;), that were not considered in the present analysis, cannot be excluded."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Approximately every other adult in North America reports the quality of their nighttime sleep as being insufficient [34] .
