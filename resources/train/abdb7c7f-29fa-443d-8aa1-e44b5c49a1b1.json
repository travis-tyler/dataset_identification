[{"section_title": "FOREWORD T", "text": "he 2011 Global Summit in Hong Kong, \"Career Outcomes for Graduate Students: Tracking and Building Pathways,\" focused on an issue that continues to grow in importance to higher education institutions around the world. In order to ensure that graduates of master's and doctoral programs are prepared to adapt to evolving career demands, graduate leaders and other stakeholders must understand the needs of their own students and communities and develop strategies to address them. A local university context, however, always exists within a global network, a situation that presents graduate leaders with both local and global challenges. The 2011 Global Summit provided an opportunity for a diverse group of graduate leaders to discuss these challenges and share program models and practices. Our goal was to better understand the differences among their approaches to graduate student career development, and to identify successful methods for tracking career placement data. Global Perspectives on Career Outcomes for Graduate Students represents both the variety of perspective and areas of common ground that emerged at the 2011 Global Summit. I hope this volume will spark future dialogue about how graduate leaders can support career development in their home institutions through local networks and collaborations with international colleagues. volume that reflects such a diverse range of opinions and perspectives is necessarily the work of many individuals. First, I would like to thank the international Steering Committee of the 2011 Global Summit for their leadership in developing a summit agenda with broad international relevance, and each of the 2011 summit delegates for their carefully-considered contributions. I also extend my sincere thanks to CGS's co-host and partner for the 2011 event, The University of Hong Kong. Specifically I thank Paul Tam, Pro Vice-Chancellor & Vice President for Research and Dean of the Graduate School at HKU, who brought wisdom and leadership to every stage of the planning process. The Hong Kong summit was supported by the work of many other advocates of graduate education at HKU: John Malpas, Pro Vice-Chancellor and Vice President, Infrastructure; Mee-Len Chye, Associate Dean, Graduate School; Nirmala Rao, Associate Dean, Graduate School; and Ben Young, Assistant Dean, Graduate School. HKU's terrific organizational staff ensured that the event was a logistical success. We thank Betty Tsui, Penny Au-Yeung, Eppie Chan, and Anna Wong for their exceptional attention to details large and small. A committed staff at the Council of Graduate Schools also supported the planning of the 2011 Summit and the preparation of this volume for publication: I thank Julia Kent, Director of Global Communications and Best Practices and managing editor of these proceedings; Maureen McCarthy, for dedicated editorial assistance; Richard Linton, for his careful comments on a draft of the volume; Patty McAllister and Belle Woods, for overseeing press communications; Joshua Mahler, for assistance with web resources and publication design; and Cheryl Flagg and Heidi Shank, who assisted with CGS's preparations in Washington, DC. My deepest gratitude goes to ProQuest UMI for their continued generosity in sponsoring the Strategic Leaders Global Summit on Graduate Education.

The establishment of this forum as an annual event would not have been possible without ProQuest's service to graduate education globally."}, {"section_title": "Debra W. Stewart President Council of Graduate Schools", "text": "INTRODUCTION summit built upon a principle agreed upon in Banff, the importance of promoting graduate international collaborations, and explored the challenges and opportunities surrounding collaborations such as joint degrees, dual degrees, and research exchanges. In 2010, the Global Summit was co-hosted by CGS and the Australian Group of Eight (Go8) in partnership with the Deans and Directors of Graduate Studies in Australia in Brisbane, Australia. In 2011, the summit again built upon one of the Banff Principles, the need to promote quality in graduate programs. The 2010 participants agreed that quality assessment was one of the most important issues now facing graduate institutions throughout the world and they saw great value in coming together to explore best practices in quality assurance in graduate education. CGS was delighted that the University of Hong Kong joined us in co-hosting the 2011 Summit, an event that coincided with the celebration of the 100-year anniversary of HKU. Early in the process of planning the summit, HKU and CGS agreed that graduate institutions around the world are seeking to enhance the professional skills and career outcomes of master's and PhD students-and that this is not just a university concern. Many stakeholders join universities in their efforts: national and provincial governments are working to strengthen the link between graduate training and workforce development, and international and local employers are joining national conversations about transferable skills and workforce needs. Most importantly, graduate students in many countries are asking for improved information and support for both academic and nonacademic career development. These parallel trends have led graduate deans and other senior university leaders to closely follow workforce trends both locally and globally. Many universities have also sought to develop better methods of tracking graduates' career pathways and to develop programs that prepare students to adapt to new and evolving career demands. The Fifth Annual Strategic Leaders Global Summit on Graduate Education, \"Career Outcomes for Graduate Students: Tracking and Building Pathways,\" provided an international forum for exploring these efforts and exchanging promising practices with participants from 16 countries. Following the highly successful format used in previous summits, this summit began with a survey of important differences between national and local systems of graduate education and an opportunity to share common challenges. This first panel laid the groundwork for a productive discussion by providing context for understanding the diversity of national perspective brought to the Summit by its delegates. Because Panel 1 contained a limited number of presentation slots, participants were invited to submit country papers to supplement the discussion. Formal presentations are included in Part I of this volume, while supplementary country papers may be found in Appendix B. Panels 2-6 (corresponding to Parts II-VI of this volume) provided opportunities for participants to share ideas and participate in conversations about best practices in specific areas of graduate student career preparation. Panel 2, \"Creating Institutional Cultures that Value Career and Professional Development,\" explored the benefits and challenges to creating and communicating a cultural change in the way career development is perceived in graduate education. In Panel 3, \"Defining and Developing New Areas of Professional Skill,\" panelists shared successful program models and discussed the possibilities inherent in partnering with employers. Panel 4, \"The Role of Programs and Faculty in Supporting Graduate Student Careers,\" focused on the challenges and opportunities unique to STEM and humanities and social science fields, respectively. Panel 5, \"Global Trends Shaping Careers and Professional Needs,\" examined the increasingly global nature of graduate education and possible responses to this new reality. In Panel 6, \"Opportunities for Global Collaboration,\" panelists offered thoughts on the roles of external partners such as national organizations, foreign universities, and professional societies. The expertise shared in these panels set the groundwork for the final session, where summit participants collaborated to create a set of principles that we hope will serve as an international statement of common values, practices, and priorities for future action with regard to career outcomes for graduate students. To read the final consensus document, please refer to Appendix A. Once again this year, as in past years, the leadership represented in the 2011 Global Summit was diverse, broad, and deep. I am confident that our efforts as both individuals and as a diverse international group will make these proceedings an invaluable resource for many graduate communities worldwide.\n\nAPPENDIx A: PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES FOR BUILDING PATHWAYS FROM GRADUATE SCHOOL TO CAREERS I n the final session of the annual Strategic Leaders Global Summit, participants come together to revise and approve a set of conclusions that had received significant support in earlier sessions. For the 2011 Summit, participants agreed to a statement upholding the importance of supporting graduate students' career pathways through collaboration, program and mission development, and more complete data collection."}, {"section_title": "I. PATHWAYS FROM GRADUATE SCHOOL TO CAREERS: NATIONAL CONTExTS AND TRENDS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Summary of Presentations and discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "W", "text": "hile the employment landscape has globalized, local and national forces often play the most direct role in shaping universities' actions to support the professional development and employability of their graduate students. Increasingly, national, provincial, and regional governments are redoubling efforts to strengthen graduate training and workforce development; employers are joining national conversations about transferable skills and workforce needs; and graduate students are demanding improved information and support for career development both inside and outside academe. These changes challenge graduate leaders to think in new ways about the content and form of graduate education in relationship to national and local workforce opportunities and demands. In this first summit session, panelists described the national and regional contexts for preparing master's and doctoral students for their future careers. Speakers from seven countries-Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, South Korea, and the United Statesformally addressed this topic as members of the international steering committee. A number of participants from countries not represented in the opening panel, including Brazil, Egypt, Hungary, India, and Spain, submitted country papers for the summit program to inform the discussion that followed (see Appendix B). Together these papers provided detailed accounts of on-the-ground developments in specific countries. Here we draw out common threads from the papers, pointing to three dominant topics and themes.\nhere do career development initiatives fit into graduate programs? How should data collected on graduate career outcomes be used? Are there fundamental differences in the student career support needed in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and in the humanities and social sciences? Panelists in this session addressed these questions in the context of their own universities. Many also articulated strategies for integrating career development into doctoral and master's programs, including the use of career data to enhance programs, as well as challenges and opportunities across various disciplines."}, {"section_title": "Graduate education: a Public and a Private Good", "text": "There was consensus among panelists that graduate education should be viewed as both a public and a private good-an activity that contributes to the economic competitiveness of nations and regions as well as to the professional success of individual students. Panelists nevertheless pointed to differences in the ways that governments understand and communicate the public value of graduate education. In Australia, Max King (Monash University) reported, the government views graduate education as a public good, while undergraduate education is considered a private benefit. This view of graduate education is made clear in Australia's recent Initiative of the Australian Government of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, which produced a 2011 report, \"Research Skills for an Innovative Future: A Research Workforce Strategy to Cover the Decade to 2020 and Beyond.\" The report affirms the role of graduate education in supporting the skills base of Australian firms and public sector research organizations. Australian research students are also promised \"clear and equitable\" pathways for career progression. In Canada, national data indicates that 66% of doctoral students and 95% of master's students work outside of academia. This is evidence, indicated Jay doering (University of Manitoba), that students \"contribute directly to the productivity of the private, not for profit, and public sectors.\" These data demonstrate to both government stakeholders and the Canadian public that the benefits of graduate education are not contained within the campuses of universities. Participants from Europe indicated that discussions about the public value of graduate education are taking place at both the national and European levels. Speaking on behalf of his university as well as the European University Association's (EUA's) Council on Doctoral Education (CDE), Jean Chambaz (Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie) cited the 2005 Salzburg Principles, formed during the Bologna Process, which directed reforms of doctoral education in Europe. These principles, along with a set of more concrete principles to emerge in 2010 under the title of \"Salzburg II,\" affirmed that the outcome of doctoral education should be considered the \"doctorate holder himself or herself-the talent-able to contribute to society's development with knowledge, competencies and skills mastered by undertaking research.\" ernst rank (Technische Universit\u00e4t Munich) also pointed to the importance of the Bologna Process in creating greater awareness of employment outcomes in the context of graduate education in Europe and in Germany. Dr. Rank explained that historically, German graduate education, particularly in the context of doctoral education, emphasized personal development, or Bildung. The Bologna Process, however, along with the German Excellence Initiative, have led German institutions to place more emphasis on employability. In Dr. Rank's view, public good and private good should be productively aligned: \"personal, cultural maturation, together with scientific excellence is the best guarantee for lifelong success.\" Representing India, Kumkum Garg (Manipal Institute of Technology) reported the nation's urgent need for a more educated population makes clear the public value of graduate education. Dr. Garg indicated that graduates are not only considered skilled workers for the Indian economy, but \"employment generators\" capable of building the county's economic infrastructure. The national commitment to higher education is demonstrated in the Indian government's new budget, detailed in Dr. Garg's paper, which allocates almost 15 times the previous amount to higher education."}, {"section_title": "Strategic Collaborations", "text": "Cultivating strategic partnerships with government, employers, or national organizations can strengthen graduate education, better prepare students for a variety of careers, and send a message to the public that graduate education yields benefits beyond the university. Repeatedly, panelists emphasized that federal and regional state investments in higher education can provide much-needed financial support for innovative programs and can encourage strategic collaborations. For example, Shiyi Chen (Peking University) described recent legislation in China that provides \"a higher level of financial support to graduate students, giving universities more freedom to develop degree programs and help recruit world-class professors.\" In particular, the Chinese government has tentatively supported the development of a professional doctorate in engineering and begun to promote professional graduate education in general. As detailed in the paper by Vahan agopyan (University of S\u00e3o Paulo), the government of Brazil is also working to align graduate education and workforce development. The Brazilian government issued a 2011-2020 National Plan for Graduate Studies that directly addresses the role of graduate studies in developing human resources for public and private corporations. In South Korea, Kyung Chan Min (Yonsei University) noted, the Ministry of Education, Science & Technology has developed new initiatives to enhance cooperation between universities and industry and to promote the growth of joint companies. In the United States, where the federal government does not directly fund or mandate priorities for higher education, non-profit organizations are in a strong position to support collaborations between universities and other stakeholders. Addressing efforts in the U.S. to clarify career outcomes for graduate students, Pat osmer (Ohio State University) described a joint project of the Educational Testing Service and the Council of Graduate Schools, The Commission on Pathways through Graduate School and into Careers. The goal of the Commission was to create national awareness of the challenges and opportunities that students face as they make the transition from graduate school to careers. As part of this process, the Commission, which included graduate leaders and employers, was charged with providing recommendations to different stakeholders-university leaders, employers and the U.S. government-for supporting these pathways. Support for strategic collaborations may also occur outside national borders. Speaking to the Middle East and North African (MENA) region, Amr Shaarawi (American University in Cairo) described two mechanisms that are supporting the development of partnerships among universities: funding from the Persian Gulf region to seed collaboration between institutions, and funding that supports European consortia that seek to collaborate with universities in the MENA region. 1 "}, {"section_title": "Mechanisms for Tracking Career outcomes", "text": "A clear understanding of career development needs for master's and doctoral students must be based on an accurate picture of the careers they actually pursue and the employment opportunities available to them. To gain a better understanding of how national higher education systems track career outcomes for graduate students, we asked panelists to describe current initiatives in their countries and institutions. Panel papers and country papers contained specific examples of career tracking mechanisms ranging from completed surveys to national tracking systems. Some recent large-scale tracking mechanisms are worthy of note: \u2022 australia: The Australian Group of Eight (Go8) ResearchUniversities' conducted a 2007 survey, \"PhD Graduates 5 to 7 Years Out: Employment Outcomes, Job Attributes, and the Quality of Research Training.\" Dr. King (Monash University) explained that the survey tracked longer-term employment outcomes of doctoral degree holders and links those outcomes to the effectiveness of graduate programs. \u2022 Hungary: The Higher Education Act began to require higher education institutions to track the careers outcomes of their graduates in 2006. liviu Mateil (Central European University) notes that a national system for career tracking is now in place, with the purpose of aligning broad policy objectives with national and institutional policies for higher education. These examples demonstrate a shared belief in the link between graduate program quality and the strength of graduates' career outcomes. While these efforts represent a step forward, panelists also agreed that more tracking is needed, especially over the long term, in order to further strengthen graduate education. Panel 1 discussions uncovered a range of unresolved questions, however, including: who is to lead the efforts to track graduate careers? Of various stakeholdersincluding universities, regional and federal governments, and national organizations-who is best positioned to coordinate these efforts? The unique situations of different nations may dictate a variety of solutions, but it remains important to continue sharing ideas and lessons across national lines."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "More information about university collaborations with external stakeholders can be found in Part VI, \"Opportunities for Global Collaboration.\""}, {"section_title": "Pathways from Graduate School to Careers:", "text": "The Australian Context"}, {"section_title": "Maxwell King Chair, Go8 deans of Graduate Studies Pro Vice-Chancellor, research and research Training Monash University", "text": "Over the last few years, the Australian Government has recognised the need for a Research Workforce Strategy. This strategy was finalised and published earlier in the year. It contains the following vision for the research workforce: \"The Government's vision for 2020 is of a strong and productive Australian research workforce, comprising the scale, breadth and depth of skills required to support innovation, educate the next generation of Australians, and ultimately drive productivity improvements across the economy. It is underpinned by seven aspirations, targeting key factors influencing our ability to meet the immediate challenges of the decade ahead and position us for the many challenges and opportunities beyond. These aspirations are that: \u2022 Australian firms have access to the research skills and experience that will enable them to move up the valuechain and be globally competitive. \u2022 Australia's public sector research organisations have a sufficient research skills base to support their diverse roles. \u2022 Australia's higher degree by research (HDR) graduates have the skills and attributes to both engage in world-class research and make productive contributions in a wide spectrum of professional roles. \u2022 Australian universities, as the major providers of research training in Australia, have sufficient numbers of research qualified staff to develop the next generation of researchers. \u2022 Australian research students, researchers and research support staff are provided with clear and equitable pathways for career progression and supported to meet individual career needs and objectives. \u2022 Australian research employers have in place the communication channels and linkages which promote the effective diffusion of knowledge (both codified and tacit) across the economy. \u2022 Australia effectively draws on and harnesses the potential contributions of all research qualified individuals and facilitates participation in and engagement with the research workforce.\" -Australian Government Department of Innovation Industry, Science and Research 2011, p. viii Naturally, universities play a very strong role in training researchers. We have a long history of including a research component in undergraduate degrees (the honours year). Over the last decade there has been a very good partnership between universities and government in support of a strong PhD system. The government funds PhD places for local students so that no fees are charged. It also provides scholarships to the brightest and best to cover living costs. Currently the number of these scholarships is being doubled (with 3,270 new scholarships to be awarded in 2011). This provides a clear demonstration that the government views graduate research education as a public good. There are many informal communication channels between universities and other stakeholders but not many formal channels. An obvious channel is the twice-yearly meeting of Deans and Directors of Graduate Studies (DDoGS) in Australian Universities. One memorable presentation was at the second DDoG meeting in 1996 by Julian Clarke, of F. H. Faulding & Company Limited, entitled \"Preparation of PhDs for the Real World.\" He outlined a number of weaknesses with the then-current PhD system, including issues of poor supervision (advising or mentoring) and too many students doing the minimum to pass. Main skill weaknesses of postgraduates he identified included poor work practices in areas such as time and project management and the ability to meet deadlines; poorly developed people, leadership, negotiation and communication skills; and most importantly, a lack of understanding of the importance of teamwork. Presentations such as his have led to a much greater awareness of the need for more general skills training for PhD students in order to improve their research and employment skills. In the near future, the core mission for China is to construct an innovation-oriented country. Consequently our graduate education has to meet higher requirements. As State Council member Yandong Liu has pointed out, graduation education is \"the major resource of high-level innovative talents and critical symbol of scientific research potential, the firm backup for enhancing the overall national strength.\" Graduate education in China has been accorded unprecedented significance. The Chinese government has carried out a variety of measures to guarantee the development of graduate education, providing a higher degree of financial support and introducing more social resources."}, {"section_title": "Chinese government has made strategic adjustments to develop graduate education", "text": "In 1981, China resumed the graduate education system and the number of students enrolled went through rapid expansion beginning in 1999. In 2009, students enrolled reached 400,000 with 1,400,000 students in school. With respect to the number of students enrolled in the graduate education system, China has become the second largest country after America. Our graduate education system has made great progress and cultivated mostly students with academic degrees for universities and colleges, as well as other scientific research institutions. However, with the division of labor more specific and the degree of professionalization higher, Chinese society has set up higher demands upon high-level professional talents, especially in areas such as equipment manufacturing, finance and accounting, medical health, etc. The major mission that graduate education has to achieve now includes nurturing profession-specific and creative talents urgently demanded to promote economic growth. Besides, both job hunters and employers have raised their requirements as to the professionalization degree of specific occupations. Practical working capabilities and professional skills have been paid special attention. Therefore, the Chinese government has made a vital strategic transformation in the development of graduate education, which is to adjust the overall structure of graduate education, building upon the principle of cultivating mostly academic graduates to attach equal importance to both academic graduates and professional graduates. To realize the goal, we shall increase the rate of professional graduates out of overall graduates from 30% to 50%. The focus of future graduate education shall shift to serving the demand of economic development and adhering to the principle of quality first. Rigorous development of professional graduate education and larger graduate student numbers shall be efficient means to meet the demand for graduate students with high-level professional talents."}, {"section_title": "Chinese government has carried out critical measures to promote professional graduate education", "text": "Professional graduate education has been set up to satisfy specific demands of certain occupations and also for the sake of high-level special personnel.

Relative measures include giving prominence to the internationalization of graduate curricula, reforming the mentor system, and providing students with more opportunities to participate in academic activities. Professional degrees aim to cultivate higher-level applied talents equipped with standard and high-level professional skills as well as practical experience. The employment market has a huge demand for professional graduates. China has been sparing no effort to speed up the process of reforming the mode of professional graduate education: 1. Reform the mode of student enrollment: we have been gradually decreasing the enrollment number of academic graduates and increasing that of professional ones, with distinct entrance exams for respective professional degrees set up. 2. Reform the mode of student cultivation: currently we focus on fulfilling the request of practical application, with attention paid to theoretical systems and professional curriculum. 3. Reform the mode of student management: provincial Degree Committees shall be given a higher degree of self-government to adapt to national and regional economic development requirements and improve the quality of professional graduate education."}, {"section_title": "Tentatively initiate professional doctoral degree of engineering", "text": "Instituting the professional doctoral degree of engineering as the highest degree in cultivating professional talents puts more emphasis on abilities of practice compared to an academic doctoral degree.

They have made proactive attempts to satisfy the development requirements of our country. Here I would like to present you with several examples. 1. Peking University: Full-time Master of Business Administration (MBA) (professional degree). In cultivating the MBA, Peking University (PKU) has paid special attention to the theoretical curriculum and practice programs as well as intern sessions. Generally, there are two categories making up the theoretical curriculum: core courses and elective courses. The former covers mandatory basics in principles of management and economics, while the latter values professional knowledge in specific areas of management. Moreover, PKU from time to time hosts activities for students and businesses to communicate with each other. Practice programs are crucial parts in cultivating well-rounded students, providing them with opportunities of reporting to enterprise management their key findings during the process of one-semester management research. An intern session focuses on developing students' professional skills and quality through internships in social institutions for eight weeks. The mode of MBA cultivation has brought PKU favorable reviews from both graduates and employers. 2. Hohai University: Full-time Master of Water Conservancy Project (professional degree) Hohai University has taken positive advantage of its superior principle of water conservancy and promoted the relation with key units in that specific industry. Resulting from their enthusiastic exploration, they have created the cultivation pattern of \"Bi-tutor\" mechanism which focuses on \"combining internal cultivation and base cultivation, combining knowledge construction and capstone experience.\" Hohai University has been adopting this distinct pattern for more than eight years and a lot experience has been accumulated. 3. China University of Petroleum: Full-time Master of Petroleum and Gasoline Construction China University of Petroleum (CUP) has carried out a cultivation mode composed of threeyear graduate education and \"1 + 0.5 + 1 + 0.5\" stages which refer to one-year theory learning at school, half-a-year practice at a school-run enterprise, one-year practice in accord with thesis topic and half-a-year thesis composition. Meanwhile CUP has set up a curriculum system of \"platform + pattern\" which refers to required courses to meet the demand of national and professional development, and elective courses selected by students according to their personal background and occupational planning. This mode of CUP sets up an effective paradigm for other schools. In addition, attempts have been made by Beihang University, Northeast Normal University, and China Agricultural University in their respective advantage principles. Promote the reform in management mechanism as required Based on the distinct features of professional graduate education, member schools of ACGS have vigorously initiated the reform of the management mechanism. The following measures have been carried out: 1. Establish base management committee Hohai University established a base management committee responsible for major issues arising in the process of base construction, development, and operation, in order to guarantee education quality. A management committee like this provides a solid foundation for professional graduates to study at the base."}, {"section_title": "Set up professional degree management unit", "text": "In order to meet the requirements of professional graduate education, Beijing Normal University has recently set up a professional degree management unit responsible for the enrollment and cultivation of graduates.

Graduate education has become the major resource of high-level innovative talent and for transforming the means of economic development. It plays a crucial part in enhancing China's comprehensive competitiveness. Hereafter, China shall focus on the principle of \"quality first\" as always and speed up the structural transformation of graduate education. Professional graduate education shall be rigorously advanced to satisfy the requirements of social and economic development.

Until 15 years ago, German universities (which have always been-and will be in the foreseeable future-predominantly public institutions) were characterized by a very strong dependency on state governments, 1 university presidents with more representative than leadership roles, deans of the departments who hardly ever saw it as their task to lead their faculty, and a strong position of full professors (chair holders). The German Federal Lands controlled programs, admission rates, and the general policy of German higher education. No tuition fee was raised as it was (and is) the overwhelming conviction, that higher education (up to the diploma level, equivalent to the international master's degree, i.e. a graduate degree) is of major public interest. Study programs were steered to have rather uniform and high standards at all German universities. For that reason it was of no major importance from which university a graduate obtained his diploma. Bildung (in the sense of scientific, personal and cultural maturation) was considered of much higher importance than \"training for the labor market.\" In contrast to the \"public\" responsibility for studies up to the diploma level, doctoral studies were mainly under the personal or even \"private\" control of professors. This apprenticeship model producedand still often produces-a Lehrer-Sch\u00fcler relationship, with excellent scientific results on the one side, but with a lack of training of doctoral candidates regarding the applicability of their results and the needs of the labor market on the other. By nature, this \"academic ivory tower\" was much more pronounced in the humanities than for example in the engineering sciences, where a close collaboration with industry has always been a hallmark of the German higher education system. In the middle of the 1990s, a dramatic modernization of German higher education system started, first initiated by a few universities, but since then by the system as a whole. These changes can be characterized as a) a reduced influence of the Federal Lands into details of university governance, b) a drastically strengthened role of university leaders with their management boards including the deans of the departments, and c) a stronger differentiation of the higher education system as a whole, where (ideally) every institution finds its own, specific profile. In contrast to the former situation, many universities today obtain a significant part of their budget from competitive public sources and by third party funding from industry. Two developments have been of utmost importance for the system change over the past years: the European Bologna process and the Excellence Initiative of the German government. Their influence on graduate education and careers has to be seen in light of the German political and economic situation. As a country with only minor natural resources, we completely depend on the strength of our high technology industries and consequently on the excellence of our education and workforce on all levels. We can only keep wealth and a strong position in the world if we optimally prepare our present and future workforce for international collaborations. Last but not least, we face a dramatic demographic change resulting in the need to raise the best talents from Germany and abroad. At its inception in 1999, the \"Bologna Process was meant to strengthen the competitiveness and attractiveness of the European higher education and to foster student mobility and employability through the introduction of a system based on undergraduate and postgraduate studies with easily readable programmes and degrees\" (European Higher Education Area, 2009). Germany moved away from its classical one-cycle diploma system towards the internationally compatible two-cycle bachelor's and master's system. International exchange of students and \"employability,\" and thus a much stronger orientation towards economic needs have been the central goals for these new programs. Naturally, these changes have not always been appreciated in academia. These reforms quite often place an overemphasis on \"orientation to the present labor market\" and too detailed regulations for study programs enforced by accreditation agencies than could be observed. It has only been during the past two or three years that a movement towards a synthesis of traditional academic freedom in undergraduate and graduate programs and labor market orientation has evolved. Policymakers and the published opinion seem to have acknowledged now, that an optimal academic education cannot limit itself to training skills and factual knowledge, but prepares its graduates for lifelong learning in the framework of an ever-increasing knowledge society. In summary, the Bologna process, especially in its second round of reform, has clearly increased the responsibility of universities for supporting careers of (bachelor's and) master's students and economic development as a whole. In most German universities there is a strong resistance against the integration of the doctoral phase as the \"third cycle\" in the Bologna process similar to the first and second cycles of the bachelor's and master's programs respectively. The major argument is that the doctoral phase is not considered as a study phase but as the first phase of independent research as a professional scientist. As such, regulations which try to strongly formalize processes in doctoral education on a national or European level are considered to threaten the roots of the self-conception of academic freedom. This does not mean that universities would leave the responsibility for reinforcing the doctoral phase aside. Exactly the opposite is true, as universities consider their doctoral candidates as possibly the most important group for competitiveness in research. A lot of reforms are on their way, and the competition within the research focused Excellence Initiative plays a prominent role. The Excellence Initiative has been funding selected universities in a highly competitive process with approximately two billion Euros over the past five years and is presently in the review process for increased support until 2017. It is organized in three lines of funding, of which the first line supports the development of new graduate school concepts. The German Research Foundation (DFG) is responsible for the organization including the review process in this funding line and states, \"Graduate schools play a key role not only in developing internationally competitive centres of top-level research and scientific excellence in Germany but also in increasing their recognition and prestige. They serve as an instrument of quality assurance in promoting young researchers and are based on the principle of training outstanding doctoral students within an excellent research environment\" (Detsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, 2011). Presently, 39 graduate schools are funded by the Excellence Initiative and beyond this, universities which were not successful in this competition are now building up similar structures. Apart from administrating doctoral studies, most of these schools provide a broad transferable skills training program preparing their doctoral candidates for the labor market inside or outside academia and, more general, for taking over responsibility in society. Most graduate schools funded by the Excellence Initiative have a topical research focus (e.g. neurosciences, African studies); some of them are constructed as strategic instruments for the development of the university as a whole. Examples of the latter type are the Ruhr University Research School (Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, 2011) and the International Graduate School of Science and Engineering (IGSSE) at the Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, 2011). Both schools put strong emphasis on multidisciplinary, cross-border research. The IGSSE in particular supports networking with international partner universities in research projects, constructed as small and flexible bi-or even multi-national groups of young (and senior) researchers. According to the mission of technical universities, extensive collaboration with industry is included in the graduate school's concept, as well as its emphasis on supporting the future career of young researchers. At the IGSSE, the development of professional and entrepreneurial skills, of personality and responsibility towards society, is considered as important as that of technological and scientific competence. To summarize, reforms over the past 10-15 years have significantly improved the international compatibility and visibility as well as the competiveness of the higher education system in Germany as a whole. Universities are much more committed to developing a workforce and to educating for the labor market. On top of this, university leaders with farsightedness are well aware that a broad Bildung in connection with scientific excellence best guarantees success in a globalized world.

According to an official report, the employment rate of graduates from graduate school in 2011 is 72.1% (25,160 persons among 34,917 graduates), and about 60% of graduates with master's degrees get a position outside campus and about 10% of them continue their study for a doctoral degree. Despite this uncomfortable situation in the job market, for a long time universities and the government did not show serious concern for pathways from graduate school to careers. As an example on this matter, in general there is no information and service center for career development for graduate students on university campuses. Most departments or professors usually are concerned only with curriculum directly related to specialization and thesis requirements without concern for career development for graduate students. As a matter of fact, most faculty members may not recognize the importance of core capabilities needed in career paths of their students in the future. On the other hand, corporations today look for global talent who are ready with expertise and a professional attitude, wholesome values, creativity, a challenging spirit, and a \"team-player\" work ethic. In these aspects, the numbers of companies giving priority to applicants with internships in industry are increasing. As we see now, these gaps between university environment and the social need for capabilities to be fostered in graduate education have been raising mismatch issues as an urgent agenda to resolve in Korea. In recent years government and universities have been trying to improve the quality of graduate education and to enhance the capacity of graduate students. They introduced several measures to innovate the educational system at the graduate level with various programs and supporting systems like the BK21 (Brain Korea 21), WCU (World Class Universities), and GPS (Global PhD Support) projects. In 2003, the Korean government introduced an act promoting industry-university cooperation. As a result of such governmental efforts, 356 universities among 412 have established an \"Industry-Academic Cooperation Foundation\" on campus. The government also has been encouraging the establishment of technology holding companies, school enterprise, (local) customized departments, and technology licensing offices in universities. Moreover, as one of major policies for 2011, the Ministry of Education, Science, & Technology launched a project to promote the \"mutual growth of regional universities and industries.\" Government is trying to enhance systems to promote industry-university cooperation with the advancement and consolidation of financial support projects, encouraging various models such as industry-university companies, leaders in industry-university cooperation, industrial complex campus, etc. The government has been encouraging universities also to develop customized degree programs designed by university and industry. Moreover, the government has been promoting some special programs to enhance entrepreneurship education for university students in science and technology. For this purpose, the government plans to set up various centers for entrepreneurship education in 50 leading universities in 2012. Even though the government introduced various measures and programs to promote cooperation between industry and universities, there are still many difficulties to creating an agreeable progress in adopting innovative curricula and programs in graduate education reflecting needs of real world, technology transfer and commercialization, and the amount of investment in universities from industry. There are some important issues to be resolved to strengthen ties between universities and industry such as a lack of practicality of research results in universities, possible disclosure of a company's sensitive information, proper sharing of intellectual property, and a lack of incentive for industry in a legal or financial support system. Universities should change their attitude to have more serious concern for the future of graduate students after graduation. Particularly they should communicate with industry to recognize necessary capabilities for new-comers in the marketplace, including communication skills, writing skills, and leadership. Moreover they should take notice of changing winds in markets and global trends. They should pay attention to other items such as a special project or a license as an additional requirement of graduate degree, a mentor-mentee program with alumni or enterpriser as a practical career advisor, and entrepreneurship education to stimulate venture in university students. Moreover, for better performance in graduate education, the evaluation system of faculty members should be modified to recognize and give considerable credit to their activities and outcomes from university-industry cooperation. In Korea there does not exist enough data to support national strategy on pathways from graduate schools to careers, which is essential to establishing governmental policy on human resources in the future. The Ministry of Education, Science, & Technology has launched a couple of surveys on doctorate-degree holders. Some of interesting surveys are as follows: \u2022 A panel survey of doctors who received degrees in August 2007 and February 2008 to trace their economic activities; \u2022 A survey on career pathways of doctoral-degree holders in science and technology awarded by universities outside Korea; and \u2022 A Korean version of SED (Survey of Earned Doctorates), started in USA, operated every year since 2007 by the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training. In conclusion, to overcome many difficult obstacles faced now and to promote cooperation among government, industry, and universities, all stakeholders must mutually understand the win-win effect of active and practical cooperation, particularly the supply of excellent human resources with the capability to take on new challenges and the creativity and daring spirit to continuously nurture new values."}, {"section_title": "Graduate Education in Canada: Its Framework and Context", "text": "John (Jay) doering President, Canadian association for Graduate Studies dean, faculty of Graduate Studies, University of Manitoba national (federal) Context Post secondary education in Canada is the responsibility of the provinces. There is no national (i.e., federal) government agency that oversees education. The federal government's mandate is quite circumscribed; it funds research and related activities but not education. For example, the federal government funds Canada's three granting councils, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada, The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR). The combined budget of the three granting agencies is approximately 2.3 billion dollars annually. In additional, the federal government has funded national initiatives such as the Network Centres of Excellence (NCEs), Canada Research Chairs (CRCs), the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI), Canada Excellence Research Chairs (CERCs), and the Knowledge Infrastructure Program (KIP). The vast majority of universities in Canada are publicly funded. The two principal sources of funding for a Canadian university are tuition (and ancillary fees) and funds from its provincial government. The provincial method of funding universities varies by province. Some provinces provide a block grant to each university, which is ostensibly independent of enrolment, while others provide a grant related to undergraduate and graduate head counts. While the linkages and interconnections between graduate education and the economic/workforce development are probably obvious to those of us in academia, ensuring the federal government's awareness is typically undertaken by associations in Canada. Two such associations are the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC) and the Canadian Association for Graduate Studies (CAGS). AUCC is currently celebrating its 100th year as \"the voice of Canada's universities,\" representing 95 public and private not-forprofit universities and university-degree-level colleges. CAGS, which celebrates its 50th anniversary next year, represents 58 universities offering graduate-level programs. Both organizations make budget submission recommendations to the federal government's House of Commons Finance Committee. Recent submissions to the Finance Committee have shown that the value of a university degree in Canada has never been higher. Why? Between 2004 and 2009 the employment of bachelor's and graduate degree recipients rose by 22% and 28%, respectively; in comparison, employment of college 1 and high school graduates during the same period rose by only 16% and 4%, respectively. Canadian data shows that the income of a university graduate increases rapidly and consistently throughout their careers. For example, 2005 census data showed that a male with a graduate degree earned about 10% more than a male with bachelor's degree and 60% more than a male with a high school diploma. No data was given for female graduates. It is important to note that these higher income earners will pay higher taxes and have more disposable income to inject into the economy. Moreover, university graduates in Canada tend to have a healthier lifestyle and are, therefore, less of a burden on our health care system as well as other social safety nets, such as welfare and employment insurance. There are also demographic changes driving the need for enhanced graduate education in Canada. It is estimated that by 2030 the number of Canadians over 65 years of age will double, while the number of Canadians between 24 to 64 years of age will increase by just 8%. This shift in demographics towards an aging population will increase the demand for a range of professionals whose training occurs at universities and increasingly in graduate programs. Such graduate professional degrees include, but are not limited to, occupational and physical therapists, physician's assistants, orthodontists, and oral surgeons. Increasingly, master's degrees are being preferred in disciplines such as engineering, education, social work, arts, and science."}, {"section_title": "local (Provincial/Manitoba) Context", "text": "As noted above, the funding provided to a university is a provincial responsibility. There is considerable disparity between provinces with respect to the per head funding of (graduate and undergraduate) students. The province of Ontario set ambitious goals a number of years ago to double its graduate student body; a significant sum of money was offered to achieve this goal. Other provincial governments, such as Manitoba, have not articulated any explicit undergraduate or graduate student enrolment goals. Rather these matters appear to be left to the province's universities to set. The Government of Manitoba does have a six-point \"Innovation Framework\" action plan. The first three points of its six-point plan are potentially relevant to graduate studies, the economy/workforce, and research. They are: 1. Develop a skilled workforce that meets the needs of an everchanging economy; 2. Strategically invest in research that builds on Manitoba's economic strengths; and 3. Strategically invest in technology and commercialization activities that develop and attract opportunities.

The majority of PhD and postdoctoral fellows are ultimately employed outside of academia. It is no surprise, therefore, that stakeholders such as industry, funding agencies, healthcare, and nonprofit agencies understand the need for highly-qualified personnel in order for Canada to be competitive in a knowledge economy. Many of Manitoba's larger industries work closely with the University of Manitoba to try to ensure an adequate supply of master's and doctoral graduates.

Canada needs a highly educated workforce to compete in the global marketplace. The cost of various graduate degrees in Canada tend to reflect the income potential associated with employment upon completion of the degree. Professional degrees typically have higher tuition fees than non-professional degrees. For example, at the University of Manitoba, graduate students in professional programs such as orthodontics, business administration, and the School of Medical Rehabilitation, to name a few, pay higher fees than graduate students in non-professional research-or thesis-based programs.

Most (if not all) provinces have a body responsible for the oversight of post-secondary education-this ties into quality assurance.

Master's and doctoral graduates are expected to help the nation advance its position in the global economy, but also to support a \"critical and engaged citizenship\" that will advance social justice.

Dr. Skrbis was of the same mind, emphasizing the importance of introducing graduate students to career information early in their programs.

The presentations and discussion set the groundwork for building consensus on one of the summit's common principles for building pathways from graduate school to careers: communication about the value of graduate professionalization is based in part on accurate tracking of graduate student career outcomes and using that information to improve graduate programs.   Editors' note: Participants from different countries use different terms to refer to faculty members who oversee a graduate student's research and training. Outside the US, the term \"supervisor\" is often used to refer to the main faculty member in charge of directing a graduate student's thesis or dissertation. In the US, the more common term for this role is \"advisor.\" A senior colleague told me recently that she only agreed to supervise for a doctorate those who she was unable to talk out of it. Her argument was that while doing a PhD is terrifically rewarding, it is also a difficult and frustrating task, involving a long-term commitment by both student and supervisor and that, accordingly, the student had to have a clear reason for embarking on this journey and to ask her supervisor to join her in doing so. In essence this colleague was engaged in career guidance at its crudest level-advising students to only embark on something if they know why they are doing it, where it is taking them, and that it will provide the desired opportunities. The benefits of this approach for the colleague are that she only supervises motivated goal-focussed students. She reports having had a very good experience as a supervisor, with hard-working eager students, a relatively short completion time and very low drop-out rate, and the students being successful in terms of achieving (academic) positions after completion of the PhD. Multiplied across many supervisors one can see the institutional benefits of this career guidance-high-quality students who achieve, secure good positions after graduation, and enhance the academic reputation of the institution. While there may be benefits of this approach there are also costs as the gifted, curious but non-directed potential student may be turned away. Such an approach may also limit the range of students accepted into the institution, with a greater emphasis on academic careers than is reflected in the career destinations of doctoral students. Career development must start early in a doctoral candidate's tenure and continue throughout. It must be responsive to the needs of students entering a breadth of careers but also provide clarity to future employers of these students in terms of \"what you get\" when employing a doctoral graduate from the institution. It must be recognized that the future needs of our doctoral students, even for appropriate entry-level employment, extend beyond academic research skills and disciplinary expertise. Doctoral students make significant contributions to the quantity and quality of research outputs in any research-intensive university. As our junior colleagues, we must strive to provide PhD students with an environment in which these future leaders can flourish. The reputation and strength of the university will continue to grow and advance through their ideas, work, and research. It is imperative, therefore, that we not only attract and recruit high quality doctoral students but that we also support their drive for success in their studies. No longer is enabling students to produce a doctoral thesis sufficient; the PhD student demands, and requires, more from the host institution than the opportunity to become a foremost expert in a specific domain of study. 1 Further, a higher percentage of PhD graduates are now working outside the academy upon completion than inside it. Postgraduate students are increasingly pointed towards non-academic careers. Already over half of all new doctorates worldwide are employed outside the academy. As academics and PhD supervisors, we are not then seeking merely to reproduce ourselves, to foster the next generation of academics, but rather to guide individuals who will make their mark in a diverse range of fields. It is incumbent on an institution that wishes to maintain a position as a preferred destination for high quality postgraduate students to be known as one that provides the opportunities for students to acquire and develop additional, transferable skills, and that provides guidance to students as to those skills on which they should be focussing. Besides disciplinary research skills, doctoral students also need generic and professionally-transferable skills, to include academic and professional writing, presentation skills, library and information skills and project management. Producing better-rounded graduates will reap reputational benefits for the institution with graduates who are well prepared to enter their chosen career with relevant skills, in addition, of course, to high quality research skills as demonstrated by the achievement of gaining a PhD, in most countries (including New Zealand) the highest studied-for degree attainable. This last point cannot be emphasized enough-while I am advocating the need for doctoral students to be afforded a broader skill set within the tenure of their doctoral studies this cannot come at a cost to the quality of the PhD work, as presented in the doctoral thesis. The PhD is recognized internationally for the high quality of research, scholarship and creative work it encompasses, the defining criterion of the PhD worldwide being the need for a unique contribution to knowledge. While the quality of the thesis needs to remain high, however, I posit that there is some room for a reduction in quantity 2 in order to enable the thesis student to complete their thesis in the same length of time whilst obtaining a broader portfolio of skills. What skills, in addition to those acquired through the course of their doctoral studies, are required then becomes the important question. The answer is crucial both for the institution to inform the development of provision of such skills to students and crucial to students as they prepare for life after the PhD. To answer this question it is important that we consult widely: while academics can advise well as to the skills needed in an academic portfolio and assist with the development of the provision of such, 3 they are often not best placed to advise on the skills needed for those who wish to pursue a career outside of the tertiary sector. While still a necessary requirement for an academic position a student with only a PhD thesis will be neither competitive nor prepared for an academic post-more is needed in their portfolio. Accordingly, tertiary institutions, including the NZ universities, typically run a course or series of workshops/seminars for doctoral candidates looking to pursue an academic career, and provide opportunities for such students to become involved in other aspects of academic work beyond their individual research. Increasingly, advanced doctoral students are invited to contribute to teaching and supervision of lowerlevel students (Feldon, et al., 2011), are being invited to participate in laboratory or research groups, writing groups, and journal clubs, to facilitate academic debate, and to engage in committee activities. Such activities are of great benefit to those who participate and are likely to increase the academic job prospects of participants. In general, preparation for an academic career has received attention within the NZ universities. Less attention, however, has been paid to career development for those looking outside the academy upon graduation. Again one might ask what skills are needed. While the PhD cannot provide specialist training for each and every career opportunity to which graduate may be drawn, we can ask whether there are a set of generic skills or competencies that could be provided for these students that would enhance their career development across a variety of domains. To do so would provide individual students with a competitive edge in the job market and, by doing so, enhance the reputation of the institution amongst those employers. Advice about what such generic skills might be must be sourced from those with appropriate insight: career advisors, employers of graduates, alumni. Employers have clearly indicated that both transferrable, academic skills and the capacity for effective professional networking are valued in non-academic workplaces. Many of the skills so identified (e.g., presentation skills, networking skills) are ones that are consistent with academic pursuits (e.g., conference attendance) but are generalizable beyond and accordingly do not provide a challenge to those who might claim that the inclusion of such career development skills would \"take away from\" the academic rigour of the PhD research. Over recent times there has been greater follow-up of postgraduate students. Such follow-up provides valuable information regarding the development of skills courses-what do alumni wish they had done during their doctoral studies that might be included for the next cohort? Individual universities have maintained contact with alumni to a greater or lesser extent. In an international first the Graduate Longitudinal Study NZ is being launched in 2011. This survey will follow students in NZ graduating in 2011 for a 10 year period. This tracking will provide invaluable information to universities that can be incorporated into the development of future courses and opportunities for students. Such tracking of graduates also, of course, provides marketing opportunities, highlighting successful alumni and linking that success to their university study and broader experience. A successful institution of the future cannot afford not to invest in career and skill development for all its graduates. Morally universities cannot take students in, take ever increasing fees from them, support them through their specialist studies but not provide a broader skill base, and then cast them out with no assistance in entering the workplace. The reputation of the institution will not survive without increased attention to preparing graduate students for life post-PhD, whether that be within or without the academy.  New Zealand largely follows the UK model in offering a thesis-only PhD degree.\nThe professional purpose of various degree types is a controversial issue at most graduate institutions, and there are likely to be ongoing debates about many questions. To what degree should professional training be built into different types of graduate curricula, and to what extent should this training be provided by central university offices such as the Graduate School or Career Center? At the PhD level, how can students be better informed about a wide range of career opportunities that relate to their education and research training and supported by their mentors and peers to explore these opportunities? Institutional data on students' career aspirations and actual career outcomes will help ensure that debates are informed by evidence.\nEmployers increasingly expect master's and doctoral graduates to possess both a deep understanding of a specialized topic and a broad range of skills in communication, team building, and interdisciplinary The past few decades have seen dramatic changes in the shape of academia, and in the career prospects of our graduate students. The numbers of graduate students around the world have grown rapidly, while the proportion of PhDs entering the professoriate has declined. For example, between 1998 and 2008, the number of science doctorates earned grew about 40% for OECD country members (Cyranoski, Gilbert, Ledford, Nayar, & Yahia, 2011). During that time, the numbers of doctorates earned in China grew at an even more impressive pace, growing by more than a factor of 5, and now producing more PhDs annually than any other country in the world Similar levels of growth have been seen at the master's level (He, 2010). At the same time, the numbers of PhD students who obtain positions as university professors has declined. In Canada, 34% of PhDs were university professors in 1996, but by 2001, that number had declined to 24%. As the numbers of graduate students continue to increase and the opportunity for faculty positions fails to maintain pace, that proportion seems likely to continue decreasing for the immediate future. For example, in 2007, Canadian universities granted approximately 4,800 PhDs and employed approximately 6,000 postdoctoral researchers, but only about 2,600 new full-time faculty members were hired (Crawley, 2009). These shifts are not unique to Canada, and, although some of the decline in the proportion of students moving into academia clearly is due to a mismatch of supply and demand, at least some part also comes from shifting goals among graduate students. For example, a recent study of PhD students from the University of California system showed that, by the end of their graduate school careers, only 36% of male and 27% of female students were interested in pursuing faculty positions at research institutions (Goulden, Frasch, Mason, & the Center for American Progress, 2009). Regardless of the cause of diminishing academic positions for graduate degree holders and postdoctoral fellows, as educators we need to respect our students' evolving goals and desires. To ensure the success of our students, it is increasingly clear that universities need to ensure not only that our graduate students are well trained in their specific discipline, but that they must develop \"transferable skills\" to succeed regardless of their ultimate career path. A number of regional and national organizations that focus on graduate education (e.g., the Council of Graduate Schools (US) and the Canadian Association of Graduate Studies (Canada)) have developed proposals for a core set of such transferable skills for which graduate students should receive training beyond the labs and libraries. These core skills include communication, leadership and management, creativity and entrepreneurship, teaching and knowledge translation, and ethics (Wendler, et al., 2010; Canadian Association for Graduate Studies, 2008). Ideally, all of these core skills would be taught within the framework of 21 st Century fluencies, including digital, media, and global fluencies. Given the tradition of graduate training programs, however, what is the best way to ensure that students receive adequate opportunities for learning transferable skills in addition to discipline-specific knowledge? We cannot assume that all programs will take up the charge themselves, nor should we assume that any program has the capacity to train students in all relevant aspects of transferable skills in an optimal manner. Instead, we need to recognize that universities must cultivate an ecosystem to support the development of transferable skills. As noted above, an ecosystem normally is defined as \"the complex of a community of organisms and its environment functioning as an ecological unit.\" In his recent book, Enchantment (2011), Guy Kawasaki highlights the importance of building people-based ecosystems in companies to ensure success of worthy initiatives and ideas. Such people-based ecosystems can and should be applied to the university setting as well, particularly in the context of training transferable skills. In an ecosystem, different people or groups of people will play different, but inter-related roles, complementing and building on each other: the ecosystem for developing transferable skills includes a community of faculty, students, staff, administrative offices and academic programs within the university, as well as partners external to the university. McMaster University's approach to training transferable skills is one example of the benefits of a cultivating an ecosystem. The School of Graduate Studies clearly is a key component in the ecosystem, but we have neither the resources nor the expertise to ensure that all aspects of transferable skills are taught. Instead we partner with a range of other groups, both within the University and beyond. In all cases, we try to ensure that activities are coordinated, and we often provide financial support and/or in-kind support to ensure graduate students and postdoctoral fellows are adequately engaged in the full range of programs and initiatives. The administrative departments within the university with whom we partner include, but are not limited to: the Centre for Learning and Leadership, who offer a wide range of workshops and programs related to teaching and learning; the McMaster Research Ethics Board, who lead a range of training programs on research ethics; the McMaster Industry Liaison Office, who provide training on intellectual property issues and entrepreneurship and who help connect our graduate students and postdoctoral fellows with industry research opportunities; the Research Office for Administration, Development & Support, who provide information and support related to research grant development; the University Library, who support initiatives in digital media and knowledge translation; the Student Success Centre, who provide workshops on career development and life skills; the Alumni Affairs Office, who have supported networking events and business dining etiquette programs; the Offices of International Affairs and International Students, who have helped ensure successful transitions for students coming to Canada and traveling abroad for their studies; and the Graduate Students Association, with whom we work to support social activities as well as recognition events for graduate students. We also include the faculties and graduate programs in our ecosystem, and work with them to support initiatives that teach transferable skills at the faculty or departmental level. For example, our Department of Religious Studies recently hosted a Wabash Centre Workshop to provide graduate students with discipline-specific training in teaching. Our interdisciplinary neuroscience program routinely engages students in organizing symposia and conferences, providing students with valuable training to work cooperatively and manage projects. And the faculty of Health Sciences hosts conferences specifically for students and postdoctoral researchers in their faculty, including explorations of academic and non-academic career options. The students and postdoctoral researchers themselves are an essential part of the ecosystem. Our ecosystem cannot thrive without strong intellectual communities among the students, and we support those communities with a range of programs, including Dine with the Dean, in which students and postdoctoral researchers from across the campus come together to engage in discussion with individuals from within the University and beyond. After a recent discussion with a local community leader on the topic of social innovation, a number of students self-organized into a reading group, to continue the discussion well after the last brownie was served. That sort of occurrence highlights the fact that the School of Graduate Studies' role in the ecosystem is not to drive all aspects of transferable skills training, but to ensure that the people have the opportunity to come together and to learn how to move ideas and initiatives forward on their own. Our goal is to develop a sustainable environment for furthering graduate student and postdoctoral intellectual communities, because through the students' own initiatives they learn so much more than they would in top-down-driven programs. Finally, our ecosystem includes partners beyond the University: industrial partners with whom our students and postdoctoral researchers gain valuable real-world research experience; local organizations, with whom they work to develop leadership skills; community arts partners, with whom, for example, we provide students and postdoctoral researchers with improvisational theatre training to enhance their communication and collaborative skills; national partners, such as Mitacs, with whom we collaborate to provide professional development training programs on a wide range of topics (www.mitacs.ca/step/); and global partners, who are increasingly important as the numbers of international collaborations growin 2006, 42% of Canada's research publications were completed in collaboration with international partners (Filliatreau, 2008, p. 402). Whereas any one of the groups within our broad ecosystem would be unable to meet all of the needs of our graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, together we can achieve much more, much more efficiently. As Kawasaki points out (2011), the ecosystem approach, when done right, also is self-sustaining: groups want to be part of the ecosystem when they see success, because the success of different groups is intertwined. The success of ecosystems for developing transferable skills ensures the success of our graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in any career path they choose. Nowadays, with the rapid development of science and technology, there is a large demand for a vast variety of professionals, while occupational classification becomes more specific and more jobs require high-tech and specialized knowledge. China, however, has mainly aimed at training academic postgraduates who could not adapt to the requirements of occupations. The enrollment scale of the Academic Master's degree is too large while that of the Professional Masters is too small, constituting only ten percent of the total. Meanwhile, scarce categories of professional and profession-related degrees result in a grave shortage of high-level applied professionals and a gap with the needs of socio-economic development. To solve the problem, China is actively adjusting the structure of postgraduate education and gradually changing the academic-oriented Master's educational system into a profession-oriented one. Under the circumstances, Xiamen University has changed its goal and pattern of postgraduate education accordingly. It has actively adjusted the structure of postgraduate education, expanded the proportion of Professional postgraduates and strengthened students' creativity and practical abilities. The Graduate School at Xiamen University has tried to enhance postgraduates' employability and competitiveness to adapt to the development of science and technology and social economy in the following six aspects. \nFFTF has provided enormous benefit to graduate students in a wide range of disciplines at Indiana University and to the host campuses. As the only major fellowship offered by the Bloomington campus for advanced graduate students that has the specific goal of enhancing preparation for careers in college teaching, many students compete for the dozen or so fellowships available each year. Host campuses are eager to have Fellows join their faculty for a year. The success of the FFTF experience among the Indiana University campuses has led to expansion of the program to other liberal arts institutions and master's-serving institutions within the region. A partnership with regional institutions provides additional opportunities for doctoral students, and enables the program to accommodate more students. A recent initiative has extended the program beyond the region to Howard University located in Washington, DC, an HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities). This program is unique from the typical FFTF model in that it involves a reciprocal exchange with a major doctoral granting institution. A doctoral student from Indiana University teaches at Howard for a year with the aim of the student experiencing a very different teaching and cultural environment from what is found in Bloomington. In turn, an advanced doctoral student from Howard serves as a Fellow on the Bloomington campus. The hope is that this program becomes a successful way to recruit underrepresented minority graduate students to the Bloomington faculty and lead to other collaborations between the institutions. If all goes well, collaborations with other minorityserving institutions may be sought. Although current collaborations are within the US, there have been discussions between the University Graduate School and institutions in China regarding adapting an FFTF arrangement for Indiana doctoral students who plan to seek academic appointments in Chinese institutions or who desire an international teaching experience. The thinking is that this would be a good mechanism to facilitate placement and provide other advantages for doctoral students and the institutions. Clearly, the FFTF model is one the University Graduate School hopes to expand broadly. The FFTF program has proven to be a successful way to provide graduate students particularly interested in faculty careers in liberal arts colleges and master's-focused institutions with a unique opportunity to experience life as a faculty member while also gaining skills that will be critically important as they pursue an academic career. As a multi-campus endeavor, FFTF enhances cooperation among Indiana University campuses and holds the promise to build partnerships in graduate education with different types of institutions nationally and internationally. which is a pre-condition for the scholarship. This course focuses on ensuring the candidates are prepared for the research component of their graduate studies. However, after running this course for more than twenty years, various stakeholders both at the public universities and the Ministry are now questioning its impact and effectiveness. There have also been suggestions to provide other training courses. Recently the Ministry decided to play a more active role in providing other aspects of training for their SLAB/SLAI scholars to ensure they complete their graduate studies successfully within the stipulated time, as well as having the necessary skills and competencies that make them valuable future academics in the Malaysian public universities. The Ministry requested the Malaysia Deans of Graduate Studies Council (MyDEGS) organize a series of training for their SLAB/SLAI recipients. Thus, MyDEGS organized the National Graduate Symposium on 17-18 September 2011 at Universiti Teknologi Petronas with the theme of \"The Graduate Journey: Mapping a Smart Route to a Successful Completion.\" The symposium focused on guiding 300 academics in their first year of doctoral programme to conduct their research with effective time management in order to graduate on time (GOT). The symposium agenda included plenary forums and talks on fast-track programmes, research ethics and scholarly integrity, interpersonal skills, stress management, publication strategies, and a knowledge-sharing session on graduate life experiences by doctoral graduates from various parts of the world. One of the indicators that is intended to be used for these participants is the time it takes for them to successfully complete their doctoral studies in Malaysian public universities. In January 2008, the Ministry established AKEPT (www. mohe.gov.my/akept), a higher education leadership academy that is responsible for human capital development in the transformation of higher education in Malaysia. AKEPT provides leadership development for the top and middle management of Malaysian universities by offering courses that will lead to a certification programme. AKEPT is comprised of three main centers, namely the Center for Leadership Training, the Center for Learning and Teaching (CLT), and the Center for Leadership Research and Innovation (ACLRI). The approach used by CLT is to collaborate with national stakeholders and internationally-renowned agencies to provide relevant and pragmatic training programmes. By organizing a series of continuous professional development training, workshops, seminars, and forums for higher education leaders and master trainers, each institution develops the capacity to innovate their own teaching and learning based on international and local best practices. Nevertheless, there has not been any specific measurement developed to assess the impact of this training provided by AKEPT CLT. The ACLRI, on the other hand, administers the Competency Profiling Programme to identify the essential skills and knowledge needed for the higher education leaders to excel in their respective areas and levels of management. It identifies and nurtures a talent pool for succession planning by continuous assessment and improvement of the participants' competencies through the provision of pragmatic and relevant training courses. Participants' feedback received at the end of each programme is analysed to ensure best practices are continuously adopted. institutional level Pff initiatives: The UTM Case In 2001, the Faculty of Computer Science & Information Systems in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) streamlined its computing graduate programmes into three tracks according to the relevant career outcome. The tracks and programmes are: (1) the Academic and Research Track, offering PhD/Master's in Computer Science for future academics and/or researchers; (2) the Professional Track, offering the Master's in Information Technology and Master's in Software Engineering for those who will be serving as ICT professionals/ practitioners in the ICT industry; and (3) the \"Technopreneurship\" Track, offering the Master's in IT Entrepreneurship for those who wish to set up their own ICT business. Students were given relevant training and courses according to their chosen track. The courses were conducted in collaboration with the relevant partners in industry and government. The Academic and Research Track provided elective courses that developed their research skills with attachments to relevant research groups that provided research grants and opportunities for research exhibition/ competition. The Professional Track involved various computing associations providing training and certification in common tools and technologies used in industry. Opportunities for industry attachment in companies with large IT departments were also incorporated in the curriculum. The master's in IT Entrepreneurship programme within the Technopreneurship Track involved extensive collaboration between UTM and MARA, a government agency responsible for the development of local entrepreneurs. MARA entrepreneurship development officers and local ICT entrepreneurs worked with the academic lecturers to provide the students with both credited and noncredited courses that developed their business and technology skills. The effectiveness of these courses within these three tracks was measured by tracking the career outcomes of the graduates ten years down the road. Indeed a majority of the graduates do actually become what they aspired to be when they joined the graduate programmes. preparing future faculty in malaysia Nonetheless, it is also noted that academics came not only from the Academic and Research Track, but also from the other two tracks. Quite a significant number of the students decided to pursue an academic career immediately upon their graduation because of the opportunities provided through the SLAB/SLAI funding schemes provided by the Ministry of Higher Education.\nThis article has highlighted that Malaysia needs to establish formal PFF initiatives, which should be initiated at the national level, either by a dedicated agency under the Ministry such as AKEPT, or in collaboration with the public universities via the Malaysia Deans of Graduate Studies Council (MyDEGS), or both. The Ministry can provide grants that can be used by MyDEGS to identify appropriate programs and activities to adequately prepare future faculty members from amongst Malaysian graduate students.\nThe discussion raised important questions for universities to consider as they develop skill-based programs for students: what are the opportunity costs associated with embedding more professional training into graduate programs, or is the choice between broad training and specialized disciplinary education a false dichotomy? While there might be some incremental costs, participants agreed that the global knowledge economy has placed more urgent pressure on graduate schools to advance both types of skill sets in their students. using career data to enhance programs at the university of georgia\nThe programs and strategies described in Panel 5 suggest that universities are developing innovative strategies in response to global trends impacting research and education. Interdisciplinary and internationally-focused training, technological fluency, and universityemployer partnerships were all identified as useful strategies for preparing students for a globalized economy. The final and concluding session, Panel 6, built upon these examples to explore additional ways for universities to draw from the expertise and resources of national and international institutions and organizations.\nUniversities and graduate schools are well-positioned to initiate discussions and partnerships with a broad range of groups-including many not represented in this panel. As long as institutions and their partners can agree about common goals that serve the interest of graduate students and future professionals, such collaborations can serve to reinforce key messages about the importance of career preparation to graduate education. Not only do these collaborations have the potential to enhance career pathways for graduate students, they also may also provide incentives to faculty and students to seek out and welcome professional development opportunities on campus.

Guided by the philosophy of Total Quality Management in graduate education, the university has been placing great emphasis on career development for graduate students and has incorporated it as essential a part of graduate training as recruitment, training, and degree awarding. The university has been exploring possibilities and opportunities to prepare students for truly extraordinary careers in pivotal enterprises by providing on-campus professional training, joint education with overseas universities, career guidance and service to graduate students. The professional training at the university is offered in the form of a series of lectures in four modules with career development, scholarliness, interpersonal skills and leadership, and entrepreneurship included. These lectures are intended to help graduate students develop employability and professional skills and to prepare them for the job market. The more than 40 lectures are comprehensive and practical and are delivered by experts internal and external to the university. The graduate school encourages graduate students to attend the lectures and those who attend eight lectures and submit a final report will be given a credit. Besides, the university has wide collaborations with overseas universities in offering joint professional development programs for graduate students by taking advantage of the strength of both universities. In the year 2009, the university launched the program \"Global Technology Entrepreneurship\" in partnership with UC Berkeley. The goal of the collaboration is to foster the development of graduates, technologies, and services that will contribute positively He kebin to society. A variety of activities have been designed to meet the end of increasing employability and entrepreneurship skills, including course work, business plans, international forums, entrepreneurship competitions, etc. Many well-known venture capitalists are invited through the venture lab network to deliver lectures and guide students in their business plans as tutors. Another successful case which may deserve attention is the Imperial-Tsinghua Academic and Career Development Summer Program for Doctoral Students. This program was jointly offered by Tsinghua University and Imperial College London under the framework of the PMI2 project funded by the British government. The program aims at developing transferable skills and helping students successfully complete the transition from graduate study to career development. It also helps students better understand different cultures and learn to quickly adapt to work and study in an international environment. The program was received well by both faculties and students. The university is trying to find other collaboration opportunities with overseas universities in professional training. One of the programs in progress is the Leadership Program with National University of Australia, which has decades of experience offering professional training. Professional skills like leadership, communication skills, team work and project management are greatly emphasized in the program. On its way to becoming a world-class university, Tsinghua recognizes the significance of international education. The university currently offers 12 joint master's programs with overseas universities. Among the many benefits of the programs is that students may find good job opportunities in multi-national corporations. The students enrolled in joint education programs will study in overseas universities and have internship experiences in multi-national or joint ventures, which provide funding to the programs. In addition, \"study together and research together\" gets the students acquainted with international communication and endows them with a global vision, which is demanded of 21st century's talented professionals. To take the advanced master's program jointly offered with Mines Paris Tech as an example, the students enrolled are funded by French companies. The companies will get involved in students' selection, training, and supervision and offer internships. The students trained in the program will be probably recruited by the funding companies upon graduation. Moreover, the university provides career guidance and service at both the university and departmental levels. We collect campus recruitment information of employers and organize campus recruitment meetings, where students can have face-to-face interviews with desired companies or enterprises. The career service center offers training in terms of making CVs and interviews and inviting successful men and women in all walks of life to give reports on their professional development. To further increase the employment rate, the career service center has engaged time and effort in doing surveys and research in collaboration with overseas counterparts. One example is that the center has established links with British universities under the PMI2 project. They collect and communicate problems in employment of graduate students, share best practices, and make collective efforts in finding solutions to common problems faced by both partner universities. Overproduction of graduate students has become a big problem for graduate education in the world with the global trend of expansion of student recruitment. It is of great importance to create institutional cultures which make career and professional development as important as other components in total quality management in graduate education. We hope to promote exchanges in terms of enhancing employability with other universities and to learn from each other. We welcome opportunities to collaborate with you, not only in teaching and research, but also in the professional development of graduate students."}, {"section_title": "zlatko skrbis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Institutional Benefits of Supporting Career Development for Graduate Students: A View from the University of Queensland", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Zlatko Skrbis dean, Graduate School The University of Queensland", "text": "Much of contemporary discussion around educational policies focuses on the ostensible tension between career-focused vs. liberal arts education. The tension has recently reached philosophical heights with liberal philosopher Martha Nussbaum (2010) taking issue with Barack Obama and others who suggest that educators in places like Singapore and China are \"spending less time teaching things that don't matter, and more time teaching things that do. They are preparing their students not only for high school or college, but for a career. We are not.\" The dichotomy which appears to run through these debates is one that juxtaposes utilitarian against more liberal and cosmopolitan visions of educational purpose. Nussbaum's comments relate to college and high school, but are echoed by others who are concerned with universities. C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Allahar (2011) for example, emphasise the dangers of \"pseudo-vocationalism\" which accompanies the alleged corporatisation of universities and the associated fall of liberal education. Being a product of liberal education and one who made educational and career choices based on intellectual idealism rather than a well-crystallised understanding of career pathways, I confess being sympathetic to comments and concerns of the advocates of broad liberal education because it cultivates the imagination and the spirit of any well-rounded global citizen. I also strongly believe, however, that while the dichotomy between career-focused and liberal education allows us to crystallise opposing positions, I am not convinced that it has to be a stark choice as it often appears to be. At the graduate education level we face a similar tension, albeit not so much a tension between broadly liberal vs. career focused education as between the research project requirements vs. other skill sets that will be necessary when newly graduated PhD holders enter the labour market. The research/thesis project has its own disciplinespecific requirements, manifested in the challenge of finding a balance between allowing a student to spread the wings of conceptual imagination and to hone in on discipline/project-specific content. Much effort is put into ensuring the scientific competency of the student and academic integrity of training and the output. As various studies have now demonstrated, graduate training places rather limited emphasis on future career aspirations of graduates and in fact many graduate students start thinking about job preferences only in later years of their training (Russo 2011: 535). For all too many graduate students, the articulation of career prospects and labour market options are an afterthought or more-or-less accidental side effect of training rather than a proactively interrogated challenge. Also, the attractiveness of the PhD research project itself, and the all-consuming demands and trials and tribulations that accompany it, often militate against graduate students proactively engaging with questions of careers. It appears that, at the graduate level, there are multiple signs highlighting the need for more emphasis on careers. In the reminder of this paper, I will briefly interrogate these questions by showing how The University of Queensland (UQ) has confronted this challenge and I will then focus on the key question about the institutional benefits of career development. Like all research intensive universities, at UQ we take pride in high quality of research, the real-life impact of work and a successful alumni network. We provide a range of professional development opportunities, we strongly encourage PhD student inward and outward mobility, and our PhD experience is truly international. Not surprisingly, the career outcomes of our graduates are very positive. But there are at least two problems with this positive picture. First, the above outcomes are predicated on the assumption that the employment market for our graduates is expanding, or that it is at least stagnant. Second, these outcomes are somewhat accidental because-although they are based on good practice-they are a product of largely unstructured mechanisms within our research training paradigm. There are additional external factors that we need zlatko skrbis to take into account: the tightening of employment opportunities for PhD graduates in some parts of the labour market (Cyranoski, Gilbert, Ledford, Nayar, & Yahia, 2011); an increased competition at the high end of the graduate training market; an ethical responsibility to ensure that graduate students think and plan for their careers. At UQ we undertook an extensive amount of research to better understand these challenges. Our starting point was a study conducted in 2004 of PhD graduates at the Group of Eight (Go8) universities in Australia, surveyed five to seven years out from graduation (Western et al., 2007). The broad aims of the study were to determine the employment outcomes, job attributes, and quality of research training of those graduates. One of the key findings of this research was the importance of career-enhancing skills acquired during PhD training and relevance to their current job. We supplemented these findings with almost a year-long independent study. We conducted survey and focus group research on career pathways and professional skills development with current and prospective PhD students, surveyed a cohort of recent graduates, and held one-on-one interviews with industry partners. We also facilitated discussion groups for postgraduate coordinators, Heads of Schools, and Associate Deans (Research). At the end of this process we designed three \"UQ Career Advantage\" packages which optimally align with indicated career pathways of PhD students, UQ institutional strengths, and the preferences of our industry partners. The three packages are: Higher Education Practice and Leadership (for students who intend to prepare for careers in academia), Research Innovation, Translation and Commercialisation (for students who intend to work in translational research, a commercial environment, or to straddle the worlds of research and industry), and Global Collaborations (for students whose career are likely to launch them into an international research, innovation, or translational networks). All PhD candidates at UQ will be strongly encouraged to avail themselves of at least one of these packages. Students will select individual packages at confirmation, around 12 months into a PhD program. They will be available at no cost and will consist of intensive three-day workshops, offered twice every year to accommodate different activities that impinge on students' availability through the year (e.g., fieldwork, international travel), and a series of other structured activities available throughout the year. One of the key changes which the introduction of this UQ Career Advantage PhD program signals is the departure from our current casual approach to career planning. This program will encourage PhD students and their advisory teams to seriously pause and consider, at a defined point in their candidature, what career trajectory the candidate is most inclined to pursue. And the university will then support them by providing opportunities to develop professional networks, to take advantage of additional training activities, and to acquire a skill set required to equip them to meet challenges. Importantly, this program does not take attention away from the research project, which represents the core of PhD training. Instead, it promises to enhance the PhD experience itself and will make the transition from study into career much smoother. Rather than increasing the tension between research and career focus of PhD training it is designed to interweave the two into a coherent whole. Finally, what are the key expected institutional benefits of this UQ Career Advantage Program which will be launched in September 2011 and implemented in 2012? I have already identified some key reasons which led us to develop these programs in the first place. However, there are clearly some benefits which UQ as an institution can expect to derive from its increased focus on career pathways of its PhD students. There are some that are likely to be seen as UQ-specific but they are also likely to be of generic value to any institution which intends to highlight and implement programs which will place more emphasis on career options of its graduates."}, {"section_title": "Institutional Benefits:", "text": "1. Added purpose to the existing linkages between the university and strategic partners. Our internal research that led to the development of the UQ Career Advantage Program involved our long-standing institutional domestic and international partners in industry, the private sector, and governmental and not-for-profit sectors. We found that these partners have used the discussion on career pathways as a hook for multiple other opportunities which have not been considered before. 2. Improved and strengthened alumni relations and networks. Alumni are an integral part of the UQ Career Advantage Program. They will not only teach in our Program and provide placements for our candidates but will also be critical contact points with industry. Our emphasis on career pathways will ensure the strengthening of university-alumni relationships with all the auxiliary benefits (e.g., advancement) that may flow from this. 3. Market positioning. By focusing on PhD careers, the university clearly signals its intent to the market. Participation and successful completion of the program will be formally attested to by the university, thus providing candidates with a document which will attest to their additional skill set and experience. 4. Enhanced employability of PhD graduates. The program will assist graduates with articulating the breadth and relevance of the skill set that they have acquired as part of their research degree and how this can be applied to a broad range of industries, both in Australia and internationally. 5. Improved understanding of research amongst employer groups. Programs such as UQ Career Advantage will increase the understanding of the value of research and a research degree within the broader community and specifically amongst the employers."}, {"section_title": "Quality of Graduate Training:", "text": "1.

I will also describe how career development is addressed for our graduate students. Admitted in 1995, Emory University is one of the sixty-one research universities that comprise the AAU, Association of American Universities. The AAU focuses on issues that are important to researchintensive universities such as funding for research, research policy issues, and graduate and undergraduate education. The Association regularly examines the contributions of their research elite member universities on a number of dimensions, some of the most important being research productivity, capture of extramural federal dollars for research, and the production of doctoral graduates. Today, the Laney Graduate School has forty-one graduate programs, with almost ninety percent of its students pursuing doctoral degrees. This fall, we enrolled about 416 new students, and 80 percent were pursuing doctoral degrees. Our programs span the humanities, social sciences, biological and biomedical sciences, public health sciences, nursing, and business. Our programs are designed to culminate in the doctorate, masters, and in selected areas, certificates. The total enrollment in our graduate programs is just under 2,000, and the total enrollment of the University is just under 14,000. Our faculty are productive researchers and scholars with broad international collaborations, and we are consistently able to recruit extraordinary senior faculty and bright new stars. Let me say, too, that my purpose here is intended to paint a picture of a young US research elite university, and the positive competitive climate shaped by its leadership, faculty aspirations and activity, and the imagined and real excitement created for graduate students. Jonathan Cole, in his most recent book on The Great American University reminds us that faculties involved with doctoral study, more or less, carry forward the combination of activities in a portfolio of pedagogy that characterize the nineteenth century German university: lectures with the purpose of imparting new findings and historical background; seminars and laboratory experiences for advancing new knowledge; and professional emphasis on methods and techniques. Quite importantly, one of Cole's main points is that teaching and research cannot be separated. Embedded in this view, then, is the notion that teaching and learning \"how\" and \"what\" to teach, in the contemporary research university must take on a range of forms, and that our students must learn \"how, what and when\" to communicate their work and their collaborations to multiple audiences-especially to those outside the academy. This, in fact, is at the heart of contemporary career development. How do we increase value and importance to understanding the new realities related to career development? One way to enter the discussion posed by this question is to ask in return is, \"is it prudent and is it just to admit students for whom there are no jobs?\" If the \"jobs\" are understood to be those in the academy, we do face a dilemma. But, if we value and engage pathways beyond the professoriate-\"jobs\" in sectors that are not only in the academic research and scholarship sector-we can see opportunities for enhanced strength and vitality for graduate programs. Taken together, these views encourage, even urge, support for career development programming for graduate students that provides interdisciplinary exposure, research and communication skills, and lisa tedesco grant writing skills that address work engaged by multiple fields aimed at diverse audiences (not only disciplinary audiences). The problems of our times are increasing in complexity, and our worlds are more contiguous because of technology and connectivity. How should we provide programs for our students, and in some cases, for our faculty to meet the challenges before us? How can we diversify mentoring opportunities and shape professional networks to expose students to a broader array of career options? Across graduate education in the United States, career development, or professionalization programs, are delivered both through central graduate school activity and also at the program level, in field-or discipline-based contexts. Students also take on programming and design activities that meet their needs and interests. Sometimes university-supporting units, such as libraries and alumni associations, provide career development activity. At each juncture there is a communication opportunity, one that graduate school leadership can and should catalyze. The encouragement here is to use every channel and every pathway: central and local, top down and bottom up, from the inside and from the outside. In all cases, faculty, students, staff, and alumni are involved. Examples of how we are communicating with our alumni and friends about our professionalization programming can be found in two brochures that focus on the importance of student professionalization and ways that alumni can be involved and offer support: Professional Preparation of Our Students and Reimagining Graduate Education (James T. Laney Graduate School, 2011a; 2011b). Reshaping a culture for preparation of students for pathways that include the professoriate but also those beyond, is a challenging goal. Communicating the value of professionalization in open forums and other media is important to advance discussion in these areas, but it is not enough. At the Laney Graduate School, we find that the most effective way to communicate the importance of career development is by positioning it as a priority and offering programs that add value to our constituents' work and challenge them to broaden the scope of professional possibility. Our programming is diverse and designed to meet the professionalization needs of students while engaging stakeholders in their development such as faculty, leadership, alumni and other university resources. A list and brief description follows for some of our career development programming."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Professional Development Support Funds", "text": "(http://www.gs.emory.edu/resources/professional.php?entity_id=23) Through an application and review process, the Laney Graduate School makes available funds to support specific categories of graduate student professional development: conference participation, special training that is not available at Emory, and research that incurs extraordinary costs. The Professional Development Support program seeks to encourage and help students to compete for external funding as well as provide students with an opportunity to acquire specialized training and conduct preliminary research. \u2022 Grant Writing Program (http://www.gs.emory.edu/grantwriting) The purpose of the Grant Writing Program is to offer information, advice and feedback to Social Science and Humanities graduate students at every stage of grant writing, from the initial stage of project conception, to developing presentation strategies, addressing methodological issues, and finally, to the advanced stage of revising proposals for submission to external funding agencies (and subsequent review by multidisciplinary selection committees). \u2022 Teaching Assistant Training and Teaching Opportunity (or TATTO) (http://www.gs.emory.edu/resources/professional.php?entity_id=20) TATTO introduces graduate students to the profession of teaching in a supervised and graduated manner so that teaching responsibility increases along with their skill-sets. Participation in TATTO is a degree requirement for all doctoral students. The program has both centralized and decentralized elements and progresses in four stages over the course of a student's career. In what will be a degree requirement, the Laney Graduate School will offer a mixed-model program featuring centralized resources and support and cross-discipline workshops combined with discipline-specific training at the program level. The program will be implemented for students in the naturual and biological/biomedical sciences in 2012 and for students in the humanities and social sciences in 2013. \u2022 New Thinkers/New Leaders Fund (http://www.gs.emory.edu/about/special.php?entity_id=33) The New Thinkers/New Leaders Fund is designed to promote interdisciplinary innovation, intellectual enrichment, creative explorations in pedagogy and career pathways, and improvement to the climate and quality of graduate education. The Laney Graduate School invites graduate programs and cross-disciplinary programs of the University to submit applications for matching funds to support scholarly activities that enrich the mentoring experience of graduate students; foster cross-disciplinary investigation of complex intellectual problems; and develop innovative graduate programming to address the changing needs of graduate students as they prepare for a workplace that is increasingly defined by interdisciplinary, international, and comparative perspectives. \u2022  (Edwards et al., 2011) and report that Australian universities should actively facilitate more attractive pathways for research students into academic professions. The report also found research students perceived that research studies in Australia prepared them for research, but not very well for non-academic careers or university teaching. With the Australian Government's vision for 2020 to grow a strong researcher workforce to support innovation and economic growth (Commonwealth of Australia, 2011), a key driver promoted by this report is to provide researchers with clear career progression pathways to help meet career objectives as well as employer requirements. To support researcher employability, it is necessary to understand what researcher skills employers seek. A survey in Australia (Allen Consulting, 2010), found that employers rate problem solving, communication, initiative, and enterprise as the most important nontechnical skills needed by researchers. Employers also noted that a combination of business acumen, experience, and life skills also needed to be enhanced. In many Australian universities, there is no clear focus on developing these skill sets for research students. The key driver is to complete the research thesis, within a specified time (less than four years) and to the best possible quality. This focus, which is clearly important for both student and supervisor, can consume all other possible opportunities for professional development or career development planning. During this time, some students will have a relatively lonely existence, working steadily to review literature, collect and analyse data, and write a thesis that satisfies examination requirements. Supervisors, Heads of School, Executive Deans, and other higher education leaders need to reconsider budgets and focus for these courses, and place more effort in trying to nurture, capture, or refine valuable technical and generic skills that can be used to develop CV's and career plans and to enhance opportunities for employment. At Edith Cowan University, three key strategies have been used to try and promote the importance of career development to different groups on campus and to external stakeholders. These include: \u2022 SOAR Centre; \u2022 Supervisor Training; and \u2022 Employment Register (E-Recruit)."}, {"section_title": "Soar Centre (Support, opportunities, advice and resources)", "text": "At Edith Cowan University, the Graduate Research School (GRS) launched the SOAR Centre (Support, Opportunities, Advice and Resources) for Higher Degree by research and honours students in 2009. It was established to offer a peer-to-peer support and information with a focus on research training and career development ( Figure 1). Ten higher degree research students (Ambassadors) are employed by the SOAR Centre and trained to provide peer-to-peer support to other research students ( Figure 2). Ambassadors are selected through an interview process, based on essential requirements as well as key research skills such as SPSS, NVivo, literature reviews, research proposals, Endnote, writing skills, survey techniques, quantitative methods, qualitative methods, and IT troubleshooting. They are then trained on customer service requirements, how to respond in a timely and professional manner, interpersonal boundaries, specific needs of international students, and career planning. This training helps build their skills as well as their employability. They use these skills to support other research students. Research students can book appointments with a SOAR Ambassador via the SOAR Centre's website (http://www.research. ecu.edu.au/grs/soar/), or they can drop in unannounced. Generally clients access the centre because they have an immediate need such as needing help with formatting a document, referencing, or statistical analysis. Other students access the centre because they wish to work on a long-term goal such as seeking advice on career paths, resources, or academic English writing. Visits vary depending on the time of the year and the stage of the client's research.  Ambassadors are trained to set career goals early in their candidature, to document achievements, and to use CareerWorks (http://www.careersolutions.com.au/pages/products/2_01_CareerWorks. htm), a career guidance database with features that allow users to selfanalyse their career direction, build action plans, create To-Do lists, and create a resume. A career development practitioner is contracted to conduct workshops to help SOAR Ambassadors understand how to integrate career guidance, goals/action planning, self-marketing, and provide career management across years.

The SOAR centre targets research students with a peer-to-peer advisory service that helps communicate research skills, support services, and career development advice at the grass roots level. Mandatory supervisor training with established templates helps supervisors undertake an active role in supporting skill and career development. The employment register provides a vehicle for research students to connect with casual employment opportunities within and outside the university, to help build their skills. These strategies provide some help in communicating and supporting the career development of research students. However, more still needs to be done in convincing academics, Heads of School, and other senior executives that career planning and professional skill development are critical issues, and cannot be ignored. Also, integrating professional development and career planning into mandatory academic progress reports each semester would also help raise awareness. To develop good enough career paths for graduate students, many Korean universities try to develop their specific strategies by adjusting to or overcoming the given environmental situations. In this talk, we introduce some strategies adopted by most Korean universities, and more specifically, the efforts and strategies undertaken by the Ajou University's Graduate School. introduction South Korea became independent after World War II, after being occupied for 36 years by Japan. In this period, the Korean economy was very primitive and mostly based on agriculture. When the Korean Civil War between North Korea and South Korea ended in 1951, the four-year war throughout the Korean Peninsula left everything destroyed. Therefore, you can safely say that South Korea took her first step toward transforming herself from a poor, agricultural country to an industrialized country in 1962, when the first five-year economic development plan started. To develop herself from the ruins of the war under the constraint of the lack of any significant natural resources, South Korea focused on developing her human resources. Thus the Korean Government has emphasized very strongly the development of high-quality engineers in such fields as Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering and Electrical Engineering. This policy has worked quite well for a rather long time and contributed strongly to the phenomenal growth of the Korean economy, culminating in her introduction to G20 as a member country in 2010. In the mean time, the Korean governmental policy on human resource development has changed from providing graduates in various engineering fields to providing masters or PhD specialists in order to adapt to a knowledge-based economy. In this talk, we will review how governmental policies on human resource developments have changed in recent decades and how Korean universities have adopted their policies to adjust to this variation of governmental policies. A discussion will also be made on the recent movements of Ajou University Graduate School on career developments as an example of a successful case.\nSouth Korea is a small, newly-developed country with a very high population density and negligible natural resources. Furthermore, Ajou is by no means a top-notch university of South Korea. Therefore, successful career preparation and development for master's and PhD graduates is critical for the purpose and existence of the Ajou University Graduate Schools. To this effect, Ajou University has introduced object-specific graduate schools and specially-designed courses in ordinary graduate school for students who prefer an industry-oriented career path with a master's degree. Typical examples are discussed for the easy understanding of our policy and our implementation methods."}, {"section_title": "Governmental efforts to Transform Graduate education in Korea", "text": "When the Korean government noticed that it should spearhead the effort to provide high-quality problem solvers to meet the human resource demands of the country's rapidly-growing economy, it started a formal program to promote research in graduate schools. In 1982, for the first time, the expression \"Research Facility\" was used in government's official documents to refer to universities. This resulted in the start of regular scientific research activities of the Korean universities in 1982. However, as we know, it takes time to achieve meaningful results when we start from scratch, and research at Korean universities only started to become productive in the early 1990s. Around this period, the developed countries in the world were transforming to the so-called knowledge-based economy. Moreover, unemployment began to rise during and after the Asian financial crisis in 1998 when the Korean government was forced to obtain financial support from the IMF. This crisis brought about a change in the country's social landscape and affected the transformation of the graduate schools of Korean universities. Before this crisis, the goal of government policy was to provide a sufficient number of master's and PhD graduates to the society, and graduates could easily find jobs. After the crisis, however, Korean companies became very selective in recruiting their higher degree employees. The aforementioned circumstance led the Korean Government to offer strong financial support for higher degree programs of Korean universities. The so-called BK 21 (Brain Korea for 21 st century), WCU (World Class University) and GPS (Global PhD Scholarship) programs were subsequently introduced to Korean universities following the change in the job market's demands. The objectives of these programs are different, however, depending on the social situation. For example, BK 21 aims to offer universal support for graduate schools, while WCU offers concentrated support for some selected graduate schools for convergence studies. The condition of the financial support to the Graduate Schools from the Korean Government is the universities' transformation to world-level competitiveness. Typical requirements of the government to foster a knowledge-based economy have been the reduction of inter-department barriers, the creation of interdisciplinary or crossdisciplinary departments for specific convergence studies, and the transformation of graduate departments to object-specific graduate schools for the master's degree, etc. For example, the LINC (Leaders in Industry-University Network Cooperation) Program, which will debut next year, will support around five million USD per year to 15 graduate schools for at least five years under the condition that the university should have specially-designed courses in their graduate schools to facilitate university-industry cooperation in the fields of national strategic industries, and recruit above a minimum number of professors with industry experiences. ajou University's efforts in Career developments for Graduate Students Korean graduate schools have worked hard for the last two decades to adjust themselves to the aforementioned changes of environment. To enhance the graduate schools' competitiveness and improve job opportunities of its graduates, most Korean Universities followed government policies of enhancing their research capability, establishing object-specific graduate schools and develop inter(cross)-disciplinary departments in ordinary graduate school. Moreover, as the Korean society demands more competitive master's or PhD degree graduates while job opportunities decrease, specifically-designed courses have been developed even in traditional graduate departments, and research topics have shifted toward more practical ones. Ajou University followed this trend, and the job opportunities of its graduates is found to be quite high compared to that of other graduate schools. The goal of Ajou University Graduate School is to lead (or at least adjust to) the social evolution as well as to cultivate the next generation of education. For that, the required fields should be open as possible. In some cases, however, it is possible only when the benefits of existing professors in the old departments could be suppressed by the academic authority. This is the reason why Ajou University Graduate School is eager to welcome new courses. Ajou University has developed 13 object-specific graduate schools, such as the Graduate School of International Studies, the Law School, and the Graduate School for Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The conceptual difference between ordinary graduate school and object-specific graduate schools is that the latter aims at special studies needed for the Korean society, while the former aims at classical academic activities. For an easy understanding of the difference between the two, let's take the students in ICT. As you might know, Korea's ICT industry has a strong international competitiveness, and demands many high-quality specialists. On the other hand, Ajou University has three undergraduate departments-the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department, the Department of Computer Science, and the Department of Media-within the College of ICT. We also have three corresponding departments in our ordinary graduate school for master's and PhD students and a graduate school for ICT specialists in software engineering. Students who wish to perform academic research may enroll in the ordinary graduate school, while candidates who are interested in a special intensive education geared toward advanced ICT with software engineering background may prefer the Graduate School for ICT. As another example, the Graduate School for International Studies at Ajou Universitiy admits roughly 40 students every year from around the world, of which more than half are international students. After two years of study, the students graduate with a master's degree in Social Science and have a chance to apply to international companies or government organizations in their country of origin. Since they have a strong competitiveness in their specialty, they have high job opportunity. When the graduates from object-specific graduate schools would like to further study for their PhD degree, they may do so in the relevant department of the ordinary graduate school. Another resolution Ajou University adopted to facilitate career development was to open a new department for inter(cross)disciplinary studies and/or design special courses supported by the industry or the national research institute in traditional departments of the ordinary graduate school. The department of Finance Engineering is a prime example of such process, which started around ten years ago in Ajou University. Another example is the NCW department which deals with national defense-related information technology. The students of the ECE department who major in electronic devices may not attend the Graduate School for ICT since relevant courses are not offered. However, students in the field who wish to join the industry with a master's degree may enroll in specially-designed courses, supported by Samsung Industry or LG Electronics, which sponsor entire master's and/or PhD programs under the condition that the graduates will join the supporting company after his or her study. The Advance Molding Technology course in the Mechanical Engineering Department of the graduate school, opened in the fall semester of this year, is another example. The course is tailored to the need of Samsung Electronics Company in adopting advanced molding technology for their products. At the ordinary Graduate School of Ajou University, such specially designed courses are very popular, and one can easily find such courses in many graduate departments."}, {"section_title": "Institutional Efforts to Track Career Outcomes for Graduate Students: A CGS Perspective", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Julia d. Kent director of Global Communications and Best Practices", "text": "Council of Graduate Schools"}, {"section_title": "U.S. Context for institutional Tracking efforts", "text": "In the U.S. as in many countries, our knowledge of the career trajectories of master's and doctoral students is far from comprehensive. There are currently good data on initial career and postdoctoral placements for U.S. PhDs, including data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), conducted by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) with support from the National Science Foundation and five other federal agencies, and from surveys conducted by professional societies (NORC, 2012). However there is relatively less information on initial career outcomes for master's degree recipients. For longer-term career trends, the most comprehensive source of U.S. data comes from the Scientists and Engineering Statistical Data System (SESTAT), which tracks degree recipients in the sciences, social sciences and engineering up to the age of 75 (NSF, 2012). 1 The Center for Research and Innovation in Graduate Education (CIRGE), which tracked PhD recipients in six major fields of study for ten years following degree completion, also provided data on career outcomes for graduates who completed their degrees between 1983 and 1985 (Cerny and Nerad, 1996;Nerad, Rudd, Morrison, andPicciano, 2007-2009). While these data sets have contributed to our understanding of past and current employment trends, there is generally a need for longitudinal data across all fields; improved data for specific fields such as the arts and humanities and education; for PhD students who pursue non-academic career pathways; and for recipients of master's degrees. As addressed in the U.S. paper for the first panel session, CGS launched a research effort in collaboration with the Educational Testing Service (ETS) to fill some of these gaps. The Commission on Graduate Education's Pathways through Graduate Education and into Careers has brought together leaders in higher education, employers, and government representatives to examine the steps needed to strengthen the link between graduate education and the U.S. workforce. The key goal of the Commission's work is to oversee a research effort to collect data on graduate students' knowledge of career options, how students learn about occupational opportunities, the role of graduate programs and graduate faculty in informing and guiding students along the path to professional occupations, and career pathways that graduate students actually follow. Meanwhile, U.S. universities are developing parallel approaches to understanding the employment outcomes of their own graduates. The Pathways report is designed in part to enhance these efforts and will allow U.S institutions to compare employment outcomes for their students to national trends (Wendler, et al., 2012). The following sections describe current and developing institutional approaches to tracking career data for graduates and CGS's role in supporting these efforts."}, {"section_title": "institutional Surveys of recent Graduates", "text": "Both public and private universities are seeking career outcomes data for their graduates for a variety of reasons: to assess and improve the quality of their programs, to improve the satisfaction of students, to attract competitive prospective students, and to remain in competitive standing with respect to peer institutions. In the case of state institutions, there are additional incentives to demonstrate that public funding is making significant contributions to the economic and social infrastructures of the state and to the employability of in-state students. It is fair to say that there is currently no standard approach to collecting data on students' career outcomes: methods may include a combination of exit surveys or focus groups involving recent graduates; alumni surveys; program or departmental data-keeping as required by the institution or graduate school; and the collection of institutional data for reports to existing national databases. In general, it is easier to collect data on initial job placements as part of university exit surveys or surveys of recent alumni who, compared to older alumni, are in relatively close contact with their institutions. A recent review of survey models used by a range of CGS institutions indicated that surveys of graduate students and recent alumni commonly request information on: \u2022 salary and current employer; \u2022 number of job offers received; \u2022 the degree to which a student's current career is related to career goals; \u2022 the skills used in the former student's current position; and \u2022 satisfaction with the current job. Universities may also ask graduates to indicate how well their programs prepared them for their current positions, how certain they currently are about professional goals, or which university career resources they used and whether these resources were helpful. Of course, tracking the career outcomes of graduate students presents a number of distinct challenges. Central university offices such as the alumni office are often in the best position to conduct outcomes surveys since they maintain the most up-to-date contact records for students and have the staffing and experience needed to implement large surveys of students from different programs. Yet they may have difficulty securing high response rates from master's or PhD students, who compared with undergraduates, affiliate more strongly with their departments and programs than with a central office representing the university as a whole. Meanwhile, academic staff in departments may lack time and interest in gathering career data for graduate students. This is particularly the case with PhD programs that value (highly or exclusively) research-intensive academic placements. Influenced by department cultures where non-academic positions are viewed as secondbest, students may be reluctant to share career outcomes that diverge from the career pathways most strongly valued by their programs."}, {"section_title": "Career aspirations and outcomes for Phd's", "text": "A number of universities and research centers have undertaken new efforts to understand employment aspirations and trends for PhD students, including employment pathways outside academe. Two of these programs were featured at the 2011 CGS Summer Workshop and New Deans Institute: A PhD Survey that seeks information about academic employment, post-doctoral placements, and non-academic careers at Princeton University and a new tracking initiative at The Ohio State University. The program also featured a combined research and educational project at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), a university that houses only graduate programs. In 2008, a research team at UCSF surveyed all doctoral students in the basic biomedical sciences in an attempt to understand the types of career paths students were considering and what changes in career aspirations occurred over the course of their doctoral programs (Fuhrmann, Halme, O'Sullivan, & Lindstaedt, 2011). The survey asked students first to indicate all careers they were currently considering. Responses indicated that the majority of students (92.3%) were considering careers in scientific research in the academic, industry, and government sectors, of which 72% were also specifically considering an academic career path in a researchintensive faculty position. However, when asked to choose only one preferred path, only 44.8% indicated a preference for a traditional academic career path, 26.9% preferred a research-intensive career outside academe, and the remaining quarter of students preferred nonresearch careers. The most popular choices for non-research careers were in the business of science, teaching or education-related careers, science policy, and writing. These results confirm reports from many U.S. universities with highly competitive doctoral programs: even while these programs attract qualified and high-performing students with the capacity to successfully complete their degrees, many admitted students have career goals that range widely and may diverge from the career pathways for which they are principally trained. The projects described above are likely to generate new knowledge about the employment aspirations and outcomes of PhDs by discipline and help create an institutional environment in which non-traditional or non-academic career pathways for PhD students are acknowledged and valued. This process is likely to take time, and have uneven results across departments and programs. Perhaps the most important step toward supporting such a culture change is generating more data about the types of employment students are actually seeking and making visible (through more data) their contributions to government, industry, and non-profit sectors."}, {"section_title": "Collaborationss between CGS and Graduate institutions", "text": "CGS has developed a number of initiatives to better understand the career pathways of graduates in different types of programs, of which the Pathways project described in Panel 1 is the most wideranging.

In the discussion that followed the presentations, ernst rank (Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen) and Jean Chambaz (UPMC) agreed with Dr. Sekuler that to effectively develop new areas of professional skill, it is essential to create environments where students can develop their own programs and projects. However, participants also agreed that certain programs delivered centrally or in graduate programs (particularly those providing graduate students with teaching experience) successfully help students cultivate core competencies. Jim McGinty (CIG), speaking on behalf of non-academic employers, emphasized that teaching assistantships (TA-ships) are important because industry leaders must, in essence, \"teach\" others within their organizations. Mar\u00eda Morr\u00e1s ruiz-falc\u00f3 (Universitat Pompeu Fabra) pointed out that Mr. McGinty's comment reveals that academic skills can be considered transferable, echoing similar remarks made by lucy Johnston (University of Canterbury) in Panel 2.

Xiamen University mainly takes these six measures to enhance the postgraduate education program: 1. We have introduced famous experts, researchers and senior executives of related industries and improved the composition of postgraduate supervisors. 2. We employ experts and senior executives as external postgraduate supervisors including 130-odd external doctoral supervisors and 200-odd external master supervisors. Among them there are 10 academicians. Their research covers almost all areas of industry. 3. We launch a strategic cooperation with government sectors such as the Ministry of Industry and the Information CSIP Center and companies such as China Aviation Industry Corporation, Datang International Power Generation Co, Ltd, China National Nuclear Corporation, China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group, and Bank of China to establish technology innovation platforms and laboratory bases for selected postgraduates to further their study and research. 4. We have broken the inter-institute barrier and coordinated all the faculty and postgraduates to apply for major national projects or build innovation platforms together with relevant large enterprises and research institutes. We emphasize the combination of talents, bases, and projects, and try to bring the interdisciplinary advantage to its full play. Postgraduates are given opportunities to participate in the research so that they can increase their abilities and competitiveness. 5. We set up a research center in Xiamen Software Park to introduce new methods of integrating production, education, and research in talents training. 6.

The details are as follows: 1. We place emphasis on offering career counseling services. Postgraduates, who possess a higher level of knowledge and more independent thinking, need pertinent, professional, and personalized career counseling. Therefore, we have set up the Counseling Room for Career Planning. We try to motivate postgraduates' awareness of career planning and help them consider their problems by applying relevant theories and career assessment tools. We encourage them to shoulder the responsibility of future career development with a focus on fostering their abilities of self-clarification, self-planning, and decision-making, etc. 2. We pay close attention to postgraduates' psychological problems. Emotional and psychological problems turn out to be more severe due to the increased pressure of competition and employment. There exist many different psychological problems such as overconfidence, autism, hesitation, or sun shigang utilitarianism, etc. Psychological and vocational counseling help build their dignity, self-respect, self-reliance, and independence. 3. We provide vocational support and guidance to improve postgraduates' employment skills. Intending to help postgraduates upgrade employability and comprehensive quality, we organize counselors and tutors to offer courses on career planning and vocational guidance. Meanwhile, we introduce job analysis software and hold featured activities such as lectures, exhibitions, career planning competitions, workshops, salons, and colloquia. 4. We encourage postgraduates to get more practice in order to increase their creativity and to have a better understanding of the society. We have subsidized a number of postgraduates with their internships or social practices in large and middlesized enterprises during summer vacation. In this way, they can learn more about the world of work and expand the scope of their personal career development. The preparation of doctoral students for successful careers in the professoriate is an important component of doctoral education. The increasing demands for faculty to be exemplary in all areas of responsibility-teaching, research, and service-can be overwhelming for new faculty members fresh from PhD programs, even in environments where junior faculty are purportedly \"shielded\" from extraneous activities unrelated to teaching and research. Without having a glimpse of the day-to-day experience of life as a faculty member, a new member of the faculty can find him or herself not only struggling to perform all faculty responsibilities outstandingly, but also hard-pressed to fare well in the political arena of one's academic unit. Socialization into the academy far too often occurs on-the-job only, but this approach carries the risk of costly mistakes that could potentially derail one's career mobility and social well-being. The purpose of this paper is to describe a successful effort-The Future Faculty Teaching Fellowship Program (FFTF)-by the University Graduate School at Indiana University to provide doctoral students on its Bloomington campus with a year-long realistic job preview of faculty life on one of its six regional campuses, its campus in Indianapolis, or other master's-focused institutions within the region. The program, similar to the Preparing Future Faculty Program sponsored by the Council of Graduate Schools and funding agencies from 1993 to 2003, represents a model for providing individuals interested in an academic career with an opportunity to advance their training and to experience the tasks and responsibilities of tenuretrack faculty in a \"safe\" environment where mistakes that might prove costly for a permanent hire are more easily corrected and forgiven."}, {"section_title": "The future faculty Teaching fellowship Program", "text": "The University Graduate School has successfully run FFTF for over 15 years-a program highlighted as one of the \"40 Best Practices in Graduate Education\" in the September 2005 edition of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation's The Responsive PhD: Innovations in the US Doctoral Education. The program started as a result of a group of students expressing concerns to university administrators about difficulty in obtaining placements in liberal arts and master's-focused institutions. Many of the students participating in the group had been successful in their coursework and research, but because of their lack of teaching experience beyond that of a teaching assistant or assistant instructor in a Research I institution, selection committees in liberal arts institutions did not consider the students to be a good match for faculty positions. A proposal for FFTF was drafted by the University Graduate School and vetted by a Universitywide steering committee, which endorsed it highly. The proposal was initially funded for three years by a grant from the office of the University's president, and subsequently funded by the University Graduate School. FFTF is for advanced doctoral and Master's of Fine Arts students who express a strong desire to experience all aspects of faculty life in the type of academic environment where they wish to begin their careers. Students participating in the program are given the title \"Teaching Fellow\" or \"Visiting Lecturer\" by the host institution, not adjunct. Fellows are paid a stipend by the host institution with the University Graduate School providing health and dental benefits coverage. Fellows are expected to teach two courses each semester, serve on committees, and continue their scholarship. The goal is to provide the student with an immersive experience so that she or he gains a good understanding of faculty life. To prepare Fellows for the year-long experience, participants are required to complete a course in pedagogy and participate in an intensive three-day workshop held at an off-campus location during the preceding summer of the fellowship year. The workshop is designed and facilitated by members of the Indiana University Faculty Colloquium on Excellence in Teaching (FACET)-a distinguished group of faculty from all eight Indiana University campuses selected by their colleagues based on a rigorously documented record of extraordinary teaching. Topics covered in the workshop include: discussion in the classroom; scholarship of teaching and learning; teaching strategies; cooperative learning; effective lectures; assessment; syllabus construction; creating a teaching portfolio; and strategies for success in the first years on the job, among several others. Host institutions are required to provide Fellows with an office and all other equipment and resources typically available to its fulltime faculty. Fellows are expected to be fully engaged in faculty activities such as attending new faculty orientation, sitting in on departmental and campus faculty meetings, taking part in service activities, attending campus community functions, attending faculty lectures, and assisting with undergraduate student advising. A key component for the program is mentoring. A mentor is selected by the chair of the host department for each Fellow. This is usually an experienced faculty member who is expected to work closely with the Fellow to provide advice, counsel, and guidance through all aspects of the Fellow's campus experience. The mentor also closely observes and evaluates the Fellow's teaching and overall performance on a regular basis. A lot is expected of the mentor, thus only faculty with a demonstrated commitment to mentoring are chosen to serve in this role. Mentors are paid a modest stipend to compensate for the extra effort expected from them. The FFTF program has proven to be a win-win for both the Fellow and the host campus. Alumni of the program consistently report that the fellowship experience had an important positive impact on their ability to gain full-time employment. In fact, many former Fellows report that hiring committees have noted that their FFTF experience distinguished them from other applicants. Since the beginning of FFTF, numerous Fellows have been awarded tenure and promotion, and several of those have gone on to become administrators. While the program is designed to prepare future faculty, it also advantages host campuses by providing them with talented individuals available to teach existing courses and who often develop new courses that the campus could not otherwise make available to its undergraduates. In addition, faculty mentors enjoy the opportunity of working with advanced doctoral students."}, {"section_title": "Preparation for Interdisciplinary Careers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "text": "Chaohui du Professor and deputy dean of the Graduate School Shanghai Jiao Tong University Since the beginning of the 1990s, Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU), with the aim of building itself into a world-class university, has gradually broadened its view and improved the quality of education. Recently, besides taking \"first-class talent education\" as its foremost mission, SJTU put more emphasis on the significance of cultivating each student into a \"complete man.\" Therefore, SJTU started to explore different models of delivering skills training and career development opportunities so that it could help its students, especially graduate students, to adapt themselves to new developments in their fields and to pursue a wide variety of careers."}, {"section_title": "international Transferable research Skills Course", "text": "The International Transferable Research Skills Course brings together doctoral level researchers from Imperial College London, Hong Kong University and SJTU. This course is designed to develop the transferable skills most needed by early-stage, postgraduate researchers, enabling them to increase both their personal and research effectiveness. In 2010, eight SJTU PhD students representing four schools attended this course. They spent an entire week with 16 PhD students from Imperial College and 24 PhD students from Hong Kong University working and living together. In 2011, ten SJTU PhD students and two SJTU staff members took part in this course. After the completion of this course, all the students told us that it offered a fantastic opportunity for them to enhance their awareness of international career paths within and beyond academia as well as their understanding of cultural issues. Through various activities, the skills of leadership, teamwork, communication, self-awareness, self-management, motivation, enthusiasm, flexibility, adaptability, problem solving, planning, etc. have been all vividly acquired and profoundly experienced. preparation for interdisciplinary careers at shanghai jiao tong university The feedback from students who have taken this course encouraged SJTU to take further steps with this program and also proved the worth of the financial aid from SJTU to its PhD students in this program. In the future, SJTU would support more students to attend this course and is planning to employ this program on our campus in Shanghai. excellent engineer Project SJTU started the Excellent Engineer Project in 2009. This project is focused on professional master's degree students in Electric Engineering, Civil Engineering, Material Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. They spend the first year taking courses as full-time students, the second year in internships in different enterprises and the last half year completing their theses. Aiming to be at the forefront of modern technology and to meet the strategic requirements of national development, SJTU keeps improving cooperation between industry, the academy, and the institution by establishing partnerships with large companies such as Shanghai Electric Group, China National Nuclear Corporation, Baosteel, Shanghai Automotive Company, and China Shipping (Group) Company in the fields of discipline construction, scientific research, and talent cultivation. In this case, SJTU recommends students in the Excellent Engineer Project do their internship with one of those corporations with whom there exists a partnership. Additionally, SJTU has a \"two-supervisor system\" which means each student should have two supervisors, one from the college and the other from industry. This is an efficient way for students to apply their academic knowledge to practical experience. Students are trained not for examinations any more but for career, practice, and society. This method is not only to improve the quality of cultivation but also to provide a quantity of excellent engineers. The Graduate School of SJTU established a fund to support all graduate students to train in industry skills in 2009. The total amount of the fund is more than 5 million RMB. From then on, individual schools could submit applications to the Graduate School, and through careful screening process they could be approved for an amount of money to help their graduate students do their internships in different industries. In addition, this funding aims to build 50 off-campus bases for innovative practices, to employ veterans as students' supervisors, and so on. This funding has encouraged plenty of students and schools to pay more attention to innovative practices and led them to understand the significance of practice. interdisciplinary forum, academic salon and summer school In order to help graduate students to be prepared for interdisciplinary research and careers, the Graduate School of SJTU has organized several interdisciplinary forums, academic salons, and summer schools. In 2009, the School of Agriculture in SJTU invited the School of Life Science in Waseda University to have a forum so that students as well as professors from both schools and fields could have a chance to communicate, discuss, and present. Through this forum, potential cooperation among either students or professors could emerge. In 2010, the School of Mechanical Engineering and the School of Environment jointly organized a summer school to reinforce the communication between the disciplines. In 2011, the School of Ocean and Civil Engineering and the School of Finance jointly organized an academic salon to explore potential academic cooperation between them. More than 20 activities have been taken place in 2011 and will be continued in the future.

Providing data directly to faculty allows them to shape program missions and activities to prepare their students for the workforce beyond academia. By providing data to prospective students on career outcomes in their prospective fields, students are better positioned to decide what graduate program to pursue. In the discussion following the panel, Gary Slater (University of Ottawa) cautioned that, when devising survey questions for this kind of feedback, graduate schools should remain mindful of the ways in which the data could be misused."}, {"section_title": "issues in STeM", "text": "The STEM fields encounter discipline-specific opportunities and challenges when it comes to supporting graduate student careers.

Dr. Golfman acknowledged that while graduate schools should prepare students for faculty careers, \"we are dropping the ball\" if that is the only career preparation graduate students receive. Not only is there a gap between students' career expectations and the realities of the academic job market, but students in the humanities often do not realize the applicability of their skills to other career options. liviu Matei (Central European University) identified challenges in supporting the career paths of arts and humanities students, including accurately tracking career outcomes and identifying useful career development strategies."}, {"section_title": "The importance of language", "text": "The first question to emerge from the discussion following the panel presentations concerned the importance of terminology in discussions of career development opportunities. Dr. Grasso's paper prompted a number of participants to reflect on the effectiveness of the terms generally used to discuss issues of graduate career preparedness. There was general consensus that some terminology may inhibit effective communication with faculty. In particular, participants struggled with the tension between depth and breadth of skills in graduate education and the related issue of emphasizing \"education\" versus \"training.\" Several participants raised questions about the extent to which career training should be integrated into graduate programs, perhaps at the expense of research quality. Shiyi Chen (Peking University), for example, asked how the mission of the graduate school might change if more breadth is introduced. Others indicated that \"education\" has long been the way graduate schools described their missions, and that the introduction of the word \"training\" therefore evokes suspicion. allison Sekuler (McMaster University), Patrick osmer (Ohio State University), and Dr. Grasso proposed that deep education and broad training are both necessary, as terms and complementary endeavors: deep skills education, in keeping with the traditional mission of graduate school, and broad skills training, to keep pace with the complexity of global problems. However, as educational leaders choose to balance these priorities, it is essential that the skills students develop in graduate school be \"explicitly discussed with the students,\" as Helene Marsh (James Cook University) suggested in this panel discussion. Participants also probed more deeply the efficacy of internships as opportunities to develop professional skills, a topic that also raised questions about terminology. Dr. Osmer suggested that \"partnership\" might be a more accurate designation than \"internship,\" and ernst rank (Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen) agreed: the term \"partnership\" signals that graduate students, especially doctoral students, bring high-level skills to these opportunities and that there is value and benefit to the participating company as well as to the student. Participants then considered the actual content and benefits of various types of internships. Dr. Matei emphasized that adequate fiscal support is necessary for the success of any internship program or university-employer partnership."}, {"section_title": "Using Career Data to Enhance Programs at the University of Georgia", "text": "Maureen Grasso dean of the Graduate School The University of Georgia We know that career placement is an important outcome measure for graduate education. We need to be able to answer the question: Do our graduates receive job offers? More significantly, we want to answer the question: Are our graduates getting the jobs they want, and for which they have been trained? At the University of Georgia, we can answer yes to both of these questions, based on the data reported by our graduate programs. Eighty-eight percent of our doctoral graduates in the past year have begun a career in their chosen field. Providing students with the knowledge and skills to pursue the career of their choice is a collaborative effort of the Graduate School and individual graduate programs. We have learned that successful career placement is not only an outcome, but also an essential component of an iterative cycle of feedback and activities, shown in Figure 1, that define successful graduate programs. This model integrates program characteristics and activities with the feedback from multiple stakeholders to achieve an outcome of student success in degree completion and career placement. Data from each of these activities can be used in turn to make decisions about the other components. Useful and valid data from faculty, students, alumni, and other external groups inform each component of this cycle. The expertise of faculty, guided by the program's mission, has a direct impact on the content and format of the graduate curriculum. Providing this information to prospective students ensures a good \"fit\" between the program and admitted students. The mentoring and professional development opportunities available from the program and the Graduate School help students to move into professional communities of practice, which can provide the language, skills, and connections necessary for their future career paths. These types of successful experiences help students complete their degree and enter the career of their choice. Data from students' exit surveys, alumni, professional organizations, and places of employment provide a critical feedback loop for continuous program improvement. It has been the traditional role of a research-intensive institution such as the University of Georgia to train the next generation of the professoriate. However, because less than 50% our graduates pursue an academic career, we also have a responsibility to prepare students for careers in business, government, and non-profit organizations. Working with the entire faculty to provide opportunities for different career paths for today's students is an ongoing process. Meaningful change happens at the program level. The Graduate School works with individual faculty and programs to affect change at the program level by providing relevant data, identifying areas for collaboration, and sharing best practices across campus. These are examples of best practices that have been implemented by graduate programs at the University of Georgia: \u2022 Some departments have structured their curriculum to allow students to focus on sub-disciplines when there is wide variety of expertise in the field. This structure has been successful for students planning to enter one of several different careers in the discipline. \u2022 Over the past five years, programs in multiple disciplines have introduced courses that focus on teaching skills for the college classroom. \u2022 Programs in the sciences offer practical skills courses for scientific researchers, which emphasize the scientific method, research proposal writing and reviewing, oral presentations, and standards for responsible conduct of research. \u2022 Departments offer a \"job market\" seminar to help students prepare for the annual association meetings and other job opportunities. These seminars focus on document preparation and interview skills, and help the students develop networking skills. Guest speakers explore academic and non-academic jobs with the students. \u2022 Departments hold a career workshop or research day with visiting scientists from various areas of the field, including industry, research laboratories, publishing, academia (teaching at all undergraduate colleges to research/teaching at large universities), patent law, government policy, and other agencies. \u2022 Some departments pay for their students to attend national career workshops in the discipline. \u2022 Programs have strengthened their alumni database, to which the students have access. These alumni are often very open to talking with students, which is particularly useful for those considering careers outside of academia, such as in the nonprofit sector or government agencies. \u2022 Alumni from programs may serve as career mentors; their names, jobs and contact information are provided in an electronic graduate student manual. \u2022 Schools and programs have established external advisory groups, which may include representatives from academia, non-profit organizations, business, and governmental agencies, to solicit advice about possible revisions to the curriculum. \u2022 Departments have used feedback from current students, exit questionnaires from graduating students, and comments from alumni to improve and strengthen their programs. Programs would like to increase the availability of internships for graduate students. These are usually more feasible in a master's program, but working one into a doctoral program has been a greater challenge, particularly if the student has an assistantship. The Graduate School supports the efforts of individual programs and works to institutionalize key initiatives across campus. One of our strategic goals is to offer a range of professional development seminars and certificates that go beyond discipline-specific training to provide students with opportunities to develop skills that prepare them for future careers, both in and outside of the academy. The following are some of the professional and program development activities undertaken by the Graduate School. \u2022 An \"Interdisciplinary Certificate in University Teaching\" is offered as an academic credential. \u2022 The Graduate School recognizes outstanding teaching assistants with the annual \"Excellence in Teaching\" awards. \u2022 The Graduate School collaborates with the university's Center for Teaching and Learning to offer the Preparing Future Faculty program. \u2022 The development of students' research agendas is encouraged by providing workshops and materials to support students in seeking national fellowships and recognizing the students who receive national awards and fellowships. \u2022 The Professional Science Master degree has also given us the means to design new programs to meet specific career knowledge and skills needs for employers. \u2022 The Graduate School works closely with faculty to identify and shape new degree programs to meet the expectations of today's graduate students and fulfill future career paths. We often can facilitate more inclusive discussions, particularly for developing new interdisciplinary programs that bridge multiple colleges and schools. Knowing and incorporating the career expectations of our graduate students into programs and course curricula are essential for building strong graduate programs. Both individual graduate programs and the Graduate School have a role in ensuring that students are provided relevant information, mentoring, and professional support to become active participants in the career of their choice, beginning with their recruitment into graduate school and continuing through to their graduation. At the University of Hong Kong (HKU), research graduate education is student-centered and the HKU Graduate School endeavors to equip research graduate students with general competency in research skills, methods, ethics, and thesis writing. These courses, completed within the first year of study, form the foundation for research and aim to launch the student on the right track for challenges in all fields including Science, Engineering, and Medicine. Furthermore, such courses are taught in English to reinforce HKU's commitment to educating in the international language for the most effective communication in these disciplines. The developmental opportunities provided by the Graduate School do not differentiate between those in the \"pure\" and \"applied\" sciences. Ultimately, with basic knowledge and skills acquired right from the start, students will be well-equipped to embark on their careers after graduation. Graduate School courses provide a balance to the discipline-specific courses and training given by the student's supervisor, department, and faculty. The Graduate School runs a \"HKU Research Skills Development Course\" which is rather similar to the \"International Research Skills Development (IRSD) Program\" jointly-organized at HKU every summer (since 2009) with Imperial College London and a mainland university (Shanghai Jiaotong University or Tsinghua University). The HKU Research Skills Development Course is a three-day residential course held off-campus during Reading Week and provides participants (~30 students) with the opportunity to interact with one another, enhance personal and research effectiveness, and broaden one's horizons. The Graduate School recognizes that development in awareness and skills are important for the student's study, career, and personal development. This course, incorporating interactive teaching and team activities, exposes students to a new learning environment that focuses on experiential learning achieved through teamwork. Participants from different disciplines work in small groups and hold discussions on research planning, project management, creativity, communication skills, group dynamics, networking, developing self-awareness, collaborative research, and careers. Furthermore, participants are encouraged to link what they learn to their own research and apply new insights to their work. In comparison, the IRSD Program is a four-day residential course with greater international flavor and allows participating students (~50) from diverse cultural backgrounds from HKU, Imperial College London, and a mainland university to interact and bond. Furthermore, following the course, participants are hosted for three weeks at HKU laboratories and get to sample \"international research collaboration\" early in their research careers. To facilitate such lab visits, the visiting student should seek attachment to the HKU lab best related to his/her own current research. Given that HKU places great emphasis on promoting research integrity, students are required to complete a \"Research Ethics for Graduate Students\" course. In this program, student researchers are instructed on good research practices (honesty, accountability, and fairness), what is perceived as proper research conduct, and the expected international standards and principles that must be adhered to in research. Students can then apply these values to their own discipline and in emerging fields as they progress in their careers. This academic year at HKU, we launched a course on \"Mandatory Training on Teaching Skills\" offered by the Centre for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning to those who are required by faculties/departments to undertake teaching and/or assessment duties. Completion of this course culminates in the award of a \"Certificate of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education: Stage 1.\" The largely practical course provides skills in teaching small groups using an interactive mode, with an emphasis on cooperative learning and group work, and ensures that research students engaged in teaching duties are competent. It also serves as a stepping stone for those who aim to pursue a teaching career. mee-len chye More recently, the Graduate School and the Knowledge Exchange Office jointly organized the first Three Minute Thesis (3MT\u2122) Competition at HKU. The 3MT\u2122 competition was first launched by the University of Queensland in 2008. Research students are challenged to present their work to a general audience within three minutes. Given the potential impact of research on society, this exercise stresses how essential it is to effectively communicate one's findings to the public, especially in the technological fields of Science, Engineering, and Medicine. HKU also gives research students an opportunity to present their findings at international academic conferences by providing financial support in the form of Conference and Travel Grants. Students may also choose instead to use the funds to attend international academic activities or seminars. Workshops attended by HKU research students include those organized by the Universitas 21 global network (http://www. universitas21.com/), of which HKU is a founding member. U21 organizes meetings for research students in workshops, summer schools, and exchanges which are generally more discipline-related. Travel grants are also available for international collaborative efforts that fall under the U21 global umbrella. HKU conducts an annual Career Workshop for MPhil and PhD students and informs them how they can use their research degrees to embark on the career of their dreams. Speakers lecture on how one can prepare for academic careers as well as non-academic careers, given that academic positions are competitive and difficult to secure. HKU's international links, supported through the Croucher Foundation and the Research Grants Council (in partnership with organizations in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, The Netherlands, Germany, and China) and by joint degree programs with Imperial College London and King's College London, have developed facultyled ties between partner labs to research student exchanges. These links generate opportunities for students by extending learning in a multi-cultural background. Such training and exposure, often interdisciplinary, is vital for the development of the next generation of researchers in Science, Engineering and Medicine. In conclusion, besides the traditional discipline-specific knowledge from faculty (supervisor)/department, the Graduate School at HKU provides students a broad range of learning opportunities in courses and programs, which are continuously reviewed to optimally support and ensure that their needs are met in line with global best practices. When students acquire a wider perception of their discipline, they gain a competitive edge and will be much sought after by multinational organizations upon graduation. kumkum garg"}, {"section_title": "Challenges and Opportunities in Science and Engineering: The Role of Programs and Faculty in Supporting Student Careers in India", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Kumkum Garg director, Manipal institute of Technology Manipal University", "text": "The new millennium has brought many revolutionary changes in the social, cultural, and economic ethos of India. Globalization and technological innovation have become buzz words that call for new competencies from students in technology, both at the undergraduate as well as graduate levels. A knowledge-based economy like India's can ill afford to ignore this clarion call. The onus is on technical and other institutes of higher education to ensure that their students are equipped with the skills needed to contribute to the all-round development of the country today. Manipal Institute of Technology, a constituent Institution of Manipal University, Manipal, India, is a premier technical institute of the country. It has, through the years, striven to provide its students with value-based, quality education in engineering and technology. Our vision of \"impacting society through globally competent technologists\" is being slowly but steadily realized, through the relentless efforts of our well-qualified and dedicated faculty and through the forward-looking strategies implicit in our administration and programs. As one of the largest technical Institutes in the country, we are also committed to mandating quality with quantity. The challenges we face are many and varied. Six of the most important ones are listed below: The first and foremost challenge is that of enhancing the employability of our students. Rapid technological advances have resulted in many of our graduates becoming unemployable in the Industry on graduation. Companies have to arrange for \"training\" or retraining these students over a period of 3-6 months in skills specific to their needs. The second important issue is that of making our graduates \"globally competent.\" With the world increasingly becoming a global village and international boundaries becoming blurred, there is an urgent need to impart skills and competencies that can be utilized on a global basis. No longer is it sufficient for technology graduates to be locally or even nationally competent. They need exposure outside of their country, both technically and socially, to be able to deliver in the international arena. The third challenge is about interdisciplinary learning. It is becoming increasingly apparent that technology graduates have to be confident about not only their own specialized fields, but also have a broad knowledge about related areas in science and technology, so as to be able to give their best. Interdisciplinary research and development is thus the need of the hour. Entrepreneurship is the next important challenge facing our graduates. It is now established that for India to develop as a knowledge giant and find its rightful place in the major economies of the world, we have to foster the spirit of entrepreneurship among our students. We must provide an education that creates employment generators, not merely employment seekers. The emphasis has to be on \"inclusive growth\" that addresses the needs of one and all. Increasing the numbers of our technical workforce is also a major challenge facing the country today. At 50% of the population, India today has the distinction of having the largest number of young people. To impart any kind of professional training to them and prepare them for meaningful careers requires setting up of many Institutes of Higher Learning and Technical Training Centres across the length and breadth of the country. These numerous institutes need to be populated by a large number of teachers, which in itself is a major challenge, given the current paucity of well-qualified faculty. Finally, but most importantly, we have the issue of imparting and promoting \"ethics\" and high moral values amongst our graduates. Today, more than ever, our science and technology graduates need to \"connect\" with the society at large and be caring and responsible citizens, working transparently for the benefit of, and impacting, society. Our academic programs need to take care of this important kumkum garg aspect. To meet and address all the above challenges is a herculean task. Nevertheless, we provide many opportunities and facilities for students to improve their career options and make them \"saleable.\" Some of these are listed below. We continuously engage with industry, to keep track of their everchanging requirements. We have active avenues of collaboration and interaction with them in the form of student internships and faculty/ staff exchanges and sabbaticals. Many of our programs are developed with the help of industry. We also have a number of laboratories and Centres of Excellence funded by Industry giants like Schneider Electric, EMC2, Philips, Cisco Systems, Cognizant, etc. We modify our academic curricula and introduce new and relevant programs whenever required. The programs are completely revised and updated once every 5 years to keep pace with rapid advances in technology, so that our graduates are in tune with the state-of-the-art in their chosen fields. This is done with the help of industry and in tune with the higher education policies of the government. Our core values of excellence, integrity, trust, and continuous and student-centric learning, are all closely woven into the fabric of our technical programs. We aim to equip our students with the necessary competencies in their core areas, while also providing them with the entrepreneurial skills and research capabilities so necessary for success in today's highly competitive world. Our programs stress creative thinking and innovation. A full-fledged Innovation Centre and a government-funded Technical Business Incubator are operational at MIT, where graduate/ research students are encouraged to think out-of-the-box. We provide training and awareness programs on Intellectual Property and IPR, so as to build a knowledge pool amongst the students. Technology transfer and start-ups are encouraged so that students get a feel of industry right on the campus. This is done through business plan competitions, wherein attractive monetary awards are given. Faculty advisors and mentors from industry are in place for each student group for effective guidance at every step. MIT has the advantage that there are many other sister institutions of Manipal University present in Manipal and neighbouring places, catering to other disciplines such as medicine, dentistry, nursing, allied health, pharmacy, hospitality, management, architecture, and life sciences. Thus many of our graduate and research students are able to choose interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary projects for their theses/projects. These result in many research developments in areas directly relevant to either the industry or the society in general. This in turn helps in the student's career prospects and progression. Manipal University is aggressively pushing interaction and exchange programs with many technical and medical institutes outside India in its quest to be a world-class University. It has MOUs with many leading universities, through which it is able to send its graduate students for study abroad for short-and medium-term exchanges. There are also many long-term twinning and dual-degree programs which help the students to get exposed to state-of-the-art systems outside the country. Cultural mixing also happens through student mobility, which enables students to understand these technologies and their impact on society better. Faculty is a major resource for any institution of higher learning. To ensure an effective teaching-learning process for the increasing number of graduate students coming into science and technology streams, many schemes are in place to attract and retain quality faculty. Performance incentives, faculty development programmes and awareness workshops emphasising research and development are regularly conducted under the aegis of the government and industry. Industry initiatives like Wipro's Mission 10x, Infosys's Campus Connect, and similar programmes by Schneider, Philips, etc., are helping considerably in enhancing the lecture delivery competencies of our faculty by leveraging technology. Such initiatives in turn benefit the students by helping to assimilate knowledge faster and make them more employable."}, {"section_title": "noreen golfman", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Challenges and Opportunities in the Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences noreen Golfman dean of Graduate Studies Memorial University of newfoundland", "text": "About a year ago, a video uploaded to YouTube attracted a lot of attention from those of us who come from arts disciplines. \"So you want to get a PhD in the Humanities?\" brilliantly satirizes what has become a familiar conversation we have with ourselves and sometimes with our students about the arguable benefits of pursuing a doctoral degree (Allison, 2010). Yes, we laugh at the YouTube conversation, captured so perfectly by the innovative educational software Xtranormal, because so much of it rings true. I am sure almost everyone reading this has seen it by now. An earnest young woman who claims she has \"brilliant and original ideas about literature and death\" is relentlessly discouraged from pursuing a PhD by a senior female professor. Full of optimism, inspired by Robin Williams' performance in Dead Poets Society, and moved by the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson (a dead poet if ever there was one), the aspiring PhD student is told at every turn that what awaits her at best is a life in the hinterlands of Nebraska, grading papers, working hard for inferior pay, and being profoundly disrespected at her own institution. The students believes in the life of the mind; the professor seems to have lost hers somewhere along the way. Why has the video attracted so much attention-and a host of almost equally hilarious imitators? Strings of commentary following the video, which now boasts well over a million viewers, point to the sad kernel of truth in the dialogue, even while it makes us laugh with a kind of uneasy recognition. Humanities professors might not openly discourage their students from thinking about a life in graduate school in these excessive terms, but many have probably personally experienced a loss of idealism in the face of less than agreeable working conditions, weak salary scales, and a society that seems intent on underappreciating their contributions to the store of knowledge. Indeed, one cannot help but notice that in the last couple of years considerable attention has been dedicated at higher education conferences and widely read publications to exploring the troubled career pathways for graduate students in arts-based disciplines, with special emphasis on the humanities. Notable are the essay examples of Thomas H. Benton, pen name of William Pannapacker, an associate professor of English at Hope College in Holland, Michigan, who contributes to the Chronicle of Higher Education from time to time. His \"Graduate School in the Humanities: Just Don't Go\" (30 January 2009) might very well have inspired the creator of the YouTube video described above. It is nothing less than a bitter sermon aimed at discouraging anyone with even a hint of a dream of a career in the academy. It is not that what he has to say is incorrect in its depiction of hopelessness as much as it is focused entirely on a traditional pathway, once thought to have led naturally from graduation to a junior professorship, even in Nebraska. That road, as all now know well, is much less travelled by. Benton advocates, perhaps even inadvertently, our moral responsibility to our students not only to inform them of the facts of the academic marketplace but also to think differently about nonacademic jobs. This is, to date, our biggest challenge, and we are probably not making as aggressive an effort in this direction as we ought to be. Benton notes that \"doctoral education in the humanities socializes idealistic, na\u00efve, and psychologically vulnerable people into a profession with a very clear set of values. It teaches them that life outside of academe means failure, which explains the large numbers of graduates who labor for decades as adjuncts, just so they can stay on the periphery of academe.\" It is hard to disagree with this statement. The evidence abounds. Recently, I was asked to perform an assessment of a large Canadian university English department with a strong reputation in graduate studies. I traveled to the site and talked to faculty, students, and a wide range of administrators. Graduate students were especially anxious about not finding a tenure-track career in their area, and many openly worried about being destined for a life of penury, consigned to teaching the same undergraduate courses year after year-a kind of seventh-level-of-hell scenario. No one seemed to be talking to these noreen golfman people about alternative pathways, about what they could possibly do with their emerging skill set, or what healthy futures might exist for those holding doctoral degrees in English. The gap between their expectations and the reality of the marketplace remained huge. I was struck in particular by the department's avowed mission statement, bolded in their handbook and echoed throughout my visit-that it was their goal to prepare graduate students for a life in the academy. Success, it followed, meant placing their students somewhere in the higher education system, preferably not at a community college. I honestly cannot see how at this moment in our history we can stand behind a statement like that. For that matter, even if employment opportunities were abundant in the arts, social sciences, and the humanities it does not seem appropriate, let alone honest, to be reproducing the same tired binary by which many of us were informed. If we think success can be measured by how many graduate students we can place within the academy then surely the opposite is true. Those who fail to secure academic positions are, by definition, losers-and, if not losers, then somehow less worthy of our respect. This is nonsense, of course. But what are we doing about mentoring, about preparing our students for the real opportunities their PhDs allow them? Sadly, not that much so far. We need to be working much more closely with our career counseling offices, if we have them at all, and with Faculties of Arts and Humanities to establish a fresh discourse about employment opportunities. It is easy to think immediately of cognate prospects, such as publishing and editing for the Humanities, or the not-for-profit sector for many social science disciplines, but these pathways are familiar and, understandably, not always so appealing to our graduates. Brilliant examples abound in our worlds of those with arts-based graduate degrees who occupy high political office, run corporations, start independent businesses, write for Hollywood, shape public policy, become lawyers and doctors, write award-winning novels, and on and on. We so rarely trumpet their names or successes in graduate school, or even think of illustrating the career pathways that led to such nonacademic activities. Increasingly, these examples are not exceptions as much as they are flourishing models of what is possible, and what we need to be reminding our students about what their skills can achieve. If someone had tapped me on the shoulder many years ago to suggest I might want to consider thinking about any one of the above I might very well have done so. It just wasn't part of the conversation. It is fine and responsible to be preparing our students for a career in university by offering grant-writing workshops, rehearsing conference papers, nudging them towards peer-reviewed publications, and practicing their job interview skills, but if that is all we are doing then we are dropping the ball. We might just be setting them up for a life of bitter rejection, and a grudging regret that they pursued a Sociology or History PhD in the first place. Instead of seeing their experience as wasted and narrowing they should be recognizing how many more opportunities await a skilled, critical thinker, someone with terrific and proven writing skills, confidence in public speaking, a demonstrated ability to harness a lot of complex information, a synthesizer, a public intellectual, an educated mind that can entertain a thought without necessarily accepting it, to paraphrase Aristotle. Today's complex world demands people with these important assets, and so why do we not recognize we are producing them all the time? At my university the Faculty of Arts, which comprises humanities and social sciences, is steadily building a ritual of annual career days aimed at showcasing a wide range of examples of successful career pathways outside the academy-to both undergraduate and graduate audiences. There is nothing like a strong, confident industry or community leader with a PhD in Economics or Political Science to give career-uneasy students pause. My own office in the School of Graduate Studies has also recently hired a career counselor specifically to attend to the increasing number of international students, many who have come to Memorial to pursue graduate degrees with no intention of returning to their home countries. These students deserve special attention, their chances of securing a position in the academy being even smaller than it is for Canadian nationals. With internationalization have come new responsibilities: our efforts are aimed at opening up the pathways to careers in our city and beyond, not only for the swell of engineers and business students but for those who came from far away to study economics and religion, literature, and film. noreen golfman Not surprisingly, it was a PhD student in English at Temple University who created the \"So you want to get a PhD in the Humanities\" video. Clearly enterprising, independently minded, able to use animation software with flair, and obviously graced with a fine sense of humour, Leslie Allison has already shown by example what such graduate students are made of. Ostensibly, she aspires to teach upper-level English courses at a liberal-arts college, as a Chronicle of Higher Education piece on her observed (Parry, 2011). But with skills such as these, perhaps she should be considering other options. I hope someone has pointed this out to her. Operating in Budapest, Hungary, CEU promotes a somewhat unusual institutional model, which brings about both particular strengths as well as challenges, including with regard to student career development. Established in 1991, CEU is a private, graduate, research-intensive, English-speaking, and mission-driven university, accredited in the United States and Hungary. It promotes the study and development of open society and democracy through high-level research, researchbased teaching, and civic commitment. CEU is densely international, enrolling at present about 1600 master's and doctoral students recruited from almost 150 countries. The diversity of nationalities represented on the campus is quite remarkable, given both the size of the university and its location. The most remarkable, however, is the fact that there is no single dominant national group: at CEU all students are international students. The largest national group, Hungarian students, represents only about 15% of the total student body. CEU's 190 resident faculty members come from about 40 countries. Visiting faculty members are also recruited internationally; they deliver about 15% of the curriculum. The student-professor ratio, in full-time equivalent, is slightly below 8:1. CEU specializes primarily in the social sciences and humanities. The large majority of its students benefits from full or partial financial support provided by the university. These characteristics allow CEU to develop and function as a particular type of intellectual community, one that is cohesive despite its densely international demography, focused, flexible, risk-taking, liviu matei and energetic. As a university, CEU is interested not just in \"academic excellence\" generically, but, along with academic excellence, also in pursuing a particular, ambitious, and clearly-defined intellectualsocial agenda. An important measure of success for this institutional agenda, if not the most important, is to be found in the careers and work of its students after graduation (Do CEU graduate students who trained in the social sciences and humanities, indeed make a serious contribution to studying and promoting the principles of the open society?). For this reason, the concern for the post-university life and careers of our graduates is a central element of CEU's institutional ethos, formal strategic planning, and actual operations."}, {"section_title": "Challenges for the career development of CeU's students, and institutional strategies to address them", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Tracking career paths", "text": "The first challenge is to closely and accurately track the career paths of the students. This is difficult, given the extensive international character of the student body. Students come from all parts of the world (about half of them from Central and Eastern Europe) and after graduating from CEU they go in all directions worldwide to pursue either professional careers or continue further studies. In addition, CEU cannot rely on any single kind of external support (such as from national authorities or institutions) in following the post-university trajectories of our graduates. Mutatis mutandins, tracking the career paths of our students resembles to a certain extent a situation whereby a small airline flying to all parts of the world would attempt to develop its own global system of flight control. To address this challenge, CEU has developed two tools, using primarily the experience of working with alumni in U.S. universities, adapted to our particular situation. CEU has established one of the first alumni offices in continental Europe, and has allocated resources to staff it, train the staff, and support its global scope of operations in accordance with the ambitions of the university. Since its creation in 1999 the office has had to address a whole set of particular challenges. In general, there was no experience in working with alumni in Europe, even the term \"alumni\" entered the European higher education vocabulary only a few years ago. Given that CEU offers only graduate programs, our students come with a first degree from another university and we have to take into consideration that their loyalty would normally go to their first alma mater. Moreover, CEU is a young university, our alumni are still very young (the oldest ones are barely fifty years old), and discerning stable career trends is not necessarily easy. Given its particular role in the CEU institutional context, the alumni office was intended from the beginning to function as a service unit to our graduates (and also to our current students), rather than a fundraising vehicle. This decision was based on the university mission, a relatively low expected giving potential of young professionals who have studied social sciences and humanities, as well as on the lack of university fundraising traditions in the region. The office had done excellent and creative work in close cooperation with the academic departments, faculty members, current students, and more recently with CEU alumni chapters around the world. At present, CEU has about 8,000 alumni in over 100 countries, and we know the whereabouts of more than 80% of them. The CEU alumni office systematically collects information about the career paths of our graduates, including types of careers, career progress (beginning with the first year after graduation) or career change, and it regularly provides this information to other units of the university and to the central administration. The university has cultivated a related tool in the form of a network of CEU alumni, including formal CEU alumni chapters (currently operating in about 40 countries). The international CEU alumni network is very effective in providing career support to our former students. CEU alumni chapters provide support not only with regard to career tracking and career advancement, but also with student recruitment, and more recently also with fundraising. Such a strong and active international alumni network is a great asset for the university and it helps to distinguish CEU from other universities in Europe. As a matter of fact, a large percentage of our new students acknowledge that its existence and the benefits it is providing represented an important factor in their decision to apply to CEU."}, {"section_title": "liviu matei", "text": "Strategies and tools to enhance students' career prospects Difficulties in this area result from a mix of specific institutional characteristics and challenges graduates in social sciences and humanities generally face. For example, CEU is committed to providing career development support for a very international student body, with individual students who will be seeking rewarding jobs in any part of the world, sometimes far away from Budapest. At the same time, CEU has the ambition to stimulate students to return to their countries of origin, although this is not a formal obligation for any student. Another challenge for CEU is to analyze actual career trajectories of former students and develop adapted support for specific career tracks or types of careers, rather than \"generic support.\" For example, our statistics show, not surprisingly, that more than 60% of the PhD students would like to and indeed do pursue academic careers. The rest of the PhD students and most of our master's students (those who do not continue with doctoral studies), work with NGOs, international organizations (often national branches of large international organizations), or central or local governments. A few of them go to the business sector. The CEU alumni office provides detailed statistics, updated regularly. Individual departments, such as Medieval Studies, sometimes have even more detailed statistics about their own former students. CEU has developed an entire arsenal of strategies, tools, and activities to address such challenges. For example, we encourage and support students to stay in contact with their countries of origin by selecting a research topic which is about or relevant for those countries; by providing them with research grants to do field work in their countries; by systematically inviting academics, university administrators, politicians, and NGO leaders from such countries to take part in events (conferences, public lectures, workshops, etc.) organized at CEU. As another example, this time regarding specific tools designed to support PhD students willing to pursue an academic career, CEU provides financial and logistic support to all doctoral students to spend a semester at another university of their choice and also to organize or attend academic conferences. We invite as a second supervisor or as members of the defense panels academics Promoting Career DeveloPment of graDuate StuDentS in the SoCial SCienCeS anD humanitieS at Central euroPean univerSity from other universities, including occasionally from the countries of origin of our students. We encourage and support students interested in working with national or international NGOs, intergovernmental or other organizations to take up internships in Europe and around the world (we intend to make internships a key element of the educational offerings at CEU, as reflected in the draft new strategic development plan of the university for 2012-2017). Given the special interest of the students and university in the voluntary sector, we organize successful student career fairs on our campus at which we invite NGOs, international organizations, and commercial companies. CEU organizes more than 100 academic, policy, and cultural public events during any given academic year, a major logistic and financial effort, which helped the university to acquire the reputation of a lively intellectual place. These events cultivate open, professionally serious, and engaged debates, many of which are about presently pressing or more fundamental issues in social sciences and humanities. Such events also contribute significantly to raising awareness about the nature and quality of work carried out at CEU among a variety of potential employers (universities, research institutes, NGOs, international organizations, governments, national and international professional associations), and thus contribute directly to enhancing career prospects of our students. As mentioned above, the CEU alumni network and alumni chapters work systematically, both formally and informally, in coordination with the university, to support the career advancement of our alumni. CEU conducts regular surveys to assess the effectiveness of individual career support methods or tools, and based on the results adjusts and further develops effective methods and drops the ineffective ones. The general picture indicates that CEU alumni are very successful professionally and many of them do pursue work illustrating commitment to the idea and principles of the open society. While part of their success should be explained by their personal qualities, quality of their pre-CEU and CEU studies, and the highly selective admission at CEU, the impact of the specific career support efforts provided by CEU appears to be significant as well.\nGeneral lessons: can a small institution influence transnational trends? Some of the main challenges we have to face follow from larger European and global trends. In today's Europe national governments and European Union institutions, rather than higher education institutions themselves, play the central role in defining higher education policies, including funding policies (public funding being still the most important source of revenue for universities in Europe). The focus of policymakers appears to be more markedly on the natural sciences and on research, as opposed to social sciences and humanities and teaching, allocated fewer resources or being among the first candidates for cuts in public support. To promote a complementary perspective to this approach, CEU has launched this summer a European Award for Excellence in Teaching in the Social Sciences and Humanities. We hope that this initiative, launched by a small university like CEU, will generate a larger European discussion about the value of teaching, in the social sciences and humanities in particular. We intend this to be a permanent initiative and we have already received very good signs of support from other universities, from the Bologna Secretariat, OECD, and the European University Association. We also hope that this initiative will give more public visibility to teaching careers in the social sciences and humanities. As another possible lesson, at least of regional relevance, the CEU case seems to contradict some of the prevailing perceptions in Central and Eastern Europe regarding private higher education and graduate studies in the social sciences and the humanities. There are widelyheld beliefs in the region that private higher education is usually not concerned with quality and relevance; that it is mainly, if not only, developing in \"lucrative fields\" such as business management, and not in social sciences or humanities; and that it is driven mainly, if not only, by commercial motivations. It is also believed that career prospects of students in social sciences and humanities are very limited in scope. The institutional model promoted by CEU and the success of its alumni contradict these beliefs. CEU has the ambition not only to produce quality research and train professionals, but also to contribute to the broader discussion about the public role of universities. One of CEU's main aspirations is to become a new model for international education, a global laboratory that represents a source of intellectual support for building open and democratic societies that respect human rights. This program cannot be realized without the central contribution of the social sciences and humanities, and also without systematic work to support and enhance the career prospects of graduate students in these fields. The experience of CEU so far has been reasonably successful and convincing."}, {"section_title": "V.

Dr. Kankanhalli described how the National University of Singapore addresses the need for globalized research training with a \"buffet approach,\" offering students an array of optional programming. In the discussion that followed, Gary Slater (University of Ottawa) posed two questions about such a model: how do graduate leaders make sure that students actually avail themselves of these optional training opportunities, and how should universities respond to advisors who might perceive workshops and courses as a distraction from program studies and research?

If we just focus on the economic aspect of these monumental shifts, the most obvious signs are the global mobility of capital and industry. They are basically macro-level indicators of several overlapping phenomena: \u2022 There has been a substantial globalization of the industrial supply chain. It is very common for even a relatively simple product to have components conceived, designed, manufactured and assembled in several countries. \u2022 Product life cycles have significantly shortened due to intensive competition, as well as changing consumer preferences. Newer and better product designs are constantly being brought into the market. \u2022 With the increasing affluence of the middle-class in many countries, services has emerged as the second arm of industry, along with manufacturing. In fact, the services component has overtaken the manufacturing sector in many developed nations. \u2022 There is now greater access to higher education globally, which has resulted in an increased production of college-educated graduates. \u2022 There has been a greater democratization of entrepreneurship due to easy availability of education, capital and information. It has become a lot easier for potential entrepreneurs to spot market gaps and come up with their own innovative solutions. \u2022 Due to the intensive competition in the marketplace and the attendant need for being responsive to market conditions, hiring and firing of employees based on short-term corporate needs is becoming the norm. As a result, the possibility of obtaining lifetime security in one job or in one company is unfortunately diminishing. \u2022 There is an increased mobility of jobs and talent. Technical advances have led to rapid improvement in communication links and there has also been an overall improvement of the physical infrastructure, especially in the developing world. Because of the better infrastructure with the lower operating costs in many places, jobs are now migrating to economically optimal locations. In addition to the mobility of jobs themselves, due to progressive immigration policies and the global premium on top talent, there has also been a concomitant increase in the mobility of qualified people. While the above trends have undoubtedly improved the overall efficiency of the global production system, this has led to significant local disparities and dislocations. There are many interesting socioeconomic as well as political implications resulting from this situation that we are grappling with, but we will focus here on their impact on graduate education. Given the increased supply of graduates, not all PhDs can be absorbed into academia. On the other hand, industries are becoming increasingly sophisticated and now require personnel with graduate-level training. Thus industry is requiring an increasing number of masters and PhD graduates. One of the direct consequences of the above trends is that research is now a global enterprise. Most nations have programs and incentives for innovation, entrepreneurship, and research. As a result, corporations are situating their research labs in a distributed fashion in proximity to the markets as well as in places which have a critical mass of well-trained research manpower. This in turn is spurring governments to provide extensive support to local research universities. Hence, in many developing economies, there is a virtuous cycle of industrial innovation, demand for graduate students, and improved governmental support for the university sector. Based on the trends described earlier, some key characteristics desirable in today's workplace are: \u2022 An increased depth of technical knowledge which is partially ameliorated by easy and quick access to factual, explicit knowledge via internet and electronic repositories. \u2022 The ability to visualize the big picture while retaining the ability to go deep to solve a specific problem. \u2022 An increased versatility demanded by fast-changing products and processes. \u2022 The ability to quickly become a part of a team to solve problems which needs a flexible combination of leadership skills with an ability to cooperate with peers. \u2022 Innovation is increasingly becoming the market differentiator for products and services. \u2022 The ability to navigate within one's career through various aspects of a corporation (technology, finance, human resources, marketing, vendor and outsourcing management). \u2022 Possess cross-cultural sensitivity to work with multi-national and multi-ethnic teams. In order for graduate students to function well in a globalized research environment, we need to nurture diverse qualities of versatility, innovation, multi-functionality, cross-disciplinarity, stealth leadership with peers, and cross-cultural sensitivity. Most importantly, we have to give them the confidence, tools, and mind-set which can allow them to re-invent themselves into new roles periodically. While it is difficult to embed all of these within a single graduate program, we at NUS recognize the need to inculcate at least a few of these aspects into every graduate program. The approach that we follow is to allow for multiple pathways based on the interest and inclination of students. Some of the concrete measures that we have undertaken (or are contemplating): 1. Provide the experience of singularly handling a significant component of a difficult project along with some experience of working in a group on a complex project. The first one is usually tackled during the thesis research; the second aspect is woven into coursework. We are increasing the amount and rigor of coursework. We also provide distinct courses for professional masters programs and for doctoral programs. 2. Provide possibilities for picking up other skills: finance, marketing, and communications. We are running some optional short-term courses via our Center for Development of Teaching and Learning. The requirement for communication is being emphasized throughout the curriculum in terms of coursework presentations and research seminars. 3. Allow for exposure to innovation and entrepreneurship via internships in industry. The NUS Career Center, departments, faculties, and individual professors all help link students with industry. 4. We are debating the idea of allowing for a graduate minor in another related or unrelated discipline. 5. Improve the cultural quotient of graduate students by giving them exposure to non-native cultural settings by short immersion stints in different (possibly foreign) environments. It is hoped that students will develop qualities such as empathy, adaptability, and an ability to accept diversity. Overall, a twopronged strategy has been adopted at NUS for our students: \u2022 Take the NUS students to the World: Provide a global experience to as many students as possible via student exchange programs, international internships, and laboratory attachments. \u2022 Bring the World into NUS: Provide a global experience campus via joint degree programs and double-degree programs. We also have a very international graduate student body as well as the faculty. Moreover, there is the National Research Foundation funded program called CREATE (Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise) which brings in select leading university research groups in the world to work on campus with our faculty and students. A significant fraction of our graduate students find employment outside of Singapore and even those who work in Singapore have expressed an interest to do a stint abroad. Over the last three years, we have started conducting annual surveys and having focus group discussions with alumni to better understand the long-term career progression of our graduate students. Our aim is to constantly remain relevant and responsive to all of our various stakeholders. Globalization is turning out to be an important variable in our graduate alumni's career equation."}, {"section_title": "redefining global networking skills", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Redefining Global Networking Skills", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Jim McGinty Vice Chairman Cambridge information Group", "text": "Today I want to share some thoughts about the impact of technology on the global research process, and discuss how a familiar skill, possessed to lesser and greater degrees by graduate students, is fast being redefined. That skill set is networking, which supports the work of identifying, communicating, and collaborating with others in some kind of an endeavor. For our discussion we'll restrict that endeavor to academic research and scholarly communications. I'll also pose some questions about the impact of this changing skill set on graduate education, and I'll hazard a few suggestions. I'll undertake this discussion without formal research and with only scant secondary literature reviews, relying instead on discussions with colleagues and competitors, personal observations, and my forty-five years in the Information Industrythe last two decades serving the higher education community-with a focus on the scholarly communication process. My judgment is that graduate students-MA's or PhD's, those on the academic track or those seeking careers in the public or private sectors-are now being judged by the value of their networks and networking skills. For those in the academic world, networking and article collaboration have always been a major factor in assessing graduate students and recent graduates. So what will be changing? I believe most of us would agree with the premise that search, communication, transmission, storage, and now networking technologies, have altered the scholarly communications process, especially in the areas of research and collaboration. I can assure you the same can be said of commercial enterprises in the areas of research and publishing, across a broad array of industries. The impact of technology on the research process demands that we rethink the skill of networking and begin to think about networking system skills, including facility and creativity in the processes, the media, and the tools. Networking skills include far more than just a broad email reach, or a presence on LinkedIn, Facebook, Renren, EU Careers, or any other social or professional networks. It includes the skill of managing information, text, and multimedia objects-video, audio, and interactive data sets. It also includes the ability to display and narrowcast, and to illicit critique and commentary, not simply from peers, but from a broad array of relevant responders-many in different disciplines, some on other side of the globe. Like it or not, the networking skill set has become a technology-driven global process. How will your graduate students be judged in this new environment? I'll speak from the perspective of an employer of graduate students in many disciplines, and for several other senior executives in our industry. I've informally interviewed a half-dozen on this subject, all of whom routinely hire MA's and PhD's. Given the world in which we operate, we are looking for students with graduate degrees and PhD's who have demonstrated: \u2022 The ability to use technology/tools to enhance their communication and presentation skills. \u2022 Leadership in a networked environment such as establishing a professional network, being a moderator within a network, or establishing/maintaining a blog. \u2022 \"Cultural reach,\" or the ability to develop and maintain networks of active participants from several countries. It is one thing to say I studied abroad for a year, and another to say my professional network in my discipline involves a certain number of participants from specific countries. There are questions I weave into every interview session with a graduate professional seeking to join our company: \u2022 Similar questions are asked by my colleagues. This is how many students, especially those who seek employment in the private sector, are being appraised. I suspect, but will defer to your judgment as deans and leaders of graduate education, that the \"systems skills\" described above are important, perhaps even vital, for those aspiring to academic careers, both in the research lab and classroom. And again, from your perspective as deans, I suspect that ensuring that these networking skills are fostered in your graduate institution is something you deem important. Most of the senior leadership in graduate institutions will likely face the same questions: How does my institution measure up-how well are we preparing student and faculty to function in a networked world? Is our infrastructure adequate? Are we providing access, or, at the very least, information on tools or services to help graduate students foster and manage their networking skills? Are we providing guidance/evaluation on the use and acceptability of global academic or professional networks? At what juncture do we evaluate the networking skills of our students? How do we incorporate the development of networking skills into our curricula? And the perennial question about implementing strategic efforts: who in my institution will I task with this responsibility? I promised I would make a few suggestions on how institutions might respond. Notwithstanding cultural differences, many problems and opportunities are common among institutions across the globe. In terms of addressing this issue of preparing students to manage and lead in a networked world, one possibility is for graduate deans to develop a collaborative effort that would lead to the creation and publishing of \"Best Demonstrated Practices.\" A second possibility would be to develop, either within an institution or within a consortium, an \"open laboratory\" where effective networking tools and services could be deposited for use and evaluation by graduate students in a controlled environment. A transparent process would help a variety of universities get exposure to what is available. Third, in terms of when to begin networking skills evaluation, a post-acceptance survey, administered in advance of the start of a graduate program might be a useful initial assessment vehicle. Incoming orientation should address that assessment with specifics on programs available within the institution, and, more importantly, provide the institution's standards and requirements for networked communication in the graduate process. Finally, there is the question of who will manage this effort of ensuring that the institution prepares its graduate students for the networked world. That, of course, will depend on how your institution is organized. My suggestion is to meet with the Head Librarian of your institution, your CIO, if that is a separate function, and perhaps with the head of your Computer & Information Science department. Together you can begin to map your strategy, and perhaps find the right person to manage this effort. There are a good many pressing demands on the senior leadership of graduate institutions. The need to prepare graduate students for the networked environment in which they will research, teach, and work competes with many other priorities. But it is worth noting that one of the key initial nodes within any graduate student's network will be that of his or her institution, and that node will be carried and networked throughout the globe along with that institution's reputation."}, {"section_title": "University-Employer Partnerships:", "text": "An Australian Perspective 1"}, {"section_title": "Helene Marsh Chair, australian Council of deans and directors of Graduate Studies dean of Graduate research Studies James Cook University", "text": "The production of knowledge and the process of research are being radically transformed and these changes can directly affect the ways in which many doctoral candidates undertake their research. The old paradigm of knowledge discovery (Mode 1) circumscribed by disciplinary research and driven by the autonomy of researchers and their host institutions, the universities, is being superseded-but not replaced-by a new paradigm of knowledge production (Mode 2). Mode 2 research is done by teams of researchers who typically have different disciplinary backgrounds, theoretical perspectives, and skills. They assemble to work on a real-world problem in the context of its application, necessitating much closer links between the researchers and the users of the research. Researchers are brought together to form a team to address a problem. This team may be a virtual team, the members of which communicate electronically. The team dissolves when its work is finished only to be re-configured in a different constellation for another task (see Gibbons et al., 1994). Doctoral training in Australia is changing to reflect this transformation in knowledge production and the expectation that a relatively low proportion of graduates will spend their entire careers as academics in universities and will need to operate effectively in Mode 2 environments. The changes in research training in Australia to meet this requirement have been catalyzed by government policy initiatives such as Cooperative Research Centres, the Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage Scheme, Research in Industry Training Awards, and the National Environment Research Program, and by encouragement for science agencies such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australian Institute of Marine Science, and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation to become more involved in research training. In addition, the Australian Technology Network (ATN) of Universities is piloting a new model of PhD education in mathematical and statistical sciences across all five ATN universities. The centre, which is directed by a research leader with industry linkages, will commence with a cohort of 20-25 doctoral candidates in 2012. Industry engagement will be facilitated through strategic alliances with industry partners. These initiatives provide increased opportunities for Australian research higher degree candidates to undertake projects that are wholly or partially funded by industry (including government) partners. In order to undertake such a project, the candidate may be based off-campus at a government or industry research laboratory. The fields of doctoral research involved in these industry partnerships are diverse. For example, the linkage scheme operated by the Australian Research Council provided dedicated PhD stipend scholarships to an average of about 350 new doctoral scholars per year from 2003-2010. The scholars awarded \"Australian Postgraduate Research Awards Industry\" in 2010 spanned 22 of the 25 two-digit Fields of Research identified by the Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification (ANZSRC), ranging from Applied Mathematics to Applied Ethics. The fields funded by this scheme that attracted the most doctoral candidates in 2010 were Environmental Sciences, Engineering, Public Health, and Health Services (ARC personal communication, 2011). The Australian Qualifications Framework recognizes two types of research doctoral degrees (Australian Qualifications Framework Council, 2011). The PhD is designed to equip the candidate to make a significant and original contribution to knowledge, the professional doctorate a significant and original contribution to professional practice. Professional doctoral programs proliferated in the 1990s and McWilliam et al. (2002) reported that a total of 131 professional doctoral programs were offered by 35 Australian universities, particularly in the fields of Education, Health, Psychology, and Business. However, in recent years most universities have liberalized their PhD rules to accommodate new specialties and new ways in which research may be carried out. Consequently PhDs in professional fields are proving much more popular than professional doctorates (Evans et al., 2008). Thus the overwhelming majority of the doctoral candidates supported by the initiatives listed above are likely to be undertaking PhD's rather than professional doctorates."}, {"section_title": "Benefits of the Partnership", "text": "Some candidates are attracted to an industry-funded doctorate by the associated financial benefits, which may be considerable. The stipends offered are usually considerably higher than a typical stipend scholarship (about 30 per cent higher than standard stipends is not unusual). In some cases, the industry partner provides a \"top-up\" scholarship in addition to the standard scholarship. Another advantage of an industry-funded doctorate is guaranteed and often substantial project support. Such funding generally enables candidates to attempt projects that would not be feasible without external funding. Industry partners may also provide generous in-kind support such as travel to remote study sites, access to specialist infrastructure including instrumentation and data sets, plus the expertise of industry supervisors. Many doctoral candidates are attracted to industry-funded projects by the opportunity to make a difference and work on an important real world problem in a Mode 2 research environment. Working in a cross-disciplinary research team is exciting and the experience has the potential to lead to opportunities for work placement and other interactions with key stakeholders. All this may lead to future employment. Such experience also equips doctoral candidates to work in modern research agencies and industry much better than a traditional doctorate does and should greatly expand employability, especially outside academia. The research training environment of an industry-funded doctoral project can also be extremely supportive. In particular, some industryfunded research centres supporting significant cohorts of research students offer: \u2022 professional assistance with thesis writing and statistics over and above that offered by the university; \u2022 generic skills courses such as media and leadership training; \u2022 the opportunity for candidates to present their work at centresponsored conferences and workshops; \u2022 travel scholarships to assist candidates present their work at international conferences; \u2022 write-up scholarships which support candidates to write papers from their theses in the period between thesis submission and the return of examiners' reports; and \u2022 work placements. All these offerings can greatly enrich the doctoral training environment and potential employability. When the industry partner is a government department, a useful by-product of an industry-funded doctorate can be the experience of translating doctoral research into a policy briefing. For example, a group of candidates at a CRC Research Centre with which I was involved organised industry workshops for the end-users of their research. The outputs of these workshops included oral presentations on each candidate's doctoral research and written policy briefings which have been published on the Internet."}, {"section_title": "risks of the Partnership", "text": "Despite these advantages, candidates who undertake industry-funded doctorates also face significant challenges. The research project has usually been defined in detail so that the candidate does not have the same freedom to choose a topic as his or her peers on national or university scholarships. The advisor and industry partner have put a lot of effort into designing the project and as a result have a strong sense of ownership over it and may be unwilling for it to be changed. Indeed, they may be prevented from making substantive changes to the project by their contractual obligations. There are also academic challenges to doing a doctorate that has to meet both the demands of the university and deliver the outcomes required by the industry partner. Industry-funded research is usually applied and some faculty members are concerned that it may be difficult for the candidate to incorporate the scholarship necessary for doctoral research into their dissertation. The challenge of meeting these competing demands is typically more perceived than real, provided the research question is appropriate for a doctorate. The ownership of intellectual property (IP) may be an issue and candidates can feel pressured into IP agreements that they do not understand and which can impede the examination and publication of the research. Most universities provide the candidate (through the relevant Student Association to avoid perceived conflicts of interest) with the funding required to obtain the advice of an independent legal expert under such circumstances. Industry-funded doctoral candidates often complain about having to provide regular verbal and written reports which are accessible to key stakeholders, especially their industry partner. However, in my experience they appreciate the experience after graduation. In addition some candidates find that their university advisors are often inexperienced in helping them develop the practical and policy implications of the research, which is the aspect of most interest to the industry partner. Industry partners can be very helpful in making these reports accessible to a non-specialist audience."}, {"section_title": "Strategies for effective Collaboration", "text": "Effective relationships are built on agreed expectations, trust, communication, and commitment. An effective partnership requires all parties to address these aspects of the relationship. Recent doctoral research on university-industry relationships found that partnering competence is a higher priority than scientific excellence for firms choosing and trusting university partners. Candidates doing a doctorate with industry partners thus have an excellent opportunity to develop partnering skills which should be very relevant to their career development and equip them to work in the Mode 2 environment. Candidates who are supported by an industry-funded project typically gain much more than their degree. First of all, they gain the skills required to operate in a Mode 2 research environment. These skills can be enhanced if the candidate has the opportunity to negotiate a workplace placement or technology transfer scholarship to gain experience working for the industry partner and perhaps assist in implementing the outcomes of the doctoral research. Such placements often lead to employment with the industry partner but can prolong completion, which is a matter of great concern to the university partner because completions are such an important driver of government funding for doctoral training in Australia. Research agencies, government departments, and industry often complain about the challenge of recruiting doctoral graduates with the skills required to operate effectively in their workplaces. Undertaking an industry-funded doctorate can be an effective way of preparing a doctoral candidate to work in the new knowledge economy if they make the most of the opportunity and feel comfortable working in such an environment.

In Europe, this trend became explicit on the agenda of the Bologna Process in Lisbon 2000, and has been kept on the forefront of national policies. The fact is, however, that at Lisbon the stress was on the changes that society should experience to become a Knowledge Society as much as on the role universities should play in this transformation by permeating the economic fabric with knowledge. It has to be borne in mind that it was in this context that the Lisbon strategy dealt with the reform that universities should undergo, and only in order to accomplish those objectives. Among other means, it was proposed to increase the proportion of young people with a university degree and to further continuing education. There was also a call to double the total number of PhD holders until reaching the proportion of 10 doctors per 1 million active workers (the date in Spain was 5,1 in 2007; 5,8 in Europe). Naturally enough, both measures were embraced enthusiastically by universities, as they meant a growth in the numbers of students in programs which had been steadily reduced in size since the 1980s. Moreover, the cry to become more immediately useful to society by linking knowledge and economic benefit through the transference of research into applicable innovation was also welcome. It returned universities to a central role in society, as higher education was assigned a crucial mission in delivering the agents for change and progress to society at large, thus becoming explicitly for the first time in centuries to be regarded not only as a key element for individual social mobility but also for the economic development of nations. Beyond the grand rhetoric there is, however, a hope for change, some problems, and a bit of a trap. It is a platitude to state that nowadays economics means, before anything else, employability for students, their families, and even governments. Universities have the duty to account for the investment they receive from individuals and governments. In fact, if universities do not want to be seen as mere cost (not to say sheer luxury or even disposable waste of money and effort), they and we, professors, have to prove useful for one of the missions we have been jointly entrusted with: to provide the skills and the knowledge to exercise a profession. The danger is having a reductionist view of this issue, and universities are looked upon as a factory of employees tout court. This can be translated easily into incentives, as when governments decide it is going to be the main means to measure the success of a university or that it will authorize a degree forgetting other dimensions of higher education, as the Spanish government has announced recently following the example of British quality assessment of teaching. That said, there are indeed means to promote employability for university degree holders without overlooking the necessity for the economic and productive fabric to undertake changes to become more sustainable. For instance, this year the Spanish Government has approved a new regulation for doctoral degree programs. The main goal of this reform is to strengthen the Spanish training in research, development, and innovation (R+D+I) at universities in order to place it at the centre of a new knowledge. Therefore, the new regulation on PhD programs includes three main actions devised to help increasing their quality and efficiency, as well as to facilitate the PhD holders' presence in the private sector: the creation of doctoral schools, the establishment of a maximum period of time to deliver the thesis, and the design of a new doctoral profile in order to increase the competitiveness of Spanish PhDs. The new doctoral schools will be able to operate within one or several universities framework(s) and its design and development is open to other national or international organisms linked to R+D+I, including industry. Thus, it is intended to give industry an active role in curricular development, the definition of the appropriate-or necessary-lines of research, the opportunity to co-supervise with academics the dissertation's project, and collaborate in settings where soft skills are required to bridge between the scholar environment and the \"real world\" of business and industry, so much and so often deplored. Some collaboration already has been going on for some years. At my university, for example, there are agreements with a number of technological companies which offer grants for those PhD candidates that may wish to work on a given number of set lines of research. This line of research has usually an applicable dimension and responds to the necessities of the company. The research is very often conducted at the site of the company, not the university, the salary is paid directly by the company, and the person in charge at the company usually becomes co-supervisor for the final dissertation. The benefits of this system are obvious: the PhD holders can do a dissertation while they enjoy (or suffer through) a real professional experience with an appropriate salary. A major aspect is the rise in opportunities for employment at the end of the PhD. The company, on its side, profits from the work of the candidate, who quite frequently is seen as an apprentice to be hired if he or she is positively evaluated; the knowledge and guidance of the academic supervisor; and, not to be forgotten, the fuzzy but real positive consequences for its corporate image of collaborating with a highly-regarded institution. One could also hope that through the contact between academics and employers a better knowledge of the other's values and merits would result so that universities can take into account the soft skills needed for PhD holders to be employed, and the company will come to appreciate the added value of doctoral studies and PhD holders. But if the benefits of the collaboration with employers can be great for individuals, institutions, and society, the challenges and risks are equally huge. The most apparent and immediate, as it has already happened in some fields as biology and technology, a PhD candidate easily can become a cheap taskforce for the R+D+I departments or even a substitute for them. Second, and more threatening from a conceptual point of view, is that by letting employers define the lines of research for dissertations, the purpose of doctoral study could be distorted. This may happen simultaneously in two ways. The lack of freedom to look for and pursue a line of research and a corresponding methodology may hinder or even prevent the accomplishment of the main objective of doctoral programs, that is, to form researchers. And to acquire a research mind-set, autonomy, originality, and a certain amount of trial and error in the process is essential. By setting the collaboration between employers and universities in an institutional frame inside an institutional frame seems to me a positive step to prevent arbitrariness and the loss of scholarly core values and to foster the creation of a new culture of collaboration and mutual knowledge between both stakeholders. It has been said that there is no possible utopia without reality. Reality is stubborn, and it cannot be ignored that the reality is more complex than the ideal picture would allow us to assume. The fact is that to hold a university degree does not guarantee a job. In front of the increasing number of unemployed or underemployed graduates and doctors, some have raised doubts as to whether university education is the answer to the economic crisis or part of the problem. I firmly believe that education is part of the solution, but only partiallyuniversities cannot be held responsible for the crisis nor seen as a universal cure for it. To expect more could be terribly disappointing to society and might pass an awfully high bill to universities in terms of credibility and trust. Therefore, from my point of view, it is equally important to emphasize that providing well-prepared professionals and covering the demands of the job market is only a part of the mission of universities, if an important and heavy task. Because there is more to universities: anticipating (and not just meeting) the necessities of society, seeking general welfare (and not just contributing to economic growth measured in financial or productive terms), building up wisdom (and not only creating and transferring knowledge). In other words, universities should exert leadership together with other stakeholders, and not be limited to produce what the market asks for. The risk for universities of becoming mere suppliers is there, and cannot be ignored. Simple measures such as having a clear framework for collaboration with employers will preserve the universities' participation in setting the agenda, and thus being really accountable to governments, society, and individuals alike for their part."}, {"section_title": "Internationalization of Graduate Programs at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Vahan agopyan Provost for Postgraduate Studies University of S\u00e3o Paulo", "text": "Student mobility at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP) is not only intended to improve cultural diversity of graduate programmes or to improve the students' future careers. It is also considered a strong tool for the quality of these Programmes. It is necessary to point out that, according to the rules of the Brazilian Ministry of Education, graduate degrees, academic master's, Professional master's and doctoral degrees must be always research degrees. Therefore, Brazilian master's degrees are not comparable with the majority of those obtained at North American and European universities as they engage only research students. Therefore, our master's students can also take advantage of international mobility and be included in the proposed international agreements. The University of S\u00e3o Paulo, in international standards, is a very large centre for graduate studies. It adopted the aforementioned national legislation in 1969 and has been, since then, the major player of the Brazilian graduate education system. Today it has more than 23 thousand graduate research students, roughly half of them sitting for master's degrees and the other half for doctoral degrees. These students are distributed over more than 240 graduate programmes covering almost all areas of knowledge. Every year, the University awards nearly 6 thousand graduate degrees, of which around 3,600 are master's and 2,400 are doctorates. In Brazil, about 20% of the doctoral degrees and 10% of master's degrees in the country are awarded by USP. These figures used to be relatively higher during the 1970's and 1980's (more than 50%) but thanks to the dissemination of alumni throughout the country, it has been possible to reduce the regional asymmetries in Brazil. Today it is possible to find adequate research centres everywhere in the country, offering at least some master's degree programmes. USP, as a public university, does not charge fees for the students, even if they are foreigners or engaged in another university (within cooperative agreements). Moreover, governmental and private scholarships may be awarded, based on academic merit, to help foreign students cover the expenses of food, accommodation, and transport. Internationalization has been a major goal for USP since the first days of the University, in 1934. A large number of young European scholars were then invited to join the Brazilian faculty members to improve the research activities. They encouraged links between USP and foreign universities. For the University today, internationalization is a very important tool to foster academic excellence. It is essential for the development of students and their supervisors, but it is also an important mechanism to set high quality standards in the graduate programmes. For this reason, internationalization is encouraged and supported by the federal and state governments, being also a quality directive for the research funding agencies, for government evaluation of the graduate programmes, and for the University's evaluation of its own departments and faculty members. Some particularities of Brazil must be analysed. The country is large and physically distant from the developed world. The national language, Portuguese, is not widely spoken in the scientific community outside Brazil, being also unique in Latin America, where most of the neighbours speak Spanish. Portuguese is the language used for teaching and to write the dissertations and theses. Furthermore, we do not have the large number of scholarships that would make studying here very attractive for foreigners, as it is in general easier for a Latin American student to get financial support in the USA or in Europe than in Brazil. For these reasons, it has been usual to send more students abroad than to attract foreign ones. In spite of these difficulties, due to Brazil's huge cultural and ethnical diversities, as well as the people's high social tolerance, the students from foreign universities, although in relatively small number, are very well absorbed in the community, including those from Africa and South Asia. As internationalization is one of the USP guidelines, students from all continents are welcomed, and the process is stimulated via networks and consortiums such as Erasmus Mundus, Associa\u00e7\u00e3o das Universidades de L\u00edngua Portuguesa (Portuguese Language Universities Association), and the Magalh\u00e3es network, among others. Besides the opportunities for the foreign students to apply to our Graduate Programmes, there are schemes available to our students (even if they are from other countries) and to those from foreign universities such as: \u2022 Internship: basically a visit for short period, up to 3 months; an agreement between the supervisors is enough; \u2022 Split degree: generally up to one year, but it can be longer if necessary; besides the agreement between the supervisors it is necessary to have the formal acceptance of the universities; the degree is provided by the university in which the student has originally enrolled; in Brazil it is also known as a 'sandwich degree'; \u2022 Double degree: the student spends at least one year, but usually two years, in the visiting university; the degree is provided by both universities, so a formal agreement between the institutions is required; \u2022 International graduate programme: established by two or more universities; every student joining this programme is considered as a common student from the partners. Recent data 1 shows that, in 2008, around 70% of the doctors that graduated from 1996 until 2006 were working in Brazilian universities and another 20% in research centres or similar institutions. Only a small number of the doctors were employed in private or public companies. This happens mainly because there is still a lack of doctors to form the faculty of the universities, and because the Brazilian graduate system is designed to prepare researchers for academia. This may be the major challenge for the country, as few doctors join the industry. Once again, internationalization may be an important tool to demonstrate to our students who spend some time abroad that doctors may play an important role outside the universities and that this activity can be very challenging and stimulating. The statistics are not reliable, but it seems that the students that engage in an international activity follow a professional career outside academia more frequently. Moreover, with internationalization, due to a higher cultural diversity experience both in S\u00e3o Paulo and abroad, the students of USP are getting better opportunities to pursue a career in foreign and international institutions. In conclusion, the University of S\u00e3o Paulo holds internationalization as a priority. Today this internationalization is implemented mainly in the form of research partnerships of our faculty, but student international mobility has been stimulated and is increasing steadily. We expect that this mobility and the focus on international relationships as a tool for achieving high quality standards will lead to the increasing of the internationalization of our graduates' careers.\nThe Ministry of Education first formalized Brazilian Graduate Studies in 1965. Until this date the main universities used to award doctoral degrees according to their own rules and these titles were not valid nationwide. Since then, a major effort has been made in order to increase the number of graduate programmes, the number of students enrolled in them, and to spread these programmes throughout the country. The original purpose of developing graduate studies in Brazil was to improve the international competitiveness of the country. However, as there was then a large demand to form the faculty for the universities, the graduate programmes have been designed to prepare researchers for academia. Since the numbers of institutions and undergraduate courses and students are continuously increasing, currently the number of faculty members with a doctoral degree is still low in several universities, particularly in the new ones. According to the rules of the Brazilian Ministry of Education, the academic master's degrees, professional master's degrees and doctorates must always be research degrees. Therefore, since Brazilian master's degrees engage only research students, they are not comparable with the majority of those obtained at North American and European universities. In Brazil, all of the graduate programmes and courses have to be approved and evaluated triennially by the Ministry of Education through the CAPES Foundation. Current data collected from CAPES are very encouraging, as the numbers of graduate Programmes and of students practically doubled during the last ten years. Nowadays, there are almost 3,000 Programmes with more than 170,000 students, nearly 65,000 of which are sitting for doctoral degrees. In 2010, more than 45,000 master's degrees and more than 11,000 doctoral degrees were awarded in the country. More than 80% of the graduate programmes are in public universities. The number of professional master's courses is about 10% of academic ones. However, the regional distribution of these numbers is not adequate as there are huge asymmetries, since not only the majority of doctoral courses but also the better evaluated ones are concentrated in the states of S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais. Finally, less than 10% of doctorate courses are in engineering and technology. The Ministry of Science and Technology carried out in 2010 a comprehensive study on the career of the doctoral graduates in Brazil. This research output was disappointing, as around 70% of the doctors that graduated from 1996 until 2006 were working, in 2008, in Brazilian universities, 12% were engaged within governmental activities, and another 8% in research centres. Less than 10% of the doctors were working in economically productive sectors. In fact, only 7.1% of the doctors of the country are in industry. This happens because of two main reasons: a) the lack of experience of companies in investing in research, development, and innovation because of the relatively short period of economic stability in the country and b) the focus of forming graduates destined to faculty positions rather than to assuming places in the productive sector and giving support to national strategies for economic development. These issues are raised in the 2011-2020 National Plan for Graduate Studies, prepared at the end of 2010 by a commission appointed by the Ministry of Education/CAPES. In the plan there is a full chapter discussing the role of graduate studies on preparing human resources for public and private corporations. However the conclusions are very evident that the country needs to: stimulate and increase the number of master's and doctoral graduates employed outside academia; increase the number of graduates in the areas of technology and engineering, in particular in the national strategic sectors such as energy, telecommunications, automotive, chemicals and petrochemicals, health, steelwork, aeronautics, agribusiness, food and textiles; and stimulate students towards innovations. Nevertheless there is not a single proposal on how these goals can be achieved. The Brazilian legislation is improving and encouraging the links between the university and other research centres with industry. Some important measures are already proposed for the public universities such as: the use of laboratories and other research facilities by the companies; allowing the faculty to take up to four-year sabbaticals in order to work for private and public companies; and the possibility of graduate students performing their research work in subjects related to the needs of some companies. The relationship between academia and industry has been increasing very sharply during the last two decades but until now this relationship has been restricted to research agreements with the companies or consultancy activities of the faculty, almost always excluding the involvement of graduate students. With the help of the new legislation and the increasing volume of collaborative research work, it is expected that the next step will be the engagement of the assimilation of graduated students into companies. Traditionally graduate education in Egypt aimed at supplying universities with sufficient numbers of professors, lecturers, and instructors. For most of the twentieth century, holders of doctoral and master's degrees were directed either to fill academic positions in universities or to become researchers in the various national research centers. Even though the objectives of the two career lines may have differed over the past fifty years, these two main careers have essentially converged on fulfilling very similar goals: specifically, faculty members or scientists must publish a number of research papers in order to get promoted and to advance their careers as researchers, professors, or university administrators. The majority of the published research has minimal economic impact in the various fields, at the same time, the link between industry and academia is rudimentary at best, with very little research and development undertaken to serve the needs of business enterprises. Nonetheless, the first decade of the 21 st century witnessed significant change in the availability of sources of funding for research in Egypt. This is reflected in the large increase in available funding for both natural and social sciences. The availability of research funding from European and American agencies also provided decent support that builds on the recently established Egyptian Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF). The later consolidated all previously scattered research mechanisms to provide support through a competitive and transparent process. In addition, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MCIT) and the Industrial Modernization Center (IMC) created funding mechanisms that aim primarily at strengthening the links between enterprise and academia. This trend was accompanied by a clear rise in the demand for MBA graduates from a wide range of businesses that benefited from the large increase in foreign direct investment in Egypt (2006Egypt ( -2010 and the fast economic growth in the Persian Gulf countries. These circumstances encouraged more students in Egypt to pursue their postgraduate studies. Similar trends were also observed in other countries in the region over the past few years. Egypt is the most populous country in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), with the largest number of doctorate-degree holders. Accordingly, Egyptian scholars have for many years filled the positions of university professorships in MENA-region universities, especially in the Persian Gulf countries. In recent years, the rapid increase in the numbers of higher-education institutions in the Gulf region has created a substantial demand for Egyptian scholars but at the same time has constituted a serious source for Egypt's brain drain. This situation is aggravated by the large differential in compensation packages that the Egyptian professors receive in MENA universities when compared to their pay in Egypt. Currently, the continuous deterioration of the work conditions of faculty members in Egyptian institutions is causing an exodus of some of its best scientists. This is further compounded by the failure to link with or to make use of Egyptian scholars who settled in western countries. The inability to attract these experts, in contrast to countries like India and China, is an opportunity lost.  Currently most of the holders of masters and doctorate degrees become university teachers without contributing significantly to the creation of a knowledge-based society. This is happening despite the substantial increase in research funding both in Egypt and in the MENA region. Figure 1 shows that even though the Global Innovation Index for Egyptian researchers is comparable to Turkey and Brazil, the quality of its research institutions is dubious. The results were generated using the data analyzer of the Global Innovation Index (GII) report 2011 (http://www.globalinnovationindex.org/gii/). Figure 2 illustrates that very little of the research produced in the MENA-region universities is being patented when compared to other countries, even though the number of scientific journal articles produced in countries like Egypt and Tunisia is comparable or even better than that produced in Brazil, India, South Africa or Turkey. The way out of this situation is to graduate enough holders of master's and doctoral degrees who can meet the growing demand for university professors in the MENA region and at the same time to formulate a strategy that aims at enhancing the competitiveness of the Egyptian economy through the advancement of innovative research. This strategy is based on the development of the ability of both the labor market and the capital market to innovate. In Egypt, the progress of both markets needs an adequate legal framework, which should aim at the formulation of policies and procedures that simplify and streamline the operation of all stakeholders. This strategy must be concerned with the creation of an enabling environment in which innovation can thrive and contribute to new industry formation, industry diversification, and industry upgrading. Enhancing human capacity through training programs and graduate education is indispensable. Furthermore, emphasis should be given to the development of indigenous technologies that evolve out of and in relation to cutting-edge global knowledge. Accordingly, the identification of strategic research priorities is of utmost importance in order to focus efforts towards achieving breakthroughs in vital areas."}, {"section_title": "Internationalization of Graduate Programs at Dalian University of Technology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Xiangpei Hu Professor of Management Science executive dean of Graduate School dalian University of Technology", "text": "The internationalization of graduate programs is becoming a trend for many institutions with the development of economic globalization. The current problems, challenges and programs in Dalian University of Technology (DUT) are stated here in detail. There are 9,331 master's degree candidates and 3,424 PhD candidates at DUT, and every year we enroll and graduate 3900. Because of the fierce competition in the job market and with the development of economic globalization, there are three problems existing in career development for graduates. Firstly, it is easy to find a job but not a satisfying one. DUT is one of the top 25 universities, as well as one of the key universities under the direct leadership of the State Ministry of Education. It has won a great reputation in the job market, so the graduates can get offers very easily, but it is hard for them to get better jobs. Secondly, there exists a great gap between graduates that companies favor and those that are educated and trained by institutions. China is now full of multinational companies and has an export-oriented economy, which results in a high demand of internationally-oriented talents, which contradicts with the current objectives of advance education in institutions. Students with cultural diversity are better able to compete in the new global economy, because international experiences bring with them language skills, new ways of thinking, creative solutions to difficult problems, and negotiating skills. Therefore, the internationalization of graduate programs is becoming a trend for many institutions, which creates a great opportunity of career development for graduate students. The challenges are how to send our students into the world-famous universities studying with world-famous scholars and how to establish international programs to attract excellent foreign students to DUT. During recent years, DUT has made great efforts in internationalization in the hope of being promoted to a world-famous and research-oriented university. Firstly, DUT is one of the universities authorized by the State Ministry of Education in China to enroll overseas students. The university has set up the School of International Cultural Exchanges to take the responsibility for enrollment, education, and management of international students. In order to further develop international friendships and promote the cultural and academic exchanges between people all over the world, this school attracts overseas students from various parts of the world. Now there are overseas students from more than 40 countries studying in DUT, and this semester, the number of degree students is 320 and the number of language students is 240. DUT's strategic target is to continue increasing the number of degree students greatly by setting up the international programs for foreign students who are willing to pursue their master's or doctoral degrees. In addition, to enhance national strength, we are attracting more foreign students from developed countries. Secondly, we provide two ways for our PhD students to pursue research abroad. The first way is provided by the China Scholarship Council, whose objective is to provide assistance, especially financial assistance, to Chinese citizens wishing to study abroad and to the foreign citizens wishing to study in China. We send about 100 PhD students per year through this way. The second way is the joint-degree program. Currently, we have established this kind of program with institutions from France, Belgium, etc. Thirdly, for master's and MBA/EMBA students, DUT also has several kinds of international programs. For example, DUT has set steady collaborations with Waseda University for joint-degree master's programs. According to this program, master's students study courses in DUT for the first year, and in Waseda University for the second year, and then come back to DUT for one-year research for the third year. Then they can get double degrees from both DUT and Waseda University. This experience can prepare them better for a more competitive job market. And for MBA/EMBA education, the school of management at DUT is one of the earliest schools in China which imported MBA degree education since 1984 by the cooperation with the State University of New York. There are mainly three kinds of international programs. First, we have an international MBA class every year, which is composed halfand-half of abroad and domestic students . Second, there are about 100 EMBA students every year, and 60-70% of them have opportunities to study abroad. Third, every year we send over ten MBA students to Japan, France, and Germany for dual degrees. During past 27 years, DUT has achieved great success in MBA education. For example, in the 1990s, DUT set up the cooperation with Sinopec, providing MBA education for their employees who could be trained for three months in the USA during their study. In recent years, those early MBA graduates are all stepping into high-level management positions. In addition, there are other international programs such as international workshops and seminars, summer schools for worldwide students, and short-term internship summer schools in Germany, Japan, etc. for our students. Although some programs are commercial ones, students are still suggested to attend the programs to improve themselves. Promising outcomes have been achieved after years of endeavor in the internationalization of graduate programs. The PhD students we sent out are now successful in every walk of life. Through the statistical analysis based on our tracking study, we found that student mobility has made a great contribution to their careers, both in industrial and academic research fields. Over the last five years, there are more than 800 students in DUT who have the international background and this number is still growing sharply. And most of those MBA/EMBA alumni with a background of studying abroad are now in high-level management positions, which indicates that internationalization has a positive effect on career development. Globalization has altered the landscape of higher education. The academy is challenged to prepare students to better live and work in today's global society. Cultural understanding and global awareness are essential for students as they are being prepared to become excellent leaders, to be competitive in the global marketplace, and to solve growing global problems. In the future, for the sake of career development of our graduate students, DUT will focus on the following aspects. First, we will set up international programs for postgraduate students, focusing on teaching in English with English materials, in the hope of enhancing their competitive power in career development. Second, we will attract more excellent international students to DUT, who can bring their cultures into our campus and provide us with a strong internationalized atmosphere. And we will also establish international programs in some key disciplines for foreign students pursuing their master's or doctoral degrees. Internationalization of graduate programs is a global trend in education, and if this opportunity is grasped, both the graduate students and the institutions will greatly benefit from it."}, {"section_title": "VI.

To strengthen research at Germany's universities by organising a competition and to raise its visibility internationally-such were the goals set when the programme was launched in 2005. These were ambitious goals indeed, all the more so, as it meant a departure from a long-cherished conception that all universities are equal and should be treated equally. Instead, the Excellence Initiative chose a path of inequality and of funding elites. The competition was organized by both the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) and the Wissenschaftsrat (WR, German Council of Science and Humanities). It is important to note that neither organization runs a research institution, i.e., they are not research performing organizations. The DFG is a non-governmental member organization of German universities which funds research projects after peer review of submitted applications; the WR, in contrast, is an organization which is primarily concerned with evaluating universities in order to advise policymakers and to suggest structural improvements. A total of \u20ac1.9 billion was made available by the federal and state governments to fund the selected projects. The first phase shook up the German universities, which submitted an impressive range of forward-looking research concepts in two rounds. By doing so, it was precisely the universities that had been dismissed as notoriously inflexible which proved particularly innovative. The competition was organized to select outstanding projects in three areas: \u2022 Graduate Schools to promote young scientists and researchers \u2022 Clusters of excellence to promote cutting edge research \u2022 institutional Strategies on projects to promote top-level research. All proposals were reviewed by internationally-appointed panels of experts-80% of reviewers came from abroad. At the end of the two rounds, in October 2006 and October 2007, scientists and politicians in the \"grants committee\" together selected 85 institutions: 39 Graduate Schools, 37 Clusters of Excellence, and finally, nine Institutional Strategies. 1 The Graduate Schools aim to combine and improve the promotion of young scientists and researchers and to raise the profile of research. Highly qualified doctoral students are trained in these schools that offer an excellent research environment. Graduate schools are grounded in a broad scientific environment, build on innovative questions, and are headed by proven scientists. Hence, they provide the ideal conditions for a doctorate, inspire the doctoral students to identify with the respective campus, and altogether contribute to forming internationally competitive centres of science. International networking and qualification strategies for the young researchers, tailor-made study programs and teaching in English language are prerequisites that were reviewed in detail by international experts. Each school receives an average of one million euros per year for a five-year funding period. The Clusters of Excellence concentrate and focus the research potential at university locations in Germany and, hence, strengthen their international visibility and competitiveness. Their policy is to engage in scientific networking and collaboration in research fields of particular promise for the future. Besides various university institutions, non-university research institutions and industrial partners also play important roles throughout the clusters. Clusters of excellence have been conceived to contribute importantly to the respective university's strategic planning and to accelerate the process of setting thematic priorities at universities. They should also create excellent training and career conditions for early career researchers. A total of 37 clusters of excellence receive funding over a period of five years, each receiving an average of 6.5 million euros per year. Institutional Strategies aim to strengthen a university as a whole, so that it can compete successfully with the leading players in the international science market. An institutional strategy calls for a university to develop a long-term strategy on how it can consistently expand and enhance its cutting-edge research and improve the promotion of young scientists and researchers. This means identifying existing strengths and sharpening profiles in all fields. To qualify for the third funding line, universities have to develop an exceptional institutional strategy and must, additionally, each have at least one graduate school and one cluster of excellence. Nine universities and their institutional strategies are funded for five years, with each receiving up to 13.5 million euros per year. The selection of proposals was strictly scientific. The main selection criteria were: \u2022 excellence in research and in promoting early career researchers in at least one broad scientific area; \u2022 a general strategy for interdisciplinarity and international networking in research; and \u2022 cooperation with other universities and/or non-university institutions, usually on the basis of concrete and binding cooperation agreements."}, {"section_title": "What has been achieved so far for Phd training?", "text": "The Excellence Initiative is not only changing the German science and research system-it is actually driving the country forward as a whole. To date it has created well over 4,000 new jobs in research and science, promoting the specialists, experts, and executives of tomorrow, and it is contributing to innovation in business and industry. This development is also internationally recognized. Allocation of \"fresh\" money, the highest possible flexibility of budget and, last but not least, the introduction of a 20% overhead gave German universities striking possibilities to put ideas into practice. Graduate schools are new in terms of size, financial budget and structure and have a professional organization and management. Achievements so far are that universities took their chance to reorganize PhD training with regard to enrolment process, thesis committees, mentoring concepts, improved supervision, supervision contracts, individual career plans, ethical training, internal quality assurance, family support, and gender measures. A change of mindsets has led to strong pressure on quality orientation in PhD research and training. All funded schools exhibit a high number of international contacts, ranging from exchange of young scientists to international recruiting of PhD candidates and professors. The impulse towards greater internationalization and new interdisciplinary cooperation contributes to an open and international atmosphere. The mode and comprehensiveness of international collaboration is defined by the institutions themselves and is in many cases driven by the direct needs of the research projects. This also holds true for the spectrum of scientific disciplines involved. Why is such a competition run by a funding organization like the DFG? Firstly, it was clear that the impetus had to come from outside the universities themselves. Secondly, with regard to PhD training, DFG has more than 20 years of experience funding PhD programs (Research Training Groups, Graduiertenkollegs). Thus the scientific community accepts and trusts the standards DFG develops in its programs and peer review processes: the requirements for excellent research training are not imposed by politics but are formulated and specified by the respective scientific communities themselves, leading to a high willingness for innovation. The role of the DFG-besides organizing the competition, the review process and allocation of funds-is therefore supporting the universities to develop standards for high level research training in PhD programs, taking into account the specific requirements of the various scientific fields, as well as distinctive local features. This in turn gives rise to a high variability among the graduate schools that are funded, which is clearly intended in order to allow the schools to build upon their local traditions and strengths. In 2009 the federal and state governments decided that the Excellence Initiative should be continued-and with increased financial support, a clear indication that politicians are convinced that the main targets of the Excellence Initiative were met. DFG and WR had strongly demanded the continuation of support from politicians. That the call was answered in the midst of the most serious financial and economic crisis of recent decades can be seen as a strong and positive signal. The second phase of the Excellence Initiative started in 2010. The universities applied for the new funding with 227 new draft projects. In March 2011, the Joint Commission of the DFG and the German Council of Science and Humanities selected 59 of these to submit full proposals for the final round. In parallel, 84 initiatives already funded from the first phase are now applying for renewal, making a total of 143 initiatives. The final results of the exciting second phase competition will be published on June 15, 2012."}, {"section_title": "International University Partnerships at the University of Hong Kong", "text": "Paul K.

International partnerships between universities located in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) have created a new environment that is conducive for the higher education institutions to make use of resources available in the region in addition to cross-border opportunities. Universities in Egypt, the most populous country in the region that enjoys a central geographical location, are benefiting from two partnership support mechanisms that have become increasingly effective over the past few years. The first mechanism is the increased spending on higher education, scientific research, and technology development in the Persian Gulf region that creates interesting partnership opportunities between universities in the MENA countries. The other mechanism is the availability of European funding for research and educational projects implemented through consortia formed from European institutions partnering with MENAregion universities. In this paper, some of the main features of these two influences on university partnerships in the MENA region will be discussed. The paper is concluded by commenting on the current situation in Egypt and presenting two specific examples of successful partnerships."}, {"section_title": "The Pearls of the Gulf", "text": "In the past decade several attempts to establish world-class higher education institutions have been undertaken in the Arab States of the Gulf region. Traditionally, the number of universities that existed in this region did not meet the demands for higher education. This problem was more pronounced for postgraduate studies, where the Gulf countries resorted in most cases to sending their students to Europe and the USA to earn their graduate degrees. About ten years ago, a clear shift towards the establishment of a string of world-class higher education institutes was undertaken. This has been fueled by a flourishing economy in this part of the world due to the sharp increase in oil revenues. Several remarkable models have evolved that differ significantly in their approach towards achieving the objectives and aspirations set by each of these institutions. A development worthy of noting is that, in addition to higher education, these newly-established institutions have chosen to invest heavily in cutting-edge research that will hopefully lead to increased innovation and to the advancement of industrial development. These issues are taking higher priorities in many of the MENA countries and especially in the Gulf region. Examples of initiatives directed towards strengthening higher education and inventive research include King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) that will be linked to King Abdullah Economic City in Thuwal (KSA), Qatar Foundation, Qatar Education City, Qatar Science and Technology Research Park, the Advanced Technology Investment Cluster (ATIC) in Abu Dhabi, and Masdar city that will include Masdar Institute of Technology. The models for achieving the goals of these new institutions have followed one of two approaches or a combination of them. The first is to establish an educational system that is based on close collaborations with world-class universities; examples of this approach are the US universities that have branch campuses in Qatar Education City. The second approach builds on initiating joint research projects with some of the top universities in the world. A prime example of this approach is the KAUST model, where collaboration on research becomes the basis of exchanges between the partner universities either for faculty or graduate students. It also opens up venues for the utilization of what could be considered as shared top-of-the-line research facilities. These collaborations also create synergies between researchers in partner institutions that should lead to the narrowing of the scientific knowledge gap. The establishment of this string of \"Pearl\" institutions is creating a flourishing academic environment that is transforming the educational and research landscape in the respective countries and the region as a whole. The main effect of this transformation is the creation of a huge demand for scientists and researchers who are needed to run the advanced facilities established in these institutions. Most of the Gulf countries do not have sufficient manpower to make full use of the facilities that are being developed and have to attract scientists from other countries. In addition, they have to work hard on training sufficient numbers of scientists, researchers and technicians and to have an economic environment that benefits from technological innovation resulting from such an investment. If successful, these newly established \"Pearl\" institutions would act as a locomotive for building up the human capacity needed for producing high quality scientific and technological research in the region. There are several novel features associated with this endeavor: firstly, these \"Pearl\" institutions are attracting scientists and graduate students from all over the world in addition to top scholars from the region. Secondly, several of these academic institutes are associated with research parks that are designed to magnify the impact of the developed technologies on the local economies. Finally, they benefit from funding resources that allow researchers from other countries to be supported when they collaborate with faculty members from local universities. Egypt, with the largest number of doctorate degree holders in the region and the highest output of published articles in scientific and technical journals, is a natural source for the needed human capacity. In addition, Egyptian higher education institutes can play a vital role in training and building up the manpower necessary for achieving the goals of these ventures."}, {"section_title": "The Winds of european academic exchanges", "text": "In an effort to increase cooperation between southern Mediterranean and European Union (EU) countries, several mechanisms have been developed by the European Commission. Prominent among these is the TEMPUS (Trans-European Mobility Scheme for University Studies) programme, which supports the modernization of higher education in countries surrounding the EU including the MENA region. This is established through the creation of partnerships between higher education institutions in the EU and partner countries. Projects funded by TEMPUS aim at developing and modernizing curricula, improving teaching methods or materials, and enhancing the quality and relevance of higher education institutions. Partnerships function through consortia of organizations including higher education institutions, businesses, ministries, and non-governmental organizations working in both EU and partner countries. In addition, a complementary programme, Erasmus Mundus, funds the exchanges of higher education students and faculty members between European universities and universities from other countries. Egypt has benefited to a great extent from receiving funds for a variety of projects, where for TEMPUS III (2002III ( -2007 Egyptian institutes where partners in 52 Joint European Projects (JEP) and 12 Structural and Complementary Measures (SCM) projects totaling around \u20ac 22.4 million, not counting a large number of individual mobility grants. In the first three years (2008)(2009)(2010) of the currently running TEMPUS IV programme, Egyptian higher education institutes were partners in 17 projects. These partnerships have strengthened relationships between European and Egyptian higher education institutes and have proven to be a catalyst for the reform of Egyptian universities and to be a contributor to the enhancement of educational quality. More importantly the TEMPUS programme opened the way for other modes of collaboration on research and strengthened Egyptian-European networks of researchers. It also aimed at introducing different aspects of the Bologna Process to the Egyptian system. Although this step is not fully implemented, the Tempus programme has brought its flavor into the system and it is perceived as a process that will standardize the higher degrees offered by universities in Egypt and accordingly will provide enhanced international job opportunities for their graduates. The European Research, Development and Innovation (RDI-Egypt) fund has contributed in its first phase an amount of \u20ac 11 million to research projects that link academia with industry in Egypt, with the possibility of including European partners. This is achieved through the support of initiatives and projects that contribute to enhancing technological innovation and to improving competitiveness of the different economic sectors in Egypt. In addition, the RDI programme aims at enhancing collaboration between the academic research community and industry so they can embark on fruitful cooperation that raises awareness on the importance of R&D and innovation. Furthermore, this programme aims at facilitating Egyptian participation in European research efforts. The main funding mechanism for the latter is through the participation in the EU Framework Programme 7 (FP7). Researchers from Egyptian universities and research centers contributed to several FP6 and FP7 projects over the past few years. From 2002From -2008, Egyptian institutions participated in 84 FP6 and FP7 projects. However, half of these were directed towards Networks of Excellence and Coordination and Support Action projects. These are intended to strengthen networking activities that enhance the participation of Egyptian scientists in FP7 projects and do not reflect direct contribution to the cutting-edge research undertaken by EU consortia members. Elevating the level of research done in Egyptian universities and research institutes to be on par with that carried out in Europe is a real challenge and the FP7 partnerships provide a unique opportunity to achieve this goal. EU-funded projects are steering Egyptian institutions towards close collaboration with some of the top universities in Europe. This will definitely strengthen the capabilities of Egyptian scientists and researchers, not to mention that such projects provide opportunities to learn about how academia links to industry in Europe. This know-how is desperately needed to develop the infrastructure necessary for the advancement of industrial innovative research in Egypt."}, {"section_title": "egyptian Tides", "text": "The two aforementioned mechanisms are creating a \"Spring\" of scientific and educational partnerships that is transforming how innovative research is done in the MENA region. These mechanisms should be considered carefully by Egyptian higher education institutes because they can either provide excellent opportunities or pose strong competition depending on how they are dealt with. Appreciation of these schemes and managing them properly can be a blessing for Egypt. If these partnerships are strengthened and are allowed to prosper they will contribute to the transformation of the research and educational landscape in the region. A positive development is that the two mechanisms described here are complemented by a growing local support provided by the Egyptian government. This includes the recent establishment of the Egypt-IBM Nanotechnology Research Center. In addition, a number of more specific binational funding schemes are also available to support collaborations between scientists associated with universities in Egypt and partners in the USA, Germany, or Japan. A tide of high levels of funding for good quality research projects has risen over the past ten years and has been propelled by different schemes of international partnerships. One should be prudent, however, when considering the recent political developments in Egypt because of the instability in the administration of the universities and research institutes. If these issues are not resolved quickly or the level of governmental support of research is not sustained, this tide might ebb and valuable opportunities could be missed. Meanwhile, it is hoped that the democratization of the Egyptian political system will create a more open framework that will remove a great deal of unnecessary restrictions on scientific research that, so far, have hampered it. The American University in Cairo (AUC) is one of the oldest universities in Egypt (established in 1919) and has evolved from an undergraduate liberal arts higher education institute to a university that strongly supports graduate studies and advanced research. To demonstrate the nature of this transition, I shall comment on two partnerships that I was involved in and that reflect the nature of the transformation of the character of my home institution. 1. An example of the first mechanism deals with a partnership between AUC and KAUST through which joint research work on three different projects was used as a vehicle to engage KAUST post-doctoral fellows who started on research projects initiated at AUC and who eventually moved to KAUST over a period of several years (2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012). This model created a natural bridge for research collaboration that constitutes a solid foundation for future collaborative work. It is hoped that this sort of cooperation will evolve with time in a variety of ways, including becoming a basis for future co-supervision of the work of graduate students or establishing joint/dual degrees to be offered by the two institutions. Other prospects include the commercialization of jointly-developed technologies and inventions. 2. The second example is an EU partnership that involves a consortium formed of several European universities and organizations collaborating with four universities in Egypt. The aim of this project is to establish Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) in the Egyptian universities, namely, Cairo University, Helwan University, Assiut University, and AUC. These offices are the first ones to be established in Egypt and they work on the protection of technological innovations in their respective universities. They are also involved in educating Egyptian faculty members in the four universities about the patenting and commercialization of their inventions. The European Patent office and TTOs in partnering European universities have been forthcoming in providing guidance and support to the nascent TTOs in Egypt. Training is also offered to the Egyptian Patent Office and to the members of the association of investors in the 6 th of October industrial city. The know-how developed through this project is an earnest effort to amplify the impact of university research on the local economy. Despite the short period that passed since the inception of the four TTOs, they are already engaged in efforts to commercialize several inventions produced in Egyptian universities and research centers. These two partnerships are examples of collaborations that create opportunities for graduate students who are interested in working in academia, as well as, to those who decide to pursue careers in industry or private businesses. At the same time, these projects act as catalysts for the enhancement of research quality and for the identification of the best technological innovations in partner universities. training of graduate students-their future members. In order to check whether this is actually true, I investigated the matter through some associations' web sites and annual event schedules. Although the CAP web site has an Education section, I could not find anything specific on soft skills or related workshops. Interestingly, I noticed that in order to get the professional certification PPhys, you have to go through an evaluation process that uses the following criteria: \"management skills, where applicable; communication and interpersonal skills; understanding of the social implications of physics.\" Since these topics are not typically part of the graduate physics curriculum, it is unclear to me how students are supposed to acquire these skills. In any case, there is recognition that these skills are essential. Not surprisingly, the much larger (and richer) APS does offer numerous workshops during the year. It has a whole section on Professional Development and offers webinars. This is a great resource for physicists and scientists in general. Similarly, the American Chemical Society (ACS) has a \"Center for professional development\" on its web site. I also found useful resources on the web site of the Biophysical Society. In my mind, it is clear that discipline-based associations are (or should be) important actors. In some respect, many are actually offering very similar training programs. When I add to this what grad schools and universities are offering, the word \"duplication\" immediately comes to mind. Duplication can also be seen as a splendid opportunity for collaboration between sectors, disciplines, and even countries."}, {"section_title": "ontario's degree level expectations", "text": "In the Province of Ontario, where the University of Ottawa is located, we now have clear Degree Level Expectations (DLE) for all College and University degrees (University of Ottawa, 2011). Our quality assurance process now includes the DLEs, something I personally welcome. Here are some of these expectations for PhD degrees: the capacity to contribute to the development of academic or professional skills, techniques, tools, practices, ideas, theories, approaches, and/ or materials; the qualities and transferable skills necessary for employment requiring the exercise of personal responsibility and largely autonomous initiative in complex situations; the ability to evaluate the broader implications of applying knowledge to particular contexts; the ability to communicate complex and/or ambiguous ideas, issues and conclusions clearly and effectively. Similar definitions exist in other jurisdictions. Since the traditional PhD program does not directly address all of these issues, something must be done. But what? In my experience, this is a standard topic for discussion when grad deans meet. One possibility is to add formal training into the PhD programs, but this seems too onerous: surely, academic credits are not needed for such activities. Another option is for grad schools (and their partners on campus) to offer optional workshops to complement the formal academic training. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of the students ever register for these workshops because they do not see the need for them before they enter the job market (a.k.a., the real world), i.e., before it is too late. I do not even mention the resistance of many supervisors who think that the only good place for a graduate student is in the lab-do not get me started on this topic! I thus suggest that disciplinary and professional societies might play a very important role here since they are likely to have more credibility than ivorytower professors for this type of issue."}, {"section_title": "Mitacs as a national resource?", "text": "An interesting Canadian alternative is Mitacs, a unique Canadian organization. The first part of its mission statement explains why I call it an alternative: \"Through unique research and training programs, Mitacs is developing the next generation of innovators with vital scientific and business skills.\" As an example, its STEP program is offering workshops on: the Basics of the Business Environment; Communication; Project Management; Entrepreneurship; & Intellectual Property. Workshops are offered throughout most of the country, and they are very popular with our graduate students (especially in the sciences, but the humanities students are also joining the workshops). In one of their workshops, they even teach the art of the perfect handshake. We thus have a national organization that can replace, at least to some extent, both the discipline-based associations and graduate schools. Mitacs is still reinventing itself, but it seems to be ideally placed to reduce duplication and optimize the way we help our students improve their skills. This is an experiment that we should follow very closely."}, {"section_title": "Preliminary Conclusions", "text": "In my opinion, grad schools are stuck between the proverbial rock and the equally proverbial hard place. On the one hand, they have to make sure that their students acquire the skills they will need (solving differential equations is good, but it is not sufficient anymoreperhaps it never was). On the other hand, they know that it would be very expensive to put together a comprehensive training program for their students (on many campuses, we are talking about several thousand graduate students). The latter point is made even more critical (or absurd) by the fact that all universities are developing their own material, their own approach. The wheel has been (and will be) reinvented hundreds of time. Beyond universities, we have numerous disciplinary and professional societies that also develop such programs. They, too, suffer from the duplication virus. This is an area where collaboration between universities and discipline-based societies and associations would benefit all parties. In many cases, these societies are international, which opens the door to global collaborations. At this time, though, there is no clear forum where these issues are discussed in the presence of all stakeholders. he Annual Strategic Leaders Global Summit is a process as much as an event. This process aims to build international consensus, while also respecting important distinctions among graduate education systems and research cultures worldwide. By providing a forum for discussion and a starting point for consensus, the Summit endeavors to foster continued communication and collaboration among graduate leaders across the globe. Each annual Global Summit has resulted in the development of a set of consensus points that are deliberated and approved by all participants at the forum's concluding panel. Over the past five years, strong collective statements on a range of important issues in graduate education have emerged from these conversations: the \"Banff Principles\" on advancing and improving graduate education globally (2007); the Guidelines for Future Collaborations on Scholarly Integrity in a Global Context (2008); the Principles and Practices for Effective International Collaborations (2009); and Principles and Practices for Assessing the Quality of (Post)Graduate Education and Research Training (2010). Through active debate, the 2011 summit participants together generated principles and practices that are both broadly-applicable and specific enough to remain locally relevant. The 2011 statement, Principles and Practices for Building Pathways from Graduate School to Careers, includes eight points supporting the need for continued commitment to graduate student career development across graduate programs. These statements address the vital role faculties have in graduate programs, and the need to actively communicate with faculty and other strategic partners about the various \"transferable skills\" students should develop in graduate school. The eight points also clearly demonstrate that sustained and accurate tracking of career outcomes is important for individual programs, as information for potential and enrolled students, and to demonstrate the importance of graduate education to the public, employers, and all levels of government. We hope that these consensus points will prove useful to graduate institutions throughout the world in the following ways. First, as networks become increasingly globalized, these principles can serve as a starting point and guide for international graduate programs seeking to build collaborations to meet common goals. These principles represent the outcome of one international conversation, and provide a platform for further discussions within countries and regions and across national boundaries. Second, these principles may serve as a useful tool in demonstrating needs related to graduate career development to funding organizations, budget offices, academic programs, and faculties. The combined authority of graduate leaders' voices illustrates the larger importance of career development programming, tracking, and curricular integration. Above all, we hope that these principles will inspire further discussion among stakeholders that include, but are not limited to, graduate leaders. Governments, employers, faculty, students, national and international organizations-all have perspectives to share and something to be gained from increased attention to the tracking and building of graduate career pathways."}, {"section_title": "Preamble:", "text": "The global knowledge economy is developing rapidly, creating new research networks and structures as well as new career opportunities for (post)graduate students.

To achieve this goal, institutions have to function in an environment that ensures freedom of thought and expression, the advancement of research, and the application of innovative ideas. It is imperative to remove unnecessary red tape and to formulate the appropriate policies and procedures that streamline the operation of these institutions. Some of the activities necessary for the advancement of innovation require that specific laws are revisited and adjusted accordingly, e.g., laws governing intellectual property rights (IPR) and copyrights, small businesses, incubation activities and startups in universities, and simplifying imports and customs regulations. There are situations when it becomes necessary to \"create demand\" if it does not exist. In fact, the prevalent consensus among Egyptian industrialists is that there is no need for R&D and that it is better to import ready-made and tested technologies. This negative attitude has amr m. shaarawi developed due to the lack of confidence in the effectiveness of research carried out in Egypt and the poor interaction between industrial enterprises and universities. Furthermore, researchers willing to commit to technology development receive low compensation and, at the same time, the risk of failing to achieve the desired results is too high. Other factors that weaken industry-academia cooperation include scarcity of support mechanisms for building businesses out of home grown technologies and the lack of a clear understanding on both sides of issues pertaining to IPR and disclosure of innovation. This lack of communication creates mistrust between academia and industry. Such issues have to be resolved through special programs that aim at strengthening the interaction between businesses and academia. An example of an existing mechanism that attempts to advance innovation in the ICT sector is the technology incubation program (TIP) at the MCIT. This program is complemented by a wide range of funding schemes that are designed to support research aimed at bringing industrial and academic partners together to develop technologies or prototypes specifically for ICT applications. Even though this initiative is a bold step forward, it has been criticized for not having a clear exit strategy for incubated companies and accordingly it is not sustainable. Similar schemes should be developed to serve other sectors of the Egyptian industrial businesses. Currently, the IMC and STDF are trying to play a significant role in promoting cooperation between industrial enterprises and universities. The possibility of having part of these funds dedicated to the support of incubation and start-up activities at national and private universities should be considered. This kind of support will help also in alleviating some of the structural shortcomings of the Egyptian higher education system especially in its relation to industry and business enterprises. Providing support for innovation activities may be inspired by the Brazilian S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), which is an independent public foundation with a mission to foster research and the scientific and technological development of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo. The Foundation provides support of research projects to be carried out in universities and research institutions, in all fields of knowledge. The constitution of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo establishes that 1% of all state taxes are transferred to the Foundation. The stability of the funding and autonomy of the Foundation allow for an efficient management of the resources with a sizable impact. FAPESP invests in (i) fellowships for graduate and undergraduate students, (ii) exploratory fundamental academic research and (iii) product development research, in many cases directed to small businesses or towards joint research performed by academia and industry. A similar mechanism, if established in Egypt, will greatly strengthen the existing efforts directed towards the advancement of developmental research and innovation. Moreover, the involvement of private and independent organizations together with governmental agencies in the development of Egypt's research strategy and managing it to completion should lead to a higher chance of success. In Egypt, the role of independent institutions in the advancement of innovation should be encouraged and strengthened. The role of several philanthropists and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) is becoming more visible. Notable among these is Misr El-Kheir NGO that manages private donations to support scientific research and graduate education. This is a welcome development that should be expanded upon. In this framework, high-level governmental support provides credibility, at the same time, appropriate actors in the private sector should have well-defined roles.

The introduction of graduate-level higher education has been stimulated mainly by European developments brought about by the Bologna process (aiming at the creation of a European Higher Education Area) and the Lisbon strategy of the European Union (in particular through the projects of the European Research Area and the European Area of Lifelong Learning). The evolution of graduate education in Hungary in the last 10-12 years, along with the evolution of higher education in general, follows the main lines of these European developments, although at times at a different pace than in other parts of Central and Eastern Europe. At present, the government of Hungary, elected in 2010 with a large, twothird parliamentary majority, is publicly promoting a re-consideration of the main lines of development of the country, including in the areas of general education and higher education, with new legislation being currently drafted. Certain observers are questioning whether Hungary's previously steady commitment to take active part in the larger European integration process and to follow trans-national, European \"models\"-including in the area of higher educationwill persist, or, as indicated by some government politicians, a new direction will be sought, which could imply the introduction of a more markedly nationally-oriented model, with elements of reference drawn from the more remote past of the country. One of the consequences of this overall political reassessment and eventual change of direction is that, for the time being, it creates uncertainty regarding the future of higher education, including with regard to whether or not current plans to complete the creation of graduate education layers would be carried out. Likewise, decisions currently under consideration create a certain degree of uncertainty regarding the continuation of the current direction in the work of policy makers, university administrators, researchers, or other stakeholders engaged directly with issues of career development of graduate students. As in all other countries of Central and Eastern Europe (and most of Europe), the distinction between undergraduate and graduate studies is not a familiar one in Hungary. This is not only an issue of terminology, but also a substantive matter, which has to do with core characteristics of the national higher education system, with its recent and less recent history. The Hungarian higher education system was heavily influenced by the Soviet model during the communist period, which resulted, among other things, in that there was no distinction between undergraduate and graduate levels. The terms \"bachelor\" and \"master\" 2 were not used at all. University studies mainly consisted of a four-to-five-year-long cycle, culminating with a \"diploma,\" after which for a very few students it was possible to pursue doctoral studies, organized during a long period according to the Soviet model as well. The Bologna process, of which Hungary has been a part from the very beginning (1999), stimulated the introduction of the \"bachelor\" and \"master\" as two separate \"cycles\" in higher education. Doctoral education became formally part of the Bologna process only after 2003 as a separate third-cycle or layer. The terminology used currently in Hungary is the Bologna terminology, with three distinct cycles: bachelor, master, and doctoral. The master and the doctoral cycles are referred to as \"post-graduate,\" rather than \"graduate,\" as is the case in the rest of Europe. Hungary has made a commitment to follow the Bologna model not only in terminology, of course, which has resulted in major reforms at all levels (national, institutional, sub-institutional). It is important to note, however, that up until now the introduction of this model has not been completed. The 2009/2010 report of the president of the Hungarian Accreditation Committee, for example, indicates that the implementation of the \"Bachelor/Master system in Hungary\" is still a work in progress and that this situation was the main factor that influenced the work of this committee in 2009/2010. While the creation of a bachelor/master system has drawn a lot of attention initially, very significant work has been done in Hungary to reorganize doctoral education as well, largely influenced by European trends, as stimulated by the European Higher Education Area and the European Research Area projects. In this context, it is important to point out, for example, that Hungary introduced the concept of \"Doctoral Schools,\" moving away from the previous model of doctoral education based on the master-apprentice approach. This is a new concept which includes elements of the graduate school model as known in the US. For example, taught courses have been introduced, which were not offered previously at the doctoral level. Hungarian \"Doctoral Schools,\" however, are rather loosely institutionalized, being in many cases rather only nominally a school or a distinct unit of a given university, unlike a graduate school in the US. While graduate education is a reality in Hungary, it is a recent development and still a work in progress. In addition, the main focus of basically all stakeholders-students, parents, university administrators, policy makers-remains largely on the bachelor level. national and institutional efforts to track and build career pathways for students/graduate students Systematic efforts to understand and enhance career aspirations of students in general (not only of graduate students) are relatively new in Hungary. Recent initiatives, either at national level or launched by individual universities, indicate a growing interest in this area, led primarily by economic motivations (such as seeking to enhance national competitiveness and economic growth through matching of \"demand and supply of human capital in Hungary\"), but also by concerns that are more social in nature, having to do for example with the relationship between social status, education, and access to the job market, which is particularly problematic in Hungary according to OECD and Hungarian studies. Considering the current state of graduate education in Hungary, as sketched above, it may not come as a surprise that existing efforts to track and enhance student careers focus predominantly on the bachelor level. It is also important to keep in mind that, similarly to most other parts of Europe, attention to supporting students' careers after graduation was traditionally very limited. Terms such \"alumni,\" for example, entered the core university vocabulary very recently and the emergence of systematic concerns for the post-university professional trajectories of students is a very recent phenomenon as well. Even simply tracking the graduates' careers was not part of the main concern of universities or educational authorities until very recently. In Hungary, the Higher Education Act currently in force (adopted in 2005 and amended a few times since then) includes provisions that create for the first time (since 2006) the obligation for higher education institutions to track the professional careers of their graduates. A national system of student career tracking was designed in 2007, which is currently functional, with a de facto national student career tracking centre (Diplom\u00e1sP\u00e1lyak\u00f6vet\u0151Rendszer) as its engine. 3 The system was created under the auspices of the New Hungary Development Plan as a tool to collect, analyze, and provide material for evidence-based policies that would link larger policy objectives with specific national and institutional policies in higher education. The system collects data about former students' careers; it promotes systematic research in this area; and serves as an online platform offering information to students/former students, companies and policy makers. The system is a recent creation and it illustrates the growing concern and increasing awareness in Hungary regarding the need to collect data regarding post-university careers, and, more specifically, to provide relevant tools helping to model policies in higher education. The system has produced a series of excellent studies already, which are relevant both in a policy perspective and in a scholarly perspective. The 2010 report, for example (Diplom\u00e1sP\u00e1lyak\u00f6vet\u00e9s IV. Frissdiplom\u00e1sok 2010), contains a wealth of highly informative data (such as about the transition from university to the labor market of the most recent graduating cohorts) and solid analyses (with summaries in English). It is not clear yet, however, whether policy makers and university administrators pay significant attention to this type of work. Developments could also be mentioned at the institutional level, either initiatives of individual universities or stimulated by national policies and legislation. Corvinus University Budapest started one of the very first career management centers in Central and Eastern Europe in 1996, with a grant from USAID and additional support from corporate sponsors in Hungary. At present, all Hungarian universities are running or starting alumni offices, whose tasks include gathering information about their former students' careers. Since 2006 universities are legally required to provide career guidance for students and to organize internal student career services. It should be mentioned in this context that neither the existing legislation, which clearly calls for work in the area of tracking and enhancing students careers, nor actual initiatives at the national or institutional levels (with a few exceptions) appear to pay distinct attention to the needs of graduate students."}, {"section_title": "Tracking and building career pathways for master's and Phd students: relevance and challenges", "text": "Serious efforts could be identified in Hungary, in particular in the last five to six years, aimed at developing policies and infrastructural elements to support tracking and building career pathways of students, although mainly at the bachelor level. As indicated by the applied research available in Hungary, further continuation and expansion of these efforts could play a major role in improving Hungarian higher education in terms of quality, access, efficiency of resource allocation, increasing the currently low national rate of employment, or helping to address some serious sectorial imbalances between supply of graduates and market realities, thus making a more effective contribution to the Hungarian society. Political/policy challenges. The ongoing developments of graduate education, of related policies and regulatory frameworks in Hungary followed primarily from the commitment to be part of the European Higher Education Area and an active player in EU-sponsored projects with a direct or indirect impact on higher education. Whether or not Hungary will maintain this commitment is an important question, with very practical implications, including for the emerging efforts in the area of tracking and supporting career prospects of graduate students. Two examples can be used to illustrate this statement. Hungary has made a commitment to introduce the two European Qualifications Frameworks adopted recently (one for higher education only, the other covering lifelong learning), through the adoption and implementation of a National Qualifications Framework. The implementation of the two European frameworks is expected to stimulate an unprecedented, deep cooperation between universities and other stakeholders. \"Social partners\" are expected to have a major role in the organization of the university curricula, regarding recognition of qualifications, etc. It could be reasonably expected that if Hungary continues along this path, considering the expected massive participation of non-university stakeholders in what was previously closely-guarded university business (e.g., definition of degrees), new attitudes, policies and structures will emerge, as in the other countries of Central and Eastern Europe engaged in this process. This process may have a serious impact in the area of career development as well. Moreover, the introduction of the lifelong learning perspective, with which universities and policymakers in the region have basically no experience, may produce additional important effects regarding the monitoring of and supporting the career paths of all students, including graduate students. The second example concerns the definition of PhD students as \"early stage researchers.\" This follows from a recommendation of the EU Commission (The European Charter for Researchers and Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers), actively promoted through funding conditionalities accompanying some EU grants. It basically stimulates universities to treat PhD students as employees, with employment contracts and benefits (salary, social security), expected to produce actual research (new, usable knowledge) rather than as students who are expected to learn (only) and who receive stipends. This model is intended to have far-reaching consequences for the organization of doctoral studies and on the understanding of the efforts to support the post-university careers of doctoral students/ early stage researchers. If current policies and commitments continue, the most important challenges in the area of graduate students' career tracking and supporting could be expected to be in terms of enhancing capacity to effectively implement and adapt European models and trends to local conditions."}, {"section_title": "references", "text": "Diplom\u00e1sP\u00e1lyak\u00f6vet\u00e9s IV.

Sadly, 420 million of these are considered poor, i.e., one in every three. The major task before the Indian government is to improve the lot of these poor, and to provide them with access to basic medical care, safe drinking water, and good education. The relation between education and poverty is well-known and hence the mandate before successive governments has been to provide at least primary, but optionally secondary and tertiary education to its masses. Today 65% women and 82% men in India are literate, with about 300 million falling in the category of absolute \"illiterates.\" So how do we go about raising the living standard and literacy of our people? Mr. Narayan Murthy, Infosys founder, has said that the answer to the above lies in the way we provide education. According to him, the purpose of education should be to create \"employment generators,\" not just employment seekers. We have to nurture the spirit of entrepreneurship amongst our people so as to create more and more jobs and hence wealth. We therefore have to equip our educated people to think about creating knowledge and fostering innovation and incubation. The government is aware of this and has started putting a lot of systems in place to facilitate research and innovation. The budget for higher education in the 11 th Plan (2007-12) has been increased from a meagre Rs. 3000 crores (0.65 B USD) in the 10 th Plan (2002-07) to a huge Rs. 44,000 crores (10B USD). It has set itself a target of improving the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education from 13.5% today to 30% by 2020. This is no mean task and requires the active support of all agencies in the government, public, and private sectors. India has the second largest higher education network in the world and graduate education is a major component of this. The situation here is also very dismal. Only 35% of our 150 million graduates, i.e., about 52 million, go in for post-graduate studies. This is in spite of the fact that we have about 535 Universities and 25,000 colleges, with 14 million students and about 600,000 teachers. The number of students is set to rise to 26 million students, requiring at least 1 million teachers by 2020. The challenges before the governmentand the universities are immense. Although graduate and undergraduate education in the government and public sectors is highly subsidised, these cater to a very miniscule number of students, only about 6-7%. Thus privately funded Institutes are coming up in large numbers. But the tuition fees charged by them are very high and the quality of most of the graduates leaves much to be desired. The infrastructure in terms of state-of-theart laboratories is mostly substandard. As a result, a graduate student is not exposed to the latest technologies. The situation is compounded by the lack of quality teachers, as most graduates go in for industry jobs, which pay much better. Further, it is observed that the employability of these students is low, with only 30% of them ready for productive work. As a result, the industry has to spend huge amounts of money to train them in-house. Keeping in mind the career goals and aspirations of graduate students, and the need to produce them in large numbers, many stakeholders are now coming forward to do their bit. For example, banks are providing education loans on easy terms, other governmental funding agencies like the Department of Science & Technology, the state Vision Groups, R&D organisations, health-care bodies, and NGOs, etc. are providing incentives, scholarships, and research grants to facilitate quality higher education. We also have a number of accreditation agencies like NBA and NAAC, regulatory bodies and certification agencies, which are constantly working to raise the quality of higher education and bring about standardisation across universities and colleges. The demand is high, but the supply being inadequate, a number of distance learning facilities have been set up to help the workforce to kumkum garg enhance their qualifications and job-oriented skills, while on the job. Vocational training is gaining importance in this regard. \"Inclusive\" education is the mantra to address the needs of varied sections of society. There is also a major effort towards industry-academia partnerships and collaborations, to strengthen and improve the quality of graduate education, and also to bridge the employability gap. Industry is coming forward to set up advanced research facilities and centres of excellence in educational institutes for this. Many industryspecific programs and courses are being identified for study. Earlier, graduate education was generally viewed as a \"private good\" for an individual's professional success. But today, more and more industry and governmental organisations are sending their employees back to the classroom, for higher studies and research. This is necessary, in order to make them more productive and thus contribute to the economic development of the country. The government is also strategizing to bring in foreign institutions to put up shop in India. This has the two-fold advantage of not only reducing the demand-supply gap but also restricting the so called \"brain drain,\" especially in graduate education. We are already witnessing a \"reverse\" drain, where a large number of our \"professionally\" educated youth that left the country from 1970s onwards, for greener pastures, have started to come back because of the initiatives mentioned above and the resulting opportunities created for them by the government. Infrastructure creation and building is now the main focus of the government, as opposed to its preoccupation with the \"services\" sector in the latter part of the 20 th century. This is seen as the main factor boosting the economy and growth in 21 st century India. The major emphasis is on power generation, water supply, and road construction. Many alternate sources of generating power are being explored. Digital Learning is being given a boost to enhance both the quality and quantity of student learning. The teacher is no more seen as a \"sage on the stage,\" but rather as a \"guide by the side.\" Group learning through live projects identified by teachers has become the norm. Under a very important programme initiated by the governemnt called National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning, or NPTEL, faculty from reputed institutions like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) have provided entire course material as video-or web-based lecture packages that can be viewed on the internet from anywhere. Many Professional Engineering Societies such as the Institution of Engineers (India), Indian Institute of Electronics & Telecommunications (IETE) and AMIE, besides government bodies like the DOEACC also conduct examinations for the benefit of such working professionals who can neither afford to register for regular programs/courses, nor have the time to do so. In the 12th Plan proposals which are currently underway, the Governemnt is further increasing funding for doctoral research, so that the IITs would produce 10,000 PhDs every year, as compared to the meagre 1000 they produce now. This will provide a major incentive to graduate education in the country and pave the way for improving its innovation potential and knowledge pool, thus allowing it to take its rightful place among the community of nations. mar\u00cda morr\u00c1s ruiz-falc\u00d3"}, {"section_title": "National Contexts and Trends: Increasing the Presence of Doctors in the Third Sector in Spain", "text": "Mar\u00eda Morr\u00e1s ruiz-falc\u00f3 delegate for the internationalization of doctoral Studies Universitat Pompeu fabra On January 28 th 2011, the Spanish Government approved a Royal Decree (99/2011) that regulates the doctoral degree programs. The main goal of this reform is to strengthen the Spanish training in research, development, and innovation (R+D+I) at universities in order to place the country at the centre of a new knowledge-based economy. This reform comes at a time when, according to the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE 2009), only 15% of Spanish PhDs work in the tertiary sector (versus the 43% working in higher education institutions or the 38% within public administration). Therefore, the new regulation on PhD programs includes three main actions devised to help increase their quality and efficiency, as well as to facilitate doctors' presence in the private sector: the creation of doctoral schools, the establishment of a maximum period of time to deliver the thesis, and the design of a new doctoral profile in order to increase the competitiveness of Spanish PhDs. The new doctoral schools will be able to operate within one or several universities frameworks and its design and development is open to other national or international organisms linked to R+D+I. At the same time, in order to improve the competences and capacities of its PhD candidates, doctoral schools will be able to organise themselves within one or several fields of knowledge or within an interdisciplinary structure, according to the needs and strengths of each one of the universities. In the second place, the regulation also involves a reform in the dissertation, cutting the time for delivering it to three years (stretched up to five years for part-time students), according to the European recommendations. Finally, the new reform includes the creation of an academic committee for each doctoral program (in charge of designing, implementing and coordinating its content and organization). This has been opened not only to university professors but also to senior researchers in public research institutes as well as members representing other national or international institutions and entities involved in R+D+I. To sum up, all these measures intend, not only to empower the strengths of individual universities, but also to foster a research more oriented to the needs of society. Indeed, they should contribute to increase PhD presence in companies, a goal aimed at the heart of the university policy on Education, and seen as crucial in a knowledgebased economy model. Despite the existence of some active measures that promote doctors' contracts in companies (as the Torres Quevedo Program developed by the Science and Innovation Ministry), 1 there is a general lack of knowledge in Spanish companies about the profit from contracting PhDs (for example-beyond other intangible benefits, tax credits), and neither are there specific processes to contract doctors. Moreover, there is still a lack of cooperation between universities and companies in the development of the doctoral curriculum. These are some of the challenges brought out in the 2007 workshop on \"La inserci\u00f3n laboral del doctor en la empresa\" (\"PhDs as taskforce at business\") organised by the Fundaci\u00f3n Empresa-Universidad (University -Enterprise Foundation), which involved the participation of more than 50 professionals from these areas (doctors, entrepreneurships and public administrations' representatives) (Fundaci\u00f3n Universidad-Empresa, 2007). Actually, in the context of an overregulated country such as Spain, with a non-existent tradition of civil society taking on large initiatives, especially acute in the case of for-profit organizations, the lack of public institutions aimed to bridge over universities and other organizations helps to explain the low percentage of doctors in the private sector. In this sense, the 2007 workshop emphasised the following specific skills that make a PhD an excellent candidate for joining any kind of organization: systematic skills at work (organization and planning of time and work, establishment of long-term goals), high specialization in specific matters, creativity, teamwork experience as well as in mar\u00cda morr\u00c1s ruiz-falc\u00d3 individual initiative, familiarity with international and multicultural contexts, experience in leadership of groups and teams, vision, and experience in knowledge management and research. In fact all these are what should be the major traits which distinguish PhD education, aimed at cultivating a research mindset. On the other hand, among the most important gaps in doctoral training, there were pointed out the inexperience in the business sector (particularly in the field of management) and, from some individuals, the lack of versatility. Of course, other more vague but nevertheless important reasons have to be taken into account. Among them, the more outstanding are of a cultural and sociological character. Very little social prestige is attached to holding a doctorate, or for that matter, being a university professor or a researcher in any institution. There is neither a salary differentiation nor any kind of professional advantage in having a postgraduate level of studies as opposed to a grade, or at least it is not clearly perceived by Spanish society. This is again partially due to the fact that the Public Administration, the largest employer for PhD holders does not recognize this advanced degree in any visible way. On the other hand, cooperation between universities and companies is still perceived with suspicion by some groups at the heart of universities, mainly small numbers of both students and professors worried by the possible loss of academic autonomy. However, when this cooperation is undertaken in certain conditions, it actually seems the best strategy to strengthen the position of universities and academics as well as the most feasible path towards a knowledge economy and a stronger civil society. Due accountability, an ethics of common good, and an inclusive view-i.e., that it is in interest of society to increase not only profit but levels of critical thinking and cultural awareness-could be mentioned as some requirements to prevent the much-feared diversion in universities' root mission. Stressing only the immediate benefits and the economic profit at the cost of a more holistic and long-run approach is what raises mistrust in academic circles. Unfortunately, the fear that the moment companies put their hands on the university, business and economic interests will prevail over non-profit knowledge has been proven painfully true in some areas such as financial analysis and pharmaceutics. Hedging knowledge per se and research with no immediate economic results as well as securing funds for these would appease many a doubt. Besides, mobility should to be seen and practiced as trans-sectorial from universities to companies but also, indeed, the other way around, through sharing the acquired knowledge in companies with universities both in corporate management and skills (i.e., through collaborative teaching), entrepreneurial joint-ventures in research and business, etc.). A last remark concerning the new doctoral regulation might be added. At the same time that the Ministry of Education announced that around nine million Euros from the 2012 budget would be invested for the creation of doctoral schools, some newspapers disclosed that the total sum for the global education system in Spain (including primary, secondary, and tertiary education) will be cut by 1,800 million Euros in 2011 (Auni\u00f3n, 2011). The gap between capacities and expectations, between what is openly recognised as necessary and what is provided to cover those needs, is bigger than ever. Notwithstanding, one thing is clear: without proper investment and a clear strategy in higher education, the Spanish transition to a knowledge-based economy will not able to become truth. An open question remains, though: whether it is desirable or even possible at all to raise a sustainable knowledge economy without building it up on the basis of a more comprehensive, more inclusive, more-to-knowledge-than-to-profit-society. That is, without overlooking what was defined in paideia as humanitas by Greco-Latin philosophers, the ultimate founders of what centuries later became universities: the capacity of becoming better citizens through knowledge.
