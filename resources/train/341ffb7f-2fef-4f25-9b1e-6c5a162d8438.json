[{"section_title": "Background", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is becoming increasingly prevalent, in part due to the aging population [1] . In the United States, the number of death certificates stating AD as the cause of death increased by 89% between 2000 and 2014, and the number of individuals (aged 65 years) with AD is expected to increase from 5.3 million in 2017 to 13.8 million Disclosure and competing interests: L.M.S. provides quality control oversight for the Roche Elecsys CSF AD biomarkers measured by immunoassay on the cobas e601 analyzer in the ADNI study and has received research support from Roche for studies using this analytical system and from Lilly for CSF AD biomarker studies. J.Q.T., L.F., M.F., M.K., and T.W. have nothing to disclose. M.J.P. is an employee of Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, a wholly-owned affiliate of Eli Lilly and Company, and is a stockholder in Eli Lilly and Company. U.E. and S.W. are employees of Roche in 2050 [1, 2] . At present, the diagnosis of AD is based principally on an assessment of clinical symptoms, with tests and imaging techniques used to rule out other possible causes of symptoms. Histopathological hallmarks of AD include the deposition of extracellular amyloid plaques (primarily composed of amyloid b [Ab] peptides), tau protein neurofibrillary tangles, and subsequent neuronal degeneration [3] . Therefore, establishing biomarkers that can accurately identify amyloid and tau pathology could be beneficial in aiding the earlier diagnosis of AD compared with the use of clinical symptoms alone. The use of biomarkers may also serve to identify individuals who could experience a greater benefit from disease-modifying AD therapies [4, 5] ; for example, therapies that aim to reduce Ab and phosphorylated tau levels in the brain may alleviate cognitive dysfunction and prevent further synaptic loss, axon degeneration, and neuronal cell death [6] .\nIn the recent EXPEDITION (NCT00905372) and EXPEDITION2 (NCT00904683) studies, 26% of patients with clinically diagnosed mild-to-moderate AD lacked evidence of amyloid pathology established by positron emission tomography (PET) [7, 8] . A subsequent trial, EXPEDITION3 (NCT01900665), was enriched for patients with objective, biomarker-based evidence of amyloid pathology, assessed by amyloid-PET imaging or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ab (1-42) analysis using the INNO-BIA AlzBio3 Ab immunoassay (cutoff value of 249 pg/mL) [9] . Compared with the AlzBio3 Ab (1-42) immunoassay, the fully automated Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42) immunoassay has an improved analytical performance and is the first assay to be standardized to a candidate reference measurement procedure [10, 11] . Therefore, the Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42) assay may improve the precision of Ab (1-42) quantification in CSF compared with the AlzBio3 Ab (1-42) assay.\nThis exploratory study aimed to establish a cutoff estimate for the Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42) immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics) for future clinical trials with similar population and preanalytical procedures, based on the analysis of CSF samples from the EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION2 studies. Cutoff estimates for the ratios between measurements derived with the Elecsys\u00d2 Total-Tau (tTau) and Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42) immunoassays and between the Elecsys\u00d2 Phospho-Tau (181P) (pTau) and Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42) immunoassays were also evaluated."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design", "text": "EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION2 were phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled international trials of solanezumab in patients aged 55-94 years with mild-tomoderate AD [7, 8] .

All measurements were performed at the University of Pennsylvania [9] . Three different statistical approaches (outlined in the following section) were used to estimate a cutoff for Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42), the Elecsys\u00d2 tTau/Ab (1-42) ratio, and the Elecsys\u00d2 pTau/Ab (1-42) ratio: (1) method comparison versus AlzBio3, mixture modeling, and concordance with florbetapir F 18 imaging."}, {"section_title": "Assays", "text": "The Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42), Elecsys\u00d2 tTau, and Elecsys\u00d2 pTau CSF immunoassays are currently under development and are for investigational use only.

A PET scan was performed with data acquired for 15 minutes, beginning 50 minutes after intravenous administration of approximately 370-MBq florbetapir F 18. Images were reconstructed via an iterative algorithm with a 5-mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian filter in a 128 ! 128 matrix. A central reader visually interpreted each image as amyloid positive (likely associated with moderate-to-frequent neuritic plaques) or amyloid negative (likely associated with zeroto-sparse neuritic plaques), in accordance with previous published methods and the manufacturers' label instructions [12, 13] . For quantitative analysis, images were fitted to a PET template, and a composite standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) was also derived from the average estimate of florbetapir F 18 retention in six cortical volumes of interest (frontal, temporal and parietal cortex, anterior and posterior cingulate, and precuneus) relative to a whole cerebellum reference region [14] . An SUVR cutoff of 1.1 was used, whereby patients with SUVR 1.1 were classified as PET positive. This cutoff estimate was initially proposed based on the upper confidence limits of a group of clinically normal middle-aged subjects [15] and subsequently demonstrated to be able to distinguish autopsyconfirmed amyloid-positive subjects (moderate-to-frequent neuritic plaque) from amyloid-negative subjects with high sensitivity and specificity [12, 14] . All quantitative image analyses and visual interpretation were performed blind to clinical data and treatment assignment."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "Method comparison is a commonly used approach for bridging cutoffs between two nonstandardized biomarkers to guarantee backward comparability. A method comparison was performed between the INNO-BIA AlzBio3 assay b-Amyloid (1-42) (Fujirebio) and the Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42) immunoassay, Elecsys\u00d2 tTau/Ab (1-42), and Elecsys\u00d2 pTau/Ab (1-42) ratios. Method comparison was performed using a weighted Deming (Ab ) or Deming (tTau/ Ab and pTau/Ab ) regression after log transformation of both AlzBio3 and Elecsys biomarkers (to achieve linearity) and after removal of Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42) values above the upper limit of the measuring range. A Spearman's correlation coefficient was also calculated. Using the regression, a cutoff estimation corresponding to the previously validated AlzBio3 Ab (1-42) cutoff of 249 pg/ mL was determined for the Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42) assay. Confidence intervals (CIs; 95%) for the Elecsys\u00d2 cutoff estimate were calculated by jackknife estimation [16] . Agreement measures were obtained between AlzBio3 (using cutoff 249 pg/mL) and Elecsys\u00d2-based classification (using cutoff transferred via the regression line). Overall percentage agreement (OPA) was calculated as the proportion of subjects with the same classification according to both assays; negative percentage agreements (\"specificity\"), positive percentage agreements (\"sensitivity\"), negative predictive values, and positive predictive values were also calculated.\nMixture modeling was used to obtain two cutoff estimates each for the Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42) immunoassay and the Elecsys\u00d2 tTau/Ab (1-42) and Elecsys\u00d2 pTau/Ab (1-42) ratios after log transformation; one estimate was based on equally weighted densities of both the groups (see the study by De Meyer et al. [17] ), and the second was based on prevalence-weighted densities. The two estimates vary with respect to their dependence on prevalence within the data set (in this case, the greater proportion of \"positive\" patients); the former approach based on equally weighted densities is less dependent on prevalence and thus less specific for the population of interest. The distribution of Ab (1-42) concentrations was expected to follow a mixture of two normal distributions with means m G1 and m G2 and standard deviations s G1 and s G2 , respectively, where G1 refers to the group with lower Ab (1-42) concentrations, \"AD like,\" and G2 refers to the group with higher Ab (1-42) concentrations, \"non-AD like\". Parameters of the two normal distributions d G1 and d G2 were estimated using an expectation-maximization algorithm, which maximizes the expected complete-data log likelihood. Biomarker values above the measuring range estimated from the extrapolated calibration curve were used in these analyses.\nSingle biomarker data (Elecsys\u00d2 Ab immunoassay and AlzBio3 Ab immunoassay) and combination biomarker data (Elecsys\u00d2 tTau/Ab and Elecsys\u00d2 pTau/Ab [1-42] ratios) were assessed for concordance with the florbetapir F 18 imaging classifications according to visual read and SUVR outcomes. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was determined, and cutoffs were chosen as the value maximizing the Youden Index for concordance with outcome amyloid PET. Values outside the measuring range in this analysis were handled as follows. For single-marker analyses, values outside the measuring range were set to the respective assay's limit of the measuring range and included in the analysis; for biomarker ratios pTau/Ab (1-42) and tTau/Ab (1-42), Ab (1-42), pTau, and tTau concentrations outside the measuring range were set to the respective limit. As an exception, the handling of Ab (1-42) concentrations above the upper limit of the measuring range was included in rule defining CSF biomarker status: (1) if tau/Ab (1-42) ratio was greater than the cutoff value and Ab 1700 pg/mL, CSF biomarker status was defined as positive and (2) if tau/Ab (1-42) ratio was less than or equal to the cutoff or Ab (1-42) . 1700 pg/mL, CSF biomarker status was defined as negative. It has been shown previously that this way of handling Ab (1-42) values above the measuring range yields almost identical results for concordance with PET imaging as an analysis using Ab (1-42) values estimated from the extrapolated calibration curve [18] ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Baseline characteristics", "text": "Baseline characteristics of patients who provided the CSF samples are outlined in Table 1 .

Importantly, the Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42) immunoassay was the first CSF Ab (1-42) immunoassay to be standardized to a Joint Committee for Traceability in Laboratory Medicineapproved reference measurement procedure [10] . Similarly, the Elecsys\u00d2 tTau and pTau assays provide quantification of total tau and phosphorylated tau, which may serve as later biomarkers of disease progression [4, 18, 19] . The new evidence provided herein confirms that the Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42), Elecsys\u00d2 tTau, and Elecsys\u00d2 pTau immunoassays are suitable for the diagnostic quantification of their respective analytes in CSF.\nIn the present analysis, the Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42) immunoassay-based patient classification showed good concordance with the classification based on CSF Ab (1-42) determined by the AlzBio3 immunoassay and based on florbetapir F 18 imaging and was confirmed by mixture modeling. Each statistical approach used to derive cutoff estimates for the Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42) immunoassay produced similar numerical values with considerable overlap in the 95% CIs. Cutoff estimates for the Elecsys\u00d2 tTau/Ab (1-42) and the Elecsys\u00d2 pTau/Ab (1-42) ratios were also comparable across the three statistical approaches. Differences in the cutoff estimates derived using each of the applied approaches are most likely due to inherent differences of the three statistical methods and variation in the size of the data sets available for use within each approach.\nBased on the multiple cutoff estimates for the Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42) assay derived herein and the comparable cutoffs derived from the BioFINDER study [20] , an Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42) cutoff point of 1100 pg/mL is proposed; this cutoff point was contained within the 95% CIs arising from all three approaches of estimation evaluated in the present study. This cutoff is higher than the value of 1000 pg/mL for the CE-marked Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42) immunoassay, which was established for use with a different preanalytical protocol. Notably, data used to determine the cutoff of 1100 pg/mL in the present study were derived using samples obtained after highly standardized preanalytical procedures for CSF specimen collection and handling specific to the Eli Lilly and Company-sponsored EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION2 trials. Thus, this Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42) immunoassay cutoff point of 1100 pg/mL may be specific for use in clinical trials that use identical preanalytic procedures. Preanalytic conditions have been shown to affect the consistency of CSF biomarker measurements, including variables such as plastic tube type, the number of tube transfers, and the number of freeze-thaw cycles [21, 22] . Use of other CSF collection and handling procedures may necessitate the determination of alternate cutoffs. Where this proves necessary, we recommend determination of cutoff estimates by multiple statistical approaches, as reported herein. We believe this approach provides greater confidence in cutoff values ultimately adopted and is especially valuable when sponsors are compelled to select study-specific cutoffs based on limited data, as was the case in this study.\nPreviously, it was likely that participants with clinical AD but without AD pathology were enrolled in trials, potentially contributing to the failure of such trials to meet their primary endpoints [23] . Moreover, as highlighted by the third renewal of the AD Neuroimaging Initiative, the ability to enroll patients with earlier predementia or even at presymptomatic stages could facilitate the development of diseasemodifying agents [24] . Currently, the only FDA-approved method for assessing the presence of amyloid plaques in the brain is amyloid-PET imaging, which has a number of disadvantages including high cost and resource use [25] . The use of the biomarkers investigated in this study could potentially aid the diagnosis of AD and enable intervention at an earlier stage of disease. The use of the ratio of Ab Patient inclusion and exclusion in the EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION2 trials were determined by clinical characteristics (e.g. MMSE score) rather than by biomarkers. An interesting analysis would be to compare biomarker results in patients who were included (randomized) versus those 1-42) .

Unfortunately, few if any excluded patients underwent biomarker testing, obviating this type of analysis.\nA limitation of the study is that the evaluation of the benefit of the single biomarker and combined biomarker ratios in terms of PET concordance was constrained by the small sample size. In addition to the limited number of patients in the \"non-AD-like\" distribution (with higher Ab concentrations) in the EXPEDITION and EXPEDI-TION2 population (mild-to-moderate AD), these patients were most likely clinically misdiagnosed, explaining the presence of biomarker-negative patients in the clinically mild-to-moderate AD population [24] . The small sample size of biomarker-negative patients reduces certainty around the cutoff estimates for the two densities in the mixture modeling analysis. Although the classifications of biomarker positive and biomarker negative have been used, in reality, all biomarker measurements are continuous variables. Even with regard to the amyloid-PET SUVR cutoff of 1.1, ongoing discussions suggest that this value may be too high for the study of persons with preclinical (i.e., presymptomatic) AD. The need to dichotomize diagnostic biomarkers is clear; however, in clinical trials, the exact cutoff point could vary depending on the population being studied. The EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION2 studies were performed in 16 countries including over 200 sites. Some, but not all, of the sites were university based; thus, although a quantitative comparison of the patients enrolled in EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION2 studies to patients enrolled to a typical memory clinic is not possible, a broad selection of patients was a characteristic of the EXPEDI-TION and EXPEDITION2 studies.\nA key strength of the study, as noted previously, was the fact that all samples analyzed from EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION2 studies underwent the same preanalytical handling procedure and that multiple statistical approaches were used to determine the cutoff estimates, each of which have different theoretical bases, providing confidence in the robustness of the derived cutoffs. The availability of standardized CSF biomarker analytical methods, such as that provided by the Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42) immunoassay, and future adoption of standardized procedures for CSF specimen collection and handling are expected to move the field closer to universal cutoffs for use in clinical research and clinical practice. At that time, large studies to establish cutoffs based on conventional, age-and other demographicappropriate reference intervals will be warranted.\nIn summary, using the cutoffs estimated in this study, the Elecsys\u00d2 Ab (1-42), Elecsys\u00d2 tTau, and Elecsys\u00d2 pTau immunoassays are suitable for use in future clinical trials using identical preanalytical collection methods to determine biomarker levels and identify evidence of amyloid pathology in patients with AD who may achieve greater benefit from disease-modifying treatments."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Authors' contributions: All authors made substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work, or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; drafted or revised the manuscript critically for important intellectual content; approved the version to be published; and agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.
