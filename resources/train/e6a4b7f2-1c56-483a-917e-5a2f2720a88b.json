[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "possible relationships between health literacy and disparities in older adults. For the overall adult population, lower income and education are associated with lower health literacy ( Kutner, Greenberg, Jin, & Paulsen, 2006 ; White, 2008 ) .\nAlthough insight into disparities related to health literacy is critical, it is equally important to understand how those relationships then translate into specifi c health behaviors, such as health information seeking and interactions with providers. Reaching patients with information they deem useful is an important foundational step in self-management. The literature notes that older individuals with inadequate health literacy and chronic illnesses (asthma, diabetes, and congestive heart failure) have lower mean knowledge scores about their chronic condition compared with those with adequate health literacy ( Gazmararian, Williams, Peel, & Baker, 2003 ) . Thus, we need to fi nd a way to support knowledge acquisition in this group. A fi rst step is understanding where older adults access health information.\nAs expected, the NAAL showed that the largest percentage of all adults with below basic health literacy used each source of printed health information less (newspaper, magazine, books, Internet) compared with others with higher health literacy. Although participants with low health literacy used each nonprint source (radio/TV, family/friends/coworkers, and doctor/healthcare provider) more than print sources, they still had the highest percentage of adults who did not use each nonprint source ( Kutner et al., 2006 ) . It is interesting to note that the percentage of those who use doctor/healthcare providers \"a lot\" decreases as health literacy decreases.\nCurrent research on sources of health information (health information-seeking behavior) is heavily focused on Internet usage. The Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) showed that adults with a high school diploma used more text-based sources compared with those without a diploma ( Feinberg et al., 2016 ) . In the NAAL, the average health literacy scores were highest for adults who sought health information from the Internet ( White, 2008 ) . The literature suggests that older individuals use the Internet less than younger persons but the gap is closing ( Kontos, Blake, Chou, & Prestin, 2014 ; Levy, Janke, & Langa, 2014 ; Pew Research Center, n.d. ; Tennant et al., 2015 ) . Other studies note that for older adults, the physician is a main source of health information ( Campbell & Nolfi , 2005 ; Hall, Bernhardt, & Dodd, 2015 ; Morey, 2007 ) . The NAAL data provide the opportunity to examine the sources of health information used by older adults on a national level for strategy and policy development to impact health outcomes. Healthcare providers need to provide education where older adults are seeking it, especially those with low health literacy and at risk for health disparities.\nThis descriptive, correlational study is a secondary analysis using data from the 2003 NAAL to examine the relationships between health literacy, demographic/ background characteristics of older adults (aged 65 years and older), and sources of health information. The conceptual model for this study, \"Causal Pathways Between Limited Health Literacy and Health Outcomes\" ( Paasche-Orlow & , directed the selection of variables and allowed for further exploration of the relationships posited. Specifi cally, the model suggests that an individual's health outcome is affected by access and utilization of healthcare, provider-patient interaction, and self-care, all of which are infl uenced by health literacy level and key demographic variables. Self-care is conceptualized in the model as patients' knowledge/ skills and extrinsic factor such as health education. For this study, self-care is operationalized within the context of health information and seeking: knowledge/skills (use of the Internet and e-mail, understanding medication dosing, help needed with completing tasks such as writing notes, mathematics, reading newspaper) and health education (newspapers, magazines, books, TV/ Radio, family, friends and coworkers, and healthcare professionals). Using the model as a guide, this study sought to further explore how health literacy level and key demographic variables directly tied to health disparities are related to information-seeking self-care.\nThe research questions for this study are as follows:\n1. What sociodemographic (educational attainment, income, race, region of the country, gender, marital status, U.S. citizenship, country of birth), background (computer usage, cognitive tasks, language, health status, vision, hearing, disabilities), and extent of health information use (sources of health information) variables are associated with older adults' health literacy? 2. What variables related to health literacy, health disparities, and sources of health information are related to the health literacy levels of older adults?"}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The 2003 NAAL was implemented through the U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Educational Sciences, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). This large-scale national assessment was designed to provide an estimation of literacy and health literacy for U.S. populations such as older adults. To decrease the burden on individual participants, a fraction, rather than all, of the assessment items were administered to each participant, resulting in no accurate individual score. The NCES used marginal maximum likelihood models to estimate health literacy scores for populations. AM software was developed to provide these estimates ( NCES, n.d.-b ) The health literacy measurement included 28 health literacy questions embedded in the literacy tasks ( White, 2008 ) . The NAAL examined health literacy in relationship to various background demographics/ characteristics. Specifi cally, the questions focus on functional health literacy tasks centered on the following domains: clinical (medications, diagnosis, and treatment), preventative (self-care, preventing disease), and health system navigation (informed consent, health insurance coverage) ( Kutner et al., 2006 ) . The population's health literacy (prose, document, and quantitative tasks) was categorized on the basis of mean health literacy score: below basic (0-184), basic (185-225), intermediate (226-309), and profi cient (310-500) ( White & \u00a9 2018 by National Association of Orthopaedic Nurses Dillow, 2005 ) . These categories were developed by a committee using the Bookmark method and \"quasicontrasting groups approach\" ( Baldi, 2009 ) ."}, {"section_title": "SAMPLE", "text": "This study included 2,668 nonincarcerated older adults (aged 65 years and older) who were part of the 18,000-person household sample from the NAAL study. The household sample was determined through a fourstage, stratifi ed area sample: primary sampling units of counties or groups of contiguous counties, secondary sampling units (segments) of area blocks, housing units with households, and fi nally eligible persons in households. This sample was weighted to represent the total U.S. population. The participant's assessment was considered complete and included if the background questionnaire and at least one task from each of the three scales were answered.\nFor individuals who completed the questionnaire but failed to answer any literacy tasks, regression-based imputation methods were used ( Greenberg & Jin, 2007 ) . The imputation procedure was instituted to avoid nonrandom unknown biases due to refusal. The analysis concluded that nonresponsive bias was negligible at the screening and background questionnaire stages ( Kutner et al., 2006 ) . Participation in the NAAL was strictly voluntary."}, {"section_title": "DATA COLLECTION", "text": "The assessment was administered on a one-on-one situation using a computer-assisted personal interviewing system. Participants utilized everyday aids and other tools such as eyeglasses, magnifying glasses, rulers, and calculators when completing tasks. The assessment began with the 35-minute questionnaire on background information, followed by seven core literacy tasks ( Kutner et al., 2006 ) . Topics in the background questionnaire include political and social participation, labor force participation, literacy practices, job training and skills, family literacy, and areas described in the research questions.\nThe ability of the subjects to participate in the main assessment was determined by completion of seven initial tasks. Those who struggled with these tasks were given an alternate assessment designed to present easier tasks fi rst and move onto highly contextualized material usually found at home or in the community. The NAAL consisted of 152 tasks divided into 13 blocks, with approximately 11 questions per block. Each participant was given a booklet with three blocks of questions. Health literacy assessment questions were embedded in the assessment ( Kutner et al., 2006 ) .\nFor this secondary analysis, the data were accessed through the public-use fi le \"NAAL_2003_Health.am\" ( NCES, n.d.-b ) located on the NCES' NAAL website ( NCES, n.d.-a ) . In this large database, missing data were managed during the data collection process. To compensate for missing data and avoid bias from the participant's refusal to answer, this study used imputed answers. Imputed answers are based on the answers given by participants with the same background characteristics."}, {"section_title": "VARIABLES", "text": "Thirty-two variables from the 2003 NAAL were chosen for this study. In this study, health literacy was the dependent variable and the sociodemographic and background variables were independent variables. Variables were selected on the basis of their identifi cation in the literature on health literacy, health disparities, and sources of health information (health informationseeking behavior). The variables examined include gender, educational attainment, race, income, marital status, region, U.S. citizenship, country of birth, vision, hearing, language, disabilities, help with tasks, and sources of health information ( Cutilli, 2010 ; Healthy People 2020, n.d. ; Kutner et al., 2006 ; Paasche-Orlow & Wolf, 2007 ) .

These variables are citizenship, country of birth, language, and needing help with mathematics."}, {"section_title": "STATISTICAL ANALYSES", "text": "The data were opened in the AM software for data editing and statistical analyses. A data fi lter was set for the age 65 years or older. Data editing such as removing nonapplicable values and collapsing categories was completed as needed. Descriptive statistics include frequencies and measures of central tendency. To answer the fi rst research question, bivariate analyses using independent t tests with Bonferroni adjustments as needed were conducted to explore the relationships of health literacy with sociodemographic and background characteristics associated with health literacy, health disparities risk factors, and sources of health information.\nTo assist with the clinical interpretation of the differences, effects sizes were reported for the difference in health literacy for each variable. An effect size is considered to be the smallest immediate difference that is clinically meaningful in the target population for the outcome of interest (i.e., health literacy in this study). Reporting the differences between the groups using an effect size index provides a more accurate interpretation of the clinical signifi cance of results. As per Cohen (1992) , the difference between two group mean scores falls under the index Cohen's d . Accordingly, an effect size of 0.20 is considered a small effect, 0.50 is considered a medium effect, and 0.80 is considered a large effect. Medium and large effects are considered substantial and of practical importance.\nFinally, to answer the second research question, a simultaneous multiple linear regression was conducted to determine the predictive relationships of study variables on health literacy. The selection of variables for regression was based on outcomes of the bivariate analyses. For inclusion, the variable had to have at least half of the categories in the bivariate analyses demonstrate signifi cance. The AM software allowed for the testing of the overall model but did not provide a measure of the robustness of the model through the quantifi cation of the variance explained.

The following variables were signifi cant (estimate in the parentheses): household income (4.284); educational attainment (9.249); "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This secondary analysis of the NAAL was a unique opportunity to examine relationships between health literacy and demographic/background characteristics in the U.S. older adult population. This study has three key fi ndings: (1) Results support most relationships described in the conceptual model and literature associated with health literacy and help identify potential ways to impact health disparities through health literacy interventions. (2) There are similarities and difference in the utilization of health information sources based on health literacy level. (3) The results support established health literacy predictive relationships and identify variables (knowledge/skills, health education) that make the model more robust. For the fi rst research question, the results demonstrate that most relationships in the conceptual model/ literature between background variables and health literacy exist in the older adult population. Furthermore, the results show that several, although not all, of the variables related to health literacy and health disparities may have potential to impact health outcomes in older adults. In the health disparities literature, gender is identifi ed as a variable that impacts health conditions/ outcomes. However, the results did not demonstrate a difference between mean health literacy scores and gender in this study. Thus, health disparities related to gender will most likely not be resolved through health literacy interventions.\nIn contrast, the literature on health literacy and health disparities repeatedly demonstrates that those from lower income brackets and lower educational attainment have lower health literacy and experience health disparities. This study showed that there were signifi cant differences in the mean health literacy score between the lowest income level/lowest educational level and most other income/educational levels. Interventions such as additional support for health management in communities with lower income and education may help older adults take care of their health and potentially prevent health disparities.\nA strong relationship between health and health literacy was demonstrated through self-reported overall health. This is consistent with the literature noting that older adults with lower health literacy had worse health status ( Baker et al., 2002 ; Baker, Gazmararian, Sudano, & Patterson, 2000 ; Mottus et al., 2014 ; Sudore et al., 2006 ; Wolf et al., 2005 ) . Although vision and hearing defi cits were not signifi cant in predicting health literacy when compared with the other variables in the regression model, the signifi cant differences noted between the mean health literacy score of those with these disabilities are important to consider when developing interventions to decrease disparities in this population.\nThe fi rst research question is also answered by examining sources of health information and health literacy. The sources used by older adults vary on the basis of \u00a9 2018 by National Association of Orthopaedic Nurses health literacy level, although there are some similarities. Most recent studies on sources of health information or health information-seeking behaviors have focused on using the Internet. Older adults using the Internet have higher education, incomes, and health literacy and make better healthcare decisions ( James, Boyle, Yu, & Bennett, 2013 ; Pew Research Center, n.d. ) . Studies show that older adults did not rely on the Internet for information and have healthcare providers as the main source of information ( Gollop, 1997 ; Kutner et al., 2006 ; Morey, 2007 ; Tian & Robinson, 2008 ) . The results of this study support fi ndings in the literature. The implication for healthcare providers is to understand that older adults do not use the Internet to the same extent as other segments of the population and it may not be the preferred source of health information. For the remaining sources of health information, the results of this study support the literature stating that the percentage of adults using each source increases with increasing health literacy ( Kutner et al., 2006 ) . However, the extent to which the source is used varies when comparing the general adult population and older adults. For example, the percentage of older adults who use doctor/healthcare provider \"a lot\" increases with increasing health literacy whereas for the general adult population, the percentage decreases with increasing health literacy. Thus, older adults use healthcare providers differently than do other adults and interventions should be tailored to address this difference. It is imperative that providers make health education a priority and be prepared to be the main source of health information for older adults. Providers need to adjust their strategy to educate older adults on the basis of health literacy level, reaching out to those with the lowest health literacy (because they seek health information the least) and being prepared to direct those with higher health literacy to various reputable sources.\nAs the fee-for-service model of healthcare fi nance is replaced by fee based on quality, providers have an opportunity to change their approach to patient and family education. Providers can try methods that engage patients and provide education in a way that meets the patients' health literacy needs. This process is actually less diffi cult if providers follow the principles of Universal Health Literacy Precautions ( Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2010 ) , educating all older adults with using simple, everyday language. Because lower health literacy has been associated with decreasing cognitive ability, providing education that decreases the load on cognition is essential ( Gakumo, Enah, Vance, Sahinoglu, & Raper, 2015 ; Kobayashi, Wardle, Wolf et al., 2015 ; Mottus et al., 2014 ; O'Conor et al., 2015 ; Tennant et al., 2015 ) . TV/radio is the next most used source of health information for older adults of all health literacy levels. The popularity of shows such as Dr. Oz , the inclusion of the health reports on local and national news broadcasts, and the popularity of health stations on satellite radio demonstrate the desire to receive health information via this medium. Healthcare providers must push for more health information to be made available through TV and radio and be available to provide information when needed for these sources. New electronic sources (Internet, cable), which provide on-demand content to various devices such as laptops and tablets, are another method to present information in a format similar to TV and radio. New technology will require healthcare providers to partner with older adults and technology specialists to develop access to these devices while decreasing the load on cognition.\nOn the whole, print health sources were used by a lower percentage of older adults when compared with nonprint sources with one notable exception. Families/ friends/coworkers were used less often than some forms of print resources for older adults with basic and intermediate health literacy. More research to understand the context in which family/friends/coworkers are used by older adults would help identify potential strategies. Also to meet the educational needs of older adults with lower health literacy, the following interventions should be examined: Increasing provider time for more extensive education and/or having health educators working with the provider answer questions and supply additional education during the offi ce visit. Because resources are fi nite, prioritizing interventions using the most common nonprint sources is very important.\nThe second research question is addressed by the examination of variables in the regression analysis. On the basis of the conceptual model, two (income and education) of the nine signifi cant predictors of health literacy have been identifi ed as impacting health literacy. The other signifi cant predictors have not been discussed in the literature. This study identifi ed self-care variables related to patients' knowledge/skills (help with forms and reading newspaper) and health education (sources of health information) as impacting health literacy. The literature on predicting health literacy using patients' skills has focused on using single questions related to ability or confi dence to complete tasks. These studies demonstrated that the use of screening questions is as effective as other more lengthy health literacy assessments such as the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) or the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA) ( Wallston et al., 2014 ) . For example, Chew, Bradley, and Boyko (2004 , p. 588) used the following questions to determine adequacy of health literacy: \"How often do you have someone help you read hospital materials?\" Like this question, the NAAL questions about knowledge/skills could provide the foundational work to pursue additional single-question screening tools used to identify those with low health literacy.\nWhere patients seek health information has not been cited as a variable that predicts health literacy. In this study, four sources of information (doctors/healthcare providers, books, Internet, and magazines) were found to be statistically signifi cant in the regression analysis. Thus, use (or lack of use) of these sources may have potential to predict health literacy. When educating older adults, providers should ask about the sources of health information used to help the provider understand patients' health literacy levels and direct patients to reliable information they are more likely to use."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "This study is limited by being a secondary analysis. The principal investigator did not have control over the original research questions and data collection. As a result, the analysis of data was limited by an insuffi cient number of observations and thus several variables (i.e., language, citizenship) could not be examined. To increase observations, categories of variables were collapsed (i.e., race, help with reading newspaper). By collapsing White and Hispanic into one category, any discussion about race in the U.S. older adult population is limited by the lack of meaningful analysis. This may have also contributed to race not being signifi cant in the regression analysis. The variable \"help with reading\" was also collapsed into \"help\" versus \"no help.\" This may have impacted the estimate in the regression analysis because it was substantially higher than other variables' estimates. Although the NAAL is the only large-scale national study of health literacy in the United States, the data from the study are more than 10 years old. Thus, the data do not refl ect changes in the population such as technology skills and the increase or decline in the use of certain sources of health information such as the Internet and newspapers."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This secondary analysis examined health literacy and multiple background questions in the U.S. older adult population using the NAAL data. The results support most relationships described in the conceptual model and literature associated with health literacy and as a result have potential to impact health disparities through health literacy interventions. These results also demonstrate the similarities and difference in the utilization of health information sources based on health literacy level, support established health literacy predictive relationships, and identify variables (skills, knowledge) that make the model more robust.\nThe results confi rm relationships already established in the literature between sociodemographic variables and health literacy. Lower health literacy in older adults is associated with income less than $15,000 (in 2003), high school graduate or less, vision and hearing defi cits, and fair/poor overall health. Income and education were the strongest predictors of health literacy when compared with other variables. Because these characteristics are also associated with health disparities, the potential role of health literacy in the decreasing disparities needs to be examined. Interventions (e.g., community health workers, postdischarge phone calls) focused on older adults with these characteristics may impact their ability to manage their health and could potentially lessen disparities. Rubin et al. (2014) developed a program to train volunteers for Meals on Wheels as health literacy coaches for older adults.\nKnowledge/skills and health education variables under self-care (needing help with skills such as fi lling out forms, reading newspaper, and writing notes; and sources of health information) have an interactive relationship with health literacy. Knowledge/skills/health education variables not only were utilized by older adults but can also be indicators of health literacy. In this study, the fi rst two knowledge/skills listed earlier were identifi ed as predictive and thus have the foundational potential to be used as single-item screener questions and make the conceptual model more robust.\nSources of health information results demonstrated some similarities and differences by health literacy level. They showed that the opportunity to educate older adult patients, regardless of health literacy level, is during the interaction with the doctor/healthcare provider and the Internet is not the preferred source. Results also show that as health literacy decreases, the percentage of older adults using each source of health information decreases. Thus, those with lower health literacy may need the healthcare system to reach out and engage them in learning about health concerns rather than assuming they will use nonprint sources. Future research should be focused on interventions that engage older adults while supplying education in formats most commonly used such as the healthcare provider and TV/radio. Some sources of health information (print and nonprint materials) used by older adults are predictive of health literacy. They may provide the foundation for determining additional single-item screeners for identifying those with low health literacy and make the conceptual model more robust."}]
