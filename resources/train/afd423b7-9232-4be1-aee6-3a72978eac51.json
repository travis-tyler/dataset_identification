Previous studies have shown that several components of the insulin signaling pathway are abnormal in AD brains relative to controls, including genes encoding insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2 peptides and their receptors [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Since these abnormalities appear to be a common feature of both type-1 and type-2 diabetes, the term \"type-3 diabetes\" was proposed to describe brain-specific abnormalities in insulin signaling associated with AD [11, 12] . Taken together, the large body of evidence implicating abnormal insulin signaling in AD has led to clinical trials targeting these abnormalities in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD [13] [14] [15] . However, it is well recognized that glucose transport from the peripheral circulation across the blood brain barrier (BBB) and capillary endothelial cells into the interstitial fluid and brain tissue are largely insulin-independent processes [16, 17] . Similarly, the transport of glucose across the cell membrane into neurons is largely independent of insulin [18] . While 18 Fdeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( 18 FDG-PET) studies have shown reduced brain glucose uptake in regions vulnerable to AD pathology [19] [20] [21] [22] , it is unclear whether an overall failure of regulation of brain glucose metabolism is a key etiopathogenic factor in AD and whether abnormalities of brain glucose homeostasis in AD are related to peripheral glucose concentration. Answering these questions is critical to establishing whether central glucose homeostasis is a potential target for disease-modifying treatments in AD."}, {"section_title": "1.", "text": "Is brain tissue glucose concentration altered in AD?"}, {"section_title": "2.", "text": "What is the relationship between brain tissue glucose concentration and severity of AD pathology?"}, {"section_title": "3.", "text": "What are plausible molecular mechanisms underlying abnormalities of brain glucose homeostasis in AD?"}, {"section_title": "4.", "text": "What is the relationship between trajectories of blood glucose concentration during life and brain tissue glucose levels measured at death?\nOur results provide the first evidence for brain glucose dysregulation as a critical event in AD pathogenesis that closely reflects both severity of AD pathology and the expression of symptoms."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) is a prospective, ongoing cohort study of community-dwelling volunteer participants in Baltimore that began in 1958 and has been described in detail previously [23, 24] .

Brain tissue regions for glucose assays were selected a priori in the MFG and ITG to represent brain regions vulnerable to amyloid and tau deposition respectively. The cerebellum was sampled to represent an additional brain region resistant to classical AD pathology [34] .\nA sterile 4 mm diameter tissue punch was extracted from the cortical surface of the three brain regions i.e. MFG, IRG and the cerebellum from brain tissue samples stored at \u221280\u00b0C. To extract metabolites from brain tissue, samples were homogenized using Precellys\u00ae with ethanol phosphate buffer. Samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was used for analysis. The BIOCRATES P180 platform was used for the quantification of glucose and the three glycolytic amino acids, serine, glycine and alanine. The fully automated assay was based on PITC (phenylisothiocyanate) derivatization in the presence of internal standards followed by flow injection analysis-mass spectrometry (FIA-MS/MS; for glucose) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS; for glycolytic amino acids) using a SCIEX 4000 QTrap\u00ae mass spectrometer (SCIEX, Darmstadt, Germany) with electrospray ionization. Brain tissue glucose concentration was derived as the sum of hexoses detected and absolute concentration expressed as nmol/mg tissue.\nTo assess activities of the three rate-controlling enzymes of glycolysis (i.e. hexokinase; HK, phosphofructokinase; PFK and pyruvate kinase; PK), we calculated the ratios of the concentrations of the glycolytic amino acids serine, glycine and alanine to glucose. These amino acids are biosynthetic derivatives of intermediate metabolites in glycolysis and thus their concentrations relative to glucose, are an indirect measure of the net enzymatic activities catalyzing the three sequential, rate-controlling, irreversible steps of glycolysis [35] . As shown in Figure 1 , the amino acid serine is synthesized from the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate and can be converted to glycine following transfer of a methyl group from its side chain. The ratio of the concentrations of serine and glycine to glucose (serine+glycine:glucose) therefore reflects the net activities of the two irreversible enzymatic reactions in glycolysis that are upstream of 3-phosphoglycerate:\ni. the first reaction in glycolysis, i.e. the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6phosphate, catalyzed by the inducible enzyme, hexokinase (abbreviated here as HK) and\nii. the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate in the presence of phosphofructokinase (abbreviated here as PFK)\nThe conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate is the last step of glycolysis and is an irreversible reaction catalyzed by the enzyme pyruvate kinase (abbreviated here as PK) ( fig-1 ). The amino acid alanine is synthesized from pyruvate by a transamination reaction catalyzed by alanine amino transferase (ALT). Therefore the ratio of serine+glycine+alanine to glucose provides an indirect assessment of the net activity of pyruvate kinase."}, {"section_title": "Quantification of brain tissue glucose transporter proteins", "text": "We examined protein levels of the two principal glucose transporters in the brain i.e. neuronal glucose transporter-3 (GLUT3) and glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1); the main glucose transporter in astrocytes and within vascular endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier (BBB) [36] .\nLabel free quantification (LFQ) of the brain proteome by LC-MS/MS was performed in the MFG using a ThermoFisher Scientific (San Jose, CA) Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted using sex and age at death as covariates.\nA similar approach was taken for analyses of group differences in protein levels of the glucose transporters, GLUT3 and GLUT1. In order to confirm that observed changes in levels of the neuronal glucose transporter, GLUT3 were not driven primarily by neuronal loss, LFQ-derived protein levels of the neuronal nuclear protein, nesprin-1 [39] , was used as an additional covariate in addition to sex and age of death in sensitivity analyses comparing GLUT3 protein levels between groups.\nAssociations between brain tissue glucose concentration, ratios of the glycolytic amino acids to glucose and AD pathology were examined using Spearman's rank correlation before and after adjusting for sex and age at death. Associations between protein levels of the glucose transporters and AD pathology were examined similarly with protein levels of nesprin-1 as an additional covariate in analyses involving GLUT3.\nTo investigate the associations between brain tissue glucose concentrations and AD pathology with longitudinal fasting plasma glucose concentrations measured during the BLSA research visits, separate linear mixed-effects models (LME) were fit with longitudinal glucose measures as the outcome and each pathology variable (i.e. CERAD and Braak score) and brain glucose concentration as the main predictors. The time of follow up was anchored at the last measurement of fasting plasma glucose (using time of last measurement as the time origin, time = 0), with all previous longitudinal observations considered negative relative to the last measurement. This re-centering of the time variable allows us to test the effects of the last plasma fasting glucose levels as well as the rates of change in fasting plasma glucose concentrations on pathology and brain tissue glucose concentration simultaneously in a single model. Other covariates included age at measurement of the last plasma fasting glucose concentration and sex.

Together with the observation that protein levels of the astrocytic glucose transporter GLUT1 are unchanged, our results implicate a specific loss of the neuronal glucose transporter GLUT3 as an integral feature of AD pathogenesis.\nOur findings also complement and extend previous functional neuroimaging studies using 18 FDG-PET showing that decreases in neuronal glucose uptake may be an early feature of AD pathogenesis [19] [20] [21] [22] 40] . These studies show a characteristic pattern of hypometabolism affecting primarily the parieto-temporal, posterior cingulate and frontal cortices with relative sparing of the cerebellum, thalamus and basal ganglia [22] . This pattern of lower cerebral glucose uptake on FDG-PET imaging therefore appears consistent with our current observation of higher brain tissue glucose levels in the frontal and temporal cortices in AD, but sparing the cerebellum. Previous studies have shown that the density of the neuronal GLUT3 transporter in the brain is coupled to local cerebral glucose utilization [41] . Our current results indicate that lower cerebral glucose utilization, as reflected in lower rates of glycolysis and higher brain tissue glucose concentrations, may thus down-regulate GLUT3 protein levels, especially in brain regions vulnerable to AD pathology.\nPrevious studies of GLUT3 and GLUT1 protein levels in the AD brain have relied upon small sample sizes and important methodological differences with our current report merit consideration. Simpson and colleagues measured GLUT3 and GLUT1 protein levels using immunoblotting and autoradiography from a sample of 12 AD and 12 control brains [42] . The mean age of the control group (56\u00b122 years) in their report was considerably lower than the AD group (76\u00b15 years). While they observed overall reductions in GLUT1 and GLUT3 protein levels averaged across several regions, considerable inter-individual variability made comparisons of regional differences in glucose transporter levels difficult. Using cytochalasin B binding assays, Kalaria and colleagues demonstrated lower glucose transporter levels in AD brains compared to controls [43] . However, as cytochalasin B is a non-specific blocker of both GLUT1 and GLUT3 transporters [44] , a reliable assessment of differences in neuronal versus astrocytic glucose transporter levels was not feasible. Moreover, in both these studies, the absence of 'high-pathology controls' or 'ASYMADs' as in our current report, precludes assessment of changes in glucose transporter levels in relation to severity of AD pathology and expression of AD symptoms. A definitive assessment of regional differences in GLUT3 and GLUT1 levels in AD may require a larger sample size and proteomic profiling across several brain regions.\nIt is important to note that our measure of brain tissue glucose is based on mass spectrometric quantification of total hexose levels transported from the circulation. Glucose is the predominant hexose in blood and is present in far greater concentrations (5450.0\u00b11200 \u03bcM) than other hexoses such as fructose (46.26 \u00b1 25.22 \u03bcM), galactose (88.3\u00b134.7 \u03bcM) and mannose (64.0 \u00b112.0 \u03bcM 12.0 uM) [45] [46, 47] . Therefore the total concentration of brain hexoses measured in our samples is likely to comprise predominantly of glucose.\nGiven previous epidemiological evidence that insulin resistance and diabetes are associated with increased risk of AD [1] [2] [3] , we also examined whether peripheral glucose levels measured decades prior to death may influence brain tissue glucose concentration. We have previously shown that this relationship does not appear to be mediated by a direct effect of blood glucose concentrations on either brain amyloid deposition or neurofibrillary pathology [48] . In the current report, we found that higher concentrations of plasma fasting glucose measured prior to death as well as greater increases in fasting plasma glucose over time were associated with higher brain tissue glucose concentrations in all three regions examined. In additional sensitivity analyses, we further confirmed that the longitudinal associations between fasting plasma glucose and brain tissue glucose concentrations are not driven by individuals with diabetes. These findings open up new lines of investigation in appropriate animal models of AD where longitudinal analyses of brain tissue and blood glucose concentrations in relation to accumulating AD pathology may provide important insights into the role of glucose dysregulation in early stages of AD pathogenesis. Such experimental studies are essential to test both causal relationships and confirm the temporal sequence of molecular events related to glucose dysregulation and AD pathogenesis in humans. It would also be important to test whether abnormalities of brain glucose utilization are a specific feature of AD pathogenesis or may be shared by other neurodegenerative diseases. The lack of brain and blood tissue samples from well-characterized cohorts representing other non-AD neurological diseases is a limitation of our present report.\nConsidering our results together, we propose that failure of neuronal glucose utilization due to impaired glycolysis is a fundamental feature of AD. At regionally specific threshold levels of brain glucose and impaired glycolytic flux, accumulating pathology in vulnerable brain regions triggers the onset of AD symptoms. Our results have important translational implications and set the stage for future studies that may uncover therapeutic interventions targeting brain glucose dysregulation in AD."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Brain tissue glucose concentration in AD", "text": "The demographic characteristics of BLSA participants who contributed data to the measurements of brain tissue glucose concentration are shown in Table 1A .

We first showed that brain regions vulnerable to amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary pathology show significantly higher tissue glucose concentrations in AD. Moreover, higher concentrations of brain tissue glucose are associated with greater severity of both amyloid plaque deposition and neurofibrillary pathology.\nTo further investigate abnormalities in glucose metabolism associated with higher glucose concentrations in brain regions vulnerable to AD pathology, we utilized concentrations of the glycolytic amino acids, serine, glycine and alanine to assess the three rate controlling, irreversible steps of glycolysis. Besides the generation of energy through ATP from the breakdown of glucose, intermediates of glycolysis serve as biosynthetic precursors of several metabolites including the non-essential amino acids, serine, glycine and alanine (fig-1 ) [35] . The ratios of these glycolytic amino acids to that of glucose, the primary substrate of glycolysis, are hence useful as indirect measures of the enzymatic activities of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. Our results indicate that the activities of these principal rate controlling enzymes of glycolysis are significantly reduced in the ITG and MFG, but not cerebellum, of individuals with AD. Moreover, lower activities of these enzymes are associated with greater severity of both neurofibrillary and amlyoid pathology.\nNext, using mass spectrometry-based proteomics in brain tissue samples from the same participants, we showed that protein levels of the neuronal glucose transporter, GLUT3 are significantly reduced in AD and that lower levels of GLUT3 protein reflect greater severity of both amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Finally, we demonstrated that longitudinal increases in fasting plasma glucose levels, measured up to four decades prior to death, are associated with higher brain tissue glucose concentrations globally.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to measure brain tissue glucose concentrations and assess glycolytic flux to demonstrate their relationships with both severity of AD pathology and the expression of AD symptoms. Including brain tissue samples from 'ASYMAD' individuals who represent an intermediate group in the gradation of neuropathology from controls to AD patients in the absence of cognitive impairment during life, allowed us to relate measures of brain glucose concentration and glycolytic flux to incremental levels of AD pathology and symptom expression. Equally importantly, by measuring glucose concentrations in brain regions both vulnerable to distinct pathological features of AD i.e. MFG (amyloid deposition) and ITG (tau accumulation) as well as in a region relatively resistant to AD pathology i.e. cerebellum [34] , we were able to determine whether the observed alterations in brain glucose concentrations and abnormalities in glycolysis were related to AD-defining pathological processes.\nOur observation that in the ITG, brain glucose concentrations are highest in AD, lowest in controls and intermediate in ASYMADs suggests that there may be regionally-specific threshold levels of tissue glucose beyond which the accumulation of AD pathology triggers the expression of clinical symptoms. Complementing these observations on brain glucose concentrations in the ITG, we also observed that activities of the three rate-controlling enzymes of glycolysis, i.e. hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, are lowest in AD, highest in controls and intermediate in ASYMADs, suggesting that regionallyspecific abnormalities in glycolytic flux may lead to the build-up of brain glucose levels, evolution of AD pathology and ultimately, the development of AD symptoms. Furthermore, the absence of significant group differences in either brain tissue glucose concentration or glycolytic flux in the cerebellum, a region that is relatively spared of classical AD pathology, suggests that these abnormalities are specifically linked to the defining pathological hallmarks of AD. This interpretation is further strengthened by the significant associations between concentrations of brain tissue glucose and measures of glycolytic flux with severity of AD pathology both in the ITG and MFG.\nOur proteomic analysis of brain tissue from the same groups of participants in the BLSA autopsy sample allowed us to further explore potential mechanisms underlying alterations in brain glucose concentration in AD. We found that protein levels of the neuronal glucose transporter, GLUT3 are significantly lower in AD and ASYMAD brains relative to controls. Furthermore, lower protein levels of GLUT3 are associated with greater severity of both neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Equally importantly, we find that both the group differences in GLUT3 protein levels as well as their association with AD pathology are independent of neuronal loss as they remain significant even after adjustment for levels of the neuronal nuclear protein nesprin-1 [39] .
