[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: Hippocampal pathology occurs early in Alzheimer disease (AD), and atrophy, measured by volumes and volume changes, may predict which subjects will develop AD. Measures of the temporal horn (TH), which is situated adjacent to the hippocampus, may also indicate early changes in AD. Previous studies suggest that these metrics can predict conversion from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD with conversion and volume change measured concurrently. However, the ability of these metrics to predict future conversion has not been investigated. We compared the abilities of hippocampal, TH, and global measures to predict future conversion from MCI to AD. TH, hippocampi, whole brain, and ventricles were measured using baseline and 12-month scans. Boundary shift integral was used to measure the rate of change. We investigated the prediction of conversion between 12 and 24 months in subjects classified as MCI from baseline to 12 months. All measures were predictive of future conversion. Local and global rates of change were similarly predictive of conversion. There was evidence that the TH expansion rate is more predictive than the hippocampal atrophy rate (P = 0.023) and that the TH expansion rate is more predictive than the TH volume (P = 0.036). Prodromal atrophy rates may be useful predictors of future conversion to sporadic AD from amnestic MCI."}, {"section_title": "D", "text": "ementia is estimated to affect >80 million people worldwide by 2040. 1 The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer disease (AD). 2 Confirmation of AD requires histopathologic examination of brain tissue, usually at postmortem. Brain atrophy can be measured at autopsy, with cortical volumes reported to be lower than controls, 3 and atrophy can be seen in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An early site of AD tau pathology is the hippocampus 4 and this is mirrored by increased hippocampal atrophy. 5, 6 Because of the physical proximity of the temporal horn (TH) to the hippocampus, changes in TH structure may reflect those of the hippocampus. Indeed, the volumes of these 2 structures have been shown to correlate, 7 and AD subjects have significantly greater hippocampal and TH rates of change than controls. 8 After medial temporal tissue loss, generalized cortical atrophy occurs with corresponding increases in whole-brain volume losses. 9, 10 Identifying subjects who are likely to develop AD would allow potential disease-modifying treatments to be given before patients become severely impaired. Subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who have measurable memory deficits have an increased risk of converting to AD of around 12% per year compared with 1% to 2% for controls. 11 However, not all MCI subjects convert to AD and therefore predicting converters would be useful for the clinician and for the patient and their carers.\nHippocampal volume is predictive of conversion from MCI to AD. 5, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] However, cross-sectional volumes may have large intersubject variances that are unrelated to the disease, and not all studies have found differences in the hippocampal volume between converters and nonconverters. 17 Using the atrophy rate may reduce intersubject variance and provide a better prediction of future converters.\nStudies suggest that the hippocampal atrophy rate can predict AD conversion. 15, 18, 19 However, these studies Received for publication December 20, 2011 13 It is therefore interesting to investigate the power of TH expansion rates to predict the prospective conversion of amnestic MCI subjects to AD, which may be useful in the recruitment of patients in clinical trials that target prodromal AD subjects. Global measures such as whole brain and ventricles have reportedly higher rates of volume change in subjects who convert from MCI to AD than in nonconverters. 20, 21 The brain parenchymal fraction (percentage of intracranial cavity occupied by brain tissue) 22 and the brain and ventricular rate of change 16 have been shown to predict the conversion from MCI to AD. However, 1 study found no difference in the baseline brain volume or atrophy rate between converters and nonconverters 23 and another showed that neither the whole-brain volume nor the atrophy rate was predictive of conversion from MCI to AD. 15 Our aims were (1) to investigate whether hippocampal and TH rates of change can predict which amnestic MCI subjects will convert to AD in the future; (2) to assess whether local regions (hippocampi and THs) have a higher predictive value than less disease-specific global measures (whole brain and ventricles); and (3) to examine whether using rates of change yields a higher predictive value than cross-sectional volumes."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Subjects were a subset of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.

ADNI inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed elsewhere (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/ 2010/09/ADNI_GeneralProceduresManual.pdf).\nSubjects included in the current study were classified as MCI at the time of their baseline visit and remained as MCI up to and including their 12-month visit. Subjects in the ADNI study were classified as MCI according to the Petersen criteria. 11 MCI subjects had an Mini Mental State Examination score of 24 to 30, a CDR of 0.5, and were amnestic. Subjects were included in the current study if they had 1.5 T scans available at the baseline and 12 months (n = 335), which were downloaded from the LONI website (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI). Patient diagnosis was recorded at 6-month intervals for 24 months. Seventy subjects were excluded because they did not have a stable diagnosis from baseline to 12 months. A further 39 subjects were excluded because of poor-quality scans (on the basis of the internal quality control). Subjects were classified as converters if they converted to AD between 12 months and 24 months and as stable if they did not convert by 24 months. Criteria for the diagnosis of AD were based on the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD. Subjects with AD had an MMSE of 20 to 26 and a CDR of 0.5 or 1. Subjects who converted but then withdrew from the study were not excluded from the analysis (n = 6), but stable subjects were included only if they were confirmed stable at or after 24 months. Twenty-eight subjects were excluded because they could not be confirmed as stable at 24 months. Of the remaining subjects, 1 was diagnosed with semantic dementia (but also classified as MCI from baseline to 24 months) and 1 had a diagnosis of shy dragger syndrome (and was classified as MCI until 24 months when they also had a diagnosis of AD) during the study period. These 2 subjects were not excluded from the study as they still had classifications of MCI or AD throughout the study period.\nThe final cohort consisted of 137 stable and 61 converter subjects.

The hippocampi in the top 8 atlases were nonlinearly registered and propagated to the target image. The 8 hippocampal segmentations were combined to produce a single consensus segmentation using the simultaneous truth and performance level estimation algorithm. 30 TH, whole-brain, and ventricle regions were created using the MIDAS software. 31 For THs, a threshold of 60% mean brain intensity defined the brain-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) boundary, with manual editing where required. The posterior boundary of the TH was the slice before which the atrium of the lateral ventricle joins the TH. THs were segmented by a single segmentor blinded to diagnosis and laterality.

There was some evidence that the TH expansion rate had a greater predictive value than the hippocampal atrophy rate. Global rates of change (whole brain and ventricles) were predictive of future cognitive decline. However, there was no evidence of differences in the predictive ability of local and global rates of change. Comparing the predictive ability of atrophy rates and volumes suggested that the TH rate of change was a better predictor than the TH volume. The analogous comparison with hippocampi showed no evidence of a difference. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to assess future conversion to AD in stable MCI patients using atrophy rate measurements of the hippocampus and TH.\nChanges in brain and ventricular volume were predictive of future decline to AD, but we found no evidence that their predictive value was less than that of the volume changes in the hippocampus. 4 The absence of a predictive advantage for regions affected early in the disease such as the hippocampi may be because larger losses outside the temporal lobe are necessary before clinical conversion to AD. This explanation is also consistent with our finding that THs have a greater predictive ability than hippocampi as the TH are likely to reflect wider changes throughout the temporal lobe, and not just the hippocampus. Other studies have demonstrated atrophy spreading from the medial temporal lobe to other brain areas. 9, 10 The current study used relatively impaired MCI subjects 38 who may be further along the disease process and may be past the point where atrophy is localized. To establish whether more localized changes occur earlier in the disease, early MCI subjects should be investigated, such as those being recruited in ADNI GO and ADNI 2 (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/ about/about-the-study/). It may be the case that changes in hippocampal atrophy rates that occur before conversion are smaller, relative to between-subject differences in rates, than for TH expansion rates. Alternatively, hippocampal atrophy rates may be measured with greater measurement error, which would lead to reduced predictive power.\nOur finding that the TH expansion rate is a significant predictor of future conversion from MCI to AD is consistent with Erten-Lyons et al, 13 who found that the presymptomatic TH expansion rate was associated with stable and decliner MCI group membership. Similarly, our finding that the hippocampal atrophy rate was predictive of future decline is consistent with Henneman et al 15 and Wang et al. 18 However, these studies included subjects who converted to AD before their second scan, whereas our study included only subjects who converted after the second scan, thus assessing future, rather than concurrent, conversion.\nOur finding that global rates of change were predictive of conversion is inconsistent with Henneman et al, 15 but consistent with Jack et al. 16 Differences between the studies' designs may explain this inconsistency. Henneman et al. used a lower strength scanner (1.0 T, compared with 1.5 T for Jack et al. and the present study), which may have contributed to a greater measurement error. Furthermore, Henneman et al. had fewer subjects (44 MCI, compared with 72 in Jack et al. and 198 in the present study), and consequently less power to detect an effect. We found little previous work on comparing the predictive ability of local and global measurements, although Jack et al 16 found that the cross-sectional hippocampal volume yielded complementary predictive information to whole-brain and ventricular rates of change. Although we found no difference in the predictive value of local and global measurements, Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord Volume 27, Number 2, April-June 2013\nPredicting Future Conversion to AD we only assessed these using rates of change, whereas Jack et al. used the volume for the local (hippocampal) measurement. Our finding that the hippocampal volume was predictive of future decline is consistent with several studies. 5, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Our finding that the TH baseline volume was also predictive is inconsistent with Erten-Lyons et al, 13 who found no difference between stable and decliner MCI groups. This discrepancy may arise from differences in group definitions; all subjects in ErtenLyons et al. started as normal controls-stable MCI were subjects who were MCI by the end of the study, but did not progress to AD-whereas our stable subjects started with a diagnosis of MCI. Our subjects were also younger (stable mean 75.1 y, converters 74.4 compared with 85.7 and 87.7 for stable and decliners, respectively in Erten-Lyons et al.).\nOur hippocampal atrophy rates were generally consistent with the literature. Our mean stable hippocampal atrophy rates (2.3%/y) were comparable to those reported previously, which ranged from 2.3% to 2.5% per year, 39, 40 and our median hippocampal atrophy rates (2.1%/y) were reasonably similar to that of Jack et al, 20 who reported a median of 1.8% per year. Jack et al 39 and Archer et al 40 report mean hippocampal atrophy rates for declining MCI subjects of 3.7% and 3.6% per year, respectively; the analogous value from our converters was 3.2% per year. Likewise, Jack et al 20 reported a median value for hippocampal converters as 3.3% per year, which is comparable to 3.1% per year for our converters. Note that our converter group differs from these studies because we include only subjects converting after 1 year, whereas the other studies include any subjects converting from baseline.\nWe found only 1 study that reported TH expansion rates in MCI subjects. Erten-Lyons et al 13 reported a 3% per year TH expansion rate (estimated from a graph) for MCI stable subjects. Analogous rates for stable subjects in our study are 10.8% per year. As Erten-Lyons et al. stable MCI subjects started the study as controls and changed to an MCI status, the annualized rates of change may be expected to be lower than our study. Interestingly, the TH expansion rate of declining MCI subjects in the Erten-Lyons et al. paper is 17% per year, which is more comparable to the rates of our converters (17.4% per year).\nA limitation of this study is that only a subset of the ADNI data set was used, mostly because we included goodquality scans only. Our results pertain to the prediction of imminent (in the next year) conversion. It is important to note that although the stable subjects have not yet converted to AD, they may still convert in the future. Further, we note that the findings of this study may be relevant only to amnestic MCI because subjects with other forms of MCI (nonamnestic MCI and multidomain MCI) were not included in the ADNI study. However, studies suggest that amnestic MCI subjects may represent a transitional zone from normal aging to AD 41, 42 ; it is therefore appropriate to focus on amnestic MCI in the current study to assess future conversion to AD. Finally, some subjects were excluded because their conversion status was unavailable. This may bias our results if these excluded subjects differ with respect to the value of the imaging measures in predicting conversion. Strengths of the study include its multisite nature, careful diagnosis at 6-month intervals, and examination of future diagnosis change in MCI subjects, which is more clinically relevant and useful than concurrent diagnosis change.\nThis study demonstrates that TH, hippocampus, whole-brain, and ventricular rates of change and TH and hippocampal volumes are predictive of future decline to AD from MCI using serial MRI. We found no evidence that regions susceptible to early change were more predictive of future decline than global measures. However, there was some evidence that the TH expansion rate had a greater predictive ability than the hippocampi atrophy rate. There was also some evidence that the TH expansion rate was a better predictor than the TH cross-sectional volume.\nIn conclusion, prodromal atrophy rates may be useful predictors of future conversion to sporadic AD from MCI."}]
