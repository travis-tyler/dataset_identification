Introduction", "text": "Median expenditure per student in U.S. public schools grew from $9,131 in 1990 to $12,907 in fiscal year 2008/9, a real increase of 41%. The top panel of Figure 1 shows that school districts in the top and bottom percentiles with respect to expenditures per pupil also had similar patterns. While the large amount of resources devoted to public education still sparks a debate over whether money matters for improving school quality, 1 in this paper we focus on understanding why the recent growth happened in the first place. We propose a new mechanism, housing disease, based on spillovers from housing markets. with Tiebout (1956) , local finances are determined by individual preferences or by \"voting with your feet,\" i.e., by households sorting into local communities that provide their preferred quality of public services. 2 House prices are just a function of local taxes and amenities (Oates 1969) and therefore can be used to recover willingness to pay for local public goods and to test whether those goods are provided at efficient levels. 3 Housing disease reverses this standard relationship. First, housing cycles generate unusually high growth rates of housing prices. That triggers a growth in school district revenues given that local governments raise some of their funds via property or land taxes and fees. In turn, school district administrators may have incentives to spend the extra revenues without consulting voters due to rent seeking, budget rules, or frictions in re-optimizing tax rates. The end result is an increase in education expenditures without a corresponding shift in local 1 Some key studies on this topic include Coleman et al. (1966) , Hanushek (1986) , Card and Krueger (1992) , Krueger (1999) , Hanushek and Rivkin (2006) , Jackson, Johnson, and Persico (2016) , and Lafortune, Rothstein, and Schanzenbach (forthcoming). 2 A long literature shows the importance of household preferences and sorting for determining the quality of public education, such as Epple and Sieg (1999) , Fern\u00e1ndez and Rogerson (2001) , Hilber and Mayer (2009) , and Epple, Romano and Sieg (2012). preferences. This type of mechanism is not unprecedented in the economics literature. In fact we use the word \"disease\" to emphasize its similarity to Baumol and Bowen (1966) 's cost disease, a canonical example of a spillover to the cost of public education stemming from conditions in a separate market. The primary difference is that, wherease Baumol and Bowen's cost disease originates in the labor market, the housing disease's genesis is the housing market.\nThe first challenge in estimating the importance of housing disease is that house prices are endogenous to school quality and household composition. We deal with this issue by using the timeline of housing booms in each school district in our sample. The variation from local housing booms has two features that are key for our research design. First, different school districts began to boom across a decade-long period from mid-1990s to the mid-2000s, some of them multiple times, allowing us to remove the impact of national macroeconomic factors. second, the beginning of a boom is associated neither with changes in proxies for school quality nor with widespread changes in household composition. In Section IV we show how to estimate the timeline of local booms using time series methods developed by Ferreira and Gyourko (2011) and empirically validate the research design by directly testing the two key features above. 4 The second challenge is that housing data is generally not available for a large sample of school districts. We solve this problem by amassing the most recent version of the CoreLogic universe of housing transactions from 1993 to 2013, and mapping each home to school district boundaries. Our sample covers more than 2,000 school districts with almost 60% of all total enrollment in public schools. The micro data allow us to use a split-sample approach, such as in Card, Mas and Rothstein (2008) , to deal with specification search bias that arises when the same time series is used to estimate both the timeline and magnitude of a housing boom (Leamer 1983 ). The first random sample is used to create a price index for each district and estimate the timing of local booms. The hold out sample is then used to estimate the magnitude of price changes along the cycle.\nWe find that school district house prices increase by over 4 percent in the first year of the boom when compared to the pre-boom year, net of other housing booms in the same district and of time and district effects. Prices keep increasing and are nearly 20 percent larger by the end of the fourth year. Next, we estimate how school finances react to the timeline of the boom.\nExpenditures per pupil start to creap up with a one to two-year lag, turning statistically signficant at year 3 and becoming 3.3 percent larger by the fourth year of a boom.\nWith those magnitudes in hand we can back out the house price elasticity of public school finances. We find an elasticity between 0.16 and 0.20. This relatively small elasticity makes sense given that a large fraction of school district revenues now come from state and federal transfers, especially for low income districts. 5 In fact, we find heterogeneity in the estimation of elasticities that matches this intuition: districts that spent below (above) the median early in the data have smaller (bigger) elasticities than average, though the difference is not statistically differentiable from zero. But the last housing boom was so extraordinary that housing disease can account for almost half of the real increase in public education spending since the early 1990s. Our back-of-the-envelope calculations also show that housing disease can account for a higher fraction of the spending increase for the school districts in the highest percentiles of school expenditure per pupil.\nThis result is a breakdown of the theoretically efficient choices made by Tiebout-type households. But it does not necessarily imply that all additional resources are being wasted.\nWhile our setting does not have enough power to detect meaningful changes in test scores, we can look at how different spending categories are affected by housing disease. 6 Pupil-teacher ratios, a proxy for educational quality, improve but at a fairly small rate (less than 1% reduction in pupil-teacher ratio), and capital expenditures increased markedly (18% increase four years after the boom). We also find increases in average instructional salaries and benefits (2.9% and 3.7% respectively), which could reflect increases in productivity or rent-seeking, a possibility raised by Brueckner and Neumark (2014) and Diamond (2017) . Interestingly though, we do not find new resources being used to disproportionally increase administrative expenses. Overall, the fact that pupil-teacher ratios increased, capital budgets grew, and administrative expenses 5 Those transfers now corresponds to more than 50% of total revenues, but this number is difficult to properly measure given that the data may not distinguish between the jurisdiction that collects taxes versus the jurisdictions that actually has control over taxes -see Hoxby (1996) . For the effects of equalization and transfer schemes in education see Murray, Evans and Schwab (1998), Hoxby (2001) , Bradbury, Mayer and Case (2001) , Card and Payne (2002) , and more recently Jackson, Johnson, and Persico (2016) and Lafortune, Rothstein and Schanzenbach (forthcoming). 6 We explain the power issue and nonetheless provide test score estimates in Section V. remained flat suggests that housing disease is accompanied by improvements in the quality of school inputs, and that bureaucrats are not capturing most of the increased expenditures.\nThere are a couple of caveats with our results. First, we do not observe how local rules, regulations and tax rates change over time, so we are likely underestimating our elasticities. This lack of data plagues almost all research in school finance and it is due to the nature of the decentralized public system of education. Second, the estimated elasticities may not be symmetric for booms and busts. The descriptive evidence suggests that housing busts are less likely to affect school finances because it is difficult to downsize and also due to the help of state and federal transfers. But we cannot properly test the asymmetry because housing busts are usually preceeded by changes in incomes and household composition.\nOur estimates contribute to the understanding of the dramatic increase in public education spending of the past three decades. We propose a new mechanism, housing disease, that is generally not taken into account by standard theory, and it is also quite difficult to study given data and design limitations. Moreover, the relevance of such a mechanism is likely to increase in the near future. Extreme housing cycles are becoming a feature of the system as opposed to a one-time bug: local communities continue to impose new regulations that limit the supply of new housing and exacerbate housing cycles. 7\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews how school district finances work and the potential for housing disease; Section III then describes the data sources and sample construction; Section IV then describes our empirical framework and test the validity of our reserach design; Section V presents our estimates; and Section VI concludes."}, {"section_title": "II. Public School Finances and Housing Markets", "text": "School districts in the United States are funded by a mix of local, state, and federal revenue. In 2014, States and localities provide 46% and 45% of total public school revenues, respectively, with federal spending contributing the final 9%. State and federal transfers are generally redistributive in nature. At the state level, movements to reduce inequality in district resources gained traction in the 1970s and accelerated after a series of court cases in the 1990s.\nHoxby (2001), Jackson, Johnson, and Persico (2016) and Lafortune, Rothstein, and Schanzenbach (2017) provide analyses and more detailed overviews of these reforms.\nIt is important to note that the distinction between state and local revenues is not always clear, due to the complexities of state revenue-sharing policies. Hoxby (1996) highlights the importance of distinguishing between the entity that collects revenue -an accounting conceptand the entity that decides how to spend it. For example, California has a system in which school districts collect taxes locally even though revenue rules are determined almost entirely by the state.\nNonetheless, property taxes are the dominant source of local revenue, accounting for 81% of the total. Our empirical analysis focuses on districts with independent taxing authority, i.e. those with the power to levy taxes in order to fund local schools. Mechanisms for selecting property tax rates vary by jurisdiction. Annual budgets, with associated tax rates, are proposed and administered by district officials, and, in some cases, must be approved by voters. District officials have varying levels of accountability to their residents; superintendents and schoolboard members may be directly elected, appointed by other political officers, or a mix of both. In certain cases, citizens may directly vote on school spending measures (Cellini, Ferreira, and Rothstein 2010).\nRegardless of the variation in accountability measures and tax rules, households are free to \"vote with their feet\" by moving to another district if local tax and spending policies stray too far from the household's preferences. This intuition underlies the Tiebout (1956) model and the extensive literature which follows. 8 Note that in Tiebout's original model, districts use head taxes rather than property taxes to screen residents, but in practice, districts cannot use head taxes and instead raise most of their revenue from property taxes. Hamilton (1975) notes that local jurisdictions can still achieve efficient sorting and expenditure policies by combining property taxes with zoning. Lot size restrictions establish a minimum house price in each jurisdiction, mimicking the screening mechanism of Tiebout's head tax.\nThis class of models has generated significant debate over the proper interpretation of the relationship between local house prices, taxes, and public goods. One point of view -often referred to as the \"benefit view\" -emphasizes the across-district relationship between taxes and public goods characteristic of the Tiebout/Hamilton tradition. Taxes reflect the price of local public goods, and in the process the screen out households with low willingness-to-pay for these amenities. Thus, the costs of higher taxes are efficiently balanced against residents' valuations of local public goods.\nMany other papers qualify this interpretation. Barseghyan and Coate (2016) highlight issues that arise when zoning restrictions -which affect only new construction -are selected by incumbent residents. Banzhaf and Mangum (2017) emphasize that capitalization can take the form of both fixed access costs, a la Hamilton (1975) , and an increase in the per-unit cost of housing. When taxes affect the marginal cost of housing services, they also create a consumption inefficiency. Hillber (2017) and Banzhaf and Mangum (2017) provide useful overviews of theoretical and empirical work on this question.\nWhile these models vary in their description of the policy levers available to local governments, they almost uniformly treat house prices based on market-clearing conditions in the housing market. Empirically, however, one of the most salient features of housing markets are strong boom-and-bust cycles, which are difficult to generate in models in which prices depend solely on fundamentals. Glaeser and Nathanson (2015) review models that allow prices to depart from fundamentals, for reasons such as uncertainty about long-run supply, limited rationality, search-and-matching frictions, and lapses in credit standards. Housing disease starts with these departures from competitive equilibrium prices. More precisely, we use the term to refer to the influence of exogenous price increases -i.e. those unrelated to local fundamentals like amenities and productivity -on school district revenues.\nSome mathematical notation may help clarify how our mechanism departs from standard models. Suppose school district leaders choose both the level of total education expenditure E and the local property tax rate \u03c4 to maximize a value function that increases in expenditure E and decreases in the tax burdens imposed on the local citizenry. Let T denote the vector of household tax burdens, defined by T i =\u03c4Ph i , where P is the price of housing and h i is household i's housing consumption. Hence, letting H denote the stock of housing, the district solves the following program: max \u0bbe, \u0738\u123a\u202b,\u0727\u202c \u123b subject to \u202b\u0727\u202c \u2264 \u202b\u072a\u0732\u07ec\u202c In standard models, the tax rate \u03c4 can be frictionlessly adjusted each period. 9 Optimal taxes and expenditures are then determined by an equimarginality condition: taxes are increased until the marginal cost of raising revenue equals the marginal benefit of additional expenditure. 10\nSuppose now that the district experiences an unexpected housing boom -an increase in P in our framework. If tax rates can be costlessly adjusted, the district can restore the initial allocation by a proportional reduction in the property tax rate. Expenditure and each resident's tax burden is unchanged. 11\nFor the reasons discussed above, however, changing tax rates can be a costly process. 12\nSuppose now that the district has set E and \u03c4 in expectation of a certain price level P. If, after choices are codified, the district learns that prices are actually higher, then revenues will exceed expectations and must be spent. Since the policy variables were chosen to equate marginal costs with marginal benefits, the additional spending induces costs that exceed its benefits. This inefficiency is the cost of housing disease.\nThis simple set-up assumes away several possible uses for the windfall that deserve discussion. First, our specification of the objective function depends only on total expenditures.\nIn practice, there are many potential sources of educational spending, and district officials could allocate the windfall to sources that benefit them personally, such as their own salaries.\nDiamond (2017) and Brueckner and Newmark (2014) provide evidence that local officials sometimes use their positions to extract rents in this manner. This effect is more likely if voters pay less attention to tax revenue increases that result from unexpected windfalls as opposed to 9 To guarantee a unique solution, we also assume that V() is twice continuously differentiable, strictly concave, and obeys standard Inada conditions (V e (0, .) = \u221e, V e (\u221e, .) = 0, V Ti (., 0, .) = 0, and V Ti (.,\u221e, .) = -\u221e). 10 This is obviously an indirect formulation of the district's decision, rather than a full micro-foundation of the political-economic equilibrium. Instead of taking a stand on the district preferences, resident preferences, and the political process that leads to an equilibrium, we use a general value function that captures the key intuitions. 11 Note that we are implicitly assuming away several effects that may be important in practice. First, we assume that the population of the town is fixed. While this is perhaps a justifiable assumption in the short and medium termespecially if we think local decision makers place more weight on current residents than potential new residents -it ignores the sorting mechanisms underlying Tiebout models. Second, we assume that expenditures and taxes do not influence prices or quantities, a mechanism emphasized by Hoxby (2001). The setup here can readily accompany such pass-through effects, but they distract from our main point. Finally, by placing tax burdens directly into the value function (rather than, say, citizens' after-tax income) we can ignore the direct effect of the price increase on citizen purchasing power. 12 School district administrators may also hesitate to change tax rules because they may not be able to distinguish housing disease from other mechanisms that produce increases in prices and revenues, such as gentrification or local productivity shocks.\npolitically salient increases in rates. We explicitly test for the presence of rent-seeking in our empirical work.\nAlternatively, district leaders could save the increased revenues and return them to voters in subsequent years via lower taxes. In some cases, however, districts may have explicit incentives to avoid this behavior, as unspent funds may crowd out future transfers. To account for a full range of possible dynamic effects, our empirical specifications allow prices and expenditures to evolve flexibly over a period of five years following a housing boom. Before turning to our empirical specification though, the next section reviews the school and housing data."}, {"section_title": "III. Data", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "School District Data", "text": "Our primary data source for school district finances is the School District Finance Survey (often referred to as the F-33 survey), which the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has administered annually since 1995. The datasets report detailed revenue and expenditure categories for all school districts in the United States. 13 School district boundaries are not constant over time, as districts merge and split with some regularity. We contacted all state education agencies to request details of the history of district boundary changes. Ultimately we received this information from 36 states, allowing us to create constant-boundary district definitions for most of our sample. We restrict our final analysis sample to districts that have independent taxing authority, \"unified\" districts that include both elementary and high school students, and districts that never merged or split during that time period. However, we show in the Appendix that our results are robust to relaxing these restrictions.\nWe supplement the revenue and expenditure data with demographic and staffing information from the District and School Universe Surveys, part of the NCES' Common Core of Data. These datasets provide a several useful descriptors for our analysis. First, they report the racial background of enrolled students and the number of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. These measures allow us to check whether changes in local housing prices might reflect changes in the composition of local students or residents. The files also provide detailed staffing information, which we use to construct measures of average salaries and employment levels for various categories of workers.\nLocal income data comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis' (BEA) Regional Economic Accounts. We use this information to test whether changes in local economic fundamentals might explain local booms and busts. We observe average personal income for all United States Counties, from which we construct a district-level weighted average using Census\nBlock-level population data. 14 These measures will be inaccurate if county-level economic activity is not evenly distributed among school districts, so we supplement all analyses using data aggregated to the full metro area.\nFinally, we obtained microdata from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) to assess whether changes in spending translated into short-term changes in student achievement. We make use of the State NAEP sample, which contains scores from a national, consistently-normed test administered biannually to a randomly selected subset of students in participating states. 15 We average student scores 16 to the district-year-test level to construct a summary measure of student performance. 17"}, {"section_title": "Housing Transactions Data", "text": "Our house price data come from CoreLogic, a private data vendor that aggregates public deeds records from county recorder's offices in markets across the country. Houses are pre-assigned to their Census block group, which we then match to school district boundaries using Census block relationship files.\nWe focus attention on districts with sufficient data to at least calculate a continuous quarterly price series between 2000:Q1 and 2007:Q1 18 (we use data from outside of this time period when it is available). The resulting dataset includes 2,785 school districts and over 28 million transactions. To eliminate bias from specification search (Leamer 1983), we randomly split the sample in half and compute constant-quality hedonic price indices for each sample independently. 19 One sample is used to identify and test for the existence of structural breaks, and the other is used to estimate how prices change in the periods surrounding the break.\nThe top panel of Figure 2 plots the 90 th , 50 th , and 10 th percentiles of the resulting districtlevel price indices. The boom period of the recent cycle is apparent at each part in the distribution. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the bust varied tremendously. Even though we normalize each index to 100 in 2010:Q1, there is considerable variation at the peak just five years earlier.\nThe bottom panel plots annual growth rates of the same series. To remove the effects of seasonality in the housing market, we calculate growth rates as year-over-year changes in the quarterly series, i.e. (P t -P t-4 )/P t-4 . While the national housing bust starting in early 2005 is immediately apparent, there is no visual evidence of a sudden break during the previous boom period. This fact is essential to our identification strategy. While most markets experienced a sudden onset of rapid growth, there is considerable cross-sectional variation in the timing of the booms. Unsurprisingly, the districts that survive the merge to the housing data tend to be larger than the national average; enrollment in the breakpoint sample (10,221 students per district) is nearly three times that of the average district (3,459), corresponding to almost 60% of the total enrollment in public schools. These districts also have larger minority populations, higher student teacher ratios, and greater portions of the population eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, an indicator of family income. Somewhat reassuringly, revenue per pupil is similar in the housing sample ($11,047/student) as in the overall sample ($11,158/student)."}, {"section_title": "Sample Restrictions and Representativeness", "text": "Columns (3) through (5) show the effects of restricting the sample to unified districts only (as opposed to districts specific to elementary schools or high schools); districts with independent taxing authority; and districts with constant borders and no missing financial data over our sample period.

Our favorite sample is based on\nColumn 5, and it represents 42% of all public school students. .

Empirical Framework and Validity of Research Design", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Identifying Structural Breaks and Estimating Magnitudes", "text": "First, consider the problem of testing for the existence of a single structural break.\nDenoting the house price growth rate in district i at time t as d i,t , the null hypothesis of no structural break is:\n(1) \u202b\u072a\u202c : \u0740 ,\u0be7 = \u0740 , , \u202b\u0750\u202c = 1, \u2026 \u0736\nThe alternative hypothesis is that the growth rate changes in the middle of the sample, at a time period t*, i.e.:\n(2) \u202b\u072a\u202c \u0b35 : \u0740 ,\u0be7 = \u124a \u0740 \u0b35, \u123a\u202b\u0750\u202c * \u123b, \u202b\u0750\u202c = 1, \u2026 , \u202b\u0750\u202c * \u0740 \u0b36, \u123a\u202b\u0750\u202c * \u123b, \u202b\u0750\u202c = \u202b\u0750\u202c * + 1, \u2026 \u0736\nThe first step of our analysis is to identify the value of t* that minimizes the residual variation in growth rates. We implement this by searching over all values of t' in each districts' price growth series, 20 estimating a regression model with separate intercepts for the pre-and post-t' periods, and selecting the candidate time period that produces the smallest sum of squared residuals.\nOf course, this procedure will select a candidate breakpoint regardless of whether a break exists, and some care needs to be taken when constructing tests for the existence of a structural break. If t* were known a priori, we could test H 1 against H 0 using standard methods. Because we select the break that maximizes the likelihood ratio, however, critical values for testing must be derived from the distribution of the supremum of the likelihood ratio statistic (under the null hypothesis of no break). Andrews (1993) and Bai (1997) derive exact formulas for this distribution, and Estrella (2003) describes numerical methods to calculate p-values efficiently.\nUltimately, we allow for up to three structural breaks in the price growth series for each district. Bai (1999) and Bai and Perron (1998) derive tests for the existence of b+1 structural breaks against the null hypothesis of b breaks. Therefore, we test for a second break whenever we detect a first break at the 5% significance level, and a third break whenever we identify a significant second break. This recursive testing procedure is valid because, as shown by Bai (1999) and Bai and Perron (1998) , the one-break test remains valid when multiple breaks exist.\nWe identify candidate breakpoints in multiple-break models by looping over all possible pairs (or triples) of breaks in a districts' price growth series.\nIt is also important to note that the regressions used to identify breakpoint locations do not provide unbiased estimates of the significance and magnitude of the change in price growth rates at the breakpoint. This is due to the specification search issue identified by Leamer (1983), in which the data-dependent manner by which we identify breakpoints contributes to a bias in estimating the magnitude of the break. We address this issue via the split-sample approach suggested by Card, Mas, and Rothstein (2008) . That is, we randomly split the dataset in half, and use one sample to estimate the breakpoints and the other to estimate the price response.\nWe run variants of the panel equation (3) below in order to estimate the magnitude of changes in price (and also for a number of other school district outcomes) along the housing boom. Denote \u073b ,\u0be7 the log of the house price index in district i and year-quarter t, \u202b\u0750\u202c , * the quarter of the b th breakpoint in a district, and B i the number of breakpoints estimated for district i:\nwhere \u07d9 and \u07e2 \u0be7 are district and time fixed effects, respectively. This parameterization allows for flexible dynamics in the break's effects. Each \u07e0 \u0c18 measures the change in the outcome variable \u03c1 years after the break, relative to the year immediately prior to the break (note that we omit the dummy variable for relative year zero.)\nNegative values of \u03c1 target the \"effects\" of future breaks, allowing us to test for the existence of pre-trends that might confound our research design. The controls included in panel equation (3) guarantee that the housing boom effects will be estimated net of calendar effects, school district fixed effects, and also net of other booms and busts that happened in the same district.\nIn the same specification we estimate separate effects for positive breaks, non-significant breaks, and negative breaks, as we are primarily interested in understanding the effects of sudden booms -i.e. positive structural breaks. Even though all empirical specifications will estimate the effect of housing busts, the validity of such estimates are less credible since many markets begin to decline at essentially the same time, complicating efforts to separate the effects of bustinduced price variation from the national macroeconomic downturn."}, {"section_title": "Breakpoint Results and Validity of Research Design", "text": "For illustrative purposes, each panel of Figure 3 Figure 5B then turns to the demographic composition of school districts. First, there is no evidence of changes in racial composition around booms. Second, while it appears that use of free lunch is lower in the post-boom period, the magnitude of the change is quite small compared to the size of the price effect. To confirm that shifts in demographics are not driving our results, in the next section we report results from models that control for %white, %black, %Hispanic, and % free lunch as a robustness check. Their inclusion does not impact the estimation of the house price elasticity of expenditures per pupil. We also discuss possible mechanisms through which booms could alter unobserved demographic composition at the end of Section 5."}, {"section_title": "V.

But while prices immediately respond to the beginning of a boom, expenditures respond with a lag -matching the institutional features of school district finances discussed in section II. Finally, the magnitude of the price effect is an order of magnitude higher than the expenditure effect. Table 3 explores a number of robustness tests. Column 1 shows our preferred estimates again to facilitate comparisons. Column 2 includes the full sample of school districts in our data, prior to restricting the sample to independent unified school districts that never experienced a split or a merge and that possess a complete panel of finance data. 21 The path of the coefficients is similar, but the point estimates are about 20% smaller -which is not surprising given the nonconsistent sample. Column 3 then excludes non-independent school districts from the full sample, and the resulting point estimates for expenditures per pupil become slightly larger.\nColumn 4 trims outliers in our preferred sample by excluding districts with expenditure growth rates in the top or bottom 1% of the sample. These estimates are only slightly smaller for house prices and similar for expenditures per pupil.\nColumn 5 only uses the one-breakpoint model. Estimates are equally larger for both prices and expenditures. The intuition for this result is that such model does not control for a 2nd or 3rd break, and therefore the magnitude of boom is loaded into the one break. Finally, column 6 uses our original specification with the addition of school demographics. Estimates are practically unchanged, which corroborates the validity of the research design."}, {"section_title": "House Price Elasticity of Expenditures Per Pupil", "text": "In this section we back out the house price elasticity of expenditures per pupil. One complication is that it is difficult to pin down the precise lag structure for these elasticities given the heterogeneity in school finance structures in the United States. We apply two strategies to alleviate this problem: a) only calculate elasticities based on the log estimates that represent cumulative changes relative to the baseline year, and b) use a Wald estimator that divides the point estimates of expenditures per pupil in time t by the price effect in time t-1. Standard errors are calculated via the delta method.\nThe first row of Table 4 shows the estimated elasticities for each relative year. The estimates are remarkably stable, ranging from 0.16 to 0.20. The last column shows the estimate for a specification that bunches some relative years, producing a weighted average elasticity of 0.18. The next row uses concurrent estimates as opposed to the lagged structure. These concurrent elasticities are slightly smaller, with a weighted average of 0.16. The table does not report the elasticities for the busts, but our estimates show a number that is larger than the ones for the boom (weighted average of 0.33). One reason for the larger elasticity is that, as we mentioned before, the busts in our sample are bunched in the onset of recessions, and therefore those results might be confounded by other factors, such as drops in employment and wages. 22 Next we investigate if there is heterogeneity in these elasticities. First we create indicators for districts that were below and above the median expenditure per pupil in 1996, and then fully interact them with the relative year dummies. We run these models for prices and expenditures and calculate elasticities that are reported in the last two rows of Table 4 . Although we have a relatively large sample of districts, it is not sufficient to produce heterogeneity estimates that are statistically different from each other. However, the pattern of the point estimates is suggestive: school districts with above median initial expenditures per pupil have a larger elasticity than the below median districts.\nThese results match a couple of important features of the American school finance system: school districts receive a large fraction of their revenues from state and federal transfers, and those transfers are disproportionally more relevant to low expenditure districts. In this setting, average elasticities should be relatively small, and high expenditure districts should have higher elasticities.\nWith the elasticities in hand we can back out by how much housing disease impacted the rise in public education spending in the United States during the 1990s and 2000s. The main assumption needed for this exercise is that the estimated elasticities can be applied to all price changes, not just the price changes from the variation used in our research design. While this might seem like a strong assumption, the sample period is characterized by little changes in real wages and incomes. While there is still an ongoing debate about the causes of the last housing boom (i.e,, changes in credit supply, changes in house price expectations, or a combination of both) the current consensus is that a small part of the cycle was due to real changes in fundamentals. Finally, we also assume no general equilibrium consequences arising from the initial changes in prices, which is consistent with the lack of changes in demographics observed 22 These elasticities are somewhat smaller than existing estimates of the property-tax elasticity for cities and states. Lutz (2008) estimates a value of 0.4 using national and state level time series analysis, while Vlaicu and Whalley (2011) find a 0.74 elasticity for California cities using an instrumental variable constructed from housing supply constraints. We believe that the differences reflect the influence of redistributive state funding formulas on school district revenues.\nin Figure 5 (we will discuss changes in unobserved demographic features in more detail in the next subsection).\nThe underlying data from Figure 2 shows that school districts had an average house price increase of 95.17% from 1995 to 2007 (right before the Great Recession). Multiplying that number by the 0.18 elasticity gives a change in expenditure per pupil of 17.13%. That corresponds to about half of the observed change in average expenditures per pupil from 1996 to 2008, implying that housing disease was the most important determinant of school finances during that period. The main driver of this effect is the unprecedented increase in house prices, a cycle never before seen in the United States (Shiller, 2005) .\nWe also calculate heterogeneity by using the price changes from the bottom and top of the distribution (P90 and P10), and applying the below and above median expenditure heterogeneity in elasticities reported in Table 4 . Housing disease can only account for 20% of the expansion of expenditures in below median expenditure districts, but can explain 70% of that increase in above median districts. Again, this reflects the fact that low expenditure districts are much more dependent on state and federal transfers and the fact that housing booms were much larger at the top of the distribution."}, {"section_title": "School District Revenues", "text": "One caveat with our empirical approach is that adjustments in tax rates and other local rules and regulations are not observed in the data. If districts reduce tax rates after the start of a housing boom, then we underestimate the elasticity -but can still interpret the results as a combination of the direct price effect plus the indirect political effect of potential adjustments in tax rates. The school district revenue data do not help solving this problem because of three issues: a) it only reports total revenues as opposed to a breakdown of tax base and tax rates; b) even the breakdown by local versus state or federal transfer is muddled because it is difficult to disentangle the role of the school district as tax collector versus who in fact has control of the tax resources (Hoxby 1996); c) the revenue data is noisier than the expenditure data because of reporting standards. For example, revenues for capital projects that invest (spend) resources for 5 or 7 years are fully recorded in the first year of the project. A similar phenomenon occurs with private donations.\nFurther complications arise from state policies that either restrict districts' taxing ability or redistribute revenues. Such policies are quite common; see Hoxby (2001) and Jackson, Johnson, and Persico (2016) , who carefully track court cases and state legislation to evaluate the impacts of state policy changes. We are primarily interested in how such policies might mediate housing disease, not the overall impact of these policies. Accordingly, we need only focus on aspects of state formulas that respond to changes in the local property tax base. Note that many common formula features, such as foundation formulas or equalization policies, are not directly affected by house price growth, so their impacts are therefore absorbed by district fixed effects.\nTherefore, we focus attention on state policies that restrict the growth of local property taxes by placing explicit limits on property tax growth, either by capping growth in assessments or capping revenue growth directly. We draw our classifications from Hightower, Mitani, and Swanson (2010), who surveyed all 50 states and categorized funding formulas along various dimensions. 23 In light of these issues, Table 5 reports magnitude estimates for total revenues and for revenue subcategories (local, state, and federal) in states with and without property tax "}, {"section_title": "Type of School Expenditures and Quality", "text": "How are the additional resources arising from housing disease spent by school districts?\nReported school expenditures are split into three main categories: current (corresponding to 84.7% of the total expenditures during the sample period), capital (10.5%) and others (4.8%). 24 Columns 1 and 2, of Table 6 report estimates for capital and current expenditures. Current expenditures show a similar pattern of lagged increases observed for total expenditures, albeit with smaller point estimates. Capital expenditures have a much larger effect, increasing 17.5% above the baseline in the fourth year of the housing boom.\nNext we split current expenditure into its two key categories, instruction and services, and present the estimates in columns 3 and 4. 25 Their estimated effects are quite similar to each other, and also similar to the estimates for total current expenses. Finally, in columns 5, 6, and 7 we break down the service component into instruction, pupil, and administration. 26 While instruction and pupil services show large effects (above 3% in some years), administrative cost point estimates are very small.\nGiven that instruction expenditures correspond to the largest expenditures in a school district, in Table 7 we test if those increases are due to increases in the quantity of teacherswhich reduces pupil-teacher ratios -or to raises in wages and benefits paid to the teachers. The results are mixed. We show small decreases in average salaries and benefits immediately following the boom, with increases in years four and five. Pupil-teacher ratios decline moderately after a boom. We report separate effects for instructional salaries, administrative salaries, and other salaries in Appendix Table 2 , though our construction of these variables requires significant caveats. 27 Teacher salaries improve steadily after a boom, reaching a 2% increase by relative year 5, while average administrator salaries are 5.6 to 6.7% lower in the four years following a boom. Therefore, we hypothesize that the initial decrease in overall salaries may be due to the hiring of new, lower-paid administrative employees in the short and medium run but that ultimately housing disease increases wages by raising teacher compensation, which constitutes the vast majority of district labor expenses.\nFinally, Table 8 presents point estimates for overall test scores for math and reading in columns 1 and 2, and separately for 4 th and 8 th grade test scores in columns 3 through 6. Because the NAEP test is only administered every two years, we pool relative-year coefficients into groups of two. The estimates are noisy, in part because test scores are never available for 15% of our housing sample. We see no significant effects on math scores in any specification. There is some evidence that reading scores increased in the very long run. We estimate that reading scores increased by 0.090 standard deviations 5-6 years after a boom, and 0.099 standard deviations 7-8 years post-boom.\nWe are hesitant to over-interpret the reading results for several reasons. First, the effects enter with a substantial lag. The estimates are driven by observations long after the boom, placing significant strain on our identification strategy. The extended lag also creates an unbalanced panel; we only observe five post-boom years for districts with positive breaks relatively early in the sample, which are observably different from the late-breaking areas (DeFusco et al. 2017 ). Furthermore, it is noteworthy that we do not observe a similar increase in math scores. We are unaware of any reason to expect reading scores to respond more strongly to increased expenditures than math scores. In fact, generally speaking, math scores are more responsive to educational intervention than reading scores for school-age children (Fryer 2017).\nFinally, the magnitudes of the effects are quite small relative to the elapsed time. Dividing 0.090 standard deviations by 5.5 years implies an average annual increase of only 0.016 standard deviations."}, {"section_title": "Household Sorting and Unobservables", "text": "Our results assumed that sorting based on unobservables were not driving the estimates, and we corroborated this assumption by looking at how observed school demographics changed around the timeline of local housing booms. However, one could posit that housing booms may induce a higher share of high income families or families with more school-age children to move to better school districts (or districts with higher expenditures per pupil) just because of budget constraints. The mechanism is simple: households with higher unobserved willingness to pay for those school districts will win the bidding war for the limited supply of homes in those districts.\nThe MSA level results shown by Ferreira and Gyourko (2011) seem to potentially corroborate such a story: even though overall income barely changes at MSA level after the beginning of a housing boom, the self-reported income of marginal homebuyers seem to have increased in the first two years (and then declined again to baseline levels).\nSuch effects, though, may only have a trivial impact on the overall composition of households in a school district because only a small fraction of homeowners move every year.\nMoreover, those households likely have very little influence in the local political decisions of school boards given that they are mostly newcomers. Nonetheless, in a future draft we plan to investigate in more detail the potential for selection on unobservables and whether that could explain part of the housing disease effect. 28"}, {"section_title": "VI. Conclusion", "text": "Both housing prices and educational spending rose dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s. Traditional local public finance models access to high-quality schools as a local public good, and access to this benefit is capitalized into house prices. This paper shows that the reverse causal channel should not be ignored: house price increases lead to additional spending per pupil by increasing the local tax base. We refer to this phenomenon as housing disease, as the increase in expenditures comes from a housing market spillover rather than a political decision weighing the benefits of school spending against the costs of increased tax burdens.\nThe magnitude of the estimated effect is substantial: we estimate house price elasticities of per-pupil expenditures of 0.16-0.20, implying that rising house prices can explain roughly half of the increase in per-pupil expenditures leading up to the 2007 recession. Although housing disease is a source of inefficiency in local finances, we find that the spending increases are concentrated on student instruction and not administrator salaries, suggesting that changes in school quality may have accompanied the increase in school expenditures.\n28 Our discussion also implicitly assumes that housing wealth effects do not operate -that is, the increase in house prices does not cause households to demand higher education expenditures by relaxing their budget constraints. Results in the finance literature (e.g. DeFusco (forthcoming)) suggest that such effects are small in practice, and therefore unlikely to drive our results.

The sample includes all independent, unified districts with no missing finance data, constant borders, and sufficient housing data to calculate breakpoints. Dotted lines show 95% confidence intervals, with standard errors clustered at the district level.\nIn estimating the break points, we allow for the possibility that a given market might experience more than one housing boom during the course of our sample period. Our method is recursive in that we first test for the existence of one break point against the null hypothesis of zero. Given the existence of at least one break point, we can then test the hypothesis of \u0749 + 1 break points against the null of \u0749 using the results from Bai (1999) . Bai and Perron (1998) show that the test for one break is consistent in the presence of multiple breaks, which is what allows for this sequential estimation procedure.\nMore specifically, let 0 < \u07ee ,\u0b35 < \u22ef < \u07ee , < 1 mark the proportions of the sample generated by the \u0749 break points estimated under the null hypothesis for district i. For technical reasons, we require that \u07ee , \u2212 \u07ee ,\u0b3f\u0b35 > \u07e8 , for some small \u07e8 , 30 where we define \u07ee , = 0, \u07ee ,\u0b3e\u0b35 = 1.\nFurther, let \u07df , = \u0c17 ,\u0c2c \u0c1d ,\u0cd5 \u0b3f\u0c1d ,\u0cd5\u0c37\u0c2d , \u0746 = 1, \u2026 , \u0749 + 1. The likelihood ratio test compares the maximum of the likelihood ratio obtained when allowing for \u0749 + 1 breaks to that from only allowing for \u0749.
