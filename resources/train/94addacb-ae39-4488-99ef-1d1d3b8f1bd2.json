[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The value of 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET for the prognosis of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is controversial. In the present work, the identification of cerebral metabolic patterns with significant prognostic value for conversion of MCI patients to AD is investigated with voxel-based Cox regression, which in contrast to common categorical comparisons also utilizes time information.\nFDG PET data of 544 MCI patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were randomly split into two equally-sized datasets (training and test). Within a median follow-up duration of 47 months (95% CI: 46-48 months) 181 patients developed AD. In the training dataset, voxel-wise Cox regressions were used to identify regions associated with conversion of MCI to AD. These were compared to regions identified by a classical group comparison (analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with statistical parametric mapping (SPM) 8) between converters and non-converters (both adjusted for apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, 1 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

A complete listing of ADNI investigators can be found at: examination (MMSE) score, age, sex and education). In the test dataset, normalized FDG uptake within significant brain regions from voxel-wise Cox-and ANCOVA analyses (Cox-and ANCOVA-regions of interest (ROI), respectively) and clinical variables APOE status, MMSE score and education were tested in different Cox models (adjusted for age, sex) including: (1) only clinical variables, (2) only normalized FDG uptake in ANCOVA-ROI, (3) only normalized FDG uptake from Cox-ROI, (4) clinical variables plus FDG uptake in ANCOVA-ROI, (5) clinical variables plus FDG uptake from Cox-ROI.\nConversion-related regions with relative hypometabolism comprised parts of the temporo-parietal and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus for voxel-wise ANCOVA, plus frontal regions for voxelwise Cox regression (both p < 0.01, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected).

Some studies reported uninformative prediction accuracies of 50% (Grimmer et al., 2016) to 57% (Schmand et al., 2012) and a recent Cochrane review (Smailagic et al., 2015) did not recommend FDG PET for clinical use for this purpose. This has been criticized (Morbelli et al., 2015) , and other studies have shown that FDG PET is a significant predictor of conversion to AD (Drzezga et al., 2005; Lange et al., 2015; Prestia et al., 2015) .\nThe majority of previous FDG PET studies were limited as they used only a-priori defined region of interest (ROI)-based survival analyses (Gray et al., 2012; Landau et al., 2010; Torosyan et al., 2017) or voxel-based analyses that disregarded observation time information (Chen et al., 2011) . In addition, previous MRI studies have shown advantages of the well-established Cox proportional hazard regression (Cox, 1972) over traditional group comparisons (Vemuri et al., 2011; Zeifman et al., 2015) , when applied at voxel level.\nIn the present work, we aimed to use voxel-wise Cox regression to identify patterns of cerebral glucose metabolism that are significantly related to MCI to AD conversion without a-priori"}, {"section_title": "ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "\n\n\n\n"}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T", "text": "knowledge about typical AD patterns. The predictive value of the normalized FDG uptake within these hypometabolic clusters was evaluated and compared against other predictors in a test-dataset, using multivariate Cox regression.\nTo this end, we used the large imaging data collected in the scope of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, http://adni.loni.usc.edu), which enables a combination of voxel level analysis of FDG PET with observation time information.\n\n\nFinally, Table 3 shows the annual conversion rates for all models and risk groups after 1, 3 and 5 years. \n\n\nfound a significant predictive value for FDG PET within the ADNI data, others did not (Schmand et al., 2012; Trzepacz et al., 2014) . Beyond differences in employed methods, reasons for this obvious discrepancy might be different subsets of the constantly growing ADNI sample, based on the time of download and inclusion criteria. This is apparent when comparing annual conversion rates of different ADNI samples: while the current study used a dataset with an annual conversion rate of 8.7%, in (Landau et al., 2010) it was 17.2 %, in (Trzepacz et al., 2014) even 20% and (Lange et al., 2017 (Lange et al., , 2015 report about 9.5% and 6.3%, respectively. It has been pointed out that the ADNI database does not represent the general population (Whitwell et al., 2012) . Therefore, the predictive value of FDG PET that we found might not necessarily apply to other samples tested. In line with this, smaller studies (Grimmer et al., 2016; Trzepacz et al., 2014) , (Frings et al., 2018) did not support this, although a meta-analysis of (Frisoni et al., 2013) showed a clear advantage of FDG PET for conversion prediction over other modalities.\nHighlights:\n\uf0b7 voxel-wise Cox regression identifies regions relevant for development AD \uf0b7 hypometabolism of these regions poses a significant hazard for AD development \uf0b7 inclusion of FDG PET data improves the accuracy of prognosis significantly"}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The data used in the present study is provided by the ADNI project, which is a large multi-center study with approximately 50 sites participating in the United States and Canada. It was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership and is led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD.\nThe primary goal of the ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments could be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Comprehensive information about the ADNI project can be found at the official website.\nFor the present work 576 FDG PET scans of MCI patients were retrieved from the ADNI database (August 2016) with the following inclusion criteria: all patients were clinically diagnosed as MCI (DX-score 2) and had an FDG PET at baseline. A mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score of at least 24 points (n=6 excluded), minimal follow-up of at least 6 months (n=20 excluded, of these n=10 had no follow-up) and no bidirectional change of DX-scores (e.g. between different ADNI phases, n=6 excluded) were requested.

The reconstructed files were downloaded in their original format (DICOM, ECAT, Interfile) for metainformation and as Nifti which was ultimately used for analysis.\nThe preprocessing steps for the ADNI MCI scans followed recommendations for optimal statistical analysis of brain FDG PET scans in the context of MCI to AD conversion prognosis, previously described elsewhere (Lange et al., 2015) . This processing pipeline utilized MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United States) and the freely available Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 8) framework (Friston et al., 2007) .\nIn case of dynamic scans, first a frame-by-frame motion correction to the first frame was applied and realigned frames were summed into a final static uptake image. In a second step the images were regularized into MNI space and subsequently stereotactically normalized onto an inhouse FDG PET template, obtained from healthy elderly controls. Finally, the scans were proportionally scaled to brain parenchyma and a Gaussian smoothing of 12 mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM) was applied."}, {"section_title": "Region of interest derivation", "text": "Two fundamentally different methods were applied to the training dataset in order to identify conversion-related ROIs of cerebral glucose metabolism on FDG PET. In both cases the calculations were restricted to brain parenchyma voxels.\nFirst, a voxel-wise analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to identify voxels with significantly reduced FDG uptake in converters (n=86) versus non-converters (n=194) in the training dataset, adjusted for age, sex, mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) 8 software. The subsequent region of interest (ANCOVA-ROI, Figure 1 ), containing all voxels with significant hypometabolism in converters compared to non-converters, was thresholded at p < 0.01 (false discovery rate (FDR) corrected).\nSecond, a Cox model was fit independently for each voxel within MATLAB, with normalized and subsequently z-scaled FDG uptake as predictor variable, adjusted for sex, age, MMSE score and APOE genotype. Voxels that showed a significant (FDR-corrected p < 0.01) association between hypometabolism and (earlier) conversion were combined to a 'Cox-ROI' (Figure 1 ). In order to match the common convention that hazard ratios above one correspond to a risk increase, the measure 'hypometabolism' was defined as a positive value. Hazard ratios below one, indicating a protective effect, were excluded for the final analysis as these seemingly hypermetabolic regions were actually due to proportional scaling (i.e. relative preserved areas like cortices)."}, {"section_title": "Cox regressions in the test dataset", "text": "Using the ANCOVA-and Cox-ROIs derived from the training dataset, Cox regressions were carried out in the test dataset. First, the average normalized FDG uptake within both ROIs were read out for each subject in the test dataset, and used together with clinical data as covariates for five Cox models. Multicollinearity was addressed by the usage of ridge regression. For all five\nCox models, a validation of the proportional hazard assumption has been performed for all covariates by testing for multiple fractional polynomials transformation, using the R package mfp (R Core Team, 2017) (Ambler et al., 2015) . As all covariates satisfied the proportional hazard assumption, transformations would have been only linear and were thus omitted. In order to be able to assign a given MCI patient to a risk group, the feasibility of risk stratification was tested and illustrated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. To this end, we calculated a prognostic index (PI) as proposed by (Royston and Altman, 2013) as follows: PI(p) = HR c1 * c 1 (p) + \u2026 + HR c6 * c 6 (p)\nwith HR ci = hazard ratio corresponding to c i = covariate and PI = individual prognostic index for patient p.\nThe resulting continuous distribution of the PI was stratified into three equally-sized groups:\ncorresponding to low, medium and high risk for conversion. For those three groups Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Using the categorical group comparison (SPM ANCOVA), significantly decreased metabolism in considerably extended beyond those identified by SPM ANCOVA (6 cm 3 ).

This pattern included the hypometabolic clusters derived from the reference method (ANCOVA SPM), but was more widespread and (at the same selected significance threshold) also involved the frontal cortex. The identified conversion-related brain regions (Figure 1) , including frontal cortex, coincided with the well-established regions of cerebral hypometabolism in MCI (Dukart et al., 2013) and AD (Bohnen et al., 2012; Langbaum et al., 2009) . Although the Cox-ROI was noticeably larger than the ANCOVA-ROI, both covered similar brain regions and the normalized FDG uptake within the two regions was highly correlated. Consequently, the Cox model pairs 2 and 3 as well as 4 and 5\nin the test dataset led to comparable results, respectively. Apparently, the classical group comparison already identified the most relevant areas, and the additional information contained in the slightly larger Cox-ROI had no added value concerning the prediction of conversion to AD.\nTherefore, the inclusion of observation time information via voxel-wise Cox regression, used to identify the Cox-ROI, was not superior to traditional group contrasts for identification of conversion-related regions.\nOf note, the prognosis of conversion to AD by APOE genotype and MMSE score was significantly improved when imaging information (normalized FDG uptake based on either method) was included.\nIdentification of conversion-related hypometabolism in frontal regions might indicate greater sensitivity of the Cox regression method. However, notably the predictive power of models including the Cox regression-derived FDG uptake (and hence frontal metabolism) was not superior to those including FDG uptake from conventionally derived regions (excluding frontal regions), which might also indicate that frontal regions play only a minor role in conversion to AD.\nThe applied stratification into risk groups based on the calculated prognostic index has the advantage of individual predictions of conversion probability within arbitrarily chosen time frames (e.g., 1, 3, or 5 years, see Table 3 ). This might be of value for patient counseling in clinical routine.\nLimitations for the Cox regression method, as applied in both datasets, include the fact that the set of chosen predictor variables was not comprehensive: For instance, it did not include information about beta-amyloid or tau from PET imaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or structural information from MRI. Also, more detailed cognitive performance data (e.g. Montreal Cognitive\nAssessment, which has not been available for about half of the patients in this study) might be important covariates. In addition, comorbid diseases like vascular pathologies may both obscure and mimic an AD-pathology.\nHowever, the current study aimed at testing the method of voxel-wise Cox regressions and hence results were only compared to those of conventional group contrasts and adjusted for commonly used clinical covariates.\nConcerning the predictive value of FDG PET in the context of MCI to AD conversion, the literature shows a large heterogeneity.
