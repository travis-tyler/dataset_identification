[{"section_title": "", "text": "account the differences in COVID-19 detection rates among the countries and the epidemic stages of the countries. Therefore we used a doubling time (DT) of the death toll as a more stable indicator.\nFirst, we investigated the DT of COVID-19 deaths in 47 countries (source: Our World in Data, 3 as of 5 April 2020). We defined the baseline date of each country as the date when fatalities of at least five people was first observed in the country. We covered all countries that have at least 10-day observation period and had a population of more than 1 million. To exclude the effect of social interventions, the death toll data of the country was truncated by 30 days after the baseline date (for China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, Japan, and USA).\nNext, we surveyed the national BCG vaccination policies of each country (sources: BCG Atlas, 4 WHO-UNICEF report, 5 and other 12 papers). The 47 countries were divided into two groups based on whether the majority of the population between the ages of 0 and 29 was vaccinated (\"BCG\") or not (\"non-BCG\"). BCG vaccination records are reliable only for the last 30 years for several countries. We also investigated the dependency of the BCG strains. Among the 32 \"BCG\" countries, the median DT of the four countries using \"Tokyo 172-1\" strain (Japan, Iraq, Malaysia, and Pakistan) was 6.8, and that of the other 28 vaccinated countries was 3.8. Their distributions were also significantly different at the significance level of 0.05 ( 0.024).\nWe showed a statistically significant difference of the doubling times of the death toll between \"BCG\" and \"non-BCG\" countries. The correlation might be a spurious and does not directly imply causality.\nData and full references used in the analysis are available at http://www.bi.cs.titech.ac.jp/COVID-19/Death_vs_BCGpolicy.html.\n.
