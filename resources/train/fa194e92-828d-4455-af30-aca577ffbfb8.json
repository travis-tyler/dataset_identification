[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The relation of antioxidant nutrients to the incidence of nuclear cataracts was investigated in a cohort of adults aged 43-84 years in the Beaver Dam Eye Study (Beaver Dam, Wisconsin). Nuclear opacity was assessed on a five-point ordinal scale using lens photographs taken at baseline (1988)(1989)(1990) and at follow-up (1993-1995). Of the 1,354 persons eligible, 246 developed a nuclear cataract (level 4 or 5 opacity) in at least one eye. Antioxidant intakes were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire administered at baseline for time points corresponding to intake during the year preceding baseline and 10 years before baseline (the distant past). Lutein-zeaxanthin was the only carotenoid, out of five examined, that was associated with nuclear cataracts. Persons in the highest quintile of lutein Intake in the distant past were half as likely to have an incident cataract as persons in the lowest quintile of intake (95% confidence interval 0.3-0.8). In the overall group, nuclear cataracts were not significantly related to intake of vitamin C or vitamin E. However, vitamins C and E were inversely associated with opacities in persons who had some other risk factors for cataracts. While results of this short term follow-up study are consistent with a possible protective influence of lutein and vitamins E and C on the development of nuclear cataracts, the evidence in the present study provides weak support for these associations.

All nutrients and foods were expressed per 4.18 MJ (1,000 kcal)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical methods", "text": "Participants were categorized into quintiles of intake for each nutrient and food. Risk of incident nuclear opacity was estimated for each quintile relative to the lowest quintile of intake, using odds ratios and 95 percent confidence intervals calculated from logistic regression models. Linear trends were evaluated by logistic regression analysis using quintile median intakes for foods and nutrients. Potentially confounding factors examined were: age, gender, smoking (never, past, and current smoking and pack-years of smoking), body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m) 2 ), alcohol consumption (total intake in grams per week, number of drinks of beer, wine, or hard liquor per week, and history of ever drinking more than four drinks per day), hemoglobin level, glycosylated hemoglobin level, and history of hypertension (systolic blood pressure >160 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure >95 mmHg, or reported history of hypertension with current use of antihypertensive medication). Interactions between potential confounders and nutrient intakes were tested using likelihood ratios in logistic regression analysis. Table 1 shows how potential risk factors for nuclear cataracts differ between persons with low and high intakes of selected nutrients (data are not shown for carotenoids other than lutein). For all nutrients examined in this study, except lycopene, participants with higher nutrient densities (quintile 5) were, on average, older, less likely to be heavy smokers, and, with the added exception of vitamin E, more likely to have a history of hypertension than those with low nutrient intakes (quintile 1). In addition, persons with high nutrient intakes were more likely to be women and to be light drinkers or nondrinkers than those with low intakes. Age, total energy intake, pack-years of smoking, and total alcohol intake (g/week) altered odds ratios for nutrient intakes (quintile 5 vs. quintile 1) by l>10 percent, and therefore were retained in fully adjusted logistic regression models for nutrient intake analyses.

Vitamin C intake was not associated with the incidence of nuclear cataracts in the overall group (table  3) . Subgroup analyses were undertaken to explore the meaning of several interaction effects seen in the logistic regression models (table 4) . Consistently inverse trends were observed between vitamin C intake and opacities in subgroups with other possible risk factors for nuclear cataracts. Inverse trends were significant for heavy smokers and for persons with a history of hypertension. In contrast, vitamin C was directly associated with nuclear cataracts among persons with a glycosylated hemoglobin level in the top quartile (>6.1 percent), although confidence intervals were wide and included 1.0.\nVitamin E intake was not significantly related to nuclear cataracts in the overall group (table 3) . Intake of food sources of vitamin E (table 5) such as plant oils, nuts and seeds, and whole grains also was unrelated to nuclear cataracts. However, associations with vitamin E were apparent in some subgroups (table 4) . Among persons with a history of hypertension or aged 65 years, a higher intake of vitamin E was associated with reduced odds for nuclear opacities.\nLutein was the only carotenoid of the five examined in this cohort that was associated with nuclear opacities (table 3) , although this association was significant at the 95 percent confidence level only for diet in the more distant past. Intake of lutein at baseline was related to nuclear cataracts among younger persons (for quintile 5 vs. quintile 1, odds ratio (OR) = 0.4, 95 percent confidence interval (Cl) 0.2-0.8) but not among older persons (for quintile 5 vs. quintile 1, OR = 0.8,95 percent Cl 0.4-1.7) (table 4). Additional analyses showed that relatively higher rates of mortality among older persons with low lutein intakes might have influenced the observed relation between lutein and the incidence of nuclear cataracts in older people. Odds ratios for mortality among older participants with lutein intakes in quintiles 2 through 5, relative to quintile 1, were 0.8, 0.8, 0.5, and 0.7 (95 percent Cl 0.4-1.2), respectively (linear trend: p = 0.13).\nConsumption of spinach and other dark leafy greens, which are the most concentrated source of lutein in the diet, was inversely associated with nuclear cataracts for persons with the highest intakes (table 5).

A strength of this study is that nutrient intakes corresponded to a time point before follow-up began, and lens changes were considered only for participants who were free of cataracts (including cataract surgery) at the outset. Consequently, nutrient intakes were less likely to have been influenced by the presence, diagnosis, or surgical removal of cataracts. Furthermore, both food sources and supplemental sources were accounted for in estimating intakes of P-carotene and vitamins C and E.\nLutein-zeaxanthin has been shown to be present in lens tissue (6, 8) and therefore is a plausible etiologic factor for cataracts. In this study, dietary intakes of lutein were inversely associated with the incidence of nuclear cataracts, especially intakes in the distant past. At baseline, lutein intake was associated with the incidence of cataracts in younger persons but not in older persons. Selective mortality is one possible explanation for the lack of a significant inverse association between lutein intake at baseline and nuclear cataracts among persons aged \u00a365 years. Klein et al. (30) showed previously that the severity of nuclear cataracts was associated with decreased survival in this cohort. Moreover, lutein intake was inversely, though nonsignificantly, related to mortality among participants aged >65 years.\nPreviously in this cohort, intakes of lutein assessed by the participant's recollection of diet 10 years before baseline were shown to be associated with the severity of nuclear cataracts measured cross-sectionally at baseline (10) . Additionally, associations between intake of spinach, the most concentrated source of lutein, and extraction of any type of cataract have been reported by other investigators (17, 31) . In this study, the incidence of nuclear cataracts was inversely related to both plant and animal sources of lutein. Eggs are a type of food that is distinctly different from vegetable sources of lutein; this reduces the likelihood that some other constituent of plant foods is responsible for the apparent association with lutein intakes. Despite the fact that eggs have a moderate concentration of lutein, they are a relatively commonly consumed food, and they constituted 15 percent of the average lutein intake in the Beaver Dam Eye Study. On the basis of results from this study and other studies, dietary sources of lutein appear to be a consistently reported link between diet and nuclear cataracts.\nThe finding of stronger associations between nuclear cataracts and lutein intake in the distant past as compared with the recent past (baseline) is consistent with results of other studies (11, 16) in which longer term intake of other antioxidants was more strongly associated with nuclear cataract than short term intake. Because errors in recalling diet in the distant past are expected to be larger than errors in recalling recent diet, associations with diet in the more distant past would be expected to be weaker rather than stronger. Stronger associations with past diet in this study may reflect an influence of diet on early biochemical events that precede the development of observable opacities in the nuclear region of the lens. If this is the case, nutrient intake in middle age may influence the development of cataracts far into older age. Alternatively, stronger relations between incident nuclear cataracts and diet in the distant past could be due to a bias in recalling diet, such that people who develop nuclear opacities recall their diets as being lower in leafy greens and eggs than they actually were in the distant past. Longer term prospective studies could provide insights regarding this potential bias and the critical window of exposure in the natural history of nuclear cataract development.\nResults from this study did not confirm previously reported associations with a-carotene and lycopene in the Beaver Dam cohort. Previously, the severity of nuclear opacities at baseline was shown to be inversely associated with a-carotene intake and directly associated with lycopene intake, based on the subjects' recollection of their diets 10 years before baseline (10) . Even when data were stratified by gender to match these previous analyses, the 5-year incidence of nuclear cataract was unrelated to self-reported intakes of a-carotene and lycopene (data not shown). Although epidemiologic studies examining cataracts of all types combined have suggested a protective relation for carotenoids (17, 32, 33) , P-carotene has not been shown to be related to nuclear cataracts (9, 14, 19) . Furthermore, recent findings show that acarotene, P-carotene, lycopene, and cryptoxanthin are not present in measurable levels in human lens tissue (6, 8) . Therefore, to have an effect on nuclear cataracts, these carotenoids probably would need to affect lens opacification indirectly via a systemic mechanism. Results from this study do not support such an effect for these carotenoids.\nVitamin E status was inversely associated with nuclear cataracts in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (14) and in the Lens Opacities Case-Control Study (9, 16, 34) but not in three other epidemiologic studies (13, 15, 35) . Previously in the Beaver Dam cohort, associations with the severity of nuclear cataracts measured cross-sectionally at baseline differed depending on the method used to assess atocopherol status. Among men, the severity of nuclear opacities was inversely related to dietary intakes of atocopherol corresponding to a time point 10 years before the baseline examination (10) but was directly related to serum a-tocopherol concentrations measured at baseline (36) . Both the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (14) and the Beaver Dam Eye Study (36) have reported differences in associations with a-tocopherol status depending on the time point at which status was assessed relative to determination of lens status. This problem was minimized in this study because nutrient intakes were assessed before follow-up and persons were included only if they were free of cataracts at baseline. Results reported here do not strongly support an inverse association between vitamin E and nuclear cataracts, except possibly among persons susceptible to cataracts due to the presence of other risk factors. However, the limited statistical power in this short term prospective study would impair the ability to detect a modest association between vitamin E and nuclear cataracts, particularly considering the influence of error in assessing levels of vitamin E in the diet. Two recent prospective studies (16, 37) , one carried out in a subsample of Beaver Dam Eye Study participants, have observed a lower risk for incident nuclear opacities in people with high levels of vitamin E in serum. Although the administration of supplements containing vitamin E for 5 years did not influence the prevalence of nuclear cataracts in the Linxian study (19) , longer time periods may be necessary for vitamin E to influence the process of nuclear lens opacification. Overall, the body of evidence at this time indicates that a potentially protective influence of vitamin E on the incidence of nuclear lens opacities cannot be ruled out.\nAs with vitamin E, associations with vitamin C intake were not significant in the overall group of participants, but there was evidence that vitamin C may be inversely associated with nuclear, cataracts for persons with other suspected risk factors for nuclear cataracts. Use of vitamin C supplements, particularly of long duration, was recently reported to be associated with a lower prevalence of mild and moderate opacities in a subsample of participants in the Nurses' Health Study (11) . Thus, a protective effect of vitamin C on nuclear lens opacification remains possible.\nHowever, in contrast to the generally inverse relation between nuclear cataracts and vitamin C intake among susceptible persons in this study, findings also suggested that the potentially glycating effect of ascorbic acid (38) may be amplified in the presence of elevated glucose levels. Furthermore, an increased level of particular DNA adducts in people administered high doses of vitamin C supplements indicates that a prooxidant effect of vitamin C may be possible in humans taking vitamin C supplements (39) . The potentially adverse association between the intake of high doses of vitamin C and lens opacification should be investigated further before widespread supplementation is advocated.\nLimitations in our study design may have prevented us from observing stronger or more consistent associations with the antioxidant nutrients considered in this study. For example, the length of time to follow-up may have been too short to detect significant changes in cataract status, especially among the younger participants, who were less likely to reach level 4 or 5 opacity. Future studies of longer duration and with larger sample sizes are needed to further investigate associations between nuclear cataracts and lutein, vitamin C, and vitamin E, particularly among persons with other suspected risk factors for cataracts. Because subgroup analyses in this study were not based on a prior hypothesis, potentially stronger relations with intakes of vitamins E and C in subgroups with other risk factors for cataract need to be evaluated in larger and long term prospective studies.\nIn summary, data from die present short term prospective study are consistent with potentially protective influences of vitamins E and C and lutein on the development of cataract in the lens nucleus. However, strong inverse relations for intake of these nutrients were not observed. Data from longer term prospective studies and from clinical trials currently under way will be useful in further evaluating these associations."}]
