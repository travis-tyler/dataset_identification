[{"section_title": "", "text": "communities\" is, and what \"affordable\" and \"nutritious\" food means (see Ver Ploeg et al. 2009 for further considerations). The concept of food desert as illustrated above links the supply of nutritious food products (and by default, of food outlets providing them) to low-income consumers, and the cost they face in obtaining such products. Although larger stores 2 belonging to organized chains can achieve lower costs by using their efficiency along the supply chain and offer healthier food (i.e., fruit and vegetables) at lower price than smaller, unorganized stores (Hawkes 2008), empirical evidence on whether the presence of larger stores selling healthier products improves consumer diets is mixed. For example, while Rose and Richards (2004) found that ease of supermarket access is associated with increased daily consumption of fruits and vegetables among food stamp recipients, Cummins et al. (2005) found no significant changes in consumption habits after entry of a large-scale food retailer. Although the interaction between the healthfulness of low-income consumer choices and the food environment is complex (Drewnowski and Darmon 2005) the drivers of the supply-side component of food deserts can be inferred using simple economic principles. Bitler and Haider (2011) point out that the existence of areas characterized by limited food access can be rationalized in an economic framework by referring to the interaction of demand and supply drivers. Assuming that nutritious food is a normal good, demand for it will increase with income; thus, demand for stores providing such food will be lower in low-income areas. Also differences in taste (which may be related to educational level, ethnicity, etc\u2026) may lead to varying demand for \"healthy\" foods. The supply-side of the issue, on the other hand, instead relates to the costs of investment and operation facing food outlets in terms of sourcing, sorting and distributing foods. Even under perfect competition (as Bitler and Haider argue), a shrinking demand curve could intersect the long-run average cost of retailing food in its downward-sloping portion, indicating long-run downward sloping supply, i.e., a reduction in the number of stores. However, perfect competition does not apply to modern food retailers, who offer retailing services that cannot be separated from the physical products sold in the stores (Betancourt andGautschi 1988, 1993;Bonanno and Lopez 2009); that is, retail food represents a bundle of differentiated products comprised of the physical product, services, ambience and assortments (Betancourt andGautschi 1990, 1993;Betancourt 2006;Richards and Hamilton 2006;Bonanno and Lopez 2009). Some food retailers invest in fixed cost to increase their overall \"quality\" level, softening price competition to become more attractive to consumers who are less pricesensitive (Bonanno and Lopez 2009); thus fixed costs are endogenously determined (Sutton 1991). 3 The existence of high fixed costs and consumer heterogeneity across markets may lead both firms and consumers to sort according to their features -i.e., costs and preferences -which lead some goods not to be available in all markets (Waldfogel 2008). In sum, these factors, suggest that limited access to nutritious food for low-income consumers may simply be an equilibrium outcome of differentiated product firms (i.e., food retailers) selling their products (i.e., locating their stores) in markets where there is a sizable demand. Such firms will play a multi-stage game while facing consumers who are heterogeneous across markets (i.e., income levels and taste for \"quality\" change across areas but all consumers in the same market are assumed to be identical). In this paper we consider an empirical framework where both demand and supply-side factors determine access to large food outlets (grocery stores with more than 50 employees and Walmart Supercenters). We measure the extent of access via a Limited Access Index (LAI) obtained by dividing the number of large stores in a county by a number of partitions consistent with pre-specified potential area of influence for a store (10 miles radius in rural counties and 0.5 miles in urban ones). Our results suggest that although the role of demand-side factors outweighs supply-side forces in determining lack of access, policy seeking to improve access, especially in areas with more low-income households, needs to consider both aspects."}, {"section_title": "The Model", "text": "What follows describes the strategic game in Ellickson (2006Ellickson ( , 2007, which uses the Endogenous Sunk Cost framework developed by Sutton (Shaked and Sutton 1987;Sutton 1991). Consumers in a given market j are identical and value retail quality (i.e., food retailers represent vertically differentiated goods). Food retailers play a three-stage game: in the first stage both potential entrants and incumbent stores decide whether or not to enter market j (incumbents playing \"Enter\" when they do not exit the market); in the second stage firms that have entered set the level of quality offered to consumers (i.e., assortment and level of service, as in Bonanno and Lopez 2009); in the third stage firms compete \u00e0 la Cournot. Of the two types of stores considered in Ellickson (2006Ellickson ( , 2007 we focus only on those offering \"high quality,\" which are characterized by large assortments and food products likely to be of high quality. Assume symmetric demand and cost, and let the observed number of firms in market j represent a possible equilibrium of this game (Bresnahan and Reiss 1991;Berry 1992); define this equilibrium number of firm as * j N . 4 If, in a given market, none of the potential entrants finds it optimal to play \"enter\" or, in other words \"do not enter\" represents the best response to any of the other players' actions, the equilibrium number of large food retail firms in j is * j N =0; in that case consumers in j will be deprived of access to large food outlets. Ellickson (2007) shows that, for high quality stores, * j N depend on market size, investment costs (in his paper price of land) and the relative costliness of investing in quality to satisfy quality-valuing consumers. He presents three possible scenarios: 1) the equilibrium number of firms increases with market size; 2) the equilibrium number of firms decrease as market size expands (i.e., a market can become saturated), an effect reinforced by increasing investment costs; and 3) if the market size is small, corner solutions are possible where * j N \u22641. This last outcome explains the lack of large stores, at least in some markets. 5 We observe the number of firms in geographic areas (indexed by l =(1,...,L)) which are aggregates of smaller local markets each representing a suitable location for a food retail store. In each area l the number of these markets represents the number of partitions into which l can be broken (i.e., each partition represents a potential market of interest). Let the number of markets in area l be indexed by j l (j=(1,\u2026,J l ), and the number of partition by Mkt l . The average number of (equilibrium) retail firms in a market in l is given by * Entry games usually have multiple equilibria. Sorting firms (facing symmetric demand and cost) by decreasing profitability (i.e., the most profitable firms enter the market first, as in Bresnahan and Reiss 1991;and Berry 1992) the observed number of market participants is one Nash equilibrium of such a game. We abstract from the dynamic aspects of entry games as this is outside the scope of this work (see Jia (2008) for an example). 5 In its empirical application, Ellickson (2006) shows that in the U.S. food retailing industry the second scenario (N * j decreasing with market size) is the most likely to be observed for large stores. He finds that while low-quality, smaller stores have an equilibrium number of firms increasing with market size, higher-quality stores, investing in fixed costs, organize in a natural oligopoly where the equilibrium number of firms does not grow indefinitely with market size. Similar notions apply to other industries where firms commit to a specific location (see for example Asplund and Sandin's (1999)  , jl S being the size of each market j in area l , measured by total income and ln() is the natural log operator (consistent with Ellickson (2006) who indicated that the equilibrium number of high quality firm declines with market size); g D (.) and g C (.) are functions qualifying, respectively, how demand (other than market size) and cost factors affect the equilibrium number of firms; X l is a vector of demand shifters (including also an average measure of the composition of consumers across the j markets in l to account for heterogeneity across areas); C l and K l are vectors of variables capturing, respectively, variable and fixed cost;  Let h = {0,1,2} be one of the three possible outcomes of LAI; assume that g D (.) and g C (.) are linear in variables and parameters and let (1) and \u03b8 = [\u03b1, \u03b1 D , \u03b1 C ] represent its parameters. Then the probability that a given outcome of LAI conditional on both the demand and cost factors is observed is: where \u039b is the logistic CDF, \u03b4 0 = -\u221e, \u03b4 3 = +\u221e (\u03b4 1 and \u03b4 2 represent \"cut-off\" points) so that the vector of coefficients \u03b8 can be estimated via maximum likelihood ordered logit. More details on the estimation method are provided in the next section."}, {"section_title": "Data and Estimation", "text": "We estimate equation 3using seven years (2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006) of observations for 2,876 contiguous U.S. counties, comprised of 20,132 observations. For our definition of access to large food stores, we adopt an approach similar to that in Ver Ploeg et al (2009). The countylevel number of large food retailers is the sum of grocery store establishments (NAICS 44511 > 50 employees) from the County Business Patterns, plus the number of Walmart Supercenters from T.J. Holmes' database (Holmes 2010(Holmes , 2011. Dividing this number by the square miles of land in each county, obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Census Gazetteer of counties (2001) rescaled to account for the potential travel radius to reach a store (Ver Ploeg et al. 2009, box b1), i.e., 10 miles radius in rural counties and 0.5 miles in urban ones (identified via the USDA Rural-Urban continuum codes), we obtain a county-level Limited Access Index. As noted above we include demand and supply side variables that could impact store  With respect to the proxies for fixed cost, the average value of the share of structure cost over the total cost of buildings is higher in \"no access\" areas than the average suggesting that, relatively speaking, building larger stores may be more expensive in these areas. However, the home price index does not show large variations across areas with different LAI. As for the variable costs, while electricity for commercial use is on average cheaper in areas characterized by LAI=2, the price of diesel shows little variation, while unemployment rates are lower. Not surprisingly the quality of the infrastructure is worse in areas characterized by less access (i.e., the number of miles of highways per square mile is lower) while the share of agricultural land is higher. Lastly, the average distance from Benton County in \"no access\" areas is lower, and there also are more areas without corporate income tax, consistent with the fact that 50% of these counties are located in the South. Moving on to an illustration of the estimation method used, as mentioned above, equation 3is estimated via ordered logit. However, the parameters of the ordered logit are constrained to satisfy the proportional odds assumption, which can be restrictive if the independent variables impact the different levels of LAI in a non-proportional way. To relax these restrictions, the model was re-estimated via a constrained generalized ordered-logit which allows, via a backward stepwise selection process, to impose sequential constraints on the estimated coefficients that do not violate the proportional odds property, leaving the other coefficients unconstrained (Long and Freese 2006;Williams 2006). Wald-tests on the estimated parameters did not support the rejection of the null that the parameters jointly satisfy the proportional odds assumption. Data manipulation and estimation were performed in STATA version 11."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Results and Discussion", "text": "The estimated parameters of equation 3, reported in table 2, were obtained using different estimators: ordered logit (first column; OL) constrained generalized ordered logit (second and third columns; CGOL), and a generalized ordered logit (last two columns; GOL). The values of the pseudo R squared show CGOL and GOL outperforming OL; the use of either of the first two estimators leads to very little difference in goodness of fit with values of the pseudo R squared being, respectively, 0.5474 and 0.5478 while the OL has only limited explanatory power. Furthermore, the p-value of a Wald test for the validity of the parallel regression assumption (under the null of the regression curves' slopes being jointly the same) performed on the OL coefficients is 0.000, indicating that the parallel regression assumption is not satisfied. The stepwise sequential process of the CGOL shows that for 19 parameters the parallel regression assumption holds (for these parameters the null of the slopes being the same cannot be rejected: the p-value of the test is 0.8834). Among the variables for which the parallel regression assumption holds (besides fixed-effects parameters, which are excluded for brevity), and which are highlighted in table 2, one has the share of population 14-25 years of age, that of Hispanics, the home price index, the price of electricity for commercial use and the indicator for states without a corporate income tax. Of the coefficients associated with these variables, only one shows considerably differ behavior across CGOL and GOL (the home price index). In sum, we find that the CGOL and GOL outperform the OL and that they are statistically equivalent; therefore, only CGOL average marginal effects of the independent variables on the likelihood that a county shows increasing levels of limited access to large food stores are discussed (Table   3). Before illustrating the average marginal effects, a brief summary of the estimated parameters follows, which overall suggests that demand factors appear to be stronger determinants of limited access than cost factors. In the first place, most of the demand side is related to higher likelihoods of observing limited access, which is a counterintuitive result. Absence of corporate income tax does not affect the probability of observing limited access, while the probability of observing no access seems to be lower in metro areas. The average marginal effects obtained from the coefficients of the CGOL are reported in table 3. We remind the reader that the values in the column \"LAI=0\" represent the average marginal change in the probability of observing a county with adequate access for a marginal change in one of the estimated variables with respect to observing a county characterized by either LAI=1 or LAI =2. The same value, with an opposite sign, will represent a marginal effect on the probability of observing \"no access\" (LAI=2) with respect to that of observing \"adequate access\" (LAI=0). The values under the column \"LAI=1\" and \"LAI=2\" represent, respectively the marginal effects of each of the independent variables on the probability of observing incremental values of the LAI (i.e. the probability of observing LAI=1 instead of LAI=0 and that of observing LAI=2 instead of LAI=1, respectively). Focusing on the demand factor first, one can notice that the natural log of total income has a large and negative average marginal effect on the likelihood of observing counties with some pockets of limited access (LAI=1: -4.5%) and counties with no access (LAI=2; -15.67% compared to LAI=1 and -20.2 % compared to LAI=0), showing that the average size of each local market is one of the strongest determinants of food stores location and, therefore of the probability of observing limited access. Also, a unitary increase in population density leads to very large decreases in the probability of observing counties with no large food stores, i.e. a -272% increase from LAI=1 to LAI=2. However, this effect is reasonable considering that a unitary increase in population density is a 430% increase of this variable. Proportionally, a population density increase of 1% would lead to a 0.63% decrease in the probability of observing a county without access to large food retailers. As this impact is still considerable, it should be noted, once again, from the sample averages in table 1 and from the marginal effect of the \"metro\" indicator below that counties characterized as no access (LAI=2) are mostly non-metro. A unitary increase in SNAP redemption rate leads to an average decrease in the probability of having limited access of -1.55% and that of having a no access are by an additional -1.04%, indicating that the additional demand generated by participation in SNAP can be seen positively by large food stores as a source of potential demand. Differently, a marginal increase in poverty rates increases the likelihood that a county has no access to larger food retailers (by 2.11%: 1.34 for limited access areas plus an additional 0.77% for moving from limited to no access). The estimated average effects of population characteristics on the likelihood of observing areas with limited and no access show interesting patterns. With respect to the age groups, we find that while a unitary increase in the share of population in the 15-24 age group is associated with an a higher likelihood of observing limited access, it is also associated with a decrease in the likelihood of observing no access (-1.25%). Unitary increases in the share of population 25-64 years of age and 65 years of age have negative and statistically significant marginal effects on the probability of observing areas with limited access and with no access, the former showing smaller effects than the latter (share of population 25-64: -0.71% for LAI=1; -0.26% for LAI=2; share of population over 65: -0.8% for LAI=1; -0.67% for LAI=2). Also, we find little evidence that a marginal change in the share of population being black would impact in any substantial way the probability of observing areas with limited or no access; a similar effect, showing mall magnitude is found for the share of population being Hispanic although in these case the estimated marginal effects are statistically significant. The impact of the cost factors on the probabilities of observing counties with limited/no access areas shows less clear patterns than the demand determinants; in some cases, these variables seem to impact negatively the probability of observing counties with no access to large food retailers. This indicates that while cost factors may contribute to observe areas where no firm finds it profitable to enter, they are less relevant in discouraging entry of at least some firms. Walmart SCs, this can be explained by the hub-and-spoke logistic system. This means that more stores will be located closer to distribution systems which are more distant from BC both temporally and spatially. Lastly, absence of corporate taxes has no impact on the level of access, and metro counties appear to be 83% less likely to show no access than to contain areas with limited access (probably because of the higher population density attracting large food stores). As the official definition of food deserts in the U.S. focuses on areas \"[\u2026] composed of lower-income neighborhoods\", we re-estimated equation 3 slopes for these variables is 0.9912). Two of these 23 variables are the same as those in the full sample, the share of population 14-25 years of age, and the states without a corporate income tax. Further, the share of black population replaces the share of population that is Hispanic, and the distance from Benton County also satisfies the proportional odds assumption. The pattern of the average marginal effects presented in table 4 are mostly consistent with those illustrated above, although in some cases their values show different magnitude than those in table 3; the most significant differences are discussed below. A unitary change in the log of total income (market size) shows no statistically significant effect on the likelihood of observing limited access areas, but it shows a negative impact on that of observing \"no access\", its magnitude being 50% larger than that measured in the full sample. Also, although the average marginal effect of the SNAP participation ratio is similar to that discussed above, its impact is larger on the likelihood of observing \"LAI=1\" than on observing areas with \"no access\" (30% smaller). A similar pattern is observed for the average marginal effect of poverty rate. These results indicate that one of the most important discouraging factor for store location, especially in low-income areas, is the lack of market potential, and that even if additional demand from SNAP participants may work as a stimulating factor, it is less relevant in areas where poverty rates are higher. Both ethnic and age composition of the population show similar or smaller average effects than those measured in the full sample (with the exclusion of the share of population between 15-64 years of age). Also, the average marginal effects of the fixed cost variables are larger than those obtained using the full sample: in particular, the home price index shows a positive and significant impact on the likelihood of observing no access; this indicates that cost drivers may become more important for retailers once they consider the \"riskier\" decision of locating in areas with higher poverty rates. Similarly, higher price of diesel seems to result in a higher likelihood of observing counties characterized by limited access. The other variables show the same behavior they did in the full sample."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "Using the result provided by Ellickson (2006Ellickson ( , 2007 that modeling food retailers as players of a game where the cost of delivering quality is endogenous (Shaked and Sutton 1987;Sutton 1991) could lead to areas with limited number of large food stores, we offer an empirical framework to test the determinants of access to food stores in local markets inside counties. We assess the probability of local markets to have full, limited and no access to the \"high quality\" type of food stores, considering both supply and demand factors to show how limited access can be an equilibrium outcome of market forces. We find a clear and consistent path for demand side factors as determining food access within local markets inside counties, where market size especially (both in terms of total income and the additional demand from low-income individuals accessing SNAP) explaining a portion of the location of large food stores. Also, we find that large food stores avoid areas with higher levels of poverty, and although age composition matters for the likelihood of observing limited access, ethnic composition matters less; this is important because it suggests that studies showing a particular ethnic profile in areas characterized by low food access may be observing spuriously correlated phenomena. However we do find that the share of Hispanic is related to lower levels of large store access, although the effect is very small; this is probably due to higher demand for ethnic foods in these communities, which tend to be supplied through smaller outlets. With respect to the cost factors our results are not as clear, although they show that some cost determinants, such as the share of the cost of buildings coming from structures, home price index (more for a sample of counties with high poverty rates), and ease of recruiting labor play a role in the probability of observing areas with no access. Surprisingly, we find that a favorable tax regime for businesses has no impact on easing lack of access. Our analysis confirms that the problem of \"food deserts\" arises fundamentally due to a lack of consumer purchasing power and market demand. Simply, if the (fixed) costs of store operations are not covered by the demand that exists in a particular community, food stores will cease to operate. As for public policy intervention, it turns out that one federal program is already playing a key role in attenuating the problem of food access: the SNAP program, although its role is less marked if one restricts the analysis to counties with poverty rates above the average. Other potential policy levers (e.g., tax breaks on diesel fuel), and corporate taxes in particular, appear to play less of a role according to our results. Lowering the cost of capital investments (perhaps via grants or low-interest loans, though programs similar to the Fresh Food Financing Initiative in Pennsylvania), could result useful in areas with higher poverty rates, however, the results are mixed. Somewhat surprisingly, building more roads to enhance access would have exactly the opposite effect. Perhaps most paradoxical is the finding with respect to agricultural land shares (associated with less access even after controlling for other factors). In part this shows the great disconnect that now exists between food production and consumption. An opportunity may exist for raising awareness among food system participants of this disconnect, and subsequently relocalizing or re-regionalizing the food system to assure greater food access. However, whether such a regionalization would result in a well-functioning food system with greater access, or not, is an empirical question yet to be answered.  "}]
