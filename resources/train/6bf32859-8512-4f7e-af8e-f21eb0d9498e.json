[{"section_title": "", "text": "vision or hearing, and asthma. Kindergarten students with serious health problems tend to lag behind in social and emotional development or cognitive achievement (Wertheimer et al., 2003). Children with developmental problems are also more likely to miss school and be less involved in school and community activities, such as sports or clubs (Blanchard, Gurka, and Blackman, 2006). Through its influence on initial school readiness and involvement, early childhood health sets the stage for future educational attainment, and, consequently, racial and ethnic disparities in early childhood health may influence future racial and ethnic socioeconomic stratification. In this study we examine chronic health conditions in a cohort of Mexican American children of preschool age, in comparison to other racial and ethnic groups. The purpose of the study is to further our understanding of how the demographic, social, and behavioral characteristics of Mexican American mothers, which are linked to their infants' relatively healthy birth outcomes, influence the subsequent health outcomes of their children. Specifically, we investigate whether the health advantage in terms of a low rate of low birth weight in this population is also evident for chronic health conditions observed beyond infancy. Does the epidemiological paradox apply to other health indicators manifested in early childhood? And do prenatal factors play the same protective role for chronic health conditions as they do for birth weight in this population?"}, {"section_title": "Protective Factors Linked to Healthy Birth Outcomes in Mexican American", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Children", "text": "Extensive research has shown that birth outcomes among children born to Mexican American women parallel those of children of non-Hispanic white mothers, in spite of less favorable socioeconomic characteristics and poor rates of prenatal care use (Frisbie, Forbes and Hummer, 1998;Markides and Coreil 1986). Termed the \"epidemiological paradox\" and evident in findings regarding infant mortality and low birth weight, this pattern continues to the present day (Hummer et al., 2007;Reichman et al., 2008). The phenomenon of the epidemiological paradox has been extensively studied, with a focus on the protective factors considered to explain healthy birth outcomes in the Mexican American population. The protective factors can be categorized into healthy behaviors, social support, and immigrant selectivity."}, {"section_title": "Healthy Behaviors", "text": "Cultural practices are considered to play a key role in protective maternal life style decisions during pregnancy among Mexican American women (National Research Council and Institute of Medicine, 2004). Hispanics have more nutritious diets and engage in less risky behavior during pregnancy than do non-Hispanic whites (Balcazar, Peterson, and Cobas, 1996;Guendelman and Abrams 1995). Low maternal substance use, including alcohol, tobacco, and drug consumption, is also associated with positive birth outcomes among Mexican American children (Reichman et al., 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Social Support", "text": "Another explanation of the epidemiological paradox often associated with Mexican American cultural background involves strong kin and family support systems (Guendelman, 1998). Family support may be related to lower stress during pregnancy and better access to pregnancy-related information and psychosocial health (Guendelman, 2000). Although few data sets contain the richness needed to capture the complexity and nuances of social support and its effects on health, some research points to the importance of parental relationships for positive birth outcomes among Hispanics, along with grandparent and extended family influences (Albrecht, Miller, and Clarke, 1994). Albrecht and co-authors (1994) found that whether within a marital union or not, Hispanic households in which parents cohabit have lower risks of adverse birth outcomes relative to both non-cohabiting parental and extended family households. Religiosity is considered another important aspect of social support. Indeed, religious involvement has been hypothesized to have positive impacts on maternal health behaviors among Mexican Americans due to reduced stress and increased social support from other members of religious congregations (Maga\u00f1a and Clark, 1995)."}, {"section_title": "Immigrant Selectivity", "text": "Among the Mexican American population, immigrant mothers have better birth outcomes than do their U.S.-born counterparts. Beyond the maternal behavioral and social support differences that have been invoked to explain this nativity difference, the positive health selection of Mexican origin (and other origin) immigrants may also be very important (Palloni and Morenoff, 2001). Health selection bias refers to the premise that people who immigrate may be the healthiest subset of potential migrants. Indeed, recent studies (Hummer et al., 2007;Landale, Oropesa, and Gorman, 1999) that include Hispanic and Asian sub-populations, along with non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks, demonstrate that for all U.S. race/ethnic groups that have been studied, immigrants have more positive birth outcomes than do their native-born counterparts. Thus, health selection may help explain the positive birth outcomes of Mexican American children given the group's significant composition of immigrants. The effect of immigrant selectivity is reversed in future generations, who converge to health status patterns observed in the general population (Antecol and Bedard, 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Chronic Health Conditions in Mexican American Children", "text": "Relative to infant health outcomes, less is known about the determinants of early childhood health in Mexican American children. However, according to national estimates, Mexican American children experience relatively low rates of chronic health conditions compared to non-Hispanic whites, a pattern that has been consistently evident in cross-sectional surveys of this population. Using the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) collected from 1982 to 1984, Mendoza (1994) found that Mexican American children had rates of congenital anomalies, growth patterns, mental retardation, speech problems, and chronic medical conditions (including asthma) similar to non-Hispanic whites. Moreover, based on analyses using 1988-1994 NHANES III data, Kamal and colleagues (2005) showed that among Mexican Americans, Mexico-born children had significantly lower rates of chronic health problems than did their U.S.-born counterparts. More recent analyses by the National Center for Health Statistics (Avila and Blumberg, 2008) based on surveys conducted in 2003 to 2006 suggest that children of Hispanic immigrants are at an even greater advantage than subsequent generations in terms of chronic and developmental health problems. Studies focusing on asthma similarly reveal that Mexican American children have the lowest rates relative to non-Hispanic black and white children and relative to Puerto Ricans (Lara et al., 2006). These data suggest that the paradox may persist into childhood, but there is little research on the factors explaining the mechanisms behind health outcomes among children of immigrants or longitudinal studies that track child health from birth to early childhood. Specifically, do maternal healthy lifestyle practices and social support factors confer the same health and development advantages to their children beyond low birth weight? Are the children of immigrants protected by their mothers' selectively good health? Or are the low rates of adverse health conditions found among children of Mexican immigrants explained by their limited access to health care and, thus, lower probabilities of diagnoses? In this study we observe a cohort of children at two points in time, at birth and at age 5. We analyze a range of prenatal maternal risk factors for child health outcomes, including mother's health behaviors, social support, and socioeconomic characteristics, while taking into account health care access during early childhood."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": "Data are drawn from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, an ongoing, national, longitudinal birth cohort survey conducted through a collaboration of Princeton University's Center for Research on Child Wellbeing and the Center for Health and Wellbeing, the Columbia Population Research Center, and the National Center for Children and Families at Columbia University (http://www.fragilefamilies.princeton.edu/). The Fragile Families sample is made up of 4,898 infants born between 1998 and 2000 and their parents drawn from a stratified sample of twenty U.S. cities of 200,000 or more (Reichman et al., 2001). Data were obtained from mothers at the time of the child's birth while in the hospital (baseline), as well at 1, 3, and 5 years following the birth, using both in-home and telephone interviews. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish according to the respondent's preference. The survey oversampled unmarried parents for a total of 75 percent unmarried and 25 percent married families. The Fragile Families data are well suited to this study for several reasons. One is that because the project oversampled unmarried parents in urban settings, the data include a relatively large sample of Mexican American infants born to both U.S. and Mexican born mothers. Our analytic sample of 5-year-old Mexican American children from Fragile Families (n=390) is larger than the comparative sample of Mexican American 5-year-old children from the NHANES 1999-2006 data files (n=244), based on our analysis of those data. The second is that it is possible to observe the health of these children at birth and again at age 5, allowing us to explore the role of prenatal maternal characteristics on the development of chronic conditions. Moreover, the data include a wealth of information about the social and economic environment in which these children are growing up. Our analytic sample includes 2,819 children who were interviewed at the 5-year in-home follow-up interview. Of the 4,898 births initially included in the sample, 3,024 (62%) children and their mothers were interviewed at the 5-year in-home follow-up interview. We excluded an additional 60 children who were part of a multiple (twin) birth because their health at birth is not comparable to singleton births. We also omitted 101 children whose mothers did not identify as Hispanic or as non-Hispanic white or black because this group was too small and heterogeneous to analyze. Finally, we excluded 44 cases with missing values on one or more of our covariates. The remaining analytic sample did not differ significantly from the original baseline Fragile Families sample in terms of education or poverty status. However, the mothers in the analysis were more likely to be US-born (88 vs. 76%) and less likely to be married (22 vs. 27%). We did not use sample weights because none are available for the 5-year in-home follow-up interview. We limit our sample to children whose mothers identified as either Mexican American, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or other Hispanic, and who were not missing information on our analysis variables. This includes 390 children born to Mexican American mothers, 613 to non-Hispanic white mothers, 1,483 to non-Hispanic black mothers, and 343 to other Hispanic mothers. Of the Mexican American children, 171 were born to foreignborn mothers (i.e., the children are second-generation) and 219 were born to U.S.-born mothers (i.e., the children are third-generation and higher). Because the Fragile Families sample was drawn from U.S. hospitals, all of the children in this study are U.S. Health measures in the Fragile Families correspond to those used in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and other related surveys and are reported by the mother at the five-year in-home interview (Filippone and Knab, 2005). Based on the criterion used by the NHIS, chronic health conditions are conditions that limit usual daily activities (Perrin, Bloom, and Gortmaker, 2007). They include whether a doctor or other health professional ever told the mother that the child has any of the following conditions: mental retardation or developmental delay, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, autism, sickle cell anemia, congenital heart disease or other heart condition, total or partial blindness, total or partial deafness, problems with limbs, or asthma. In this paper, children are coded as having a chronic health condition if the mother reports they have one or more of the included conditions (van der Lee et al., 2007). Because asthma is the most common chronic health condition in children (Agency for Healthcare Research, 2002) and is arguably more environmentally based than the other chronic health conditions, we also analyze asthma separately. We use Stata (Version 9) to conduct our analysis. We use multivariate, logistic regression methods to estimate the odds of chronic health conditions by race/ethnicity of the child, controlling for various maternal social and demographic measures. Two indicators measure socioeconomic status at birth: poverty status (<100%, 100-300% and >300%, based on mother's reports of household income and family size) and mother's completed education (some college or higher, high school/GED, less than high school). We include various indicators of maternal health behaviors and social support. Maternal health behaviors are measured as dummy variables to indicate whether the mother smoked, drank alcohol, and used drugs during pregnancy, based on maternal reports at birth. We include three measures of social support. Parental relationship status is measured as married, cohabiting (but not married), or other at birth. The \"other\" category includes divorced, widowed, or separated parents, as well as situations where the father is unknown, categories that were too small to separate out. A second measure is whether the mother reports that there is someone from whom she can count on a loan of $1000. We also include whether the mother reports that she attends religious services once or more times a week, less than once a week, or never. We include controls for health care and low birth weight. Because the chronic conditions analyzed in this study are doctor-diagnosed, contact with the health care system will affect the likelihood that they are detected. Two indicators measure access to health care: whether the child was uninsured (did not have public or private insurance) at least at two of the survey waves when the child was 1, 3, or 5 years old and whether the child saw a doctor for a regular (non-illness or injury) visit in the past year. In addition, we include a dummy variable for low birth weight (<2500 grams, as reported by mothers in the baseline survey). Studies have shown that children born low birth weight are at increased risk for chronic health conditions (Stein, Siegel and Bauman, 2006) and asthma in particular (Nepomnyaschy and Reichman, 2006). Table 1 shows the sample distributions of low birth weight and chronic health conditions at age 5 by race, ethnicity, and nativity. The rate of low birth weight is lowest among Mexican American children, at 4.8 percent and 6.0 percent of children of immigrant and U.S. born parents, respectively. The rate of low birth weight is higher, at around 8 percent of non-Hispanic white and other Hispanic children, and highest among non-Hispanic black children, at 13.7 percent. The very low rate of low birth weight among Mexican American children in this sample is consistent with other analyses of Fragile Families data (Reichman et al., 2008). The general pattern of relatively low rates of low birth weight among Mexican American infants compared to non-Hispanic black and white infants is consistent with past studies investigating the epidemiological paradox. Table 1 also shows that, in addition to the lowest rate of low birth weight, children of Mexican immigrants have a significantly lower rate of chronic conditions, at 12.7 percent, compared to 17.2 percent of non-Hispanic white children and over 26 percent of black, other Hispanic, and Mexican American children of U.S.-born parents. Children of Mexican immigrants also have the lowest rate of asthma alone -fewer than one in ten have asthma, a rate similar to non-Hispanic white children and much lower than the one in five Mexican American children of U.S.-born mothers, other Hispanic, and non-Hispanic black children whose mothers report they have asthma. These descriptive patterns found in our sample suggest that the epidemiological paradox of relatively good infant birth outcomes among Mexican American children extend into childhood for children of immigrants, but not children of U.S.-born mothers, at least in terms of mother-reported, doctor diagnosed chronic conditions. Table 2 by race, ethnicity, and nativity. Despite the overall disadvantage of this sample, there is statistically significant variation by race/ethnicity. In particular, foreign-born Mexican American mothers are especially disadvantaged, with more than two-thirds not completing high school. Only one in ten Mexican immigrant mothers live in households that are three or more times above the poverty line, compared to nearly half of all white mothers in this sample. Nearly ten percent of children of Mexican immigrants were uninsured two or more waves, and 20 percent did not see a doctor for regular care in their fifth year of life. By comparison, only three percent of non-Hispanic black children were uninsured at two or more waves and two percent had not seen a doctor for regular care in their fifth year of life. Differences by race, ethnicity, and nativity are statistically significant for all variables, except late or prenatal care."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The distribution of predictor variables included in the analysis is presented in", "text": "While foreign-born Mexican American mothers are clearly socioeconomically disadvantaged relative to the other mothers in this sample, as a group they are characterized by healthy behaviors and high levels of social support. Table 2 shows that foreign-born Mexican American mothers are least likely to have used tobacco, alcohol, or drugs during pregnancy. Three-fourths were married or cohabitating with the focal child's biological father at birth, and they were the most likely to attend religious services weekly. These patterns are consistent with explanations for the paradox -namely that the good health outcomes of children of immigrants could be explained by their mothers' healthy behaviors and social support. Table 3 shows the results of logistic regression equations predicting the odds of chronic health conditions and asthma only at age 5. Despite the consistency of the descriptive patterns in Tables 2 with explanations of the paradox, it is immediately apparent from the top panel of odds ratios that the models do not explain racial and ethnic differences in health -neither the paradoxically low rates of chronic conditions and asthma among children of Mexican immigrants nor the much higher rates among children of U.S.-born Mexican American, other Hispanic, or non-Hispanic black mothers. Net of the socioeconomic characteristics, maternal health behaviors, social support, and child birth outcomes and health care as measured here, the odds of chronic conditions and asthma are statistically equivalent for children of Mexican immigrants and non-Hispanic whites. For the other groups, including children of US-born Mexican origin mothers, the odds of chronic conditions are between 40 and 65 percent higher and the odds of asthma are 77 percent to 2.5 times higher than they are for non-Hispanic white children. These odds ratios are relatively unchanged from bivariate models (results not shown). Compared to children whose biological parents were married at birth, those whose parents were cohabiting or in other (non-marital, non-cohabiting) relationships are at an increased risk of chronic conditions and asthma at age 5. This risk associated with non-married parents, especially non-cohabiting parents, persists across all health outcomes in this study, suggesting the importance of family structure for young child well being. Contrary to what we expected, social support associated with mother's regular religious attendance during pregnancy does not decrease the odds that her child would exhibit a chronic health condition in early childhood. Our findings show that increased attendance increases the likelihood of chronic health problems. Children born low birth weight have greater odds of chronic health problems at age 5. As expected, children who were uninsured two or more years between the ages of 1 and 5 were less likely to have identified chronic health conditions. On the other hand, the association between regular doctor's visits in the past year and chronic conditions was not statistically significant. Insofar as these models adjust for unequal access to health care, based on our measures of health insurance coverage and whether the child saw a doctor for regular care in the past year, the low rate of chronic conditions among children of Mexican immigrants is not an issue of underdiagnosis."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Our study was motivated by the scarcity of research on whether the health advantage of Mexican American children at birth persists through the preschool years. Although national health indicators reveal a pattern of good health in young Mexican American children relative to other racial and ethnic groups, little is known about the extent to which maternal factors that promote healthy birth weight explain other measures of early childhood health. We approached this question by analyzing differences in chronic health conditions in a cohort of preschool children and determining the effects of prenatal maternal risk and protective factors, while controlling for access to health care in early childhood. Consistent with previous research, multivariate analyses of an urban sample of children revealed no significant differences in health outcomes at age 5 between children of Mexican immigrant mothers and non-Hispanic white children, a pattern that is unexplained by differential access to and utilization of health care. In other words, the lower rates of chronic health conditions among children of Mexican immigrants are not the result of their not being diagnosed by health professionals. In contrast, children of U.S.-born Mexican origin mothers do not fare as well: they are over fifty percent more likely to be diagnosed with at least one health condition and twice as likely to be diagnosed with asthma relative to non-Hispanic white children. We wanted to know whether protective factors associated with healthy birth weight account for chronic health conditions which emerge in early childhood. We focused on the set of factors that the literature has shown help explain the healthy birth outcomes of Mexican American children: prenatal maternal health behaviors and social support, and immigrant selectivity. We found no relationship between mother's health behaviors during pregnancy (tobacco, drug, or alcohol use) and chronic health problems or asthma. Greater access to social support during pregnancy plays a role, albeit modest, in the health outcomes of children at age 5. Children born to mothers who were married were less likely to be diagnosed with a chronic health problem or asthma by age 5 than were children whose mothers were cohabiting or not living with the father. Contrary to what we expected, however, mother's regular religious attendance was not associated with better health for their children. Thus, our findings suggest that positive health outcomes in early childhood may reflect the positive health selection of Mexican origin immigrant mothers. That is, as a result of health selection, immigrant mothers are healthier and healthier mothers are likely to have healthier children. By the third generation, however, the health patterns of these children deteriorate, reflecting patterns of generational unhealthy assimilation observed in the general population (Antecol and Bedard, 2006). While we find that children of Mexican immigrants have low rates of chronic health conditions, there is little question that the health of this population is jeopardized by other health problems. According to data from the 1999-2000 NHANES, Mexican American children even at preschool age are more likely to be overweight and obese (Ogden et al., 2002), which may lead to diabetes and cardiovascular diseases later in life. Preschool Mexican American children also tend to have poorer developmental outcomes, as measured by cognitive indicators, relative to non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black children, based on analyses of 1986-1996 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Child Data (Padilla et. al., 2002). Mother's education, poverty and immigrant status explain a significant portion of the disadvantage. Other research indicates that, overall, Hispanic children between the ages of 1 and 12 years are at increased risk in comparison to non-Hispanic white children on a number of indicators. For example, immunization coverage is lower, while the risks for infectious diseases, lead poisoning, oral health problems, and unintentional injuries are higher (Guendelman 1998;Guendelman, English and Chavez, 1995). Moreover, the generational health advantage seen among Mexican American immigrant mothers is not consistent across pregnancy outcomes. Although they have a lower likelihood of low birth weight, their rates of miscarriage are not significantly different from subsequent generations (Guendelman et al., 1990). Furthermore, the apparent healthy start of children of Mexican immigrants may be compromised at a critical time of their development due to poor access to health care, thus potentially negatively affecting future wellbeing. In addition to very high rates of poverty, Mexican Americans have the lowest rates of insurance coverage (Flores et al., 1999), with children of immigrants disproportionately affected (Dinan, 2005;Hamilton et al. 2006). As a result, they are less likely to have physician contact or a usual source of health care compared to non-Hispanic whites and blacks. Another factor that puts these children at risk is the mixed legal status of their families. Analyses of the 2001 Current Population Survey showed that in Latino families in which at least one parent is not a citizen, children are less likely to have any type of health insurance (Ojeda and Brown, 2005). At the same time, noncitizen parents are least likely to be aware of health and community resources available to low income families, according to a recent study based on data from the 1999 National Survey of America's Families (Yu et al., 2005). Our study has several important limitations. The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study which we used is a sample of mostly disadvantaged, unmarried, urban families. We show, however, that even though there is an oversample of unmarried families, non-Hispanic whites are still more advantaged than the Mexican groups, especially immigrants, in terms of income, education, and access to health care, and that the patterns in child health outcomes persist when we control for SES and marital status in the regression models. Furthermore, the subsample of Mexican American children is relatively small and does not include immigrant children, but is limited to U.S.-born children. Attrition in the foreign-born sample of mothers between the time of the child's birth and the child's fifth birthday is disproportionately higher than it is for other groups. The effects of attrition in immigrant samples are problematic for various reasons, including the possibility of return migration among the more disadvantaged. Finally, the types of childhood health outcomes examined in this study are limited to chronic health conditions, which are closely tied to low birth weight and thus may reflect initial birth outcomes. An in-depth study of the factors associated with healthy outcomes among children of Mexican immigrants, found in this and past studies, is necessary to understand the mechanisms underlying these findings. The significance for both policy and scholarship of this research is critical, given the longterm effects of children's health and development for their success in school and their subsequent socioeconomic attainment. Although it is clear based on the literature brought together for this study that important work is being carried out indicative of the factors influencing Mexican American early childhood health, the state of the art on this issue is currently fragmented and incomplete. Analyses of emerging data sets containing large samples of Mexican Americans, such as the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K), will help us build an integrated research agenda on the social determinants of Mexican American early childhood health. The resulting body of knowledge can provide the basis for comprehensive policy recommendations to improve the life chances of Mexican American children.   "}]
