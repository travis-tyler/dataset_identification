Baled corn residue, supplemented with corn grain ethanol by-products (wet or dry distiller's grains), is increasing in feedlot and backgrounding rations (Klopfenstein et al., 2013) . Grazing and harvesting corn residues are considered to be widely practiced in the western Corn Belt (Sulc and Franzluebbers, 2014) . However, limited information is available as to the extent to which US producers have used this resource.\nThere are multiple advantages to utilizing corn residue, including managing residue quantity in high-production fields, supplemental revenue, and a simple, cost-effective method of integrating crop-livestock systems. Improved corn hybrids and management practices have increased US corn grain yields by 50% since the early 1980s with an equivalent increase in nongrain biomass (USDA-NASS, 2016) . Producers who use continuous corn rotations can have high residue accumulation especially under conservation tillage practices. Partial corn residue removal can ameliorate potential yield reductions where high residue accumulation can interfere with planting operations, uniform stand emergence, and increased disease incidence on reduced tillage and continuous corn fields (Sindelar et al., 2013; Verma et al., 2005) . A 3-yr rotation of corn-corn-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is widespread in the US Corn Belt, particularly in central Nebraska, northern Iowa, and northern Illinois (Sindelar et al., 2015) .

The 2010 ARMS corn survey was collected in 19 states ( Fig. 1A ) that represent 93% of planted corn acreage in the United States. The ARMS corn survey has three phases: ARMS I-screening to determine a farm's operating status and whether a producer grew corn in 2010; ARMS II-data collection on acreage, production practices, input use, and costs related to a randomly selected corn field within the previously identified farms; and ARMS III-collected data on whole farm finance and operation characteristics for a calendar year. A probability-weighting method is applied to the ARMS II survey so that the sum of the surveyed corn fields across farms equals the corn acres planted reported by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. Data from the ARMS II survey were from 2250 corn producers located in the 19 surveyed states (Foreman, 2014) . In 2010, questions addressing corn residue management were included in the ARMS II corn production practices and costs report survey (pp. 7-8; questions 22-25) field characteristics section (USDA, 2010) . Specific questions on corn residue harvest or grazing included the following:\n\u2022 Were the stalks/stover harvested from the field?\n\u2022 How many acres of corn stalks/stover were harvested from this corn field? \u2022 Did any livestock graze this corn field after harvest of the 2010 corn crop? \u2022 What type of livestock-cattle (Bos taurus), sheep (Ovis aries), or other-grazed this corn field after harvest of the 2010 corn crop? For each question, multiple subquestions were asked to provide more detailed reasons for not harvesting corn residue, harvested residue amounts, number of livestock grazed, and so on. Summarized results are reported here, with a general discussion on current and future research needs."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Eighty-three percent of corn residue utilization occurred by grazing (4.06 million ha), and 17% of corn residues was harvested and baled (0.81 million ha). Corn residue that was grazed after harvest represented 12% of the total corn acreage (33.07 million ha) across the 19 states but was largely skewed to the western Corn Belt Region. Four states (Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, and South Dakota) had residue utilization rates >20%, while Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, and North Carolina had residue utilization rates of 10 to 20% of total corn acres (Fig. 1A) . States in the Northeast and eastern Corn Belt had the lowest corn residue utilization rates surveyed (<5%) (Fig. 1A) . Nebraska had the highest total of corn residue grazing at 1.91 million ha, followed by Iowa (385,000 ha), South Dakota (361,000 ha), and Kansas (344,000 ha) ( Table 1) . Both Nebraska and Colorado had significant corn residue utilization, with approximately 52 and 56% of their total corn acres being grazed (2.2 million ha) and, to a lesser extent, mechanically harvested (48,000 ha). Average grazing days from surveyed states ranged from 10 to 73 d (mean = 40 d). Total reported number of livestock grazing corn residues was 11.7 million, with 94% of the total comprising cattle.\nCorn residue harvests primarily occurred in the central and northern Corn Belt (Table 1) . Iowa was first in mechanically harvested residue at approximately 224,000 ha, followed by Minnesota (108,000 ha) and Wisconsin (94,000 ha). These three states represented 52% of the total corn residue area that was harvested in 2010. An estimated 2.9 Tg of corn residue was harvested across the surveyed states, with a weighted harvest average of 3.6 Mg ha -1 . Producers' responses indicated that partially harvesting sections of a field is a common practice; with 1.6 million ha of corn fields designated for corn residue harvest, approximately 0.8 million ha was harvested.\nCorn residue harvest occurred on approximately 2% of the total corn acreage across the 19 states.\nThe majority of producers indicated the reasons not to graze or harvest corn residue as primarily a lack of market or leaving on the field to supply organic matter to soils. Survey results also indicated regional differences in overall reasons to utilize corn residue or not (Fig. 1B) . Producers in the South answered a lack of market or use (45%) for corn residue. Producers in the East answered leaving the corn residue for organic matter (55%). Responses from producers in the central United States were more evenly distributed, but the majority answered leaving on field as organic matter (30%) as the primary use of corn residue."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The USDA Economic Research Service survey responses to corn residue utilization show similar results to other regional and state-level surveys (Mueller et al., 2012; Ulmer et al., 2016) . In a separate 2010 survey, 58% of corn producers (n = 116) in the western Corn Belt (western two-thirds of Nebraska and Kansas) reported using corn residue either through grazing or mechanical harvests, and an estimated 1.4 million ha of corn residue was grazed in the western twothirds of Nebraska (Mueller et al., 2012) . A 2015 University of Nebraska survey indicated that 52% of Nebraska corn producers (n = 130) allowed corn residue grazing on their fields, while 37% of respondents primarily cited soil compaction, inconvenience, or a lack of demand as reasons for not allowing corn residue grazing (Ulmer et al., 2016) . Existing research on soil compaction has generally shown minimal effects by livestock grazing corn residue when following recommended management practices (Clark et al., 2004; Maughan et al., 2009; Shaver et al., 2014) . Impacts on grain yield were not considered to be a major factor by Nebraska corn producers (Ulmer et al., 2016) , which is in agreement with field research that soybean and corn yields following cattle grazing corn residues are similar to nongrazed treatments (Clark et al., 2004; Drewnoski et al., 2016; Stalker et al., 2015; Wilson et al., 2004) .\nA major research gap in integrated crop-livestock research was the extent to which corn residues were used by livestock in the United States. Survey results highlight the importance of corn residue and relative integration with the US cattle industry. Unfortunately, we cannot distinguish between beef cattle and dairy cattle from the survey, but grazing by beef cattle was likely predominant in the western Corn Belt, and residue harvesting was likely predominant for dairy cattle as bedding in the north-central Corn Belt region (e.g., Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin). We speculate that corn residue grazing is relatively stable particularly in the western Corn Belt, but it is unclear if corn residue harvest has increased in the past decade. The level of residue harvest variability over time is also unclear. We further assume that corn residue harvests in 2010 were not used as a bioenergy feedstock because no commercial-scale cellulosic bioenergy facilities were operational at that time. As a result, corn residue utilization by livestock should be considered when determining corn residue availability for bioenergy (Langholtz et al., 2016). In addition, within the 2016 Billion Ton Report, 50% of corn residue feedstocks are estimated to be operationally available in the near-term and increase to 90% of available residue yield by 2040 (Langholtz et al., 2016) . The USDA Economic Research Service survey results suggest that producer willingness to utilize corn residues is currently below these estimates. Considerable research has been conducted on corn residue harvest effects related to soil quality, soil fertility, grain yield, and greenhouse gas emissions over the past decade (Karlen and Johnson, 2014; Mitchell et al., 2016) . Research on corn residue grazing, however, is limited even though significantly more corn residue acres are grazed by livestock than harvested and baled. Further research is needed on (i) how corn residues can be profitably incorporated into regional integrated crop-livestock systems, (ii) the longterm effects of corn residue grazing on soil property changes and crop yields, and (iii) understanding the socioeconomic factors affecting corn producers' willingness or reluctance to utilize corn residues."}]
