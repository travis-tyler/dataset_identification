[{"section_title": "", "text": "underlying causes. Several pioneering datasets of surface temperature and other variables were produced and analyzed, at very considerable effort, and on limited budgets. These datasets are largely fit for the purpose of identifying long-term changes over large scales, as evidenced, for instance, by extensive use in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports. However, they do not meet all of the twenty-first-century requirements.\nObservational datasets are now expected by society to provide robust, traceably documented information about our changing climate at much finer spatial and temporal scales than ever before. This observational evidence underpins all aspects of climate change science and emergent climate services. Better characterization of, for example, regional changes, changes in extremes, and the role of natural variability is needed. Products at finer time scales (daily or shorter) and greater spatial density than many existing global data products, including the commonly cited long-term Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) surface temperature analysis (GISTEMP; http://data.giss. nasa.gov/gistemp/), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-National Climatic Data Center (NCDC; see www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cmbfaq/anomalies.php) data, and Hadley Centre Climatic Research Unit temperature anomaly (HadCRUT; see www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/info/warming/) estimates, with well-understood uncertainties, are required. Monitoring in near-real time, drawing upon multiple methodologically independent products, would also help underpin robust advice and give historical perspective, as extreme events such as the summer 2010 Moscow heat wave unfold and phenomena such as ENSO develop.\nDecision making in response to climate change and variability requires confidence in each climate product/service. This means giving careful attention to the more mundane but essential aspects, such as the use of metadata (data about the data), measurement uncertainty, provenance of data and data products, version control, and benchmarking (i.e., assessing against a reference) of methodological performance. Critically, we should also quantify and provide advice to users as to the suitability of the data for a given application; requirements could range from hourly observations at a single location to global mean changes on the time scale of centuries. Data applications will include optimal decision making (e.g., deriving building specifications, health capacity planning, land use management, flood defenses). Products will have distinct uncertainties whose nature-systematic or random-may have different influences. Hence, there can be no \"one size fits all\" solution and a renewed, vigorous effort at creating, comparing, and assessing multiple independently derived data products is needed from a truly comprehensive and publicly available data bank of the \"raw\" data."}, {"section_title": "THE MEETING.", "text": "The Met Office, on behalf of the U.K. government, proposed such an effort to the fifteenth session of the World Meteorological Organization Commission for Climatology in Turkey in February 2010, recognizing the need for multiple international and interdisciplinary partners. Additional expert viewpoints to those of traditional climatologists are essential. It was unanimously endorsed. A meeting took place at the Met Office in September 2010 to investigate potential scope of this program. Participants included climatologists from every continent, metrologists (measurement scientists), statisticians with environmental and economic expertise, software engineers, and citizen scientists. Recognizing that the meeting could not possibly host all interested participants, the organizing committee led the production of white papers. These were available for public comment through a blog prior to the meeting. Comments were then fed into discussions. ) and associated quality assurance of observations, and applying strict revision control and versioning. These aspects increase process overheads substantially but add significant value in terms of product robustness, quantifying uncertainties, and user confidence in products. Ultimately, full transparency at every step from raw data to final products enables many pairs of expert and nonexpert eyes to consider data and data products, and improves understanding.\nHowever, exceptions will always exist and data policy is complex. Existing datasets that have limited traceability and/or accessibility are still very valuable. For example, climate index datasets, such as the Hadley Centre global climate extremes indices (HadEX) dataset, provide information covering large data gaps that would remain void for many years if open source data were an absolute requirement. Similarly, dynamical reanalyses are highly complex, assimilating far more than surface data, often with proprietary code. They will undoubtedly constitute a key future product but cannot, almost by definition, have absolute transparency. Hence, although having full openness and transparency is the ultimate goal and primary principle, there will always remain a role for approaches that exploit data that, at present, would otherwise be unavailable or that cannot be made fully traceable for practical or legal reasons.\nA SINGLE GLOBAL DATA BANK. Global data access needs significant improvement. There is still no single recognized data repository for land meteorological data, which exists for ocean data (World Ocean Database), weather balloons (Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive), and surface ocean measurements [International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS)]. Our primary objective is therefore a universal data bank of land meteorological observations (ultimately including variables other than temperature, such as humidity, rainfall, and wind speed), developed in close coordination with existing repositories. There are several \"stages\" to such a data bank: starting with raw observations in written form (hard copy) or voltage/digital count for electronic data, and progressing to a unified data bank holding in a consistent format (Fig. 1) . This can require reconciling multiple sources with records from the same location. We aim to include as many stages as possible for all data, ideally with a documented and traceable quality indicator [see the Quality Assurance Framework for Earth Observation (QA4EO) documentation online at www.qa4eo.org] and known provenance, from the individual observation to monthly summaries. This is a substantial challenge, even for holdings that are already available in a common digital data format (a number of which were proposed). Early release of those holdings is necessary to allow scientific analysis, even if full provenance information is not attained. Beyond existing open source data, two distinct data groups are of great value. The first consists of data in digital form that are not currently freely available. Many national meteorological/hydrometeorological services require a return on investment. So, they sell their data commercially and are reluctant to lose this income stream. In other cases, data are perceived to hold substantial geopolitical value. Clearly, no one-size-fits-all approach will work-it is necessary to ascertain the issues preventing free data access on a case-by-case basis and then seek to persuade rights holders of the value of open exchange. In part, this might be achieved through provision of value-added products, such as station summaries that encapsulate other characteristics (Fig.  2) . It is likely that other large holdings of records exist elsewhere. The challenge is to identify, rescue, and convert these data into a common digital format. Doing this professionally is expensive. Following the meeting, optical character recognition (OCR) suitability and crowdsourcing (utilizing citizen scientist volunteers) of both OCR quality checking and digitization of data not suitable for OCR are being investigated. Old data sources are being lost; our call to preserve and digitize data is urgent.\nWork is already underway to create an initial data bank version. When a stable version exists, it will be advertised. New versions will then be issued as the data bank holdings increase and provenance issues are better ascertained, but we strongly encourage its usage as soon as possible-user feedback is essential to progress. The data are not the end of the story, though; metadata are equally important and valuable, and data without metadata are generally ambiguous. Metadata are crucial to confirming and attributing nonclimatic influences. They must be considered as one entity."}, {"section_title": "CREATING MULTIPLE DATA PRODUCTS.", "text": "Many national-, regional-, and global-scale products already exist. However, quality assurance information is sparse, documentation quality is mixed, and different source data choices and methods can make meaningful intercomparison hard. Climate has no respect for national and regional boundaries, so an individual event that impacts many countries requires a coherent context-not a patchwork quilt approach. Multiple independently produced data products, with consistently defined and described quality metrics from the data bank, are necessary to remedy many of these issues and meet the different user needs. Global, regional, and local products will be required at hourly, daily, and monthly time scales.\nMultiple products are the only conceivable way to get even a simple estimate of the structural (methodological choices) uncertainty; we need to attack the problem from many different a priori assumptions to create an ensemble of estimates. Measurement uncertainty is larger at finer scales of space and time where residual systematic and random errors are least likely to cancel out. A single estimate of the truth is inadequate no matter how meticulous the research group responsible. Although unable to eradicate uncertainty, multiproduct approaches can elucidate it. For data products covering large regions or long periods, automation is vital for data product creation.\nThis yields substantial challenges but also benefits in terms of being able to create plausible ensembles and fully replicable products.\nThe data product creation step is a broad scientific challenge and therefore will not be actively managed. However, in line with current Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) guidelines (available online at www.wmo.int/pages/prog/gcos/Publications/ gcos-143.pdf), data product developers will be requested to accurately cite the data bank version used and clearly document process steps, methodological choices, and associated uncertainties with strong preference given to complete openness, including code provision. Where this is not practical or possible for legal, intellectual property, or proprietary reasons, exceptions will need to be documented. What precisely, if anything, would constitute minimum acceptance criteria for a data product to be considered an output of this effort was left open; opinions were broad with disagreement on the balance between desirable clarity and discouraging overregulation. Contributions from nontraditional participants will be particularly welcome in yielding useful insights from people attacking the problem by thinking \"outside the box.\""}, {"section_title": "SPATIAL INTERPOLATION.", "text": "Many end users require spatially complete fields. However, even in the most densely observed regions, it is rare to have <10 km separation between sites. Station separations of several hundred kilometers (or more) in some developing countries, and in sparsely populated areas such as the polar regions, are common. There is therefore a need to create estimates where no measurements were made. Creation of spatially complete fields is not a certain, unambiguous science. There will need to be several independent algorithms developed that users can apply. These algorithms need to be assessed in a rigorous manner, akin to the need for a consistent data product benchmark test (see next section). The meeting initiated undertaking of such an analysis, working with existing efforts.\nCONSISTENT BENCHMARKING AND ASSESSMENT. If, as hoped, multiple groups create data products for a given region and period, it will be necessary to objectively compare products to aid users. Creation of a consistent set of synthetic test cases with which to assess software and methods is required. These analog datasets would have the same spatiotemporal sampling and similar climatology, variability, and interstation statistics as the consolidated master database (stage 3 data; Fig. 1 ). To these eS44 november 2011 | would be added a range of \"nonclimatic inf luences\" to mimic white noise random sampling errors and systematic abrupt and gradual red noise errors analogous to a station move, instrument change, or urban encroachment. Data product creators would be given these \"analog\" datasets and would be required to apply their methodology, returning a best guess as to what the original data were and their associated uncertainty. Unlike in the real world, in these analog cases, the \"answer\" is known and so strengths and weaknesses of each data product methodology can be ascertained.\nA group was established at the meeting to lead this benchmarking. Crucially, creation of analog datasets, including specific error models and assessment of the data product creators' best guesses, are to be carried out by a third party, ensuring a double-blind assessment. These analogs will systematically explore likely realworld data issues ranging from overly optimistic to overly pessimistic in their assumptions. Benchmarks will have a limited 3-yr lifecycle with a workshop at the end attended by all parties (Fig. 3) . In other fields, such as software engineering, such a program has led to significant methodological advancement.\nIn addition, an overall assessment of each product is needed in terms of fitness for its intended purpose. Issues of ease of use, reproducibility and traceability, provision of uncertainty estimates (very highly desirable), and other aspects are important to users."}, {"section_title": "HOSTING OF DATA PRODUCTS AND GENERATING TOOLS AND VISUALIZA-TIONS FOR END USERS.", "text": "It is envisaged that all temperature data products created from the data bank will be hosted in an unrestricted data product portal, with aids for users to access and compare data products. The first requirement is to employ the results of the benchmarking and assessment to guide users in their choice of products for their particular problem through a decision tree. Then a suite of tools is required to visualize, tabulate, and manipulate that data product to suit their needs (Fig. 4) . A key challenge will be communicating the uncertainty to all users in a succinct and useful manner. Such requirements have implications for how the data products are managed, formatted, and stored, necessitating a group to manage this process. This group has not yet been established."}, {"section_title": "ENGAGING PARTICIPATION BY PRO-GRAMS, COUNTRIES, SCIENTISTS, AND CITIZENS WORLDWIDE.", "text": "Given that this work has the attention of multiple international agencies, this is the most opportune time for the community to take such analyses forward in an international and coordinated manner. This will happen only with broad \"buy-in,\" participation, commitment, and input. Critically, this effort needs to partner strongly with existing programs, many of whom were represented. This includes overarching programs such as the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Commission for Climatology (see www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/ ccl/index_en.html), the World Climate Research Programme, and the Global Climate Observing System. Perhaps more importantly, it needs to work with and learn from those activities already engaged in similar projects at the working level such as ICOADS, ACRE, EURO4M (European Reanalysis and Observations for Monitoring; www. euro4m.eu), COST HOME (homogenization project; w w w.homogenisation. org), crowd sourcing website projects such as www. oldweather.org and www. data-rescue-at-home.org, and the dynamical reanalyses in addition to existing data-product teams who have a wealth of experience to offer.\nHowever, the net also needs to be cast wider. It is envisaged that the oversight, once formally constituted, will include relevant metrological and statistical bodies, in addition to meteorological entities, and will have truly international representation. Governance needs to be light but effective-ensuring progress, inclusivity, and flexibility, but ultimately guaranteeing usability.\nFinally, success or failure will not depend upon the governance structure or the number of associated acronyms but on the degree of meaningful engagement with scientists and citizen scientists.
