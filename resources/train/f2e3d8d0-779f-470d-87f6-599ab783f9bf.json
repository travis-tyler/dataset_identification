[{"section_title": "", "text": "Recent study reported in this journal that the threats of continuous evolution and dissemination of 2019 novel coronaviruses. 1 Since its emergence in December 2019, a \"seventh\" member of the family of human coronavirus named \"SARS-CoV-2\" was responsible for an outbreak of coronavirus disease in Wuhan, China. 2 As of March 7, 2020, China had reported more than 80,815 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2, with 3,073 fatalities and counting ( http://www.nhc.gov.cn ). Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 had been transmitted rapidly in more than 90 countries to date ( https://www.who.int ), including Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and Oceania, posing serious concerns about its pandemic potential. Despite of droplet and contact transmissions of SARS-CoV-2, recent studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 might be transmitted via aerosol and fecal-oral routes 3 ( Fig. 1 ) , which needs to be paid attention in particular.\nThe close phylogenetic relationship to bat-origin coronaviruses provided evidence for a bat origin of SARS-CoV-2. 4 Bats provided a rich \"gene pool\" for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments of coronaviruses, which were established as mixing vessels of different coronaviruses. 5 Although humans and bats live in different environments, some wildlife species were susceptible to the novel coronaviruses in nature, highlighting that the need of tracing its origin of SARS-CoV-2 in wild animals. Previously, researchers had demonstrated that coronaviruses had been detected in pangolins. 6 Here, we explored the phylogenic relationship of the human SARS-CoV-2 together with pangolin-and bat-origin coronaviruses. The similarity analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and the animal-origin coronaviruses demonstrated that recombination events were likely to occur in bat-and pangolin-origin coronaviruses (Supplementary Figure S1) . A Blast search of the compete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the closely related coronaviruses were the BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 (bat/RaTG13) and BetaCoV/Pangolin/Guangdong/1/2020 (Pangolin/1), with \u223c96% and \u223c 90.5% overall genome sequences identity, respectively. In the 1ab, S, E, M, and N genes, the bat/RaTG13 coronavirus exhibited 96.2%, 97.3%, 100%, 99.6%, and 99.0% amino acid identical to that of SAR-CoV-2, respectively, while the pangolin/1 coronavirus showed the 96.3%, 92.4%, 100%, 98.7%, and 97.9% amino acid identical to that of SARS-CoV-2, respectively ( Fig. 2 ) . However, it was notably that 1b gene sequence identity of pangolin/1 coronavirus was greater that bat-origin RaTG13 coronavirus, with the highest being 99.3%.\nThe spike (S) protein mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion. 7 The amino acids of the spike 2 protein of pangolin-origin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 were more conserved than that of the spike 1 protein, and only a few minor deletions of amino acids of S protein were found in pangolin-origin coronavirus compared with the SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Figure S4) . Interestingly, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 was more similar to that of the bat/RaTG13 strain and Pangolin/1 coronavirus. Although the S amino acid identities of pangolin-origin coronavirus exhibited lower amino acid identities with bat/RaTG13, it was noteworthy that six amino acids associated with the receptor binding preference of human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II-464 L, 495F, 502Q, 503S, 510 N, and 514Y (SARS-CoV-2 numbering)-in the pangolin/1 coronavirus were the same as that of SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 2 ), but were distinct from that of the bat-origin coronaviruses. Besides, the PRRA-motif insertion was occurred in the S1/S2 junction of SARS-CoV-2; however, the PRRA-motif insertion in the pangolin-and bat-origin coronaviruses was missing (Supplementary Figure S4 ), suggesting that the convergent cross-species evolution of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses.\nThe phylogenic tree of full-genome of SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses could be classified into four clades, including clade 1, clade 2, clade 3, and clade 4 ( Fig. 1 ) . The two bat-origin SARS-like strains (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) formed clade 1, and pangolin-derived Pangolin/1, BetaCoV/ Pangolin/Guangxi/P2V/2017 (Pangolin/P2V), and Be-taCoV/Pangolin/Guangxi/P4L/2020 (Pangolin/P4L) coronaviruses formed newly independent clade 2 and clade 3, which were notable for the long branch separating the bat/RaTG13 strain and SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 1 ) . Of note, we found that the full genome and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genome of Pangolin/1 coronavirus were genetically closely related to the bat/RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 strains ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figure S3 phylogenic tree of S gene, the Pangolin/P2V and Pangolin/P4L coronaviruses were more closely related to that of the bat/RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 strains (Supplementary Figure S2) , indicative of the continuous evolution and genetic recombination of pangolinand bat-derived coronaviruses. There was clearly a genetic gap between SARS-CoV-2 and the nearest bat-and pangolin-origin coronaviruses, and the phylogenic relationship of pangolin-origin coronaviruses were far from that of bat/RaTG13 ( Fig. 1 ) . Given the use of pangolins use in traditional medicine and for food, what kind of role do the pangolins play in the cross-species evolution and transmission of the novel coronavirus? Further details needed to be sought in the future.\nFrequent human-animal interface had been recognized the major cause for viral cross-species transmission. It is speculated that the coronaviruses circulating in pangolin, bat, and other animal species are likely perceived to be a \"gene pool\" for the generation of new recombinants ( Fig. 1 "}]
