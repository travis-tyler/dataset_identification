They retain the emotional trace of film clips despite forgetting their narrative content [1] , show preserved mutual gaze with their spouses [2] , and have a heightened tendency to take on the emotions of those around them [3] . This sensitivity can have less desirable effects, manifesting as anxiety, irritability, and agitation, among the most common neuropsychological symptoms in early AD [4] . Differences in emotional reactivity may precede the onset of cognitive decline: increased midlife neuroticism, a trait indicator suggesting increased reactivity to negative emotion [5] , is associated with higher rates of late-life AD [6] . Cognitively intact individuals with preclinical AD report more loneliness than their peers, independent of objective social network measures [7] . Whether differences in emotional reactivity and social experience represent a risk factor for AD or an early manifestation of AD pathological changes remains uncertain.\nAmyloid-PET is increasingly accepted as a strong early predictor of future AD. A newly positive amyloid-PET scan predicts progression to AD dementia within [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] years, based on a recent large meta-analysis [8] , and the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association workgroup defines the presence of a positive amyloid-PET scan in cognitively healthy individuals as the first stage of preclinical AD [9] . The functional neuroimaging literature suggests that AD and, more variably, preclinical AD defined by amyloid positivity are associated with decreased connectivity in the default mode network (DMN), which supports episodic memory [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . AD is, conversely, associated with increases in connectivity, gray matter volume, and perfusion within a salience network, which responds to diverse stimuli of homeostatic relevance to the individual, including socioemotional cues [15] [16] [17] . Salience network connectivity correlates with emotional reactivity in AD [18] . The point at which salience network connectivity increases relative to the development of AD pathology remains uncertain, though cognitively healthy carriers of an apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 allele, the major genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, show widespread salience network connectivity increases [19] .\nIn this study, we sought to determine whether salience network connectivity intensification and longitudinal increases in emotional reactivity could be detected in cognitively normal amyloid-positive individuals. We studied participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), a large longitudinal aging cohort with follow-up data spanning 2 decades [20] . We hypothesized that cognitively normal older individuals found to be amyloid positive would show a trajectory of increasing emotional reactivity but preserved to increased scores on measures of interpersonal warmth, both in absolute terms and relative to amyloid-negative peers. We further hypothesized that longitudinal increases in these measures would be associated with higher global connectivity within key salience network nodes, and that these associations would be present in the absence of significant atrophy."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants were volunteers in the BLSA, an ongoing cohort study of older community-dwelling adults.

We calculated neuroticism and extraversion composites from NEO-PI-R subscales selected to best represent the individual's response to socially salient stimuli. These included a neuroticism composite (referred to henceforth as \"emotional reactivity\") based on NEO-PI-R subscales N1 (anxiety), N3 (depression), and N6 (vulnerability), and an extraversion composite (referred to henceforth as \"interpersonal warmth\") based on NEO-PI-R subscales E1 (warmth) and E6 (positive emotion). In addition to having face validity for the affective science constructs of interest, the subscales selected are the strongest loading variables within the neuroticism and extraversion facets; that is, of the available subscales, they are the most central to neuroticism and extraversion [23] .

Because the prevalence of amyloid positivity increases with age, the amyloid-positive group was significantly older; as expected, this group also included a greater percentage of APOE \u03b541 individuals. On psychometric testing, PiB-positive and PiB-negative participants scored similarly well on a measure of global cognition [29] . PiB-positive participants reported greater depressive symptoms, though their scores fell well below the clinically significant range [30] , and had lower verbal episodic memory scores [31] than PiB-negative participants, though their scores, again, fell within the normal range (Table 1) . For the imaging analysis, subjects were matched for age at scan, APOE \u03b54 status, and other demographic variables. There were no significant between-group differences on any of these measures, with the exception of handedness (two left-handed individuals were included in the amyloid-positive group; only one appropriate amyloidnegative match was available) ( Table 2 ).\n3.2. Amyloid-positive individuals show increasing emotional reactivity, and amyloid-positive women show a greater decline in interpersonal warmth, with age PiB-positive adults showed significant increases in emotional reactivity over time (b 5 0.49, t 5 4.4, P , .001), unlike PiB-negative participants (b 5 20.08, t 5 21.0, P 5 .335), whose scores were consistent with past studies describing a decline in neuroticism in healthy older adults [32] (Fig. 2A) .

There was a weak and opposite trend for emotional reactivity, such that higher STS connectivity was associated with increased emotional reactivity across subjects (b 5 3.6 ! 10 24 , t 5 1.7, P 5 .106).\nThere was no significant relationship between personality measures and insular connectivity."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our data show that longitudinal increases in emotional reactivity, and decreases in interpersonal warmth in women, can be detected in cognitively normal older adults with evidence of amyloid deposition. These observations build upon an emerging literature showing that adults with higher neuroticism at a single time point in midlife are at higher risk of late-onset AD [6] . The increases in emotional reactivity in PiB-positive individuals stand in contrast to older adults in general, who show decreasing neuroticism in large longitudinal studies [32] .\nFurthermore, we found that amyloid-positive individuals show higher global connectivity within the right anterior insula and STS, brain regions that play key roles in social processing, and that hyperconnectivity of the STS is associated with lower interpersonal warmth and a trend toward increasing emotional reactivity. Importantly, these functional changes were seen despite normal performance on cognitive tests and in the absence of structural atrophy. The right ventral anterior and mid-insula represent important nodes within the salience network, a system critical for socially adaptive behavior [33] . The anterior insula, a hub for autonomic processing, is thought to support conscious awareness of the emotional and visceral state of the organism, based on integration of a wide variety of perceptual and interoceptive inputs [34] [35] [36] . Interestingly, the right hemisphere has been proposed as the dominant hemisphere for sympathetic autonomic processing [37] [38] [39] .\nThe STS, a part of the posterior subnetwork of the DMN, supports key spatial and cognitive aspects of social functioning, including assessments of voice prosody, trustworthiness in faces, others' gaze, and theory of mind [40] [41] [42] . Lower STS volumes correlate with higher emotional contagion, a form of reactivity, in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and AD [3] , suggesting that hyperconnectivity in the presymptomatic phase may give way to degeneration in the symptomatic phase, as proposed by some network spreading models of AD [43] . Hyperconnectivity to both insula and STS, then, could result in heightened visceral and perceptual sensitivity to salient social cues, leading to increased autonomic arousal that engenders decreased interpersonal warmth and increased emotional reactivity.\nWe found no regions of lower global connectivity for amyloid-positive healthy older adults compared with those without evidence of amyloid deposition. Several studies, using seed-, template-, or intrinsic component analysis-based approaches to focus analyses on structures within the DMN, have shown lower connectivity within the DMN in amyloid-positive individuals [11, 13, 14, 44] . However, work in preclinical AD has also identified higher in-network functional connectivity from multiple DMN nodes, including a node in the middle temporal gyrus bordering the STS [11] . Other recent work demonstrates that, although the early presence of amyloid correlates with lower local connectivity within the posterior DMN, it also predicts higher connectivity from the posterior DMN to high-connectivity frontal nodes [43] . Coupled with this previous work, the current findings suggest that global hyperconnectivity from posterior division nodes of the DMN may be as important an effect of early amyloid pathology as local DMN subnetwork hypoconnectivity.\nThat our global, data-driven connectivity analysis did not reveal any regions of lower connectivity in amyloid-positive individuals may suggest that early amyloid-driven hypoconnectivity is restricted to local connectivity within subnetworks (i.e., the anterior or posterior DMN) in preclinical AD, while early relative hyperconnectivity to the STS, insula, and other regions (including, in our sample, the left hippocampus) may reach across subnetworks and across networks. Notably, healthy middle-aged carriers of the APOE \u03b54 allele show higher connectivity between salience network and DMN structures [45] . Early brainstem sites of tau deposition such as the locus coeruleus [46] would be well positioned to drive such cross-network hyperconnectivity; interestingly, we found higher global connectivity in amyloid-positive individuals in a pontine region including the locus coeruleus and the parabrachial nucleus. Parallel findings are emerging in animal research, with new data showing that transgenic amyloid-overexpressing mice have a transient period of striking DMN-like and frontocingular hyperconnectivity during midlife, which diminishes with progressive amyloid accumulation [47] .\nIn the present study, regional STS hyperconnectivity predicted increasing emotional reactivity and decreasing interpersonal warmth, a relationship that was independent of amyloid status. Because we only assessed for amyloid near the end of longitudinal personality data included in this report, this finding raises a critical question: is insular and STS hyperconnectivity an effect of early amyloid deposition on the brain or a marker of a preexisting trait that predisposes to amyloid deposition? One theoretical model posits that individuals with preexisting hyperconnectivity may be more vulnerable to amyloid spread [43] . Conversely, in the mouse model of amyloidosis cited previously, investigators found that DMN-like and frontocingulate hyperconnectivity could be suppressed by administering antiamyloid antibodies [47] , suggesting that excess amyloid accumulation is the cause of hyperconnectivity in this model. Longitudinal studies that incorporate personality and cognitive assessments with PET-amyloid and fMRI measures are ongoing and should inform this important issue in humans.\nWe did not find evidence for an effect of the APOE \u03b54 allele on emotional reactivity or interpersonal warmth in this preclinical population. Because the older average age of the cognitively healthy subjects in this study may select for \u03b54 carriers who are unusually resilient, our findings are not incompatible with prior studies, which have shown preclinical changes in \u03b54 carriers. Our findings also suggest that amyloid deposition, rather than APOE status or even clinical cognitive impairment, may be the key factor mediating personality changes in at-risk individuals. This could potentially account for the findings of a larger study in the BLSA showing that individuals later clinically diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or AD (without amyloid testing) did not show increasing neuroticism over time compared with others [48] . To clarify these matters, future studies should examine the relationship between early amyloid deposition, the presence of an \u03b54 allele, and emotional reactivity in cognitively healthy individuals across the life span.\nFinally, our findings run contrary to our expectations that amyloid-positive individuals would show increases in interpersonal warmth alongside increased emotional reactivity. Notably, amyloid positivity had an effect on interpersonal warmth only for amyloid-positive women, who showed higher interpersonal warmth at baseline. In individuals with higher interpersonal warmth at baseline, such as the amyloid-positive women in our sample, could increasing emotional reactivity undermine these qualities rather than enhancing them? And might higher interpersonal warmth in midlife reflect a milder, socially adaptive stage of enhanced emotional reactivity? Further clarifying this finding could allow for the early identification of individuals who are most vulnerable to neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD.\nOngoing prevention studies are evaluating the potential efficacy of antiamyloid immunotherapy during the earliest stages of AD, with recent studies suggesting that intervention offered early enough in the disease process may lead to radiographic and potentially symptomatic improvement [49, 50] . The increasing focus on preclinical AD pathophysiology highlights the importance of early identification of individuals who will go on to develop AD. Our work suggests that increasing emotional reactivity is an early and significant feature of AD, which precedes clinically appreciable cognitive symptoms or significant structural atrophy. Our data further suggest that these features may relate to higher connectivity in key cortical regions subserving social and emotional processing.
