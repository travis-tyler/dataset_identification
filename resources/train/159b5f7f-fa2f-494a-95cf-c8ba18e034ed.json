Approximately one-fourth of cognitively normal populations and half of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have elevated levels of cerebral amyloidosis [3, 4] . The 2018 National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) research framework updated the biomarker classification system consisting of \u03b2-amyloidosis, tauopathy and neurodegeneration or neuronal injury (the ATN system) and emphasized the presence of amyloid pathology to identify the first stage of the disease [5, 6] . Abnormality of amyloid-\u03b2 precedes abnormality in tau, which leads to AD-related brain atrophy, [ 18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) decline and accelerated cognitive decline [7] ."}, {"section_title": "AGING", "text": "AD is a defined biological entity with a progressive continuum in clinical abnormalities. The molecular pathology of AD is accomplished by biological entityrelated continuous measures, and highlighted by three disease components, including \u03b2-amyloidosis, tauopathy and neurodegeneration. Importantly, quantifications of amyloid-\u03b2 have been incorporated into standard diagnostic guidelines and clinical trials, and abnormal amyloid-\u03b2 can be measured by decreased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-\u03b242 peptide (A\u03b242) levels or increased ligand retention of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in the preclinical phase [8] [9] [10] [11] . Previous cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have indicated that abnormally low levels of CSF A\u03b242 can be detected before the identification of abnormal A\u03b242 by PET in preclinical AD [12, 13] . Consequently, the reduction in CSF A\u03b242 levels over time has stronger predictive value for identifying population with the disease or condition and monitoring disease trajectories at early stage.\nGenetic risk factors play a key role in disease pathology with a high heritability of 70% to 80% [14] . The apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype is regarded as the strongest genetic regulator for amyloid pathology in lateonset AD. However, at present, the genetic risk factors that are related to longitudinal changes of CSF A\u03b242 levels remain poorly understood. Use of quantitative traits in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provides novel and important insights into broader trends in associations with genes and related pathways [15] [16] [17] . Therefore, we performed a quantitative trait GWAS with longitudinal measures of CSF A\u03b242 levels from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database in order to identify genetic regulators of CSF A\u03b242 change rate in non-demented elders.\n\ndominant-negative mutant of the gene causes a large number of differentiated neurons markedly reduced [26] .\nPrior to this study, the definite association mechanism of CSF A\u03b242 and CBFA2T3 has not been previously been discovered. The expression of CBFA2T3, NEUROG2 (OMIM*606624) and ASCL1 (OMIM*100790) genes overlapped, and transcription assay showed that NEUROG2 and ASCL1 are inhibited by the MTGprotein family, in which the CBFA2T3 gene was the most efficient to inhibit the transcription activity [27] . The proneural factor NEUROG2 mediates APP-stimulated neuronal differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells \n(NSPCs) to neurons, and levels of NEUROG2 are correlated with amyloid-precursor protein (APP) expression [28] , which means that rare mutations of CBFA2T3 might influence the APP expression. APP is a single-pass transmembrane protein expressed at high levels in the brain, and the generation and accumulation of A\u03b242 from sequential APP proteolysis is the crucial step in the development of AD [29] . However, the specific mechanism through which NEUROG2 regulates APP is not yet clear. Furthermore, NEUROG2 expression increased with rising relative A\u03b242 levels [30] . The recent findings from Alzheimer's disease mouse models revealed that lentiviral vector-mediated overexpression of NEUROG2 and ASCL1 can ameliorate learning and memory impairment, and the ASCL1gene treatment could be linked to inhibition of the neuroinflammatory response and enhancement of neuroprotection and neurogenesis [31] . Taken together, we reasoned that CBFA2T3 might affect the neurogenesis process and AD-related cognitive decline.\nThe A\u03b2 is a product of the metabolism of the amyloid precursor protein, a type 1 transmembrane protein [32] . APP can mediate cell adhesion and stimulate neurite outgrowth. Moreover, a secreted form of APP stimulates cell proliferation and is neuroprotective against a variety of toxic insults, including oxidative stress, glucose deprivation and excitotoxicity [33] . An imbalance between the production and clearance of A\u03b2 has a crucial role in the development and progression of AD. The toxic soluble A\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2Os) accumulate in AD brain and constitute long-lived alternatives to the disease-defining A\u03b2 fibrils deposited in amyloid plaques [34] . The \u03b2-amyloidosis triggers a redistribution of critical synaptic proteins and induces hyperactivity in metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate receptors. This leads to Ca 2+ overload and instigates major facets of AD neuropathology, including tau hyperphosphorylation, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, synapse loss and so on [35] . The A\u03b2O hypothesis has been described as a small conceptual revolution and is widely regarded as accounting for the onset of neuron damage leading to AD.\nSuggestive associations were identified through GWAS and might reach genome-wide significance in larger cohorts of non-demented older adults. The suggestive associations included a SNP in RBFOX3, which is exclusively expressed in neurons. RBFOX3 promotes neuronal differentiation through alternative splicing of Numb pre-mRNA during brain development and maturation [36] . RBFOX3 mutations have been observed to be linked to cognitive impairments. Moreover, RBFOX3 is critical for normal hippocampal function. Especially in hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus regions, the dysfunctional RBFOX3 affects synaptic transmission and short-time or long-time plasticity and results in impairment of learning, memory and cognition [37, 38] . The suggestive findings argue for further investigation into RBFOX3 to clarify the potential functional variants related to amyloid pathology.\nFollowing this GWAS scan, we assessed the associations of CBFA2T3 rs13333659-T with other ADrelated endophenotypes in the longitudinal framework. In particular, it was observed that rs13333659-T carriers had more rapid rates of cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy among the non-demented elders with detectable amyloid pathology at baseline. It has been validated by previous studies that amyloid status can be present in the brain and has a minor impact on cognition over the long preclinical period [20, 39, 40] . Our results also suggest that baseline amyloidosis as an enrolling criterion in many prevention trials might be useful for risk enrichment and risk stratification [41] . The CSF A\u03b242 (or the A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio) and amyloid-PET were widely accepted as measurable indicators of abnormal pathological states associated with cerebral amyloidosis levels [42] . The updated 2018 NIA-AA research framework indicates that focusing on longitudinal cohort studies and randomized placebocontrolled trials facilitate the biological definition of AD [5] . In the absence of successful anti-amyloid trials, the clearly identifiable stages and mechanisms behind the efficacy of the anti-amyloid treatment remain unknown. Probably the most effective approach would be to find preventive targets to inhibit the initial accumulation of A\u03b242. Thus, understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying the rate of amyloid aggregation in individuals without dementia may be the best window on a better understanding of the pathological changes in AD and the design of prevention trials [43] . This study discovered a novel risk locus which can influence the decline rate of CSF A\u03b242 decline preceding the onset of clinical symptoms, providing reliable and valid estimates for further investigations.\nOur findings must be interpreted in the light of the limitations. Although we leveraged publicly available ANDI genetics and longitudinal CSF A\u03b242 data to perform this original study, the sample size for analysis was relatively small, leading to the limited power to identify variants which have small effects. Given that the buildup of brain A\u03b242 is postulated to take decades, the follow-up of this study is not sufficiently long to monitor longitudinal changes. Replication testing is necessary in larger samples with long duration of follow-up to confirm our findings and additional discovery. The study was limited to non-Hispanic Caucasian participants to avoid population stratification across ethnicities, but the rs13333659 in CBFA2T3 has various frequencies in AGING different races. The contradiction determines the racial limitation of our research and the necessity of replication analysis in other races. Furthermore, this study provided evidence for association between rs13333659 in CBFA2T3 genetic variants with the decline rate of CSF A\u03b242 as well as that of rs13333659 and cognitive performance traits, but the specific mechanisms of influencing expression level or protein structure and affecting phenotypes were not illustrated. Functional genomics experiments have not yet been performed, which included immunohistochemistry and analyses of CBFA2T3 knockout models."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of included subjects", "text": "The final participants were consolidated for 321 nonHispanic Caucasian subjects from the ADNI-1, 2 and Grand Opportunities (GO) databases.

Table 1 shows the distribution of baseline demographic information.

The strongest association of the longitudinal changes in CSF A\u03b242 was identified with rs13333659, an intronic variant located in the gene CBFA2T3 (CBFA2/RUNX1 translocation partner 3; OMIM*603870, 16q 24.3; Figure 1A ). Figure 2A shows the mean concentration of CSF A\u03b242 during the follow-up period for the minor allele (T) carriers vs. non-carriers in the discovery cohort and baseline amyloid-positive group. There are 214 individuals who were homozygous wild-type (G/G), 98 individuals who were heterozygous (G/T) and 9 individuals who were homozygous recessive (T/T) at rs13333659. The minor allele T (MAF = 0.1) was associated with a more rapid decline in CSF A\u03b242 levels over time (\u03b2 = \u22120.034, p = 2.24\u00d710 \u22129 ).

There was a deviation from expected pvalues in the upper tail distribution, suggesting the presence of a significant genetic association. The genomic inflation factor \u03bb was 1.007, indicating no evidence of significant confounding due to population stratification. The Figure 1C shows the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between rs13333659 in CBFA2T3 and other nearby SNPs, several of which showed strong associations with the longitudinal changes of CSF A\u03b242 (p < 0.01). No significant associations were observed after controlling for rs13333659 genotype, indicating that these associations for nearby SNPs were driven by rs13333659 ( Figure 1D ). Five suggestive associations (p < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ) with longitudinal changes of CSF A\u03b242 were demonstrated in this GWAS ( Figure 1A and Table  2 ), which included an additional SNP in CBFA2T3 (rs57706252), TRPM6 (rs35878400, OMIM*607009), RBFOX3 (rs113685315, OMIM*616999), PDZRN3 (rs55732227, OMIM*609729) and an intergenic locus on 8q21.1 (rs6987191)."}, {"section_title": "Impact of CBFA2T3 on longitudinal cognitive performance", "text": "Amyloid aggregation confers the greatest risk for steeper long-term cognitive decline [18] .

Taken together, we hypothesized that carriers with rs13333659-T would display a higher rate of cognitive decline. In order to assess the relationship between rs13333659 variants and cognitive decline over time, we performed a linear mixed effects analysis on 687 non-demented elderly subjects (MCI = 433; CN = 254) from the ADNI cohort with a 6-year follow-up.
