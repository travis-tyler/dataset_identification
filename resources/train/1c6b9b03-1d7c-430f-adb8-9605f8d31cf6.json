[5] [6] [7] [8] Significant memory impairment is already present at the stage of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 9, 10 the first clinical episode suggestive of MS. However, hippocampal damage is typically not detected at this early stage of MS because atrophy is not yet observed or still confined to few locations such as the thalamus or the striatum. [11] [12] [13] [14] To the best of our knowledge, only one study has reported hippocampal atrophy in a CIS group with high T2-lesion load. 15 Therefore, there is a need for imaging biomarkers more sensitive than atrophy, especially at the stage of CIS, which could reflect clinically relevant hippocampal alterations to help the development and validation of future neuroprotective strategies.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been efficiently used to reveal widespread white-matter damages from the stage of CIS 16 but less consistently within grey matter. 17, 18 Specifically, there is no report of altered DTI within the hippocampus of persons with CIS (PwCIS) and no strong imaging correlate of memory impairment at this stage. Outside the field of MS, DTI has revealed subtle and early hippocampal alterations in Alzheimer's disease, 19 but it is currently unknown whether this technique can also be sensitive enough to capture clinically relevant modifications at the very early stage of MS.\nIn this study, we hypothesized that microstructural damage contributing to early memory impairment could occur in the hippocampus at the stage of CIS and that it might be measurable with DTI while there is no hippocampal atrophy. To test this hypothesis, we measured hippocampal volume and DTI metrics within the hippocampus of PwCIS to look for correlations with episodic memory scores and to test their ability to discriminate between memory-impaired and memory-preserved PwCIS.

After denoising, 24 images were affine-registered 25 into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and the total brain volume was estimated. Hippocampus was automatically segmented with a patch-based multitemplates method described in detail elsewhere 26 that uses expert manual segmentations in MNI space as priors. Anatomical boundaries of the hippocampus were defined according to the European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (EADC-ADNI) Harmonized Protocol. 27 Every mask was then blindly checked and manually corrected (V.P.) for inappropriate inclusion of para-hippocampal T1-hypointense lesions, choroidal plexus and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 'pockets'. To control for variations in head size, total brain volumes and hippocampal volumes were scaled using the volumetric scaling factor determined through the affine registration to the MNI brain template.\nAn in-house pipeline (dtiBrain) was used to process diffusion-weighted images (DWI). First, images were denoised 28 in order to improve signal-to-noise ratio. Then, head displacement and distortions induced by eddy currents were corrected by performing affine registration 25 of all DWI to the b0 images. The direction table was updated with the estimated motion matrices. To compensate for EPI distortion, a nonrigid registration of DWI to the subject's T1-weighted images in MNI space was performed using advanced neuroimaging tools (ANTs). 25 For that purpose, we found that registration of mean diffusivity (MD) map, derived from DWI, to CSF probability map, derived from T1, provided the most accurate strategy by visual inspection of the hippocampal areas. Then, a diffusion tensor model was fitted at each voxel using FSL 5.0 (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) to measure mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and MD within the hippocampal masks previously generated from T1-weighted images (Figure 1 (a)-(c))."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "Right and left hippocampal values were averaged.

If only two groups had to be compared, Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test was used as appropriate. Cohen's d was used to measure the effect size. Then, relationships between clinical scores and quantitative imaging variables were assessed using correlation coefficients (Pearson or Spearman according to statistical distribution) for CIS and MS groups, respectively. The associations were further tested in multivariate context to take into account adjustment on covariables fixed according to univariate results and clinical relevance: age, gender, depression and T2-lesion load. For that purpose, cognitive performances (dependent variables) were predicted with regression models. Linear regression model was used whenever possible, while logistic regression was seen as the appropriate alternative for categorical outcome variables by dichotomizing the performances; a log transformation was applied when needed to achieve normality. Considering the issue of multiple comparisons, Sidak's correction was used to reduce the risk of type I error.

Furthermore, increased hippocampal MD was associated with early memory impairment in these PwCIS.\nA quarter of our population of PwCIS showed episodic verbal memory impairment in learning and retrieval tasks which is consistent with previous studies using the same test. 9,10 Interestingly, memory impairment was more frequent than slowing of IPS in PwCIS. This observation suggests that a neurodegenerative process starts early within the hippocampus contributing to memory decline, even at a stage where IPS is relatively preserved because complete disconnection phenomena due to widespread demyelination are generally lower at the CIS stage than later on. 4 Furthermore, our PwCIS were not treated with disease-modifying therapies, avoiding bias linked to heterogeneous therapeutic response.\nOur data support the concept that early memory deficit in MS could be related to specific hippocampal vulnerability, independent of the extent of focal white-matter lesions. Hippocampal FA was significantly decreased in the CIS group and even more in the MS group, in which a significant increase in hippocampal MD was also observed. In previous work assessing PwCIS, deep grey-matter DTI changes were detected, while no hippocampal DTI changes were apparent. 17 However, the sensitivity to DTI changes in the hippocampus might have been hampered by partial voluming effects due to a larger voxel size (3.33mm \u00d7 3.33mm \u00d7 3.00mm), 17 compared to our 1.6 mm 3 voxel size. We also believe that applying a denoising procedure further increased our sensitivity towards microstructural alterations detected by DTI, enabling our findings. 28 In support of the clinical relevance of our finding of early hippocampal damage in PwCIS, we were able to show a strong and independent correlation of hippocampal MD with a hippocampus-dependent task (DR-SRT), but not with cognitive tasks that are not reliant on hippocampal function (i.e. IPS and attention/working memory, even though some authors argue for a continuum between working memory and long-term memory encoding 29 ). Hippocampal MD in PwCIS was correlated to hippocampal-dependent long-term recall in the absence of significant hippocampal volume loss, suggesting that hippocampal MD reflects an earlier pathophysiological process that likely precedes atrophy. Interestingly, and despite smaller differences between groups, the increase in MD appears to be more clinically relevant than the decrease in FA in the explored context. MD might be more stable and reproducible than FA in the hippocampus (i.e. smaller dispersion of the values, even in the control group), which can be reasonably expected in such a grey-matter structure where diffusion tends to be more isotropic and therefore imperfectly represented by FA as a measure of fibre orientation. Therefore, either FA or MD measure different underlying histological substrate or, more likely, FA is less reliable than MD in grey matter which is in line with previous results. 16, 17 Higher MD might correspond to a mixture of hippocampal demyelination, neuronal or synaptic loss together with inflammatory cells as described in post-mortem studies of MS brains. 30 We also showed that hippocampal MD discriminates memory-impaired from memory-preserved patients with a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 70.3% and a NPV of 95.0%. Among clinical and other MRI criteria, hippocampal MD was the only predictor of memory impairment in this group. Therefore, stabilization of low hippocampal MD might be an interesting candidate endpoint (surrogate marker with a very good NPV) in future proof-of-concept phase II clinical trials in CIS and early MS. Unambiguous monitoring of cognitive performances in the context of a neuroprotective agent in clinical trials is complicated by the length of the cognitive testing, the test/retest effect and confounding factors such as participation of the subject, fatigue or depression. 31 In this context, stabilization of low hippocampal MD might provide a complementary and unbiased endpoint. DTI of the hippocampus might also help to improve patient selection by stratifying those with and without hippocampal damage, therefore powering future neuroprotective trials by including more homogeneous population in comparison groups.\nIn contrast, in PwMS, episodic memory correlated with hippocampal volume, but the correlation between hippocampal MD and memory scores was not significant. This finding suggests that at a more advanced stage, assessing the microstructure of the hippocampus with DTI might no longer be sensitive and relevant. Furthermore, T2-lesion load and hippocampal DTI metrics were correlated with IPS scores. These findings can suggest that hippocampus is involved in IPS but also that hippocampal DTI at the stage of clinically definite MS reflects more general brain damage and in turn correlate better with IPS that has been associated to global cerebral damage. 2 This is consistent with data in the literature showing that cognitive impairment is associated with several imaging metrics in more advanced MS 32 because cognitive impairment is probably the result of a complex interplay between several alterations at this stage. 33 We acknowledge an important shortcoming of this meta-analysis of our data, namely, that the cognitive testing was different for the CIS and MS groups, limiting our ability to directly compare PwCIS to PwMS. Nevertheless, a previous paper reported no difference in sensitivity between SRT and CVLT 34 and furthermore, we believe that the insights gained by separately comparing these groups of patients to matched HC explored with the same tests maintain full validity. We also acknowledge that the sample size of each group is relatively small, and therefore, these results can be viewed as preliminary and need confirmation in a larger cohort of PwCIS. Another limitation is that we did not acquire 3D-double inversion recovery MRI, limiting our ability to detect focal hippocampal lesions. 35 Therefore, our DTI findings might reflect focal, as well as more diffuse alterations in the hippocampus. Because the PPV was only 52.9%, it will be of great interest for future studies to assess whether PwCIS with increased hippocampal MD but preserved memory functions display compensatory mechanisms measured by hippocampal activation and functional connectivity, as demonstrated in PwMS. 36 Similarly, longitudinal data should identify whether those patients are likely to show memory alterations in long-term follow-up. DTI could also be combined with susceptibility weighted imaging that could also reveal subtle alterations because it has been demonstrated that iron deposition is present within the hippocampus at the stage of CIS. 37\nIn conclusion, episodic memory impairment was correlated with hippocampal DTI changes at the stage of CIS, in the absence of a significant effect of global lesion volume or atrophy on any of the cognitive measures. This argues for a clinically relevant neurodegenerative process occurring in the hippocampus in the early stages of MS and suggests that DTI measurement in this structure might provide a sensitive indicator of early neurodegenerative changes.
