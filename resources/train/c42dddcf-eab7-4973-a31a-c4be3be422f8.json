At present. at least four major collections offer educational scholars and policy analysts nationally representative, longitudinal data on adolescents that have yct to be exhausted. In what follows, i.e consider both the rewards and frustrations of working with large data sets in general and the National Education Longitudinal Study begun in 1988 (NELS:88) in particular. Throughout, we use our work at the Center for Research in Human Development and Education (CRHDE) at Temple University in Philadelphia. Thus, though we usc NELS88 to illuminate the pitfalls of dealing with missing data and inconsistent responses. these phenomena have applications for working with all large data sets. On the other hand, a specific and primary strength of the NELS:88 data set is that it affords a unique opportunity to study the transition from middle to high school. We have harnessed this aspect of NELS.88 to study the gender gap in math, but there are many research areas that might benefit from this opportunity Interestingly. even as it enables one research program, NELS88 curtails another. Because NELS 88 embodies serious errors in the v.ay urban has been defined, thc data as presently constructed cannot be used to adequatel !. address issues surrounding inner-eitv educationas we have disco.ered in our States.

The first of these. the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), was begun in 1969 and has been repeated at one-and two-year intervals since. NAEP is composed of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-old students (i.e., those in grades 4, 8, and 12) of various racial backgrounds in public and private schools and is chiefly concerned with documenting curriculum and performance changes. Approximately 40,000 students per grade level (146,000 total) arc sampled in any given year. along with their teachers and school administrators. This is not a panel study in that the same studcnt are not included in survey after survey. Three major student-focused longitudinal databases follow and run concurrently w ith NAEP the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1172 (NLS 72).

NLS-72 is a national probability sample of 19,001 students designed to be representative of the nation's approximately three million high school seniors in more than I 7.000 schools. This large data set follows that group of young people. at intervals, through the 15 important transitional vears following high school (to 1986). The NLS:72 survey includes both achievement measures (standardized scores, transcript information, and grade point averages) and demographic data.

Begun in the spring of 1980, HS&B represented a departure from previous NCES programs in that the initial survey included both sophomore and senior cohorts. The 58,000 students (30.000 scniors and 28,000 sophomores) have been periodically resurveyed. HS&B data include performance measures (tcst scores) as well as attitudinal, background, school activities, and work data for students and attitudina and background information for their parents, teachers, and school administrators. Recently, NCES has initiated to new longitudinal surveys. Beginning Postsecondary Student Longitudinal Study is the first study begining with students first entering postsecondary education.

This one will begin with verv young children Data collection is to being in"}, {"section_title": "I 997", "text": "The National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88) The most recent NCES program. NELS88 was initiated in 1988 IA ith approximatel. 25,000 eiv.hth-grade students. The stated goals of this third large-scale preject are more comprehensive than those of any education longitudinal study to date. \"A central theme is that education in America must be understood as a lifelong process enmeshed in a complex social context. This study is also intended to produce a comprehensive data set for the dewlopment and evaluation of educational policy at all governmental levels\" (Ingels et al.. l 990,p 5) The initial sample of eighth graders is re-surveyed as high school sophomores (1992: the First Follow-Up study) and seniors (1994: Second Follow-Up). Like HS&B, NELS:88 employs a two-stage sampling design. Schools were selected firt and then a random selection of students was made from those chosen schools. Groups oversampled were public schools with high enrollments of Asian and/or Hispanic students. Catholic schools with high minority enrollments, alternative schools, and private schools with high-achieving students. This strategy ensurcd large enough numbers of Asian and Hispanic students to enable statistical analyses. In cases of sample mortality, samples wcrc freshened with demographically similar students from already selected schools. Elaborate weighting factors must be used to compensate for these design effects. \"Panel flags\" allow for selecting specific populations for whom particular data arc available: for example, flagging only the students for whom teacher information is also available, or who participated in all three (or two) Surveys. Over I 7,(100 students participated in both thc Base Year and First Follow-Up surveys, and approximatel l6,000 took part in all three questionnaires The student surveys included information about the students' socioeconomic status (SES). perceptions of self. school life, family, and educational experiences, and career aspirations Also available is an elaborate set of' variables based on students scores on a batters of cogniti% e tests 4.1"}, {"section_title": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE", "text": "developed by the Educational Testing Service, and transcript files that document students coursetaking behaviors and other achievements (e.g.. awards. grades). Although students who have been identified as \"dropouts\" participate in thc general student survey, NELS:88 also maintains separate data files for these students. The focus in these files is on why the students left school before graduation and what they are doing instead of going to school. The parent surve . also initiated in the l Q88 base year, includes information about the nature and extent of parental support for their children's educational activities as well as standard demographic data Student files are supplemented in both follow-ups, and parent files in 1992, with responses from the newly added (\"freshened\") participants. The teacher survey contains information from two of the student's teachers related to the teachers' background. instructional practices. attitudes, and perceptions of their students' performances. Finally. the school survey, completed by the administrators of the schools from which students were -ampled, offers information about school resources, programs. policies, and some demographic characteristics. The school data, collected in each survey year, contain slightly different information from year to year. In the First Follow-Up file, for example, numerous junior/senior high transition variables were included. In the Second Follow-Up, the focus was on school-to-work transitions. NCES constructed two types of data files for NELS:88. In thc public use files, some variables were suppressed or categorized (e.g.. school enrollment, percentage of students receiving free or reduced cost lunches, state where the school is located) to preserve NELS:88 opens new vistas for educational research, and pumps lifc into existing research programs. As for using NELS:88, you will find that technical support from NCES is excellent, as is the early documentation: books for each sample (students, parents, etc.) reproduce the questionnaire, list the coding scheme, and detail the procedures of using weights. flags. scales. and test scores (Inge ls et al., 1990). This format is both handier and easier to use than that of HS&B, where hugc all-inclusive books were published intermittently to cover several years' worth of surveys (Sebring et al., 1987). Unfortunately, the NELS:88 Second Follow-Up did not come with the same documentation as the earlier two phases of the project. According to NC ES. printing costs are becoming prohibitive. There are, however, a number of possible solutions to this dilemma: NCES could sell thc documentation or producc it on CD-ROM, computer disk, or even distribute it over the Internet through File Transfer Protocols (FTP), giving researchers the option of purchasing, downloading, and printing out their own copies A final technological innovation, that we consider in more detail below, is the availabilit . of the data sets on CD-"}, {"section_title": "ROM", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE Perhaps most important from the standpoint of research design is that, unlike previous data sets. NELS:88 begins with eighth grade. This allows observation of a critical period, the transition from junior to senior high school. For researchers interested in dropout prevention, for example, it is possible for the first time to identify the \"early dropouts:\" those students who drop out by sophomorc year of high school. Among students who participated in both Base Year and First Follow-Up surveys, 856 students left school (some more than one time) between eighth grade and sophomore year. In the second Follow-Up, 1.796 dropouts participated in the survey Attention to these subset populations can yield critical information to help better ideatify students at risk of never graduating. Another way in which transition data can be invaluable is in relation to the gender gap in math, a continuing area of research at CRIME that wc discuss at length with more variability, than girls on standardized math tests in both eighth grade and sophomore year and girls scores on the self-confidence scale were noticeably lower than bo.s in both surve>s Though girls took more (or more advanced) math courses than boys in eichth crade, they did not continue that practice whcn they got to high school This is similar to w hat others haw found. (Sec Kline & Ortman, 1994). Table I. which shows distributions of math test scores, is representative of some of our further explorations of the gender gap and illustrates the importance of ethnic-sensitive analyses (Catsambis, 1994). The gender gap in math performance is not universal but rather varies from group to group: There arc no sex differences among Asians and African Americans in either the Base Year or the First Follow-Up; Latinos and whites, however, evidence a gender gap in math performance as early as eighth grade. It is also worth noting that racial pattems arc thc same for both sexes: Asians score highest, with white students slightly behind: Latinos and African Americans scorc about 10 points lower on average than Asians. Indeed, in relation to performance, racial differences seem more pronounced than gender differences, as the mak:female difference in test scores is never as great as the Asian-African American difference . -. -Table 1 about here>   B. contrast, the gender gap in perception, as measured 1.)% the WES ,elf-enneept is much more dramatic, universal, and sex-specific Th: mean for all nirls. rci;ardless of race and SES, is lower than that of their male counterparts in both the Base Year and First Follow-Up surveys. Interestingly, the scores for the African-American girls V, .erc not as low as those for the three other race/ethnic groups. These preliminary findings evidence some of the ways in which the NELS 88 data can be used. We see here that the gender gap in math performance already exists by eighth grade for some students but has not yet emerged for others, while the gender gap in self-concept is already present in middle school and affects all females. The challenge now is to continue refining, the model of the gender gap in performance, perception: and participation, and assessing how malefemale differences arc mediated by race, SES. ability, and school effects (for more complete results, see Morse-Kelly, 1995). Others have found a gender gap in self-esteem (see American Association of University Women, 1992: Fennema. 1974). The NELS:88 Data: Some Precautions Every large data set is to some extent a \"work in progrcss,\" in that the successes and omissions of its predecessors and successors play some role in its conccption and execution. Inevitably, then, as is the case with NELS:88, there arc aspects of the projcct that limit its usefulness or that must be taken into account in analyzing the data. Some problems are not specific to NELS:88, but rather a universal consideration of working with large data sets Thus, though we use thc NELS:88 data to illustrate the pitfalls and challenges of missing values and inconsistent responses below, these arc topics researchers must grapple with using anv of the NCES databases Other problems apply only to NELS i;8 omissions, for example Although there appears to be more than enough information in the NELS 88 files, in realitN there is not Far more serious than the omissions. hokc.cver. is the error in the suro. i. 22% of the rcsponses to thc ability groups variable arc unusable, either because they are missing or because thc student responded \"don't know\" Or \"classes not grouped by ability.\" There arc several strategics for dealing with missing answers. First, because NFI.S:x8 contains different files for several populations, the best method for redistributing missing data is to cross-reference student answers with those provided by teachers and administrators. Thus, schools that do not employ ability-grouped instruction should \"match\" the students making such a claim. Similarly, teachers' indication of thc siudents' ability group can be used to fill in missing answers (and to check for consistcncy). This inethod, however, will almost certainly not eliminate all the missing values, which makes choosing another strategy almost unavoidable By far the easiest missing data strategy is to simply ignore missing cases Thus. in the case of ability groups, it could be assumed that the 22% missing arc not classified into ability groups An equally quick-and-easy strategy would be to reassign all missing values to some measure of central tendency of the sample population. Missing cases could be assigned to the mode for nominal, and the mean for interval, variables In our example, the modal categor is the Middle Ability Group Interestingly, since researchers tend to be interested in the High and I .ow ability groups. the decision to recode missing cases this %%av ma . have the same practical etfect as simply eliminating them Fither strategy, however. is potentially a problem because the 1 4 \"missing\" group is typically net a random phenomenon. To illustrate: Far from beintz \"representative subset\" of the larger sample population. the group of students missing an ability group value contains more boys than girls, and a larger proportion of Afncan American. Latino. and low-SES students than is in the general population (Le while 32\"\" of the entire sample is low SES. 44% of the missing group is low SES). Thus, by dealing with missin,2 cases too sweepingly. sw remove from analysis precisely those students most critical to much educational research There are. moreoer, serious issues invoked with homogenizing missinu respc.ises. either by discarding or reassigning them. This problem stems. first of all. from the fact that there are different kinds of missing answers and they are not all equivalent. Some are legitimate (e . the school does not use ability-grouped instruction) Others result because the student refused to answer the question. These arc very different phenomena. and provide different kinds of information: One tells us about the school, and the other about the student. Similarly, if it is our theoretical orientation that the school has a vested interest in keeping certain kinds of mformation from students, then we ought not to treat \"don't know\" answers as if they were no different than \"school does not have\" answers. Moreover, as the standardized test scores illustrated, students in the NELS88 sample arc not homogeneous: there arc widc dispersions among the eight sex/race groups. The integrity of any analysis would surely bc compromised were students to be treated as though the group mean or mode (which generally reflects the mean for whites) accurately represented all the different groups in the sample The most theoretical and methodologically sound say of dealini2 with missing data, therefore, is 13), the hot deck procedure That is. by assigning missing %.alues the same %.alue as that of cases v.ith similar characteristics Thus. for abilit groups. it mw.ht make sense to reassign missing %alues to the mode (mean) of students %.ith the same race se\\ SFS to capture individual characteristics We might also include in this set of characteristics the tv pc of BEST COPY AVAILABLE school (public or private) and the size of the eighth-grade class, since the presence (or absence) of ability grouped instruction can be the result of school characteristics. Internal Inconsistency: The Case of NELSgg A related problem to that of missing values is the number of inconsistent and unexpected answers (See Morse- . Again, this is not necessaril a problem specific to NELSX8. but rather \"comes with the territory\" of working with large data sets Indeed, given that we are dealing with adolescents who have been assured of their anon' nuts might well wonder why more students do not engage in \"creative\" survey responses. It is possible to check for internal validity since the same information is elicited in several different places/questions in the same survey as well as in different surveys For example. in the First Follow-Up survey, there are several questions about math that contain the response \"not taking subject\": hours spent on math homcwork (in and out of school), attitudes toward math classes, and math grades. In aetion. there is a \"lead\" question that allows students to check off that they \"have not yet taken math\" and thus skip all the questions that follow. There is surprisingly little consistency from one question to another --thc number of students \"not taking math\" varies with each question, and far more students claim not to take math in relation to doing homework (almost 1,000, combined in and out of school) than in relation to iziving their izrades (only 122) Examples of survey-to-survey inconsistency include students who gained (or lost) 12 or more family members between the Base Year and the First Follow Up and students who were taking advanced math in gth grade but remedial math in 10th grade Unfortunately these data problems are not confined to the student responses The School files, for example, also include some interesting/problematic findings When asked. \"flim, mans da%s in a ro 1A. can a student be absent .Aithout an excuse before he or she is considered a truant.\" 39\", of the administrators responded \"0 &Is s Is this a case of \"mental tnianes*\"' 29% of thc administrators consider a student a dropout after thc student has missed 0 das of school. Schools report offering Advanced Placement courses in Business Math, General Math for grades 10-12. ninth grade General Science, and so on. The fact that el.en administrators can gie outlandish answers is an important cautionary note for procedures such as cross-checking answers and/or assigning higher credibility to answers given by adults This has implications for considering the correlation between, say, math ability on standardized tests and the number of hours spent on homework. To give another example. the sex distribution in the NELS 88 sample population is 50-50 (M F), but among students claiming to hm,e, gone from advanced to remedial math, the sex distribution is 57-43 In other words. inconsistenc here is more likel!. to be a male trait This could have serious implications for studs int.t. to dra w. on our pre l. ions studs area, the gender gap as it relates to course-takinit bcha !or, I 7 BEST COPY AVAILABLE At the very least. the potential for unexpected responses in NELS 88 requires researchers to spend some preparation time faMiliarizing themselves with the variables and plotting an appropriate strategy for their research project. Outlandish responses may need to be recoded. perhaps via the hot deck method, in the same way missing answers are re-categonzed In some cases. it will be possible to cross-reference student answers. with parent. teacher. or transcript data, to ensure more azcuracy. although you should defend the assumption implicit in this method that one group (parents/teachers) is inherentk more \"right\" (accurate) than another (students) Finally, variables constructed from additive rcsponscs (total hours homework. faniik size. number of math courses) may need to be truncated before they can be used for a regression run. Given the inverse relationship between claiming to spend 160 hours on homework and GPA, for example, the high number (160) may mask the actual relationship."}, {"section_title": "NELS:88: Omissions and Shortaces", "text": "While we can appreciate.the need to simplify. the data-gathering instruments in a project of this magnitude, scrious omissions can result. One of the most noticeable shortcomings of the NELS:88 data set is what we call a \"lack of contcxt.\" No school district information is given for any of the schools in the study. It would be useful to know, for example, how many other hiRh schools there are in the district, schools to which the student could transfer. Students may be more accepting of their school if it is the only viable option, or they may feel less trapped if they have other choices Thc same is tnie of teachers. One of the variables in the School file is the number of teachers who left in the previous year. Leaving is not only a function of dissatisfaction with the original school, but also of the possibility of transferring or bean,: transferred to another Schools with some unsatisfied teachers may not have an% or fo. ho leti simpl because there %as no school to which to transfer Similark . in the School stir. o administrators were asked about relationships L..:meen the school board and the communik In a very large school district there most probably would be little or no direct relationships, but in a one-school town the reverse would be true. The percentage of the students in the school receiving free lunches is included in the restricted data file, but not in the public use file Imprecise as it is. this is the only measure of the social class of thc students as a whole attending the school Nor is there any information about school Finances provided other than a question or tyyo about teachers' salaries. which are only reported in verv broad categories. so it is difficult to include any anal\\ ses of priorities A final example of lack of context is the disembu1/41,ed opinions of teachers and administrators regarding whv students drop out of school. Since we cannot tell from the NELS data how much contact these authority figures may have had with problem students, there is no way for us to evaluate these opinions. In general, more data are collected about attitudes than behaviors Moreover. even behavioral questions are phrased subjectively. Students and teachers are asked many questions about their habits and practices. that is, how many times students talk to their parents about high school courses, how much time teachers spend grading papers, and so on. The imprecision of many responses (\"several times,\" \"a fcw times\"), however, tends to make these ansyvers less precise and less helpful than they might otherwise be. Even demographically, NELS:88 contains some omissions. There is a surprising lack of information about the teachers as a group. for example. While the age. experience .and sex is given for those teachers selected to complete a survey, no basis is given for determining how representative of the school as a whole this subset of teachers is This omission prevents the kinds of analyses that might follow our exploration of the gender gap-For example, to what extent is the ses of the teacher correlated with the allocation of rewards (e g high abilits 17,roup placement) in middle and high school\" We hax no variables that allow us to assess the work and intellectual climate among teachers"}, {"section_title": "I j", "text": "And. just as there is potentially valuable data missing in relation to teachers. the same is tnie (surprisingly) of students. There are some large gaps in information about peers for example. Does the student have a boy/girlfriend (and what does that mean in terms of behav iors): How often does the student date? How many friends does the student have\" Are they from inschool or out-of-school\" Are the in school friends the same types as the out Finally, there are omissions of school data. The possibility of schooling effects has a long history in the literature, and education scholars believe differences in schools and in opportunities within schools affect schooling performances NELS88, however. lacks enough information to allow researchers to adequately address this issue While test information is given for the individual students included in the sample. no information is given for the school as a w hole Students in the sample ere randoml% selected, not because the% ere representatiC olthe BEST COPY AVAILABLE school they attended. School SAT/ACT averages are given, but cannot be included in any analyses because the percentage of schools reporting these results is so low. Many of these problems could be resolved or reduced if linkages with other NCES data sets could be established. Since different schools arc included in the different data sets. composite variables wLald have to be constnicted for similar types of schools. This would greatly enhance the depth and range of research activities. -NELS 88 Design Flaws: The Definition of \"Urban\" More serious than the lack of school district information is the problem we encountered while considering the educational experience of \"at-risk.\" i.e.. inner-city, students. In an earlier paper (Rigsby, Stull. 'orse-Kelly, 1994), we used the Urban/Suburban/Rural variable provided in the public use files to investigate the relationship between educational achievcment and aspirations. Unexpectedly, students attending schools classified as \"urban\" arc the same as or better off than their counterparts attending schools classified as \"suburban.\" For example. on the average, urban students scored the same as suburban students (10th grade mathematics test) or higher (10th grade math/reading test). Also, urban students were higher on both the Locus of Control and Self Concept scales. These results raise the issue of whether the urban category in the public use data files is too broad to be used in any investigation of large city education To investigate the issue of urbanicity further, we collected information from the 1980 and 1990 censuses for cities with populations over 600,000 in 1980. From the census, we collected the number of boys and girls aged 5/6 in 1980. who thus would be in the NELS X population We also collected the number of boys and girls aged 13/14 in 1980 and aged 13/14 in 19(n) to it is obvious that there is a problem and it is a serious one. African-American students attending schools in the very largest cities are vastly underrepresented in the NELS-88 data set In the North Cental region, for exrmple. according to census data, 26.74% of the 13/14 .ear-old population is African American. In the NELS:88 data sct. however. only 4.5% of this same regional group is African American White students. on the other hand. wcre overrepresented (Sec Table 2). These same discrepancies between census and NELS:88 data also appear w hen we compare \"percent in poverty\" and \"single-parent households\" (see ). Essentially, a researcher using the urbanicitv variable provided in the public use data set would not be able to capture the depth of the social problems existing in the very large cities. or to be surc of a sample representative of critical urban demographic characteristics (Arnold. 1995) One wonders if the \"improvements\" in thc urban condition beginning to appear in the literature (e g.. recent claims from the CoUncil of the Great City Schools in Washington. DC) have morc to do with the \"redefinition\" of urban than anything else. In the short run, adding one variable -city size broadly defined --to both the public use and restricted files would uo far to alleviate the problem. This. incidently, is not a problem just with NELS:8& but rather applies to all of the recent NCES surveys as each used the Census definition of \"urban.\" Care must be taken in making any gencralizadons using the urban/suburban/rural designation included in the data set. In addition, very large eit .!.. populations arc underrepresented."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Although initially intimidating. thcsc NCES large data sct projccts are well worth investigating.
