The impulse often does not conduct to the atria and thus does not reset the sinus node. 1 They are recognized on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) by their wide (generally >120 msec) and bizarre QRS morphology, which occurs independently of atrial activation (P waves). 2 The types include bigeminy, trigeminy, quadrigeminy, and so on. Arbitrarily, three or more successive beats are termed ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular ectopic beats can have different contours and are often called multifocal (multiform, polymorphic, or pleomorphic). 3 Epidemiologically, ventricular ectopy is exceedingly rare in infants but increases in frequency with age. It may occur in patients with and without structural heart disease and Holter Monitoring reveals that, at least one ectopic beat in 40 to 75% and complex ventricular ectopy in 5 to 10% of normal adults. Ventricular ectopic beats occur with greater frequency and complexity in patients with structural heart diseases, especially ischemic and valvular heart disease and idiopathic cardiomyopathy. It may also occur in the setting of drug toxicity (e.g., digitalis intoxication) or electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia). 2 Clinically, patients are usually asymptomatic but may complain from an irregular heart beat, missed beats or abnormally strong beats (due to the increased output of the post-ectopic sinus beat. 4 The presence of frequent ventricular ectopics such as in a bigeminal rhythm can significantly lower the effective heart rate, resulting in a low cardiac output state. In such instances, symptoms might include dizziness, near syncope, and syncope. Reduced stroke volume, may occasionally cause fatigue, exertional intolerance, dyspnea, and lightheadedness. 1 Regarding prognosis, ventricular ectopics can have an impact on prognosis and risk for sudden Background and objective: Ventricular ectopic beats (extra systoles, premature beats) are frequently found in healthy people. Ectopic beats in patients without apparent heart disease are more prominent at rest and disappear with exercise. Treatment is not necessary unless the patient is highly symptomatic. Methods: Patients having ventricular ectopic beats were assessed clinically, by ECG and by echocardiography. Those with normal structure hearts underwent exercise ECG and among those we selected 50 patients whose ectopics were suppressed by exercise then followed them for 5 years. The study started from 2000 to 2010. Results: During 5-year follow-up of the above mentioned patients, relevant complications such as dangerous ventricular arrhythmias, ischemic heart diseases or heart failure were not recorded."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion:", "text": "In patients having ventricular ectopic beats and structurally normal heart, the suppressibilty of the ectopic by exercise indicated their benign origin and may preclude further invasive investigations and even specific treatment.

Although they have no prognostic significance in patients with a normal heart, their presence in patients with heart disease is often associated with poor outcome, e.g. in patients with a history of myocardial infarction, the presence of ventricular ectopics increases mortality. 2 Regarding treatment, in the absence of underlying heart disease, the presence of ventricular ectopics usually has no impact on longevity or limitation of activity. 3 As mentioned they are more prominent at rest and disappear with exercise. Treatment is not necessary unless the patient is highly symptomatic, in which case B-blockers can be used. In patients with structural heart disease, frequent ventricular ectopics and runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia have prognostic significance and may portend an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. However, no study has documented that elimination of ventricular ectopics with anti arrhythmic drug therapy reduces the risk of arrhythmic death in patients with severe structural heart disease. In fact, drug therapies that slow myocardial conduction and/or enhance dispersion of refractoriness can actually increase the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias despite being effective at eliminating ventricular ectopics. 5 The aim of the study was not to subject patients with premature ventricular ectopic to further invasive investigation especially to angiography if by the available non-invasive investigations the heart appeared structurally normal and if their ectopic were suppressed by exercise and thus reassure the patient.\nThey were assessed clinically, by ECG and echocardiography. Only those patients with structurally normal hearts were studied and followed. These were 50 patients, their age ranged from 30-60 years and 37 were males 13 were females. The following steps were done with each patient: 1-History taking and apart from presenting symptoms, special emphasis was made on the presence of heart disease like coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, hypertensive heart disease or heart failure or conditions precipitating heart diseases like thyrotoxicosis and any patient with the above mentioned diseases or precipitating factors was excluded (exclusion criteria). Moreover, any patients having prolonged drug ingestion-whatever and herbal or any suspicious drug intake was also excluded. 2-Physical examination was performed with especial emphasis on pulse examination, high blood pressure, displaced apex, thrills, soft or loud first heart sound, loud or split second heart sound and any murmur. The presence of any such signs excluded the patient from the study. 3-Then, ECG was done, and apart from ventricular ectopics, any abnormality like T-inversion or Q wave excluded the patient. i.e. their ECG were of normal baseline waves ,segments and complexes. 4-Next, chest x-ray was taken in order to exclude any patient with cardiomegaly or pulmonary congestion. 5-Later, echocardiography was done so that any patient with abnormal echocardiography was excluded. Lastly, for those with normal heart, we did formal treadmill exercise ECG, (on the assumption mentioned above that ventricular ectopic beats in otherwise healthy subjects are more prominent at rest and disappear with exercise). Those with non-suppressible ectopics or with positive exercise were also excluded. Finally, we were left only with those patients whose ectopics were suppressed by exercise.

It has also been used to evaluate ventricular arrhythmias as early as 1927. The conventional impression is that ventricular ectopics that are not provoked by exercise or reduce in activity during exercise can be regarded as \"\"benign\"\" and not of clinical significance. However, this notion has not been subjected to detailed scientific examination. 6 Early studies did not establish an association between exercise induced ventricular ectopic and prognosis over a relatively short follow up period (of around five years). Regarding long term prognosis, the results of studies are different, as in Jouven et al study (after 23 years of follow-up) 7 and offspring of the original Framingham study participants 8 (15 year study). A meta-analysis and systematic review to determine the long-term prognostic significance of premature ventricular complexes in adults without clinically apparent heart diseases concludes that most studies on ventricular ectopics prognosis in \"normal hearts\" did not use advanced tests to rule out structural heart diseases. Among these patients, ventricular ectopics are associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes if the patients are older and have higher cardiovascular risk, suggesting that the poor prognosis studies may have inadvertently included patients with occult structural heart disease, the population in which ventricular ectopics are known confer adverse outcomes. 9 While the study on a cohort of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) 10 reported that the presence of ventricular ectopics identified on a rest two-minute ECG rhythm strip was associated with a high risk for sudden death in apparently healthy subjects over a 7.5 year follow-up. Similar outcomes were reported in apparently healthy subjects in the Framingham Heart Study 11 whereby ventricular ectopics were associated with a twofold increase in the risk of all cause mortality, myocardial infarction and cardiac death. These results have been criticized for the lack of rigorous measures to exclude underlying heart disease which may have confounded the outcomes. Pertaining to our study, which is centered on ventricular ectopics in persons with normal hearts and suppressed by exercise which is regarded as \"benign\" ectopics as they have been mentioned earlier, that \"Ectopic beats in patients with otherwise normal hearts are more prominent at rest and disappear with exercise\", 4 K.Orth-Gomer et el 12 studied ectopic activity in 147 actively employed healthy men aged from 15 to 65 years who were examined by 24 hour Halter monitoring during their ordinary daily activities. During a six year follow up only two men died (from non-cardiac cause) and at necropsy neither had evidence of ischaemic heart disease or other cardiovascular disease. A study conducted by Kennedy 13 in 1985, suggested that in the absence of structural heart disease, even frequent and complex ventricular ectopics are associated with a benign prognosis. Alessandro Biffi et al 14 assessed 355 competitive athletes with ventricular arrhythmias on a 24-h ambulatory (Holter) ECG that was obtained because of either palpitations, the presence of \u22653 premature ventricular depolarization on resting 12-lead ECG, or both. They found that frequent and complex ventricular tachyarrhythmia are common in trained athletes and are usually unassociated with underlying cardiovascular abnormalities. Such ventricular tachyarrhythmia (when unassociated with cardiovascular abnormalities) does not convey adverse clinical significance. This appears to be an expression of \"athlete\"s heart syndrome,\" and probably does not per se justify a disqualification from competitive sports. Busby et al 15 followed 1160 men and women ranging from 21 to 96 years of age from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging for a mean of 56 years. Cardiac events and all-cause mortality were not increased in the 80 subjects with frequent exercise-induced ventricular ectopics when compared with an age-and gendermatched control group. Mora et al 16 examined a cohort of 2994 asymptomatic women 30 to 80 years of age enrolled in the Lipid Research Prevalence study over 20 years of follow-up. There was no relationship between frequent exerciseinduced ventricular ectopics and all-cause mortality, but their presence did correlate to an increased risk of cardiovascular death. Ventricular ectopics are common in people with no structural heart disease. In this situation, the prognosis is generally excellent. Suppression of ventricular ectopics with anti arrhythmic medication is not indicated routinely, unless the patient is symptomatic or at risk of tachycardiainduced cardiomyopathy owing to the very high. 17 In the absence of heart disease and if ventricular ectopics are infrequent or reduce in frequency on exercise tolerance test, with no documented ventricular tachycardia, patients should be reassured and no specific treatment is required especially if they are relatively asymptomatic. If these fail B-blockers may be considered. There is no evidence to support the use of other antiarrhythmic agents simply for the sake of suppressing ventricular ectopics especially considering their pro arrhythmic (for example, flecainide) and other side effects (for example, amiodarone)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Ventricular ectopic beats in structurally normal heart (clinically by ECG and echocardiography) and suppressible by exercise needs only reassurance and probably no treatment is needed."}, {"section_title": "Conflicts of interest", "text": "The author reports no conflicts of interest."}]
