This shows an 80% reduction of peak runoff, which is illustrated in Figure 47. The simulation was continued with implementation of a bio-swale. Before the bioswale was implemented, the peak runoff rate was 0.05 CMS for a different area of the same measurement of 0.05 ha (500 m 2 ). After the bio-swale was implemented, the peak runoff rate was 0.00 CMS, producing a 100% reduction in peak runoff for that specific area.

Before implementation of the bio-swale, the total flow into the outlet was 1.37 CMS. After implementation of the bio-swale, the total flow into the outlet decreased to 1.35 CMS, a 1.46% reduction of inflow to the subcatchment outlet. The percentage decrease is not large but still illustrates how green infrastructure can impact many types of mechanisms within a system. The entire system was then analyzed, to get an overall essence of how green infrastructure works at a greater scale. Figure 49 shows the comparison between the runoff of the whole system before green infrastructure and the runoff from the system using two types of green infrastructure, one 1000m 2 bio-swale and one 500m 2 green roof. Green infrastructure implementation resulted in a 3.21% reduction in peak runoff for the system.    Another scenario was modeled for the system, where a 2500m 2 bio-swale and a 500m 2 green roof were implemented into the system. This resulted in a 5.95% decrease of peak system runoff, concluding that the more GI within the system, the less runoff there will be, decreasing the amount of flooding in the streets of Camden.

The bayside along New Jersey's barrier island communities is one of the nine high-risk areas for flooding along the Atlantic Coast according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Degener, R. 2015). It was also indicated that the sea level may rise approximately 1.5 meters by 2100 in Atlantic City (Degener, R. 2015). This high risk for Atlantic City creates the need for adaptive measures to be implemented to reduce the community's vulnerability to extreme storm events and increase resilience in response to such threats. Camden, New Jersey, along the Delaware River, is a highly threatened community as well. Camden is an urban community, with a combined sewer system and poor water management services that overflow continuously during a storm (Van Abs, Daniel J. 2014). Climate Central has projected a 1.28 meter rise above the local high tide line locally near Camden by 2100, from a 1992 baseline (Climate Central, 2016). The probability of the surrounding communities to be washed-out the next time a heavy storm presents itself is high, and advanced protective tactics need to be acknowledged. 2"}, {"section_title": "Scope of Study", "text": "1.

A warming climate has led to increased rates of melting of glaciers and thermal expansion of the ocean's water. This has increased the risk of coastal and inland flooding throughout much of the world. In the US, sea-level rise threatens infrastructure (i.e. bridges, transportation, dams, buildings, docks, etc.) and the economy. The Atlantic seaboard is highly prone to coastal flooding and has received billions of dollars in damage all along the coast due to tropical storms and hurricanes (NOAA 2014). A large portion of industry and commerce are vulnerable due to their location within the low-lying areas along the coast. Hurricane Sandy damaged hundreds of power lines, affecting more than 8 million residents in the United States (LiveScience, 2013). New York City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority received about 5 billion dollars for damages (Toro 2013) to maritime facilities (Smythe 2013) caused by Hurricane Sandy. Additionally, coastal counties contribute $6.6 trillion, or just under half of the country's gross domestic product, to the U.S. economy and are home to almost 40% of the U.S population (National Ocean Service 2014). This makes coastal communities extremely valuable to the country, meaning they need to be protected well and greatly managed. An extreme sea level rise event along the northeast coast of the United States, was recorded to be around 12 cm from 2009 to 2010 (Goddard, 2015), and it is evident that the coastal flood zone is becoming wider and deeper with the potential for more damage from storm surge and flooding. Specifically, the southern New Jersey coast is at high risk of 4 flooding, economic loss, and land depletion due to sea level rise caused by climate change and the isostatic rebound of the land after the retreat of glaciers from the last Ice Age. The bayside along New Jersey's barrier island communities are one of the nine high-risk areas for flooding along the North Atlantic Coast according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Gurnian, S. 2015). and a study done resulted in Atlantic City's sea level rise to about 1.5 meters by 2100 (Degener, R 2015). Additionally, an analysis done by Strauss et al (2014) projected a sea level rise of 0.39 meters in Atlantic City by 2050. Atlantic City is at high risk and needs resiliency planning methods to help reduce vulnerability to potential loss and destruction. Therefore, there is a need for information and analyses on the hazardous flooding issues that the city faces. Cutter (1996) has identified vulnerability as the combination of the physical risk and social response due to a hazard within a specific geographical area-'vulnerability by places.' Using the spatial distribution of flood risk, land use and people within the different flood-risk zones, Wu et al (2002) found that due to Cape May County's geographical location and its elevation of only 3 m above mean sea level, storm surges and sea level rise were major issues that have to be dealt with immediately. It was also found that the increase in sea level due to climatic change will increase the vulnerability of the county to coastal storms. One tool to evaluate the threatening conditions of a potential storm is the Sea Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricane (SLOSH) model. The SLOSH model estimates storm surge heights and winds from historical and predicted hurricanes (NHC 1999b what areas of the county would be inundated for a projected storm surge height, identifying 5 risk areas. Riverine and inland flooding was also taken into account based on Q3 flood data provided by FEMA (1996). Combining these major threats of destruction allowed the team to depict a more accurate physical characterization of the flood risk in the area. Not only was the physical exposure of flooding examined, but the social vulnerability of the community was identified as well. Variables such as population, housing units, number of females and other factors were examined within the study area. An overall flood vulnerability map was developed by dividing the overall vulnerability index into low, moderate, high and very high. It was concluded that climate change would have substantial impacts on the coastal communities and sea level rise would increase the risk in areas that were already at higher risk. These studies signify the need for more research to help mitigate such flooding hazards. Solutions need to be readily available to be implemented for all coastal communities that are at a potential for loss. While an understanding of the vulnerability of a community is crucial, it is also important to understand the fundamentals of community resilience. Resilience is the ability of a system to respond and recover from disasters and allows that system to absorb the impacts and cope with an event (Cutter et al., 2008). It has been suggested that resilience can be defined as a system's capacity to absorb disturbance and reorganize into a fully functioning system (Adger et al., 2005;Klein et al., 2003;Folke 2006 (Cutter, 2008). Within the DROP framework, recovery is an ongoing process within a community until it is fully back to its original or better state, where preparedness and mitigation including social learning can be improved. The DROP model provides a basis for all communities to learn from the hazardous events that are experienced and gives them an opportunity to improve their mitigation techniques. For example, if a community experiences a 10-year flood once, their absorptive capacity probably would not be exceeded, however, if they experience a 10-year flood every year in several consecutive years, then their resources will not be sufficient for effective coping responses. Additionally, there is a need for the use of high-resolution flood models in advance of implementation of any stormwater management system. The overall goal of this study was to compare national flood assessment models to an enhanced regional flood model and to illustrate how flood mitigation techniques can benefit areas threatened by flooding. A study done in Belgium along the lower part of the Ourthe River illustrated how micro-scale analyses for protective measures of threatened coastal communities, along rivers and oceans, is extremely important (Ernst et al. 2010.) The refined analysis allows focus to be set on assets such as structures, buildings and facilities and shows the effectiveness of potential local measures for inundated areas in the community. This study took advantage of available data that characterized each building's vulnerability and used a two-dimensional flow model to provide high-resolution maps of flooding. The availability of high resolution and highly accurate topographic datasets in several countries have allowed the researchers in Belgium to collect significant data from airborne laser altimetry (LIDAR) and echo-sonar techniques. Using this exceptional quality of topographic data and a fine-scale grid as fine as 2-m by 2-m enables modeling at such a scale to individually pinpoint streets and houses rather than a larger grid that generalizes a vast area used by existing national models. This study's fine-scale model was so precise that when compared to historic flood events, observed data and numerical predictions from the simulation were in agreement, validating the uniqueness and consistency of high-resolution modeling. This study showed by using a fine-scale approach, the deduction of flood impacts and destruction could be made and there was an understanding about the level of effects a potential storm scenario will bring. This study used hydrological data from a statistical analysis of discharges measured at a nearby tide gauge for the hydraulic boundary conditions and found inundation depths and velocity components for each considered discharge. The researchers were also able to apply their exposure evaluation equation to the analysis and determine exclusive results. The data shows a detailed spatial distribution of affected residential and non-residential buildings for a 154-year flood, with the water depth in each area, where each type of building is located. The results also showed that for discharge values lower than the 100-year flood, not many houses undergo flooding with a water depth higher than 1.3 m but there is an increase in the number of houses flooded by less than 0.3 m and even more of an increase in houses flooded with a water depth in between 0.3 m and 1.3 m. In contrast, for discharge values higher than 1000 m3/s, the number of houses flooded by less than 1.3 m decreased, revealing that for such extreme storm events, even buildings located at the edge of the inundation extent undergo flooding with significantly greater water depths (Ernst et al. 2010). This crucial information that was found validates the importance and impending reputation that fine-scaled hydraulic modeling has. Another study done by the same researchers also endorsed the need for fine-scale hydraulic modeling to make accurate predictions and forecasts. This study took place along the Dendre River in Belgium (Ernst et al. 2010.) The hydraulic model provided the user with great detail and precision, due to the quality of scale and topography using laser altimetry. This type of modeling takes current configuration to a higher level, in displaying the exact depth of flood that a house will endure. The spatial resolution of this model ranges from 4 m to 1 m and is coupled with supreme high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs), which provides the user with a very impressive layout. For example, for validation purposes, the flood of January 28th, 1995 was modeled in the fine-scaled hydraulic modeling software. The peak discharge of the storm evaluated at 180 m3/s. After pertinent parameters were set in place, that same peak discharge value was inputted into the model corresponding to a 15-year return period. The predicted spatial pattern of the flood using the modeling software matched the observational pattern flawlessly. Another The frequency of hurricanes and storm surges seems to be increasing due to the climate changing and sea level rising as coastal communities are becoming extremely vulnerable to the flooding produced by these heavy storms. Camden, New Jersey, an underprivileged urban community with a combined sewer system needs resiliency plans set in place to mitigate the potential for damage due to the vulnerability of the community. risk by midcentury and a 100% risk by 2100 that a flood will reach and exceed 4 feet. Even the slightest increase in sea level rise makes rare floods more common because it adds to the tides and storm surges. The increase in sea level will essentially cause more sustained extreme storm surges and increased coastal erosion, damaging and affecting many parts of local communities along a waterbody. The city of Camden contains a combined sewer system in an urbanized area and is parallel to the Delaware River, both causing problems during severe storm events. The combined sewer system carries sanitary sewage and stormwater through the same system to a treatment facility. When there is a rainfall event, it's likely that total wastewater flows will exceed the capacity of the system, which then overflows into nearby streams, lakes, and roads. Any rainfall event affects the Delaware River for two reasons, water quality and flooding. If the event is large enough, contaminants will be discharged into the river as well as the water level will rise onto the surface and flood a particular area within the city. For example, a slow moving system dropped about four to six inches of rainfall on portions of the south-central New Jersey area on July 12-13 in 2004 (DRBC, 2015). More than a foot of rainfall was measured in some locations and as a result, 25 roads were closed and hundreds of residents had to evacuate. In the south central New Jersey area, a total of 17 dams were either partially or totally breached and countless numbers of streams flooded their banks. Being a county flood disaster zone, Camden County was made eligible for federal aid. Events like these are on a continuous climb for the future and preventative measures are crucial. Due to the climate changing which is affecting water levels, communities need to be prepared and increase their resilience towards climatic disasters. Urban communities like Camden are at higher risk for flood damage because of their infrastructure, increased impervious surfaces that do not allow stormwater to drain, and its economic status. It is one of the poorest cities in the United States (MetroFocus, 2012) and because of this, storm preparation and resiliency has not been a priority for the community. This is a problem due to the probable increase in frequency of severe storms, which will cause more damage to the city. There was a case study done on the Caribbean island of St Maarten where key elements of disaster management planning were used. The concept of a 'digital city' was explored, which is a way to improve the preparation for natural disasters. Resiliency is a quick recovery characteristic of a city or community. Preparation for a natural disaster, prevention for hazards from developing and reducing the effects of a disaster are all key components to resiliency planning. The 'digital city' method includes the application of Decision making support systems can be combined with data and modeling systems to increase resiliency and provide warnings of hindering disasters (Price, R.K and Vojinovic, Z. 2008). The monitoring system combined with an effective modeling system can form a basis for a reliable decision support system which has a few major functions. These functions include improved ways of determining risks and implementing mitigation techniques, the compilation of all data and modeling systems being used as reliable forecasts for a warning system and another function is system to be used as a tool for education programs to intrigue the public. These functions make it very obvious that there is a need for such technological advances and digital data to develop effective plans and communicate accurate information to the public. The main focus of the 'digital city' concept is creating an environment in which users responsible for various aspects of the disaster management plan are permitted to appreciate various flood-related problems and as a result to make better judgements, improved decisions and efficient action plans through the decision support tools provided (Price, R. K. and Vojinovic, Z. 2008). building. The environment is extremely important and with these strategies, many problems can be solved. One of the main objectives of this paper is assessing the effectiveness of green infrastructure to mitigate the impacts due to severe storm events. Likewise, Versini et al (2015) have completed research to assess green roofs from building scale to basin scale; to understand if similar implementation of green roofs will affect the entire basin in such a way. Green roof coverage is expanding; so much, that 10 km2 of green roof coverage is starting to happen in Germany (Lassalle,2012). Green roofs are specific elements to the urban city where there is nowhere left for infrastructure. Green roofs contribute to the aesthetic worth of a building, they reduce the heat island effect, protect biodiversity, and manage urban runoff. There are numerous beneficial effects of green roofs, let alone the whole umbrella of green infrastructure. The main performance of green roofs is stormwater management, reducing annual runoff and peak volume, as well as managing the rainfall intensity and water quality. During a yearlong experiment in New Zealand, where six different areas from 10 to 50m 2 were placed with green roofs on Auckland University. The results found 66% of precipitation was retained and a peak flow reduction ranged from 31%-100% within six of the different areas. Another surface in Genoa, Italy was covered, 350 m 2 was divided into two plots, and after 6 months, the results shows volume retained of 10%-100% and a peak flow reduction ranging from 80%-100%. These studies illustrate the effectiveness of green roofs alone, supporting research to go one step further and explore the success of green roofs at a basin scale as well. Versini et al used SWMM 5.0 to conduct their research. For their case study, Hatsde-Seine, France was modeled. It is a highly populated and urbanized area with 1.5 million inhabitants within a 176 km2 area. Their stormwater system is extremely sensitive due to the rapid growth in the early 90's and is prone to local flooding. The Chatillon basin was split into several sub-basins, each sub-basin having an infiltration area and then an impervious area where a green-roof was implemented. The impacts of the green roof scale showed an expected reduction in the hydrological response; the higher the covering, the higher the reductions of peak discharge and volume. Results showed that at the roof scale, reductions of peak discharge and runoff volume are of the same order of magnitude; 12.5% covering of the roof resulted in about 10% reduction, 25% covering resulted in about 20% reduction, 50% of covering resulted in about 40% reduction and 100% of green roof covering resulted in about 85% reduction of hydrologic responses. At a basin scale, from a green roof covering of 12.5%, there was an average of 4.9% runoff reduction, and a 25% covering of green roof showed an average increase in reduction of 9%. With 50% green roof covering, there was an average peak discharge of 18.6% and 100% green roof covering averaged a reduction of 35.6%. This supports the suggestion that the more green-covering on eligible buildings, the more reduction there will be. The conclusions of this study show that the amount of precipitation is a limiting factor for the workability of the green roof, both at a building and basin scale. The higher the precipitation, the less of a hydrological impact there will be from the green roofs, but overall the green roofs are successful in their purpose. Camden has already initiated a plan of action to help support its current and future flooding issues. The Camden SMART Initiative (Stormwater Management and Resource Training) was formed to improve the quality of life and environmental and economic health of the City of Camden (CCMUA, 2011). They support a green stormwater infrastructure approach, which will be environmentally and economically beneficial to remediate the urban community and its waterways. This initiative is a collaboration between the City of between so many individuals has helped revitalize the community with green infrastructure projects and programs. These programs are benefiting the city by preventing neighborhood flooding, reducing combined sewer overflows, improving air and water quality, and much more. There have been forty-five completed projects since 2011, capturing 61.2 MG of stormwater each year. There are no projects in the process currently, but continued research will prove that green infrastructure will help the community for the future environmentally and economically.  Three areas were analyzed in Atlantic City. One area is a vacant lot next to the channel, with homes and docks located further up the channel. This area was specifically chosen due to the high flooding that it receives when a storm hits, and because of the risk in the area for potential sea level rise. The second area that was analyzed consists of a strip of two-story homes right along the channel with ownership of boats. This area is highly vulnerable due to its low resilient characteristics of little to no flood barrier implementation or green infrastructure. The third area of Atlantic City that was analyzed, like the previous area, is highly prone to flooding, which has been shown on sea level rise risk maps provided by Climate Central and NOAA as well. The third area has been chosen due to the high risk of inundation in the area during severe storms. Figure 2 shows these three areas of interested showcased in this study.  24 points in the first study area are about 20m apart, the points in the second study area are about 5m apart and the third set of points in the third study area are about 40m apart. The reason for the different distances of points is to show that even with points 40m apart to as close as 5m apart, there will be a different depth of inundation and fine-scale modeling is precise enough to illustrate that characteristic.   This portion of the large city was chosen due to the high level of flooding that occurs in this area, as shown in Figure 5, which illustrates the hotspots of Camden.   To understand the details of the process, the firm basics had to be acknowledged first. Before the modeling process could begin, the subject area needed to be displayed in ArcMap.

Data on land-use were used with surface elevation data to estimate roughness values for channels and overland areas. The model used inland and ocean boundaries represented as water surface elevation over a specified time. However, observed data for the ocean boundary were not available, therefore model calibration was done using tide data available from two USGS tidal gages. One tidal gage, USGS gage 01410600 (Gage 1) Absecon Channel at Atlantic City, NJ (39\u00b022'40\", 74\u00b025'25\"), was located near the ocean boundary, and the second tidal gage, USGS gage 01410510 (Gage 2) Absecon Creek at Absecon, NJ (39\u00b025'23\", 74\u00b030'00\"), was located at the inland boundary, where the locations are shown in Figure 10.

The localized area that was modeled in SWMM was 0.148 km 2 , divided into 26 subcatchments. Once proper information was collected, the modeling of the network was done. Measurements of the lengths of the pipes were implemented as well as the maximum depths for each junction and each subcatchment drained into its appropriate inlet. Units were set to CMS for uniformity.  After all the parameters were implemented, two low impact development (LID) controls were then implemented into the program as well. A green roof control and a bioswale control were each created. Figures 15 and 16 shows the parameters for each control. The units are in millimeters, and the parameters were chosen due to examples through literature. These controls were applied after simulations were run without green infrastructure implementation to see the nature of the area first. Then, the green roof control was added to the system to see its effects during a storm. After the simulation was run with the green roof control, the bio-swale control was used to see the significance of implementing a bioswale in an appropriate area. After both controls were used separately, the entire system was analyzed using both LID controls at the same time to show the effects of numerous green infrastructure mechanisms.

Once the data and water level presented at Gage 1 (location of Gage 1 shown in Figure 7) matched the observed data at Gage 1 from the USGS database, then the linear relationship was successfully formed between the two boundaries and an equation could be created for any type of event. A regression equation was developed relating the ocean boundary water surface elevation to observed water surface elevation at Gage 1.

This illustrates that no other interpretation can be made except for the fact that having no available data hinders accuracy, where TUFLOW has data at every point that flooded.

The different flood depths are not equated to a certain point but a large area that covers too many different points to be able to get a specific outcome. TUFLOW analyzes data on a point-to-point basis, allowing the flood to simulate a pattern at each point, instead of an only a large area. Since there were no data available for a couple of the points selected, the second study area was compared using HAZUS and TUFLOW. These points are about 5 m apart. As shown in Figure 21, the HAZUS grid is large enough to include three different points in the same depth of inundation, whereas TUFLOW allows for a separate depth to be apparent.

To assess the exposure to the hurricane surge, a spatial analysis was conducted using the SLOSH model.      have such limited resources and such a low-resolution grid, that the worst-case scenarios presented seem to overestimate more than enough for decent results. These results can also be discussed in reference to a study performed by Katehis (2015) where Superstorm Sandy was analyzed and the map clearly shows the places missed on the East shoreline by HAZUS that shows flooding using the other models presented. These varied results are due to miscalculations of flood surface geometry, resulting in \"gaps\" in the flood data. This determination of gaps is supported in this current study, where gaps within HAZUS and SLOSH data are shown (Figure 25). These gaps come to show that it is important to have real data and true simulation data to create an accurate prediction of storm behavior. Even with such a large grid to predict storm values, depending on   Three points rather than just one point on the map were chosen to be analyzed due to the vast possibilities of flood patterns that can happen within the same vicinity. The three points are shown to give a better visual of the possible effects in more than one area at a time. Flood depth at each point shown in Figure 27 was very different despite the proximity of the locations to each other ( Figure 28). The storm event on April 30, 2014 generated the tides from the bays and ocean to rise and increase the depth of the water to flood onto land, with a maximum depth of 0.647 meters of water on the surface (Figure 28). The three different points were at three different elevations of .67 m above sea level, 0.806 and 1.17 respectively. Where the water is flowing from and how high the elevation is, affects the inundation at these points. For example, Point 1 is at a higher elevation than Point 2, but had a higher maximum flood depth. Many factors can cause this to happen such as the type of land cover before that point, possibly slowing down flow and mitigating flooding conditions before it gets to the point being analyzed. When studying the area, Point 2 has taller grasses that can infiltrate more water as well as a dock resisting some water flow to that point, whereas Point 1 has low grasses and no structures in the path of water flow. This causes Point 1 to have a higher flood depth level than Point 2. Even though the three points are very close in proximity, they still hold different characteristics, where flood features will be different in each particular position. particular storm. They would be able to know if the waters of that storm were going to encroach on their land or not, and have a better description than other existing models. This model gives precise numbers in high resolution so predictions are more clear and accurate. These results validate the argument to use fine-scale modeling as a stepping-stone towards resiliency planning. Without such localized models, predictions and estimations will not be correct or beneficial for future preparation. This area was also analyzed with a levee with rainfall and a levee with no rainfall, to examine if creating a levee in the study areas would help mitigate flooding from such storm. Figure 29 shows a definite decrease in flooding when implementing a levee. Figure   30 shows a decrease as well, but only a slight decrease with rainfall included.

This area is highly vulnerable due to its low resilient characteristics of little to no infrastructure protection. The graph in Figure 37 shows the flooding pattern of three points within the area of interest. These points were in proximity of about 5 m apart, to show a different range. Even in a different area, these three points still have different flood depths when using the fine-scale hydraulic model. Point 3 67 Figure 37 shows the flood pattern of three points in Study Area 2. This area has a smaller depth of inundation, at a maximum of 0.372 meters. This is due to the higher elevation of these points compared to the previous study area points. The complete analysis was done, comparing models of just the storm, the storm with a levee but no rainfall, and the storm with a levee and rainfall. Figure 38 illustrates this area with a levee but no rainfall. As expected, the levee does a tremendous job decreasing the flood depth from the storm surge. The maximum inundation level with the 2m levee put in place is 0.026 meters, which almost a half a meter decrease of water. Figure 39 shows the simulation done with a levee put in place and rainfall inputted into the system.  Figure 39 shows a large increase in inundation at all three points in the second study area, due to the poor drainage of the area. The levee forces the rainwater to accumulate, without letting it drain out. With a proper drainage system, putting a levee in place for storm surge protection would be a suggestion in this area, but only if a new drainage system could be built or a pump to pump out the excess rainwater, since Figure 38 shows tremendous success for the levee against the ocean tide."}, {"section_title": "Fifth Analysis.", "text": "Due to time constraints and limitations within the capacity of the computer, a full analysis using a 1m by 1m grid or less was unachievable. But, a simple analysis to show the refinement of using such a small grid was able to be developed. The simulation ran for one week due to the 0.025 time step for the 1 m by 1 m grid because otherwise, the simulation would go unstable with a larger time step. Since the grid is so small, the time step needed to be extremely small as well to be able to capture the flow through such small cells. So due to the longevity of the simulation, the time input was only 4 hours of flow rather than the full 14 hours in the previous studies. In addition to the 1 m by 1 m grid simulation, a comparison of the four grids used in this study was done. Figure 40 shows the different grid sizes used comparing a 10 m grid to the 1 m grid and to the national model grids. Area 3, shown in Figure 3, using a 1 m grid versus using a 10 m grid. The reason for a slight difference in numbers is due to the higher resolution of grid being used. This shows that the data can get very precise with a finer grid. There is a maximum flood depth of 0.88 in Figure 41 and a maximum of 0.76 m in Figure 42     Three points were chosen to be analyzed rather than one due to the vast possibilities of flood patterns that can happen within an area of a few meters when using different modeling programs. The more information we have about a vast area being flooded, the more of an understanding we will have to pose a solution. Figure 45 shows the same points on an image with a combined inundation map of HAZUS-MH and SLOSH data.  Points 1 2 and 3 in Figure 45 were analyzed in SMS, to understand the flooding pattern at a finer scale. This technique was also used to compare TUFLOW resolution to HAZUS and SLOSH, which use greater resolution for their data and information. The three points analyzed are very close together to show the difference between different scaled models. The green shading represents SLOSH data for a Category 1 storm and the purple shading represents HAZUS data that correlates to a Category 1 storm, using data for a 100year return period. Figure 46 is the graph that compares all three programs, TUFLOW, HAZUS and SLOSH. HAZUS and SLOSH only generate flood models at a larger scale. Fine-scale models allows for the flood to simulate a pattern at each point, where national models only allow for a large area at the same flood depth to be calculated. The information provided to HAZUS and SLOSH, as well as their internal capabilities don't give the programs a fine enough grid to work with. shows that TUFLOW and HAZUS are much more comparable than TUFLOW and SLOSH, which is sensible because SLOSH resolution is much greater than both HAZUS and TUFLOW. The concentration on these findings show that TUFLOW goes further into precision than HAZUS does using a smaller grid, where each point has a different flood depth rather than each certain square meter. The focus for this part of the research was to ensure green infrastructure capabilities. The first approach and emphasis was on the building scale, to see effects of a green roof on a building before and after its implementation. A subcatchment with a 100% impervious area of 0.05 ha (500 m 2 ) was chosen. The simulation was run with no LID controls first. The results showed a peak runoff rate for the specified subcatchment to be 0.05 CMS. Then, a green roof LID control was set in place for that same subcatchment."}, {"section_title": "80", "text": "Chapter 5 Summary, Conclusion and Recommendations"}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The information in this study illustrates how the increase in storm events, sea level rise and storm surges are of high concern in the subjected areas and more than just current models are needed for prevention and planning. When comparing and combining TUFLOW, HAZUS, and SLOSH models, we can get a large scale representation of hurricane and flooding impacts, as well as a finer scale representation of what is happening. TUFLOW allows the implementation of real time data into boundaries and depicts what happens when the tide levels increase. HAZUS and SLOSH are able to predict damages and losses related to a type of storm but just using national models with a coarse resolution will not help a community become resilient to climatic hazards. It is important to use high-resolution modeling and data for climatic predictions and resilience. It is crucial to create fine-scale models before implementation of any stormwater management system in a community for cost and safety reasons. When damage is under-predicted, the impacts of the storm event are devastating as well as if the damage is over-predicted; the community wastes an immense amount of money on unnecessary materials. The differences between TUFLOW, HAZUS and SLOSH are the resolution and estimation of the flood level. As shown in Figure 24, due to the low resolution of HAZUS and SLOSH, there are designated large areas with the same values of water level, which is not accurate. These coarser models tend to overestimate the storm and do not allow communities to completely understand the forecast of the storm 81 happening in their area. TUFLOW allows high-resolution data to designate fine areas with a certain value, giving a more accurate representation of the storm predicted in coastal communities. The need for high-resolution analysis is crucial when considering flood impact on threatened communities. The results show how SLOSH and HAZUS are based on such large grid sizes that there are inconsistencies with these model outputs. The large grid of these national models allows for gaps as well as a broad estimation for different points on the surface to receive the same amount of inundation, which is very inaccurate. These results can also be discussed in reference to a study performed by Katehis (2015) It is likely that a similar explanation can be made for gaps in Atlantic City and Camden from HAZUS and SLOSH data for Hurricane Irene inundation predictions. The presence of these data gaps show that it is important to have high resolution elevation data and observed data for use with simulations, i.e. tide gauge data and historical precipitation data to create a more accurate prediction of storm flooding. Even with such a large grid to predict storm values, depending on topographic data and the default settings within the program, important information still may not be conveyed. Green infrastructure is the second part of this research. Green infrastructure nourishes cities environmentally and increases its resiliency to climatic disasters as well. It is used all over the globe because it is very important to maintain effectiveness and efficiency within such an urban city. In highly developed urban regions such as Camden, NJ, low lying areas within the city fill up due to an abundance of impervious materials used for city structure, when those spots normally would be able to drain naturally. Due to this fill up, any stormwater and runoff gets directed into storm and sewer systems, overflowing and mixing raw sewage with clean water. This contaminated water lies all over the parking lots, sidewalks and driveways, eventually making its way to streams and oceans. Implementing rain gardens and bio-swales is a simpler and cheaper solution to help mitigate flooding. It's a technique that the city has already implemented within their Camden Smart Program which can expand to applying green roofs and bio-swales into their projects as well."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Community members need accurate and reliable models for a foundation of their understanding or the community will not be readily prepared for a climatic hazard. The need for fine-scale modeling before coastal resiliency tactics are implemented in threatened coastal communities like Atlantic City is apparent as national and regional coarse scale models can lead to inaccurate information for design and lack of consistency. With climate change, the frequency of storms is increasing, and resiliency methods against such 83 threatening climatic events are crucial for coastal communities. Results indicate that, using fine scale modeling, the catastrophic flood risk will be known more accurately, and potential solutions will be able to be presented quicker and more correctly, than with a coarse-scale estimation using the current national models. More accurate predictions allow the community to prepare more cost effective solutions. Awareness is crucial part in resiliency planning and without explicit advanced modeling and research, no community will be responsive to the dangers ahead. The study provided illustrates how storm events are of high concern in the subjected area presented, and the great flooding potential within Atlantic City and Camden City. This research promotes the need for dual resiliency tactics such as fine-scale modeling and green infrastructure to be implemented in threatened communities. With fine-scale modeling, flooding is able to be tracked at a much finer scale and the modeling capability allows for greater resiliency for the community. Green infrastructure implementation is cost effective, environmentally friendly and fairly easy to implement. The usefulness of green infrastructure is endless, from filtering out contaminants to storing water and infiltrating it through the ground. They mimic natural drainage systems by using such materials as roots of the plants and layers of gravel, soil and mulch to filter the water seeping into the ground. Figures in 47-50 show the benefits of implementing green infrastructure into urban regions. Figure 47 shows an 80% decrease in runoff by implementing a green roof, and even better results by using a bio-swale for a 100% decrease in runoff. System runoff is a much smaller decrease, but at such a large scale there are many more components such as impervious area that affect the outcome. The evidence is supportive to the fact that green infrastructure will help urban cities with 84 the climatic threats of climate change and sea level rise and the use of fine scale modeling combined will create a great mitigation technique to reduce flooding and its negative impacts."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Recommendations", "text": "Due to the RAM capacity of the computer that was being used for the first year and a half of this study, certain amount of data were unable to be imported into the model interface.

A third issue with the computer's minimal capacity created a problem when generating the grid for the model. The capability of the model that was run is high functioning and very fine.
