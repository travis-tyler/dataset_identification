[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The complex array of basins and channels of the Maritime Continent, including the Indonesian seas, forms the only tropical interocean exchange pathway of the global ocean. They provide a conduit for Pacific Ocean to reach into the Indian Ocean, forming a key component of the larger-scale ocean and climate systems. During the Arlindo Mixing program of 1993-1998, the primary pathways of the flow from the Pacific to Indian Ocean through the Indonesian seas were identified (Gordon & Fine, 1996;Ilahude & Gordon, 1996; Figure 1). Makassar Strait, with a sill depth of 680 m (Gordon, Giulivi, & Ilahude, 2003; Figure 1), serves as the westernmost deep pathway of what is referred to as the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF; Wajsowicz et al., 2003). The Makassar Strait throughflow channels North Pacific water into Lombok Strait and into the Banda Sea via the Flores Sea. The Makassar Strait throughflow is joined by inflow via the eastern passages of Maluku Sea and Halmahera Sea and water drawn from the South China Sea via within Karimata Strait. The eastern pathways mainly draw water from the South Pacific, experiencing substantial diapycnal mixing driven by strong tidal dissipation (Ffield & Gordon, 1992, 1996Koch-Larrouy et al., 2007, which significantly alter the thermohaline stratification profile within the Banda Sea (Ilahude & Gordon, 1996) before export to the Indian Ocean through the various passage of the Sunda Arc, primarily via the Timor Passage, Ombai Strait, and Lombok Strait (Atmadipoera et al., 2009;Hautala et al., 2001;. In late 1996, as part of the Arlindo Circulation program, two moorings were deployed in a restriction of Makassar Strait, the 45 km wide (at 50-m depth) Labani Channel (Figure 1), recording the ITF until mid-1998 (Ffield et al., 2000;Gordon et al., 1999;Susanto & Gordon, 2005). In 2004, the Labani Channel moorings were redeployed as part of the International Nusantara Stratification and Transport program (INSTANT) 2004(INSTANT) -2006 (Gordon et al., 2008(Gordon et al., , 2010 for the first time to simultaneously monitor the multiple pathways of the ITF. Upon the termination of the INSTANT program in December 2006, the Labani Channel time series was continued as the Monitoring the ITF (MITF; Gordon et al., 2012;Susanto et al., 2012), which has been maintained to the present, with the last mooring recovery and data downloading in August 2017 and redeployment in November 2017. We now have 13.3 years (not counting time gaps) of Makassar throughflow time series: November 1996 to early July 1998; January 2004 to August 2011; and August 2013 to August 2017. The Makassar throughflow time series reveals that Makassar Strait throughflow averages 12 to 13 Sv, representing~77% of the total ITF, Figure 1.

The X symbol in Makassar Strait marks the position of the current measuring mooring in Labani Channel: at 2\u00b051\u2032 S; 118\u00b028\u2032 E and water depth of 2,137 m. The topographic sill of the Makassar throughflow is 680 m at the Dewakang Sill (Gordon, Giulivi, & Ilahude, 2003). based on the ratio of the Makassar Strait throughflow to the other passages recorded during INSTANT 2004(Gordon et al., 2010. The time series displays temporal fluctuations over a broad range of scales, from intraseasonal, associated with Rossby and Kelvin Waves from the Sulawesi Sea and Indian Ocean, respectively (Pujiana et al., 2009(Pujiana et al., , 2012(Pujiana et al., , 2013, intraseasonal fluctuations induced by Madden-Julian Oscillations (MJO) passing over the Maritime Continent (Napitu, 2017;Shinoda et al., 2016), to seasonal (monsoonal) and interannual (ENSO) scales (Gordon et al., 2010(Gordon et al., , 2012Susanto et al., 2012). As is the nature of a time series, knowledge of a phenomenon grows as the time series lengthens, capturing lower frequency oscillations as well as anomalous or extreme events, offering a window to the ITF coupling to the larger-scale ocean and climate systems, including heat and freshwater inventories within the Pacific and Indian Oceans. We now present an overview of the characteristics of the Makassar throughflow revealed by the 13.3-year time series, with emphasis on the recent period, August 2013 to August 2017, not previously reported in the published literature."}, {"section_title": "The Makassar Data", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Arlindo, December 1996 to July 1998", "text": "As part of the Indonesian-U.S. Arlindo program, velocity was measured at various depths within Makassar Strait, at two moorings, MAK-1 (2\u00b052\u2032 S, 118\u00b027\u2032 E) and MAK-2 (2\u00b051\u2032 S; 118\u00b038\u2032 E), at a separation of 19.4 km, deployed within the Labani Channel, and a 2,000-m-deep, 45-km-wide constriction as measured at the 50-m isobath (Smith & Sandwell, 1997; http://topex.ucsd.edu/marine_topo/) in Makassar Strait (Gordon et al., 1999).

Caveats (1) The transport for the entire 13.3 years of time series (Figure 2a \nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans capture the Makassar Strait throughflow for the entire 13.3 years. Gordon et al. (2008) report that the INSTANT ratios of the Mak-East to Mak-West speeds average 0.95 (surface layer), 0.84 (midthermocline), and 0.76 (lower thermocline), which is consistent with the Arlindo observations (Gordon et al., 1999;Susanto & Gordon, 2005). The transport reported by Gordon et al. (2008) used an average of Mak-West and Mak-East velocity above 800 m. Using just the western site might lead to slightly higher transport but would not affect the transport variability since the Mak-West to Mak-East ratio does not vary significantly. (2) The average orientation of Labani Channel is 170\u00b0. The speed and transport values reported here are the flow directed along the 170\u00b0Labani Channel axis. Negative values denote flow toward the south. The mean directionality of the flow varies slightly with depth, albeit less than the Standard Deviation (Figure 2b) falling in the 152\u00b0to158\u00b0slightly to eastward than the Labani Channel orientation, suggesting that the throughflow within Labani Channel must rotate southward as it transits through channel, as discussed by Metzger et al. (2010). To be consistent with previous studies, we present the speeds toward 170\u00b0. The difference in this speed to that of along 155\u00b0is minor, about 3-4% over all.\n\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans Gruenburg and Gordon (2018) report that following a rapid increase from 2006 to 2008, the southward Makassar HF Anomaly (HFa; relative to the average HF during the 2004-2017 observational period) peaks at 0.13 PW during 2008 and 2009. A subsequent slow decrease of Makassar HFa culminates in a \u22120.25 PW (less southward) minimum during 2015, followed by an increase. Gruenburg and Gordon (2018) find, at interannual time scales, that the vertical structure of the transport represented by the variability in the depth-dependent velocity profile is the major determinant of HFa, accounting for 78% of the variance in HFa, whereas changes in the temperature profile account for 28%. The total depth-integrated volume transport can explain only 57% of HFa variance as it does not reflect the relative contributions of the contrasting temperature of the depth slabs above and below 300 m (Figure 2b, lower left panel).\n\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans The 2004-2017 0-to 760-m transport average is 12.5 Sv; the 0-to 300-m average about 9.1 Sv; the 300-to 760-m transport is 3.4 Sv, a ratio of~2.7 to 1. Thus, the upper 300 m supplies about 73% of the total Makassar throughflow or about 56% of the total ITF. During 2016, the ratio of the upper to the lower layers changed, reaching approximately 1:1 by mid-2016 ( Figure 5). In 2017, with the return of La Ni\u00f1a, the 0-300 increases to >10 Sv, but 300-to 760-m transport remains high ( Figure 5), driving the total transport to 20 Sv toward the end of the present time series in the summer of 2017.\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans During the entire time series, the average southward transport within the Makassar Strait ( Figure 5) averaged 12.5 Sv, with the upper 300 m, composed of water imprinted with the North Pacific temperature/salinity, water mass, and characteristics ( Figure 2c, lower panels), contributing 9.1 Sv (~73% of the total transport). The ratio of the transport between the upper 300-m slab and the transport within 300-to 760-m slab (noting the Makassar Strait sill depth is 680 m) averages 2.7 to 1 but exhibits seasonal and interannual fluctuations, attaining a 1:1 ratio in 2017. Interannual shifts in the ratio of the upper to lower layer transports are likely induced by the differences in the regions driving the transport, consistent with the depth-dependent water masses origins. The upper 300 m consisting of North Pacific water masses respond to the wind stress over the North Pacific (Li et al., 2018), whereas the lower slab composed of South Pacific water masses likely reflects factors from the greater realm. The southward transport within the Makassar Strait relaxed in 2014 and more so in 2015/2016 to less than 10 Sv (Figure 5), during a strong El Ni\u00f1o event (Figure 3a, lower panel), similar though not as extreme as during the strong El Ni\u00f1o event of 1997 (Gordon et al., 1999(Gordon et al., , 2008. Beginning in 2016 and extending into 2017 (the time series reported here extends only to August 2017), during a La Ni\u00f1a state, the Makassar Strait throughflow increased to~20 Sv. The fluctuations of the Makassar Strait throughflow reported here eventually spread across the Indian Ocean, affecting its heat and freshwater inventory. The Indian Ocean is likely just not a passive reactor to the Pacific forcing of the ITF but may feedback via to the Pacific (Yuan et al., 2011(Yuan et al., , 2013. Periods of La Ni\u00f1a increased ITF build up the heat inventory in the Indian Ocean (Lee et al., 2015). How does this feedback to the Pacific Ocean during a return to El Ni\u00f1o periods? This likely is related to the interplay between ENSO and the IOD, an active field of study (Sprintall & R\u00e9velard, 2014;van Sebille et al., 2014). As the time series grows, it capture the decadal and longer period fluctuations, presently investigated with reanalysis and model products (Feng et al., 2018;Li et al., 2018;Tillinger & Gordon, 2009). Many of the Makassar Strait throughflow features reported here will be the subject for future detailed analysis, with model comparison, including the ITF transport profile, to the spatial and temporal patterns of the largerscale ocean and climate systems."}, {"section_title": "Data Views", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Along-Channel Velocity Seasonal and Interannual Variability", "text": "Southward flow within Labani Channel of the Makassar Strait (Figure 2a) reaches a maximum during the boreal summer. Winter speeds are greatly reduced, often reaching zero or directed northward within the upper 100 m. The Makassar throughflow during 1997 was greatly diminished by an intense El Ni\u00f1o (Gordon et al., 1999), when sea level in the western tropical Pacific and associated Pacific to Indian Ocean pressure gradient was reduced (Clarke & Liu, 1994;Meyers, 1996;Wyrtki, 1987). During the persistent La Ni\u00f1a conditions of 2008-2010, southward flow intensified as the sea level in the western tropical Pacific was higher relative to El Ni\u00f1o conditions (Hu et al., 2015;. The repeated Expendable Bathythermograph (XBT) section between Western Australia and Java (Feng et al., 2018;Liu et al., 2015;Wijffels et al., 2008) enables an upper-ocean geostrophic estimate of the ITF to be made extending back 30 years, with salinity estimated from climatological temperature-salinity relationships. The analysis of these data confirms that the ITF increases during La Nina and decreases during El Nino, but this effect is often weakened by in-phase wind forcing in the Indian Ocean associated with the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD; Feng et al., 2018;Liu et al., 2015;Wijffels et al., 2008). The IOD is well coupled to ENSO but not always in-phase with ENSO (Cai et al., 2012;Chakravorty et al., 2014). Stuecker et al. (2017) find that about a third of IOD events occur independently of ENSO. As the pathway from Makassar Strait to the IX1 line is not confined to an advective \"pipe,\" a direct comparison of the Makassar Strait throughflow transport to that crossing the IX1 line (Feng et al., 2018) is not straightforward. Most of the Makassar throughflow enters the Banda Sea, which has~1-year residence time with strong vertical mixing before export into the Timor Sea of the eastern tropical Indian Ocean (Gordon et al., 2010). Additionally, the export from the Indonesian seas feeds into the South Equatorial Current and the Leeuwin Current pathways, which are likely not in-phase . Model studies  find that it takes 2 to 3 years for the Makassar throughflow to reach the IX1 region. The increased Makassar southward flow in 2008 and 2009 ( Figure 2a) may impact the IX1 transport in the 2010-2012 period. Perhaps the increased westward IX1 transport reported by Feng et al. (2018) in 2011 is a response to the Makassar Strait throughflow. Lee et al. (2015) report that cooling in the upper 700 m of the Pacific Ocean with commensurate heating of the Indian Ocean is linked to the increased ITF heat transport and may be related to the hiatus in global warming. The spreading of the ITF signal in the Indian Ocean is the topic for future research. The southward velocity maximum (V-max) of nearly 0.7 m/s on average occurs within the 100-to 120-m depth interval of the upper thermocline (Figure 2a and lower two panels of Figure 2c), leading to a cooler ITF than if the V-max fell within the warm surface layer . The mean annual salinity profile (Figure 2c) reveals that the V-max falls within the salinity maximum core, marking North Pacific Subtropical Water (Gordon & Fine, 1996;Ilahude & Gordon, 1996). The velocity at 300 m near the salinity minimum core of the North Pacific Intermediate Water, at the 10\u00b0C isotherm, is about half of that at the V-max."}, {"section_title": "Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans", "text": "The southward flowing subsurface V-max within the Labani Channel (upper panel of Figure 2c) is most intense during in the boreal summer, July through September, with a mean speed of~0.9 m/s, at a depth of~70 m. There is a slow buildup to the summer V-max, spanning the 5-month period from February to July, from the weaker and deeper V-max of November-January. In contrast, the transition from the strong July-September V-max of summer to the weak V-max of November-January spans only 2 months, October into November, with the V-max core descending to near 150 m at~0.5 m/s by December. The seasonality of the surface layer and V-max has been attributed to the winter injection of fresher, more buoyant surface layer water from the South China Sea and Java Sea into the southern Makassar Strait, which acts to inhibit southward pressure gradient and associated surface layer flow within Makassar Strait (the freshwater plug concept discussed by Gordon, Susanto, & Vranes, 2003;Gordon et al., 2012). The seasonal asymmetry of the freshwater plug buildup and decay may be a consequence the delayed injection of freshwater by river runoff from Kalimantan (Borneo). From a larger-scale prospective, seasonal and interannual shifts in the latitude of the North Equatorial Current (NEC) Bifurcation along the east coast of The Philippines (Kim et al., 2004;Qiu & Chen, 2010;Qiu & Lukas, 1996;Qu & Lukas, 2003;Wang & Hu, 2006) affect the Makassar Strait transport profile (Gordon et al., 2012(Gordon et al., , 2014. When the NEC bifurcation is in a more northern position, as during the winter and during El Nino, the throughflow into the South China Sea via Luzon Strait is increased, enhancing the freshwater plug effect from the South China Sea, while the Mindanao Current strengthens, which reduces leakage into the Sulawesi Sea (and onto the Makassar Strait). Mindanao Current leakage increases as the NEC Bifurcation shifts southward, inducing a weaker Mindanao Current. The inverse relationship of the Mindanao Current strength and its leakage into the Sulawesi Sea is a product of the nonlinear inertia of the current, based on the retroflection dynamics developed from the Agulhas retroflection research (van Sebille et al., 2009). Thus, a more northern NEC Bifurcation (winter and El Ni\u00f1o) induces a deeper, weaker V-max in the Makassar throughflow. The opposite is true in the summer and during La Nina, when the NEC Bifurcation is in a more southern position. It is noted that a lag exists between the Ni\u00f1o indices and the NEC Bifurcation latitude. Qiu and Chen (2010) find that the Ni\u00f1o3.4 leads the NEC bifurcation by 2 months; Qiu and Lukas (1996) find 5 months lead time. They also find the North Pacific wind stress curl leads the NEC bifurcation latitude: 6 months (Qiu & Chen, 2010) and 12 months (Qiu & Lukas, 1996). Qiu and Chen (2010) caution \"the exact NEC bifurcation latitude depends on the surface wind forcing over the western tropical North Pacific Ocean containing variability not fully represented by the commonly used ENSO indices.\" The same is no doubt also the situation for the Makassar Strait throughflow, and it is likely the lag relationship is a function of depth (Li et al.). The heaving upward of the less than \u22120.1-m/s isotach (Figure 2c, upper panel) during the April to June and the September to November periods is due to the penetration of strong downwelling Wyrtki Jet-related Kelvin Waves (WJKW), generated in the equatorial Indian Ocean during the monsoonal transition months (Reppin et al., 1999;Webster et al., 1999;Wyrtki, 1973), which enter Makassar Strait via Lombok Strait (Drushka et al., 2010;Pujiana et al., 2009Pujiana et al., , 2013Shinoda et al., 2012;Sprintall et al., 2000). Significant seasonal and interannual fluctuations are apparent (Figure 3a), with the depth of the V-max varying between 50 and 200 m, with the higher speeds scaling to the shallower depths at roughly 0.3 m/s/ 100 m and a root mean square of 0.10 m/s, reflecting the impact of interannual variability. Stronger, shallower V-max is characteristic of the summer and during La Ni\u00f1a periods. The strongest and shallowest V-max is recorded by the time series during La Ni\u00f1a periods, for example, 2008-2013 (except for a weak brief El Ni\u00f1o event in early 2010 transition months) when the injection of South China Sea low salinity surface layer water into the Makassar pathway is reduced (Gordon et al., 2012). A marked anomaly to this pattern is the deep, weak summer V-max of June and July 2016, falling well off the V-max/depth scatter (marked as a red star in Figure 3a). This event is induced by strong negative IOD, which increased sea level height in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean, reversing the Pacific to Indian Ocean pressure gradient facilitated substantial reduction of the upper-layer transport (this topic is covered in detail in Pujiana et al., 2019; revision in review). The southward heat flux (HF; Figure 3b), relative to 0\u00b0C, is a product of the along-channel current profiles determined by the Labani Channel time series and the temperature profiles, determined from the 2004-2006 mooring and ship-based Conductivity-Temperature-Depth recorder (CTD) profiles obtained during the 10.1029/2018JC014502\nArlindo, INSTANT, and MITF Labani Channel expeditions, combined with World Ocean Database CTD and XBT data within Makassar Strait since 1950. The boreal summer total HF of the 40-to 740-m water column ranges between \u22120.8 to \u22121.3 PW and in winter \u22120.1 to \u22120.5 PW. The average difference between the summer and winter southward HF is 0.7 PW . The southward HF peaks at shallower depths during the summer relative to winter. La Ni\u00f1a conditions are present during the maximum quarters of 2007, 2010, and 2011 and during the minimum quarters of 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2016. El Ni\u00f1o events occur during maximum quarters of 2004, 2006, and 2015 and minimum quarters of 2004/2005, 2009/2010, 2014/2015, and 2015/2016. ENSO impact on HF is most pronounced during the boreal summer, with the La Ni\u00f1a HF being much greater than the El Ni\u00f1o HF; the difference is reduced in the boreal winter (Figure 3b).

The thick black line shows the mean NDJ HF profile, and the blue and red dashed lines display the NDJ HF during La Nina events of 2005, 2007-2011-2017and NDJ HF during El Nino events of 2004-2005 \nViewing the annual cycle of along-channel velocity by year ( Figure 4b) points to the features that contribute to the standard deviation (Figure 4a). The strongest southward flow (greater than \u22120.8 m/s) is observed in the summers of 2007-2011 and 2013 (note data gap August 2011 to July 2013) with increased southward flow in 2017. Relaxed or northward winter flows in the 60-and 100-m levels are most pronounced in the winters of 2014/2015 and 2016/2017. Seasonal variation and the MJO together account for the northward winter flow (Napitu, 2017). The MJO contributes to the northward flow by reversing the southward along-strait pressure gradient and increasing northward momentum transfer from wind stress. During the active phase of the MJO over the central Indonesian maritime continent, MJO westerly winds-driven Ekman transport increases sea surface height in the southern Makassar Strait, leading to a reduction in the southward along-strait pressure gradient (Napitu et al., this issue; in review). The suppressed southward along-strait pressure gradient and the northward component of the MJO winds, together, account for an increase in northward momentum transfer, contributing to the weakening of the southward flow in the upper 100 m during boreal winter (Napitu et al., 2019;in review). Anomalous weakening of the southward throughflow occurred in the boreal summer of 2016 within the upper 300 m. Summer relaxation of the ITF in the upper 300-m layer as observed in 2016 is uncommon, as it is a condition characteristic of the winter season. The anomalous ITF relaxation during northern summer in 2016 may relate to the suppressed Pacific to Indian Ocean gradient in response to a significant negative IOD event ( Figure 3a, lower panel; Pujiana et al., 2019; in revision), marked by higher than normal sea level in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean (Lim & Hendon, 2017;Lu et al., 2017). In June 2016, the ITF within the lower thermocline is composed of near zero or weak northward flow, substantially weaker than the mean annual cycle of the ITF in June of \u22120.3 m/s. A strong downwelling Kelvin wave within the Indian Ocean may have initiated the negative IOD event in 2016 (Lim & Hendon, 2017) and induced a strong relaxation in the ITF within Makassar Strait. The Indian Ocean downwelling Kelvin wave affects the ITF by increasing the sea surface height off the coasts of Java and Sumatra, reducing the interocean pressure gradient, and penetrating into Makassar Strait and thereby suppressing the southward ITF (Pujiana et al., 2019;in revision). At 340 m, the weakest southward flow occurs in May-July and November-December, a marker of the WJKW intrusions (Pujiana et al., 2013;Sprintall et al., 2000). The most intense November-December WJKW influence occurred in 2009, 2013, 2014, and 2015, with the 2015 event being particularly strong, inducing northward flow. The 2015 May-June event was also the strongest in the Makassar throughflow time series. The May 2016 weakening was also large, but it was most pronounced in the June-July period in the 100-m level, as discussed above. Interannual variation of the semiannual Kelvin wave in Makassar Strait reflects inter-annual variation of the Wyrtki jet in the equatorial Indian Ocean. The strength of the equatorial jet varies with IOD, with negative IOD years exhibiting stronger jets (Duan et al., 2016;McPhaden et al., 2015). It appears that intensified Kelvin waves in Makassar Strait through the fall months of 2010, 2013, and 2014 coincide with negative IOD events."}, {"section_title": "Annual Cycle and Anomalies of Velocity and Transport With Depth", "text": "The mean annual cycle of along-channel velocity and transport for three different depths (Figure 4a) brings out the depth dependence of the Makassar Strait throughflow. The summer maximum of southward flow is apparent at 100 m. The pattern of the velocities at 60 m is similar to that at 100 m but with speeds reduced by 0.1 to 0.2 m/s, reflecting the deeper subsurface V-max. At the 340-m base of the thermocline, a semiannual pattern is dominant, reflecting the intrusion of WJKW. The standard deviation in all three depths is largest in the winter and summer (the minimum and maximum throughflow occur), when the monsoonal winds are stronger, relative to the monsoonal transition seasons. The 0-to 300-m transport (right panel of Figure 4a) is dominated by the annual cycle. A strong semiannual transport in the 300-to 760-m slab with reduced values in May and November reflects the influence of the WJKW. The highest correlation (R = 0.76) of the 0-to 300-m transport to that of the 300-760 m is found when upper layer lags deeper layer by 46 days. The lag may indicate an upward propagation on of the semiannual WJKW with a phase speed of about 8 m/day, considerably slower than the speed attributed to an intraseasonal Kelvin wave discussed by Pujiana et al. (2013). A semiannual Kelvin wave vertically propagates at a slower phase speed than an intraseasonal Kelvin wave because the speed is inversely proportional to the wave period.

The mean temperature and standard deviation in the 0-to 300-m and 300-to 760-m intervals are 19.2\u00b0C, 6.1\u00b0C and 7.7\u00b0C, 1.3\u00b0C. The ratio of warm upper-layer transport to that of the cold lower layer (i.e. the velocity profile) is a major factor in the Makassar Strait HF . The 0-to 300-m transport layer, containing the North Pacific Subtropical Water (upper-thermocline S-max) and North Pacific Intermediate Water (S-min marking the base of the thermocline), represents the North Pacific surface and thermocline, injected into the ITF from the Mindanao Current (Gordon et al., 2012(Gordon et al., , 2014Hu et al., 2015;Rudnick et al., 2015;Sch\u00f6nau et al., 2015). Below 300 m, Makassar Strait includes lower thermocline water and Antarctic Intermediate Water drawn from the South Pacific. South Pacific water masses are more dominant in the eastern passageways of the ITF (Ilahude & Gordon, 1996;Koch-Larrouy et al., 2008;Yang et al., 2018)."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Makassar Strait Throughflow, 2004-2017", "text": "The ITF transfers tropical Pacific Ocean water into the Indian Ocean, representing the only tropical interocean exchange pathway, and through air-sea forms an integral component of the climate system, specifically to ENSO and the Asian monsoon (Hu et al., 2015;. The 13.3-year time series of the Makassar Strait throughflow, which carries~77% of the total ITF (Gordon et al., 2010), reveals intraseasonal, seasonal, and interannual fluctuations, which reflect the regional-and larger-scale forcing within the Maritime Continent. Consistent with earlier studies, which were based on a shorter Makassar Strait time series (Gordon et al., 2008(Gordon et al., , 2010Susanto et al., 2012), the Makassar Strait throughflow exhibits strong southward transport during the boreal summer, relative to the winter (Figure 2). The seasonal signal is modulated by interannual ENSO forcing, with weaker southward flow and a deeper subsurface V-max during El Ni\u00f1o; stronger southward flow with a shallower V-max during La Ni\u00f1a (Figure 3). Interannual differences in the winter surface layer transport are associated with MJO passing over the Maritime Continent, with strong winter reversals occurring in 2014/2015 and 2016/2017 (Figure 2; Napitu et al., 2019). The strong weakening of the Makassar throughflow in observed in June 2016 (Figures 3a and 4b) can be attributed to a strong negative IOD (Pujiana et al., 2019). The HF anomaly within Makassar Strait, a product of the along-channel current and temperature profiles, displays similar seasonal and interannual variability (Figure 3b; . The annual cycle of the Makassar Strait throughflow velocity reveals changes with depth with significant interannual variability (Figures 3a and 4), responding to Kelvin Waves derived from the Indian Ocean with a distinct semiannual signal induced by the Wyrtki Jets (Figure 4; Pujiana et al., 2019). 6 m 3 /s) for the 0-to 300-m interval (red) and 300-to 760-m interval (blue).
