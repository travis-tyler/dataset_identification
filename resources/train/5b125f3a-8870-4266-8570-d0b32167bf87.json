[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "A new coronavirus disease has become the most dangerous pandemic of this century causing over 20,000,000 reported infections and over 750,000 reported deaths as of August 2020. However, a vaccine is not yet available, and effective remedies to treat COVID-19 are still under development. erefore, the infections and deaths due to COVID-19 will continuously increase until an effective vaccine or treatment is available. For this reason, various approaches to slow down the spread of COVID-19 need to be identified and developed.\nVirus-specific enzymes are most often the main targets of antiviral medicines. For example, the thymidine kinase enzyme of herpesvirus is the main target of herpesvirus therapies, and thymidine kinase inhibitors including acyclovir and ganciclovir were developed to treat herpesvirus diseases [1] . Similarly, coronavirus-specific enzymes should be potential targets to treat coronavirus diseases. e 3CLprotease is regarded as the main drug target for coronavirus diseases [2] . Cleavage of viral polyproteins by proteases is a vital step in the life cycle of coronaviruses, and several viral proteases encoded in the coronavirus RNA are required for the maturation of the viral proteins [3] . e 3CL-protease is responsible for the cleavage of viral polyproteins of coronavirus and absolutely required for replication of the virus [4] [5] [6] . In light of its importance, the 3CL-protease is a target for antivirals, and several antiviral candidates were identified using a 3CL-protease assay [7] [8] [9] . Recently, chemicals targeting the SARS-CoV-2 3CL-protease have been reported to be effective to slow down the replication of coronavirus in vivo [10] .\nGreen tea is a popular beverage, and many reports demonstrated that green tea has health benefits including cancer prevention [11, 12] . Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the major ingredient in green tea and accounts for 50% to 80% of a brewed cup of green tea [11, 13] . EGCG or green tea showed a wide range of antiviral activity against adenovirus, influenza virus, zika virus, herpesvirus, and hepatitis virus [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . In addition, a previous report demonstrated that green tea has antiviral activity toward coronaviruses [21] . eaflavin is an active ingredient of black tea, a fermented or oxidized form of green tea [22] . eaflavin also showed antiviral activity against influenza virus, herpesvirus, rotavirus, and coronavirus [23] [24] [25] .\nSince previous studies suggest that the active ingredients of green tea or black tea are effective to inhibit coronavirus 3CL-protease, we examined whether EGCG and theaflavin showed inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 3CL-protease. In this study, we chemically synthesized the gene encoding SARS-CoV-2 3CL-protease using the published SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence and then utilized the protease assay to evaluate the inhibitory effect of EGCG and theaflavin."}, {"section_title": "Reagents.", "text": "(\u2212)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (E4134, purity \u2265 95%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO). eaflavin (No. 25129, purity \u226598%) was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI).

Based on the amino acid sequence analysis, SARS-CoV-2 3CL-protease shares 96.08% identity with SARS 3CL-protease and 49.51% identity with MERS 3CL-protease (Figure 1(b) ). Sequence alignment data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 3CL-protease is more homologous to SARS 3CLprotease than MERS 3CL-protease. We used the SARS-CoV-2 3CL-protease nucleotide sequence to synthesize the gene that encodes the 3CL-protease protein. In order to conduct the SARS-CoV-2 3CL-protease assay, we expressed a His-tagged 3CL-protease in bacteria by IPTG induction and purified the 3CL-protease by a His-tag affinity column (Figure 2(a) ). SARS-CoV-2 3CL-protease is readily detected in the soluble fraction, and we purified the 3CL-protease for the 3CL-protease assay (Figure 2(a) ).

SARS-CoV-2 3CLprotease is a promising target for COVID-19 treatments. Recently, a peptidomimetic chemical \u03b1-ketoamide was reported to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 3CL-protease and reduce viral replication in cell culture [10] . However, further timeconsuming testing must occur to determine the safety and efficacy of these chemicals.\nIn this study, we aimed to determine whether EGCG and theaflavin, the major active components of green tea and black tea, have inhibitory activity against 3CL-protease. Green tea and black tea are consumed widely and regularly throughout the world, and their health benefits have been universally lauded. We demonstrated that both EGCG and theaflavin inhibit 3CL-protease activity in a dose-dependent manner. We calculated the IC 50 of EGCG and theaflavin and found 7.58 \u03bcg/ml for EGCG and 8.44 \u03bcg/ml for EGCG (Figures 3 and 4) . eaflavin inhibits SARS 3CL-protease with an IC 50 value of 7 \u03bcg/ml, and various tea extracts were assayed against SARS coronavirus 3CLprotease, with IC 50 values in the range of 25\u223c125 \u00b5g/ml [21] . In addition, black tea, an oxidized form of green tea, neutralizes bovine coronavirus infectivity at an EC 50 of 34.7 \u03bcg/ml [24] . e inhibitory activity of EGCG and theaflavin on SARS-CoV-2 3CL-protease is consistent with the inhibitory activity of SARS 3CL-protease observed in a previous study [21] . In addition, the purified single compounds (EGCG and theaflavin) show lower IC 50 than tea extracts, suggesting that EGCG and theaflavin are the main active ingredients that inhibit 3CL-protease.\nOne major question is whether effective levels of either EGCG or theaflavin can be reached in the body. When we calculated the IC 50 using the molar concentration of EGCG or theaflavin, the IC 50 is equal to 16.5 \u03bcM for EGCG and "}, {"section_title": "EAOPs", "text": "Relative activity (%) Figure 6 : EGCG auto-oxidation products (EAOPs) show the inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease.

However, the maximum blood concentration of EGCG is less than 1 \u03bcM and the maximum blood concentration of theaflavin is less than 0.1 \u03bcM [32] [33] [34] . e effect of EGCG or theaflavin, therefore, on coronavirus replication in the human body may be limited on their own. However, our data also showed that EGCG and theaflavin treatment together has an additive effect ( Figure 5) . Green tea or black tea may provide various EGCG and theaflavin derivatives, and their additive effect may be effective to limit coronavirus replication. Moreover, EGCG can be oxidized in physiological conditions of body and converted into EAOPs.\nHere, we showed that EAOPs retain inhibitory activity on the 3CL-protease, suggesting that EGCG can be effective for a long time ( Figure 6 ).\nIn addition, recent computational studies support that EGCG and theaflavin are inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLprotease. An in silico molecular docking study with SARS-CoV-2 3CL-protease showed that EGCG and theaflavin strongly interact with 3CL-protease, indicating that EGCG and theaflavin potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL-protease [35] [36] [37] .\nHere, we showed that EGCG and theaflavin, the active ingredients of green tea and black tea, are effective to inhibit the 3CL-protease in vitro. Because green tea and black tea contain a high percent of EGCG and theaflavin, it would be valuable to examine the effect of green tea and black tea on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. In addition, further clinical trials will be required to reveal the effect of tea consumption on COVID-19 prognosis.\nAbbreviations COVID-19: 2019 novel coronavirus disease SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3CL-protease: 3C-like protease EGCG:\n(\u2212)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate."}, {"section_title": "Data Availability", "text": "e original data that support the findings of this study are included in the article."}, {"section_title": "Conflicts of Interest", "text": "e authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest."}, {"section_title": "Authors' Contributions", "text": "Minsu Jang and Yea-In Park contributed equally to this work.
