Falling fertility rates allowed the transition from a Malthusian regime, where income per capita was roughly constant, to a regime with lower population growth and higher living standards. During the same period, these countries experienced the structural transformation, a sustained shift from agriculture to manufacturing.\nFor example, the number of children per white woman in the United States fell from around seven to two between 1800 and 2000, and real GDP per capita increased at the same time from 1,296 dollars to 28,702 dollars. Similarly, between 1810 and 1960, the share of the U.S.\nlabor force working on a farm decreased from 80.9% to 8.1% while the share of manufacturing employment increased from 2.8% to 23.2% (Lebergott, 1966; Haines and Steckel, 2000; Bolt and van Zanden 2014) . While unified growth theory suggests that the structural transformation contributed to the onset of the fertility decline (e.g., Galor, 2005) , empirical evidence of a causal link is lacking so far.\nIn this paper, we show that the structural transformation was indeed causal for the fertility transition to take place. Our analysis focuses on the fertility transition in the American South that took place during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a period that was also characterized by a sustained shift from employment in agriculture to manufacturing (see Figure 1 ).\nThe empirical strategy exploits the arrival of an agricultural pest, the boll weevil, which adversely affected the cotton producing counties of the American South after the early 1890s as a quasi-experiment (Lange, Olmstead, and Rhode, 2009) . Since the spread of the boll weevil was determined by geographic conditions-mainly prevailing wind and weather conditions-it provides a plausibly exogenous source of variation in agricultural production. Our estimation strategy uses two sources of county-level variation: the timing of the boll weevil's arrival and its relatively stronger impact on local economies that were more dependent on cotton cultivation. We combine this county-level variation with complete count U.S. Census microdata to estimate the causal link between structural change and fertility.\nWe find evidence that the lower earnings opportunities in the agricultural sector decreased fer-tility in the American South during the 1880-1930 period via two channels: households staying in agriculture (stayers) reduced fertility due to lower income-consistent with children being a normal good (Becker, 1960) -and households that left agriculture (switchers) reduced their fertility because of the higher implicit and direct costs of raising children in the manufacturing sector. The two channels imply that there is an unambiguously negative association between lower earnings opportunities in agriculture and fertility. 1 In order to provide support for the first channel, we estimate the effect of a decline in agricultural income on fertility for stayers by using the interaction between the boll weevil incident and counties' (initial) dependence on cotton production as an instrumental variable. Our instrumental variable estimates reveal that lower agricultural income led to lower fertility among agricultural households, independent of race. 2 This result is compatible with the view that the opportunity cost of child rearing was relatively low for farm work in the American South at the beginning of the 20th century (Jones, 1985) and potentially in agrarian economies more generally. In support of the second channel we show that lower agricultural earnings opportunities induced some households to switch to manufacturing. This shift towards manufacturing reinforced the fertility decline since manufacturing households had, on average, substantially fewer children than agricultural households, due to higher implicit and direct costs of raising children. 3 To disentangle and quantify the importance of each channel, we exploit the impact of an unprecedented increase in cigarette consumption during World War I on local tobacco cultivation in the American South as a second source of exogenous variation in agricultural production.\nOur instrumental variable estimates reveal that the effects of the structural change for the fer-tility transition in the American South are substantial: the shift away from agriculture explains about 29 percent of the overall marital fertility decline over the sample period.\nThe lower agricultural earnings opportunities also reduced the value of child labor in the American South, which resulted in higher direct costs of children and a decrease in the opportunity cost of schooling. 4 Consequently, we find a substantial decline in 10 to 15-year-olds working, and an increase in school attendance. We show that the rise in school attendance was driven by the decline in child labor and was not a result of a potential increase in the attractiveness of schooling and the returns to education per se. This finding is consistent with a standard quantity-quality (Q-Q) framework of fertility which predicts that an increase in the direct costs of having children induces parents to invest more in the education (\"quality\") of their offspring.\nOur empirical findings therefore support the view that the Q-Q framework can rationalize the well-documented rise in school enrollment that went along with structural change and the fertility transition during the last two centuries.\nOur paper relates to the unified growth theory literature which argues that the process of industrialization contributed to the onset of the fertility decline (Galor and Weil, 1999; 2000; Galor, 2005) . While this theoretical literature is well developed, empirical evidence of a causal relationship is scarce due to complicated identification resulting from potential reverse causality and omitted variable bias. Our empirical model uses plausibly exogenous variation in the earnings opportunities in agriculture to address this identification problem. In line with the prediction of unified growth theory, we find evidence that there was a causal link between the structural transformation and the fertility transition in the American South in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nThe result that stayer households experienced a decrease in income and therefore lowered fertility (the first channel) is in line with recent empirical evidence showing that, when in- 4 The idea that child labor is an important determinant of fertility behavior since it increases the value of children's time and, at the same time, raises the opportunity cost of schooling was analyzed by Rosenzweig and Evenson (1977) . In line with this argument, Hazan and Berdugo (2002) and Doepke (2004) show that child labor restrictions and education policies play an important role for the fertility decline and the transition to sustained economic growth. housing market to show that family wealth positively affects fertility. Bleakley and Ferrie (2016) find that winners of the Georgia Cherokee Land Lottery of 1832 had slightly more children than lottery losers. Lindo (2010) and Black et al. (2013) reach the same conclusion by exploiting exogenous shocks to household income. The positive relationship between household income and fertility within agricultural occupations is also consistent with the finding in some earlier literature based on cross-sectional U.S. data that higher income leads to more children within the same occupation (e.g., Freedman, 1963).\nOur finding that switcher households decreased their fertility, because the implicit and direct cost of child rearing were higher in the manufacturing sector (the second channel), relates to Wanamaker (2012) who finds that industrialization was an important determinant for the fertility decline in South Carolina between 1880 and 1900. Unlike Wanamaker (2012), we find that the reduced fertility decline is not just a result of selective migration and that also human capital formation increased as a result of structural change in the American South.\nWe therefore also contribute to a literature that argues that human capital formation played an important role in the relation between structural change and the fertility transition (Galor, 2005 (Galor, , 2011 . Becker (1960) and Becker and Lewis (1973) developed the idea that parents face a trade-off between the number of children and the investment in child quality. This quantityquality (Q-Q) model is supported by the data, since there is ample evidence of a negative relation between family size and child quality (e.g., Hanushek, 1992; Becker, Cinnirella, and Woessmann, 2010; Tan, 2018) . More recently, a number of studies test the Q-Q framework of fertility by using plausibly exogenous variation in the returns to education. For example, Bleakley and Lange (2009) argue that the sudden eradication of the hookworm in the American South during the 1910s led to an effective decrease in the price of child quality, particularly in areas with high pre-treatment infection rates. They document fertility behavior in line with the Q-Q model. Aaronson, Lange, and Mazumder (2014) exploit a substantial decrease in the cost of education for black children due to the roll-out of the Rosenwald schools in the American South during the early 20th century. They find that affected mothers reduced fertility along the 5 00851 9\nReview of Economics and Statistics Just Accepted MS. rest by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology intensive margin but, in line with Q-Q preferences, were less likely to remain childless. While these studies exploit variation in the returns to education to test the existence of a Q-Q trade-off, our paper provides direct evidence that the Q-Q model can rationalize the increase in school attendance during the structural transformation.\nFinally, this study contributes to a copious literature on the fertility transition in the United\nStates and the American South in particular. Economic historians suggest various competing hypotheses to explain the U.S. fertility decline during the 19th and early 20th centuries, ranging from changes in the cost of acquiring land, increases in the default risk of children to provide old-age care for parents to economic modernization (Easterlin, 1976; Sundstrom and David, 1988; Greenwood and Seshadri, 2002) . 5 The importance of economic modernization for the fertility transition in the U.S. has been emphasized by several studies, especially for the period after the Civil War (Guest, 1981) . Consistent with the economic modernization hypothesis, recent empirical studies find industrialization (Wanamaker, 2012) , better access to education (Aaronson et al. 2014) , and health improvements (Bleakley and Lange, 2009) to be important determinants of the southern fertility decline. Our findings add to this literature and provide further evidence that structural change led to a fertility decline in counties of the American South that relied heavily on cotton production. The lower earnings potential in the southern agricultural sector contributed to the fertility transition by accelerating the process of industrialization and increasing the demand for human capital."}, {"section_title": "The Boll Weevil as a Quasi-Experiment", "text": "The boll weevil is a vermin that depends on the cotton plant -its main source of food and host of reproduction. It first appeared in the American South near Brownsville, Texas in 1892.\nBy 1922 almost the entire Cotton Belt region was infested (see Figure A .1). Depending on prevailing wind and weather conditions, the boll weevil could cover from 40 to 160 miles per year (Hunter and Coad, 1923) . Since the timing of the arrival of the weevil is determined by 5 Note that most of the fertility transition in the southern region took place during the first decades of the 20th century (Steckel, 1992) ; see, for example, Elman, London, and McGuire (2015) for reasons for the delay in the southern fertility transition and Bailey and Hershbein (2015) for an overview of the literature on the U.S. fertility transition.\ngeography, it is plausibly exogenous to local economic conditions and can therefore be used to identify the causal effect of lower agricultural earnings opportunities on fertility.\nThe boll weevil's detrimental effect on the southern agricultural sector is well documented. production from cotton to corn, the main alternative crop in the Cotton Belt. Ager, Brueckner, and Herz (2017) find that in highly cotton dependent counties the presence of the vermin led to farm closures, a change in tenancy arrangements, removal of land from agricultural production, and a substantial decline in farm wages and female labor force participation. Other recent work\nshows that the boll weevil increased school enrollment rates of blacks in Georgia (Baker, 2015) and delayed marriage, especially for young African-Americans, as the boll weevil infestation changed the prospects of tenant farming (Bloome, Feigenbaum, and Muller, 2017) .\nThe findings based on disaggregated data resonate with the older economic history and social science literature that considers the boll weevil as a large negative productivity shock to the southern cotton production and a disruptive element of the whole Southern economy (Street, 1957; Ransom and Sutch, 2001) . Between 1909 Between -1935 , the estimated average reduction from full yield in the American South was 10.9 percent, ranging from 0.8 percent in Missouri to 17.8 percent in Louisiana. In 1921, thirty years after the boll weevil entered the Cotton Belt, the estimated losses reached their peak of 31 percent (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1951, Table   52 ). The estimated average annual loss due to the boll weevil infestation for the four years preceding 1920 was 200-300 million U.S. dollars (Hunter and Coad, 1923) .\nThe recent evidence based on disaggregated data revises findings of scholars that questioned whether the boll weevil played an important role for the development of the southern economy as a whole (Higgs, 1976; Osband, 1985; Wright, 1986; Giesen, 2011) . Proponents of this view argued that a higher cotton price had completely offset the detrimental effects that the boll weevil had on local economies. For example, Wright (1986) argues that the higher cotton price kept the southern cotton economy going; it refrained farmers from diversifying agricultural production at a larger scale, and therefore did not lead to a shift of resources out of agriculture in the South. 6\nFor our empirical approach, the literature based on aggregated data raises the concern that offsetting price effects might have mitigated the decline in agricultural earnings opportunities due to the boll weevil infestation. In this respect, it is important to note that our estimation strategy exclusively uses within-county variation and includes time fixed effects (see Section 4.1).\nThis alleviates the concern that fertility might have responded to aggregate price effects. Our econometric model further includes state-by-time fixed effects which implies that our variation only comes from differentially affected counties within a given state and year. Our estimates therefore take into account any potential confounding effects that occur at the state level, even when they vary over time. For example, changes in state-specific laws, such as regulating child labor and school attendance, which potentially directly affected fertility outcomes, are captured by our econometric model.\nFor our empirical strategy, it is also not relevant to what extent the boll weevil led to an overall decline in agricultural earnings opportunities in the Cotton Belt, but only that it induced a relative decline in more cotton-dependent counties compared to less cotton-dependent counties. 7\nFinally, it is also sufficient that the infestation created some exogenous variation in agricultural earnings opportunities. We do not argue that the boll weevil infestation necessarily was the main source of structural change in the American South.\n6 Giesen (2011) argues that 30 years after the boll weevil's arrival in the Cotton Belt, the southern cotton economy remained relatively unchanged-the South produced even more cotton in 1921 than in 1892. Osband (1985) claims that the overall effect of the boll weevil on the southern economy was modest since he finds only minimal annual revenue losses for cotton producers. 7 Even if agricultural production increased at the aggregate level it is not clear that this leads to an increase in farmers' net income because of potentially rising input costs, such as increased cost for fertilizer (see Lange et al., 2009, footnote 28) . Our construction of agricultural income takes input costs into account (see the online data appendix for further details). income of these households we use the occupation-based income score (\"OCCSCORE\") from IPUMS in constant prices. 10 The online data appendix provides a detailed description of how 8 The year 1890 is omitted from the analysis since the completed census forms were lost in a fire. 9 The spouse is present for circa 96 percent of the married women in our sample. 10 The IPUMS occupation score has been used in the literature as an approximation for income over longer periods of time (e.g., Jones and Tertilt, 2008) . the agriculture income variable is constructed.\nWe then merge the microdata with county-level data on the arrival of the boll weevil and cotton production in 1899. 11 County-level data on cotton acreage are from the Census of Agriculture in 1889 (Haines et al., 2015) . As many counties changed boundaries during our sample period, we aggregate counties to time-consistent \"multi-counties\" as in Lange et al. (2009) and Ager et al. (2017) .

Our econometric model follows a differences-in-differences strategy exploiting the fact that the boll weevil arrived in different counties at different times (variation over time) and that the boll weevil had a stronger impact in highly cotton-dependent counties (variation across counties); see Ager et al. (2017) . Under the hypothesis that the boll weevil had a negative effect on fertility, we would expect to find the largest fertility declines in counties with a high initial intensity of cotton production after infestation."}, {"section_title": "Estimation Strategy", "text": "We use our sample of married women to estimate the following reduced form equation:\nwhere Fertility ict denotes mother i's number of own children under age 5. Equation (1) further controls for county fixed effects, \u03b1 c , state-by-time fixed effects, \u03b1 st , and a set of individual control variables, X ict , which includes age fixed effects, indicator variables for race, and whether the mother lives in a rural area. To account for potential time-varying effects of the latter variables, we also include race-by-rural-by-time fixed effects and all potential interactions among these three variables. The main variable of interest, Boll Weevil Intensity ct , is the interaction between a dummy variable that equals one if county c was infested by the boll weevil at time t and county c's acreage share of cotton planted in 1889. 12 We use data from the pre-infestation year 1889 to ensure that the interaction term is exogenous to fertility changes during the boll weevil infestation period. Standard errors are Huber robust and clustered at the county level. 11 We thank Fabian Lange, Alan Olmstead, and Paul Rhode for sharing their boll weevil data. 12 The cotton share is constructed as in Ager et al.

We differentiate between women aged 16-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, and 45-49 . To capture cohort-specific differences in fertility that are independent of the boll weevil infestation, this specification also includes cohort fixed effects (interacted by county and by time). Under the hypothesis that the boll weevil has a negative effect on fertility, we would expect \u03b2 < 0 in equation (1). In equation (2), we would expect \u03b2 g < 0 with a larger coefficient in absolute size for mothers in their prime childbearing years."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Column (1) of Table 1 reports results using estimation equation (2) for our sample of married women in the Cotton Belt of the American South. The estimates reveal that 20 to 39-year-old women were the most affected. The effect for women over age 40 is not statistically significant and practically zero. This finding serves as a consistency check since we would not expect systematic fertility adjustments of older women in reaction to the boll weevil's arrival.\nColumns (2)- (4) report results using estimating equation (1), but restricting the sample to 20\nto 39-year-old women. In line with our hypothesis, the coefficient on Boll Weevil Intensity ct is negative and highly statistically significant. Quantitatively, the estimate implies that in a county with median cotton dependency, the arrival of the boll weevil led to a reduction of the number of children less than 5 years old by 0.017 (the median cotton dependency in the sample is 0.424, such that \u22120.041 \u00d7 0.424 = \u22120.017). This accounts for about 2 percent of the total fertility decline of married 20 to 39-year-olds in the Cotton Belt between 1880 and 1930. 13 Our results remain qualitatively unchanged when using a dummy whether the mother has any child under age 5 or the number of own children under age 10 as alternative measures 13 The mean of Boll Weevil Intensity ct is 0.19 (see Table A (1) and (2) of Table A. 3). 14 We also obtain similar results when using alternative empirical specifications such as including a quadratic of Boll Weevil Intensity ct or using the years of duration of the infestation instead of a binary variable (available upon request). The estimates reported in columns (3) and (4) reveal that there are no significant differences for white and black women and between households below and above the median household income. 15 This shows that the effects of the boll weevil are independent of race and not driven by credit constrained households.\nOne drawback of using the decennial U.S. Census data is that we observe women's fertility at a rather low frequency. An alternative way of measuring the impact of the boll weevil on fertility is to construct a flow fertility measure. Since the U.S. Census reports the age of each child in a household, it is straightforward to calculate the respective birth year. 16 We use this information to construct each mother's fertility history. That is, we construct for every mother a time-varying indicator variable, which is one if a child was born in a given year, and zero otherwise. The sample is based on complete count Census microdata for the years 1900, 1910, and 1920 and restricted to observations where the mother's age when giving birth is between 15 and 44. Since we know the year when the boll weevil arrived in a county, we can use this data set to explore the boll weevil's effect on the probability of a woman giving birth in a given year. The estimates using this alternative approach are reported in column (5) of Table 1 . 17 Identification comes from within mother variation in the probability of giving birth in a given year due to differences in the timing of the boll weevil's arrival in counties with different cotton 14 We address the potential threat of confounding factors that vary over time at the county level by adding county-by-time fixed effects to specification (2) and using women aged 40-44 as a control group. That is, identification comes from within-county variation across age cohorts only. While the control group is not optimal, the estimates turn out to be similar to column (1) suggesting that it is not likely that time-varying county-specific omitted variables are driving our findings (column (3) of Table A. 3). 15 We also show in Table A.2 that estimates are similar when the sample is split by race. 16 We restrict the sample to children younger than 15 at the time of the Census. 17 Note that county-specific effects are captured by the mother fixed effects (in case the mother stayed throughout her fertility history at her place of residence listed in the Census)."}, {"section_title": "00851 9", "text": "Review of Economics and Statistics Just Accepted MS. rest by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology intensities.

Further research on the relationship between the structural transformation and falling fertility rates in other historical settings would therefore be valuable.\nOverall, our study supports the view that the structural transformation was an important determinant of the southern fertility transition during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The lower earnings opportunities in agriculture contributed to a substantial fertility decline in southern households by accelerating the process of industrialization and stimulating the demand for human capital. Having the concerns discussed above in mind, this result seems not unique to historical settings. In particular, one could think of policies that reduce population pressure in developing countries by combining rigorous child labor laws with economic programs that stimulate the transition out of the agricultural sector.

The existence of such \"pretrends\" would undermine our differences-in-differences strategy, because it would invalidate the use of low cotton-dependent counties as a control group. To address this concern, we conduct an event study using the mother panel sample described above. The structure of the mother panel allows us to calculate the average number of births by 15-44-year-old women in a given county and year, Fertility ct . Our estimating equation is where T = {\u221210, . . . , \u22122, 0, . . . , 10}.

The effect is also relatively stronger in high compared to medium cotton dependent counties, corroborating our baseline estimation strategy. From Figure 2 , it is also apparent that the fertility decline due to the boll weevil infestation was persistent, which is in line with the finding of Lange et al.\n(2009) that the local effects of the boll weevil infestation were long lasting.\nTo further validate our identification strategy we conduct two additional placebo exercises. In the first exercise, we report placebo regressions that test for effects of the boll weevil prior to actual infestation. To do so, we backdate the boll weevil infestation by 20 years. For example, in a county where the weevil entered in year 1910 we now assume it would have entered in year 1890. Estimates of regression equation (1) using this placebo specification are reported in column (4) of Table A .3. Reassuringly, the interaction between the backdated boll weevil incidence and the 1889 cotton share is small and not statistically different from zero. This finding is also in line with our event study results which show that there are no pre-trends before infestation. In the second placebo exercise, we add the interaction between the boll weevil and the corn share planted in 1889 to estimating equation (1). Columns (5) and (6) of Table A .3 show that our main results are unchanged, while the interaction effect between the boll weevil and the corn share is small and always statistically insignificant. was actually the case we include an interaction of Boll Weevil Intensity ct with a measure of a county's suitability for corn cultivation in our estimating equation. 18 Since crop-shifting should be especially attractive in counties where corn could easily be planted, we would expect this interaction to be positive if there was indeed such a mitigating effect. In columns (7) and (8) of Table A .3 we show that this is not the case.\nOne potential concern is that our results might be driven by composition bias. et al., 2017) . These linked samples allow us to evaluate the effect of migration on fertility.\nWe only consider linked households where a wife of age 20 to 39 is present in the terminal period. Reassuringly, columns (1) and (2) of Table A .5 show that households that migrated out of a county did not have higher fertility, but actually lower fertility. As an alternative test, in\ncolumns (3)- (4) of Table A .5 we replicate the specifications of Table 1 columns (2) and (5), while restricting the sample to mothers who report to reside in their state of birth. Since the estimates are similar to the baseline estimates in Table 1 we can rule out that our findings are driven by inter-state migration. In conclusion, the presented evidence on migration corroborates our baseline results and makes it unlikely that composition bias is of great concern.\nThe boll weevil might also have increased child mortality due to poorer nutrition or even starvation, although recent empirical evidence from Clay, Schmick, and Troesken (2019) suggests that this was not the case. To address this potential concern, we explore the effect of the boll weevil infestation on child mortality and stillbirths. 19 Table A .6 columns (1)- (3) shows that there was no positive effect. In this context, one further potential concern is whether the arrival of the boll weevil impaired fecundity, for example, due to greater maternal stress. Since the Censuses in 1900 and 1910 list the number of children ever born, we can construct a dummy for being childless for women aged 20 to 39 who report to be married for at least two years to proxy for impaired fecundity. 20 The insignificant estimate in column (4) suggests that this was not the case. Overall, the results of Table A .6 support the view that the decision of households to have less offspring was not a result of increased child mortality or impaired fecundity.\nEven though we only consider married mothers in our analysis, it could be that in infested counties mothers have fewer children because they postpone marriage (Bloome et al., 2017) .\nTo address this concern, we include age at marriage fixed effects as additional controls in esti- 19 Data are retrieved from the 1900 and 1910 Censuses (see IPUMS variables \"CHBORN\" and \"CHSURV\") and from Fishback, Haines, and Kantor (2007) . 20 In the American South at that time it was not common for married women to voluntarily delay the first marital birth; see, for example, Elman et al. (2015) . Finally, our results might also be driven by differential fertility dynamics in counties where plantation farming was considered to be important. Large-scale plantation favored family formation and provided strong incentives for child bearing since farm allotments were determined by family size (Elman et al., 2015) . In column (10) of Table A .3, we show that mothers' fertility behavior in plantation counties did not respond differently compared to the rest of the sample after the boll weevil's arrival. Since these counties were also characterized by relatively high (land) inequality, this finding can also be regarded as suggestive evidence that land inequality is not a main driver of the impact that the boll weevil infestation had on fertility."}, {"section_title": "Case studies", "text": "This subsection provides evidence from two case studies that the boll weevil's negative effect on fertility is robust to using alternative sets of control groups. In particular, we consider control counties that were either specialized in producing other main cash crops within the cotton belt or are located on the frontier of the boll weevil infestation in the 1920s.\nThe first case study focuses on Louisiana. While Louisiana was part of the cotton-belt and engaged in cotton cultivation, some parishes, well-known for specializing in sugar cultivation, formed the \"Sugar Bowl\" (see Rodrigue, 2001 ). These parishes serve as an ideal control group to study the impact of the weevil-they were highly agricultural, but cotton production played either a very minor or even no role, and the weevil infested all parishes in Louisiana at about the same time (the first parish was infested in 1903 and the last in 1909), which makes it less likely that our estimates are confounded by time-specific effects. Figure 3a shows an event study based on equation (3) that compares the effect of the boll weevil on fertility in highly cotton-dependent parishes with \"Sugar Bowl\" parishes (the estimates are reported in Table   A .7). Reassuringly, the results are in line with our previous findings: At the time of impact, we see a significant and persistent reduction in fertility and no pre-trends before infestation. 21 The age at marriage is constructed using the IPUMS variables \"DURMARR\" (available for the we compare counties that were infested with counties that were never infested by the weevil (see Figure 3b) . Counties in our control group were not infested for two different reasons. One group had no or only very minor cotton cultivation while counties in the second group cultivated cotton but \"adverse\" weather conditions such as frost and dry climate prevented infestation.\nImportant drawbacks of this case study, besides the smaller sample size, are that the infestation of the treated sample counties occurred relatively late (circa 1920); and some counties are sparsely populated while others did not cultivate any cotton. Table 2 reports the results of this case study based on regression equation (1). We find that infested counties experienced a significant decline in fertility relative to non-infested counties, albeit the estimate is somewhat larger compared to our baseline results.

A challenge to identification is that the arrival of the boll weevil represents only one source of exogenous variation. We therefore cannot simultaneously use it as an instrument for structural change on the intensive margin (reduction of agricultural income for stayer households) and on the extensive margin (industrialization; that is, households switching to the manufacturing sector).\nIn order to disentangle and quantify the importance of each channel we therefore exploit the 27 As shown in Section 5.1, the arrival of the boll weevil decreased agricultural income and therefore led to a fertility decline. We therefore exclude households that stayed in agriculture and lived in a county where the boll weevil was present in the terminal year (1900, 1910, or 1920 We construct the second instrument as the product of the tobacco farm price in a given year and the share of tobacco cultivated in a county in 1909 (the last Agricultural Census prior to WWI). 29 The instrument is in the spirit of a so-called \"shift-share\" instrumental variable approach as it predicts local tobacco production based on the interaction of aggregated demand shocks and a predetermined distribution of tobacco cultivation at the county level. Since most of the tobacco cultivation took place outside the Cotton Belt counties, the sample for the following empirical analysis includes all counties of the state of Kentucky and the Cotton Belt states.\nThis ensures that we include the most important tobacco producing counties of the American South in the empirical analysis. 30 It is important to note that this instrument does not need to capture the main source of variation in agricultural earnings opportunities, for our identification strategy, it is sufficient that it provides some plausibly exogenous variation in agricultural 28 Tobacco was another major cash crop in the American South during the sample period; see, for example, Towne and Rasmussen (1960) . 29 The tobacco share is constructed analogously to the cotton share. We consider the tobacco farm prices of Kentucky-the largest tobacco producing state at that time-as representative of the tobacco producing states in the American South; the corresponding data sources are listed in the online data appendix. The evolution of the tobacco farm price is shown in Figure A. We use the following two-stage least squares approach using two instruments:\nwhere Fertility ct denotes the average number of children under age 5 of 20 to 39-year-old women in county c at time t. The two endogenous variables are Income ct , measured as the average logarithmic income of individuals working in agriculture, and M f gShare ct , which is the fraction of the county population working in manufacturing measured in logarithmic units.\nEquation (8) further includes county fixed effects, \u03b1 c , and year fixed effects, \u03b1 t .

In Section 2, we discussed recent evidence that the boll weevil induced population movements, a shift of production to corn, and changed southern agricultural labor arrangements and labor market outcomes. It follows from this literature that these effects can be regarded as a direct consequence of changed earnings opportunities in the agricultural sector and therefore do not constitute a threat to the instrumental validity. However, it still might be the case that, regardless of any changes in agricultural earnings opportunities, initial differences in these attributes in affected counties might have contributed to differential changes in fertility over the sample period. We address this potential issue in Table A .8. Columns (2) to (6) of Panel A show that the empirical estimates are robust to controlling for pre-infestation values of population, the black share, the corn share and total acres planted in crops, the tenant share, and the female labor force participation rate at the count level interacted with a full set of time fixed effects (column (1) reports the baseline for comparison). In Panel B we also include a measure of initial (1880) fertility fully interacted with time fixed effects, which is a flexible and demanding way of controlling for any mean reverting fertility dynamics. While we find slight changes in the relative contribution of agriculture income and the manufacturing share to fertility, our results remain qualitatively unaffected.\nAnother potential issue is that the lower agricultural earnings opportunities might have directly incentivized parents to invest more in the education of their children and therefore reduced fertility independently of its effect through agricultural income or the manufacturing share.\nIn Section 7, we provide evidence that this was not the case: Although we report a rise in schooling, we find no evidence of an increase in the returns to education due to the presence of the boll weevil per se. To the contrary, our evidence suggests that increased schooling is exclusively driven by diminishing returns to child labor and the associated increase in the direct cost of raising children (regardless of child quality), which decreased household income. 31\n31 Following the notation in Galor (2012, Section 4.1), this would correspond to an increase in \u03c4 q (i.e., the fixed costs of child rearing regardless of child quality), while \u03c4 e (i.e., the costs of 25 00851 9"}, {"section_title": "Human Capital", "text": "In this section, we show that the lower earnings opportunities in agriculture led to a substantial decline in child labor, which stimulated human capital formation in the Cotton Belt. For the empirical analysis, we use a sample of 10 to 15-year-old children that can be linked to their mothers from the 1900 to 1930 full count U.S. Census microdata. 32 The specification in this section is identical to equation (1), except that the dependent variable is a dummy that equals one if a 10 to 15-year-old child reports a gainful occupation, regularly attends school, 33 or is considered to be \"idle,\" that is, the child neither regularly attends school nor reports a gainful occupation. Our specification further accounts for potential differences in parental education levels by including dummies for father's and mother's literacy. Standard errors are Huber robust and clustered at the county level. Table 5 summarizes the results. In columns (1) and (2) we find that in the more affected counties the boll weevil infestation resulted in a substantial decline in child labor, while, at the same time, regular school attendance of 10 to 15-year-old children increased significantly. Both effects are statistically significant at the 1-percent level. For a county with a high cotton intensity (ranked at the 75th percentile), the boll weevil infestation led to a decrease in the likelihood that a 10 to 15-year-old child reports a gainful occupation by more than 4 percentage points.\nGiven that about 23 percent of children in the Cotton Belt worked during the period (see Table A .1), this effect is quantitatively important and also suggests that child labor at this investing in child quality) would remain unaffected. 32 The 1880 IPUMS full count Census data do not include information on school attendance. 33 As in Bleakley and Lange (2009), regular school attendance is a dummy variable equal to one if a child is attending and not working. For 1900, we construct school attendance based on the IPUMS variable \"SCHLMNTH.\" For 1910, we use the IPUMS variable \"SCHOOL\". We consider a child to be working if a gainful occupation is reported in the Census. Compared to the effect on child labor, the schooling effect is more modest, as about two-third of children of this age group attended school regularly (see Table A .1).\nColumn (3) of Table 5 shows that this smaller effect on schooling is due to the fact that a substantial fraction of parents left their children idle after the cotton fields were ravaged by the boll weevil. In a county with a high cotton intensity, this increase was almost 2 percentage points, which is a sizable effect, since only about 9 percent of 10 to 15-year-old children were listed as idle (see Table A .1). These findings indicate that reduced agricultural earnings opportunities primarily reduced the value of child labor but did not increase the attractiveness of schooling and the returns to education per se.\nWe can also directly assess whether fertility declined due to changes in the returns to education by investigating fertility adjustments along the extensive and intensive margins following the theoretical framework of Aaronson et al. (2014) . While increases in the returns to education would imply a decline on the intensive but not on the extensive margin, an increase in the direct cost of having children implies a decline of fertility along both margins. Column (2) of Table A .3 shows that fertility also decreased along the extensive margin. If the boll weevil also affected fertility directly by changing the returns to education, our evidence suggests that this effect was quantitatively modest and negligible.\nFinally, columns (4) to (7) of Table 5 provide additional county-level evidence that the increased direct costs of children stimulated the demand for schooling in the Cotton Belt. One prominent education program at the time was the Rosenwald Rural Schools Initiative (Aaronson and Mazumder, 2011; Carruthers and Wanamaker, 2013; Aaronson et al., 2014) . The objective of this program was to narrow the racial education gap that existed in the American South at that time, especially in rural areas. 36 Between 1914 and 1931 the Rosenwald Pro-34 This is in line with the view that children had a comparative advantage in picking cotton (Goldin and Sokoloff, 1984) . 35 This finding is in line with Baker (2015 Baker ( , p.1129 and resonates with the positive long-run impact that the weevil had on educational attainment (Baker, Blanchette, and Eriksson, 2018) . 36 The racial gap in schooling in the American South at the beginning of the 20th century was 27 00851 9\nReview of Economics and Statistics Just Accepted MS. rest by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology gram constructed about 5,000 new schools throughout the rural American South targeted to the black rural population. 37 The county-level regressions reported in columns (4) to (7) control for county fixed effects, state-by-time fixed effects, and the black population share. The estimates reveal that for infested counties, a 10 percentage point higher initial cotton share implies the construction of about two more schools and five more teachers per 1,000 inhabitants. These results show that the arrival of the boll weevil had a substantial impact on where schools were constructed. In columns (6) and (7), we add the interaction of Boll Weevil Intensity ct with the initial (1910) county child labor share. The estimates suggest that most Rosenwald schools were constructed in counties that experienced the highest decrease in the value of child labor. This is consistent with the notion that human capital formation in the Cotton Belt was triggered by the increased direct costs of children during our sample period.\nOverall, the findings presented in this section are in line with the predictions of the standard Q-Q framework. The lower value of child labor increased the direct costs of children and induced parents to invest more in child quality. The Q-Q model can therefore rationalize the well-documented increase in school enrollment that went along with the structural change and the fertility decline that the American South experienced during the 1880-1930 period."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "A prominent hypothesis in growth and economic development is that a sustained shift from agriculture to manufacturing contributed to the historical fertility decline in today's modern societies. Empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis remains scarce because identifying a causal relationship is challenging. The present paper fills this gap in the literature by using credibly exogenous variation in agricultural earnings opportunities to estimate the causal link substantial and is largely explained by differences in school characteristics and the lower economic status and education levels of black parents; see Margo (1990) and Collins and Margo between structural change and the fertility transition. We show that lower agricultural earnings opportunities triggered a structural change on the intensive margin (i.e., the reduction of agricultural income for stayer households) and on the extensive margin (i.e., households switching to manufacturing (industrialization)). In line with the notion that children are a normal good, we find that stayer households reduced fertility as they experienced income losses, while switcher households reduced fertility because manufacturing work is generally less compatible with raising children.\nThis finding also implies that there are more complex mechanisms behind the well-documented negative correlation between parental income and fertility (e.g., Jones and Tertilt, 2008) . In line with the theoretical framework by Mookherjee et al. (2012), we find evidence of two potentially confounding effects: Mobility across sectors or broad occupational categories changes parents' incentives to invest in child quality and usually implies a negative fertility-income relation. Within the same occupational category, however, higher income could increase fertility depending on whether the income effect dominates the substitution effect (Doepke, 2004) .\nIdentifying the effect of a wealth/income shock for households staying within the same occupation and for households switching occupations separately is therefore crucial for researchers interested in establishing a causal relationship between fertility and parental income.\nWe further show that lower earnings opportunities in agriculture diminished the value of child labor which made schooling relatively more attractive. This finding is in line with the testable implications of a standard quantity-quality model of fertility (Galor, 2011) , which can rationalize the well-documented increase in school enrollment that went along with structural change and the historical fertility transition in most of Europe and North America during the 19th and early 20th centuries.\nOne limitation of our empirical analysis is that individual Census data on wages are not available before 1940. While we collected additional historical data to improve existing measures that rely on occupational income, changes in agricultural income in this study result from wage differences across agricultural occupations or spatial and temporal variation in wages of farm laborers or farmer income. This data limitation implies that we cannot perfectly identify the income effect at the individual level. One further concern is the external validity of our findings."}]
