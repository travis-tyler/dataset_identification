Th e existing cotton growth model GOSSYM has drawbacks that prohibit its eff ective coupling with climate models. We developed a geographically distributed cotton growth model from the original GOSSYM and optimized it for coupling with the regional Climate-Weather Research Forecasting model (CWRF). Th is included soft ware redesign, physics improvement, and parameter specifi cation for consistent coupling of CWRF and GOSSYM. Th rough incorporation of the best available physical representations and observational estimates, the long list of inputs in the original GOSSYM was reduced to two parameters, the initial NO 3 amount in the top 2 m of soil and the ratio of irrigated water amount to potential evapotranspiration. Th e geographic distributions of these two parameters are determined by optimization that minimizes model errors in simulating cotton yields. Th e result shows that the redeveloped GOSSYM realistically reproduces the geographic distribution of mean cotton yields in 30-km grids, within \u00b110% of observations across most of the U.S. Cotton Belt, whereas the original GOSSYM overestimated yields by 27 to 135% at the state level and 92% overall. Both models produced interannual yield variability with comparable magnitude; however, the temporal correspondence between modeled and observed interannual anomalies was much more realistic in the redeveloped than the original GOSSYM because signifi cant (P = 0.05) correlations were identifi ed in 87 and 40% of harvest grids, respectively. Th e redeveloped GOSSYM provides a starting point for additional improvements and applications of the coupled CWRF-GOSSYM system to study climate-cotton interactions."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "G lobal climate change is expected to have dramatic impacts on agricultural productivity throughout the world, including the U.S. Cotton Belt (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007) . Long-term trends in temperature, precipitation, growing season duration, climate variability, and weather extremes could substantially alter the geographic distribution of crop production (Climate Change Science Program, 2008; Karl et al., 2009) . Th is could have impacts on local and regional economies and the populations that rely on agriculture in those areas. Th rough a predictive understanding of crop responses to current and future climate change, researchers can develop new technologies for climate change adaptation, policymakers can establish necessary incentives and safety nets for producers, and producers can better understand their risk horizons and mitigation strategies.\nCrop growth models simultaneously integrate nonlinear interactions between soil, water, plant, and weather factors as well as management practices to determine crop productivity, environment stresses, and water and nutrient needs (Hodges et al., 1998; Newton et al., 2007) . Regional climate processes, including mesoscale circulations, cloud formation, radiative transfer, as well as energy and water recycling, strongly depend on surface heat and moisture fl uxes that are controlled by vegetation and soil storage. In particular, vegetation plays a major role in determining precipitation, interception, runoff , and the removal of moisture from the soil by transpiration (Dirmeyer, 1994; Xue et al., 1996; Liang et al., 2003) . Th us, all current global and regional climate models incorporate comprehensive land surface models to predict surface-atmosphere exchanges of energy, momentum, water, and other mass constituents (Dickinson et al., 1993; Sellers et al., 1996; Dai et al., 2003) . Th ey represent key interactions between surface and atmospheric processes. More recent land surface models depict vegetation dynamics that include the C and N cycles (Foley et al., 1998; Dickinson et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2004; Bonan and Levis, 2006) . Th ese models, however, focus more on large-scale processes and longterm changes rather than the detailed daily variation characteristics of crop growth. While typical crop growth models give a more complete treatment of the plant life cycle evolution, they lack the feedback processes that are essential to regional climate variations. Th us, these climate and crop models need to be coupled to better understand the interactions between regional climates, ecosystems, and agricultural crops (Tsvetsinskaya et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2001; Osborne et al., 2009) . Better integration of crop growth models with climate models can help provide the needed understanding and predictive ability.\nOur overarching goal was to couple the mesoscale regional CWRF model (cwrf.umd.edu; Liang et al., 2012b) with the cotton growth model GOSSYM (Gossypium-the cotton genus) to better predict climate-cotton interactions. Th ere exist many challenges to reach this goal. In the past, crop growth models were generally treated as \"black boxes,\" where full two-way interactions were lacking or, if included, consistency with the host climate models in the representation of the physical processes and soil properties that determine surface evapotranspiration, runoff , and the energy budget was not imposed (e.g., Heinemann et al., 2002; Doherty et al., 2003; Challinor et al., 2005; Xiong et al., 2008) . Like most crop growth models, GOSSYM has been developed, calibrated, and evaluated on the basis of site-specifi c measurements. Its application and resulting credibility across a broad region with geographically distributed grids have yet to be established. Given the driving weather or climatic conditions, the original GOS-SYM has approximately an additional 85 tunable parameters for users to calibrate at a farm site (Boone et al., 1993) . Specification for such a long list of unknown parameters is extremely diffi cult to accomplish and constitutes a major obstacle that introduces large uncertainties to the spatially distributed modeling of climate-crop interactions. Model evaluation, while critical, has been limited and most oft en subjective, mainly due to the lack of comprehensive observations and coupled predictive systems (Th orp et al., 2007; Xiong et al., 2008) .\nTh erefore, our specifi c objectives to achieve the goal of coupling GOSSYM with CWRF for distributed modeling were threefold. First, we fundamentally redesigned the soft ware to change the original GOSSYM from running over time at a specifi c location to integration over space in sequential times. Second, we generalized the estimation of adjustable parameters and the specifi cation of soil properties that are geographically distinct. Th is involved reducing the list, by defi ning most of the parameters with best available physical representations and observational estimates, to the fi nal two parameters: the initial NO 3 amount in the top 2 m of soil and the ratio of irrigated water amount to potential evapotranspiration. Th ese parameters were derived through inverse modeling that minimizes simulation errors for observed cotton yields across the United States. Th ese two parameters were validated indirectly by comparing the model total irrigated water amounts with U.S. statewide observations. Th ird, we conducted retrospective simulations to evaluate the ability of the redeveloped GOS-SYM to reproduce historical cotton yield variations as driven by realistic climate conditions. Th is study, the fi rst in a series, addressed the fi rst and second objectives, with a focus on model development, including soft ware reengineering, physics improvement, and parameter determination. A companion study (Liang et al., 2012a) fulfi lled the third objective, where spatiotemporal variations of cotton yields and their responses to climate stresses simulated by the redeveloped GOSSYM were compared with observations."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "Model Development Given important diff erences in physics formulation and coding structure between CWRF and GOSSYM, both soft ware engineering and physics modeling for the critical counterparts required appropriate modifi cations to ensure consistent model coupling and realistic representation of climate-crop interactions."}, {"section_title": "Brief Description of CWRF and GOSSYM", "text": "Th e CWRF is the climate extension of the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model (Skamarock et al., 2005) . Th is extension has been continuously refi ned with numerous crucial modifi cations to improve interactions among landatmosphere-ocean, convection-microphysics, and cloud-aerosol-radiation and system consistency throughout all process modules (Liang et al., 2005a (Liang et al., ,b,c,d, 2006 (Liang et al., , 2012b . An essential CWRF component is the Conjunctive Surface-Subsurface Process (CSSP) model. It predicts 11 layers of soil temperature and moisture (liquid or ice), fi ve layers of snow (mass, cover, and age), and a two-leaf (sunlit or shaded) canopy of temperature, radiation, and photosynthesis-stomatal resistance (Dai et al., 2003 (Dai et al., , 2004 . Th e CSSP also integrates horizontal water movement (across grids) as surface and subsurface runoff that results from rainfall excess, saturation depletion, and lateral fl ows due to resolved and subgrid topographic controls (Choi et al., 2007; Choi and Liang, 2010) . As such, the CSSP, which is most relevant to the coupling with GOSSYM in the present study, has outperformed major land surface models in predicting soil temperature and moisture distributions, terrestrial hydrology variations, and land-atmosphere exchanges (Yuan and Liang, 2011a) . It also allows the CWRF to produce pronounced downscaling skill for seasonal-interannual precipitation prediction across the continental United States (Yuan and Liang, 2011b) .\nAmong the 15 published cotton growth models (Jallas, 1998) , GOSSYM is comprehensive and widely used in commercial agriculture to aid in making crop management decisions. Th e model formulation, development, and application of GOSSYM have been well documented (Baker et al., 1983; McKinion et al., 1989; Baker and Landivar, 1991; Boone et al., 1995; Hodges et al., 1998; Reddy et al., 1997 Reddy et al., , 2002 . It is a mass-balance dynamic model that simulates C, N, and water processes in the plant and soil root zone throughout the cotton life cycle. It predicts crop growth (with detailed plant chemistry, morphogenesis, and phenology) and soil responses to environmental stresses, primarily from heat, water, C, and nutrients. Th ese stresses are determined by climate variables such as solar radiation, temperature, rainfall, and wind, as well as by soil properties and cultural practices including irrigation and fertilization."}, {"section_title": "GOSSYM Software Reengineering", "text": "Th e original GOSSYM source code was written in the FORTRAN 77 (F77) standard and departs substantially from the CWRF FORTRAN 90 (F90) modular designs. Th e F77 standard has numerous shortcomings when compared with F90. In particular, F77 includes neither the complex data type to describe the hierarchical structure of plant organic parts nor the dynamic memory allocation that is desired for actual objectives with variable dimension size such as the growing leaf, stem, root, and boll. In addition, the original code was written for simulations that are site specifi c and in its present confi guration is not suitable for coupling with the CWRF, where simultaneous calculations across a large array of geographically distributed grids are necessary. As such, the entire GOSSYM model soft ware was recoded to follow the CWRF F90 modular design .

In contrast, the respective GOSSYM components are much less comprehensive, where the model formulations are generally empirical and especially lack full interactions with atmospheric dynamics that limit model performance (e.g., Staggenborg et al., 1996; Khorsandi et al., 1997) . Given the crucial controls that soil temperature and moisture and evapotranspiration have on crop growth, development, and yield, we eliminated the corresponding modules from GOSSYM and, instead, utilized the more realistic prediction provided by the CSSP."}, {"section_title": "Soil Water Movement by Macropore Flow", "text": "Th e GOSSYM model treats the cotton fi eld soil on a twodimensional mesh with 20 horizontal rows and 40 vertical layers, where mass balances of water, NO 3 , NH 4 , and organic matter are maintained and root growth rates are predicted (Hodges et al., 1998) . Water movement is simulated by Darcy fl uxes into each 50-mm-thick layer, starting at the surface via infi ltration of rainfall and irrigation and moving downward by vertical diff usion and drainage to a 2-m depth. Meanwhile, soil moisture is transported upward to the atmospheric boundary layer through surface evaporation and plant transpiration of water uptake from the crop root zone. Within each layer, water is moved laterally using the same fl ux equations according to the soil water gradient and diff usivity. Any soluble chemicals, primarily NO 3 -N, are assumed to move with the water fl uxes.\nTh e original GOSSYM does not consider the macropore fl ow eff ect that is especially important in the U.S. Southeast, where the soil contains a high percentage of sand with low soil moisture holding capacity. We thus incorporated a macropore fl ow mode to allow rapid drainage of the soil, following Th eseira et al. (2003) . Th is mode was designed to limit the actual soil water holding capability, increase water stress, and consequently reduce crop yields. We kept the soil grid structure and water movement calculation from GOSSYM to easily and intuitively incorporate the irrigation and fertilization methods (sprinkler, furrow, drip, broadcast, sidedress, foliar, and their alternatives). Th e resulting total soil moisture tendency from fi eld water movement and the new macropore fl ow is updated at the same CSSP time interval to provide consistent calculations, such as evaporation and runoff from CSSP, if fully coupled with the CWRF."}, {"section_title": "Vegetation and Soil Property Distributions", "text": "Th e CSSP uses the USGS land use or land cover classifi cation with 24 categories (Liang et al., 2005a,b) . Figures 1a and 1b illustrate the geographic distribution of the USGS categories identifi ed as the dominant type (Table 1) in each CWRF 30-km grid and the USDA county-level harvested cotton acreage averaged during 1979 to 2005. We eliminated cotton growth in minor production areas (e.g., Kansas) where the yield within a 30-km grid was <165 kg ha -1 and where there were missing data during 1979 to 2005. Across the U.S. Cotton Belt, the prevailing USGS categories are shrubland, grassland, and their mixture (southwestern states: California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas) as well as cropland and woodland mosaics (Lower Mississippi River basin: Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Mississippi, and Tennessee) and dryland cropland and pasture (southeastern states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia). We fi rst acquired the USDA data archive to defi ne where and when cotton grows and whether it is irrigated. Th e CSSP vegetation was then assigned to one of the four cropland categories (dryland cropland and pasture, irrigated cropland and pasture, cropland-grassland mosaic, cropland-woodland mosaic) by the cotton dominance in each grid. Th e GOSSYM model requires inputs at each cotton plot for the soil depth and water table as well as vertical profi les that include the following: (i) sand and clay percentages; (ii) bulk density; (iii) volumetric water content at saturation, fi eld capacity, permanent wilting point (water potential of -1.5 MPa), and air dry (soil humidity in equilibrium with the surrounding air); (iv) the water potential at fi eld capacity; and (v) diff usivity at the permanent wilting point. Direct measurements of these parameters are laborious and their general application across the U.S. Cotton Belt is limited. In contrast, CSSP uses Penn State University 1-km soil characteristics data to defi ne the depth to bedrock as well as the sand (Fig. 1c ) and clay profi les (Liang et al., 2005a,b) . Th ese quantities are then used to calculate all the other soil properties (Saxton and Rawls, 2006) . Th e identical CSSP representation for the geographic distributions of soil properties was incorporated into GOSSYM to ensure consistent coupling with CWRF and eliminate subjective calibration."}, {"section_title": "Cultural Practice Specifi cations", "text": "Cotton was planted in 2010 on >4.47 million ha in the U.S. Cotton Belt (Fig. 1b ), especially the northern Texas High Plains, Mississippi Delta, irrigated valleys of California and Arizona, and southeast coastal states. Approximately 4.36 million ha were harvested. In addition to planting location and acreage, numerous other cultural or management practices must be specifi ed in each 30-km model grid. In particular, timely irrigation and maintenance of soil fertility are necessary to ensure productivity and profi tability because cotton is sensitive to both water stress and N loss caused by water stress (Reddy et al., 1997; Gerik et al., 1998) . Th ere is, however, no systematic data archive that includes detailed records of these practices, which diff er substantially among individual farms. Th us, we adopted the following approximations:\nCotton Type, Density, and Period. Two major types of cotton (upland and pima) are grown in the U.S. Cotton Belt, where upland cotton covers 5.24 million ha and pima cotton covers the remaining 0.08 million ha, as averaged during 1979 to 2005. Given its predominance, only upland cotton was considered in this study. Because state-and county-level data records are oft en missing, we chose a mid-season cotton cultivar. A sensitivity analysis showed that the other cotton cultivars usable in GOSSYM resulted in mean yield diff erences mostly within \u00b120% of mean yields using the mid-season cultivar under the identical cultivation parameters calibrated for the mid-season cultivar. Th e prevailing cultural information on the plant row spacing and density as well as planting and harvest dates are from the Agricultural Statistics Board (1997) and State Cooperative Extension together with published literature. Th ey diff er among the states (Table 2) . For example, row spacing ranges from 0.762 m in Missouri to 1.016 m in Arizona, Texas, and Oklahoma, while the density (number of plants per meter of row) varies between 4.9 in Virginia and 12.4 in New Mexico. Th e planting and harvest dates vary widely among the states, where each state has a harvest window of up to 1 mo. We used the middle of each window as the planting and harvest dates in each state. As such, the longest growing season spans the period from 30 April to 12 November in New Mexico. Th is is the window during which the GOSSYM integration for each year is conducted. Neither plant growth regulators nor pressure from weeds, diseases, insect pests, or catastrophic weather events was applied anywhere.\nCotton Area. Th e planting and harvest areas vary greatly from year to year. Both values were derived from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) archive at the county level. Th e GOSSYM model currently does not consider cotton mortality: when planted, it always grows but may produce little or no leaf, seed, and lint yield. For the purpose of validation, we only considered the harvest acreage. Figure 1b shows the processed harvest acreage distribution for each 30-km grid averaged for 1979 to 2005.\nFertilization. No county-level records of actual fertilizer application rates and dates for cotton are available. State-level data for annual N fertilizer rates (per fertilized cotton acre receiving N) during 1964 to 2005 are archived at the USDA Economic Research Service. Missing records in this database were replaced with regional averages reported by the USDA (Potter et al., 2006, Table 34 ). Table 2 lists the N rate for each Initial Soil Fertility. Th is includes residual or initial N and organic matter content in the soil. Th e geographic distribution of the annual organic matter content is specifi ed as one of the CWRF built-in surface boundary conditions (Liang et al., 2005a) . Th e initial N is an essential input factor for most crop models and is generally measured on site before planting. Such measurements, however, are not made publically available. Th us, for this study, we chose the initial NO 3 amount in the top 2 m of soil in the root zone to be an adjustable parameter.\nIrrigation. Th e annual irrigated areas for cotton were derived mainly from the NASS archive at the county level. Th e planting or harvesting fractional area of a county is treated as being irrigated or unirrigated as indicated by the practice record. When this information was not explicitly recorded, the irrigated area of cotton was estimated using the NASS Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey (FRIS) Census of Agriculture from 1984 from , 1988 from , 1994 from , 1998 from , and 2003 from . Constant extrapolation before 1984 from and aft er 2003 from and intercensus, linear interpolation between 1984 from and 2003 were used to produce the irrigation map for each year. Figure 1d illustrates the irrigated area percentage distribution averaged for 1979 to 2005. Irrigation was applied mostly in the southwestern states (California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas), while other states required notably less irrigation or were entirely rainfed. Past studies (Richardson and Reddy, 2004; Potter et al., 2006) irrigated 19.1 mm of water once the water stress factor fell below the threshold of 0.75. (Th e water stress factor, used only to trigger irrigation, is the ratio of plant water supply to demand, ranging from zero for the most severe stress to one for no stress [Baker et al., 1983] . In addition, GOSSYM uses the leaf water potential, which is a function of both root zone water availability and the prevailing atmospheric moisture demand, to determine the water stress eff ects on crop growth expansion, photosynthesis, and reproduction [Reddy et al., 1997] ).\nAn examination of the limited cotton farmer records from the archive at the USDA-ARS showed that the amount of irrigated water varied substantially, ranging from as little as 12.7 to 76.2 mm in Texas to as much as 25.4 to 254 mm in California and New Mexico, and that the dates of irrigation were irregular.\nSensitivity experiments on irrigation applications using trial and error suggest that it is desirable to specify a unique water amount, stress threshold, and separation period set for each farm. Th is is impossible at present, given the lack of actual data for the date of application, amount of water, and method of irrigation (sprinkler, furrow, drip, or their alternatives). Instead, we adopted an automatic approach based on the cotton daily water stress factor and potential evapotranspiration. A specifi ed amount of water, as an adjustable fraction of the local potential evapotranspiration, is applied once the water stress factor falls below the threshold of 0.75. Th us, we chose the ratio of the irrigated water amount to potential evapotranspiration as another critical adjustable parameter."}, {"section_title": "EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Model Parameter Estimation", "text": "Th e two fi nal adjustable parameters for the redeveloped GOSSYM are: (i) the initial NO 3 abundance in the top 2 m of soil in the root zone; and (ii) the ratio of the irrigated water amount to potential evapotranspiration. Both parameters vary widely across the U.S. Cotton Belt. Th ere are, however, no credible data to specify them correctly. Our strategy was to estimate both parameters through inverse modeling by optimization that minimizes local root mean square errors (RMSEs) of annual cotton yields simulated from observations during 1979 to 2005.\nTh e inverse modeling or optimization algorithm is well accepted and widely used in calibrations of crop growth models (Liu et al., 1989; Jones and Carberry, 1994; Calmon et al., 1999; Irmak et al., 2000; Gauch et al., 2003; Th orp et al., 2007; Xiong et al., 2008) . For example, Liu et al. (1989) derived the phenological coeffi cients for maize (Zea mays L.) through inverse modeling by closely matching the CERES-maize Th e use of this optimization in the current study required a large ensemble of GOSSYM standalone simulations. Th ey were driven by the same set of the most realistic climate conditions during 1979 to 2005, while the two adjustable parameters listed above were altered across the ensemble to cover their respective conceivable ranges. Th is standalone approach eliminated complications from any CWRF climate biases and nonlinear feedbacks and thus eff ectively confi ned the optimization result by reducing the physical and numerical defi ciencies specifi c to GOSSYM.\nAnnual cotton yield data for each county available from the NASS archive were used as the reference to evaluate GOSSYM simulations. Below we describe the driving climate conditions and model experiments to identify formulation defi ciencies, improve irrigation modeling, and achieve system optimization. Th ese eff orts aimed to minimize cotton yield errors to derive best estimates of the two adjustable parameters."}, {"section_title": "Driving Climate Conditions", "text": "Th e climate conditions driving the standalone GOSSYM simulation were taken from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) (Mesinger et al., 2006) . Th e NARR provides a long-term, consistent, high-resolution climate data set that represents the best available proxy of observations. Th e NARR adopts a 32-km grid, close to that of CWRF, and provides 3-h atmospheric and land surface data, including precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff , radiation fl ux, surface air temperature, humidity and wind, and soil temperature and moisture. Daily minimum and maximum temperature diff erences between NARR and the analysis based on surface (1.5-2-m) measurements from 7235 National Weather Service cooperative stations across the continental United States were generally small, having RMSEs within 1\u00b0C. Th e NARR biases in daily accumulative precipitation are relatively large, especially in the southeastern United States. As such, we replaced the daily precipitation with an objective analysis based on gauge measurements from the same cooperative stations (see Liang et al. [2004] for the data source and analysis procedure). Doherty et al. (2003) applied GOSSYM to simulate geographic distributions of cotton yields across the U.S. Southeast. Th ey used the original GOSSYM, however, as a \"black box\" model (i.e., without the modifi cations outlined above) and did not provide a direct model validation as driven by realistic surface and climatic conditions. Specifi cally, they presented the results under the following conditions: (i) one of three representative soil types (loamy sand, sandy loam, or silt loam); (ii) with or without irrigation application of an unstated amount (perhaps the default 19.1 mm) of water once the water stress factor dropped below 0.75; (iii) planting on 1 May and harvesting on 20 November; (iv) CO 2 concentration fi xed at 330 \u03bcL L -1 ; (v) generic fertilizer application of 165 kg ha -1 NO 3 ; (vi) climate variations during 1960 to 1995 simulated by global and regional climate models (containing important biases from observations). Th eir resulting cotton yields were substantially greater than the observations, with statewide overestimations ranging from 30 to 120%."}, {"section_title": "Original GOSSYM Defi ciencies", "text": "A similar experiment using the original GOSSYM was conducted in this study to simulate cotton yield distributions across the entire U.S. Cotton Belt during 1979 to 2005 under more realistic conditions that include observed CO 2 concentrations and climate variations, fertilizer application rates, and irrigation area percentages (all distributed on the CWRF 30-km grid), as well as state-specifi c planting and harvest dates. Th ese driving conditions are identical to those specifi ed for the redeveloped GOSSYM except that a single sandy loam profi le was chosen everywhere, no macropore fl ow was included, the initial soil NO 3 abundance was specifi ed as 165 kg ha -1 , and irrigation was applied as 19.1 mm of water whenever the stress level was <0.75, following Doherty et al.

Th e use of loamy sand and silt loam soil profi les did not substantially alter this outcome, although there were some small regional contrasts. In addition, the standard deviation ratios in Fig. 2b indicate that model cotton yield interannual variability was approximately 138, 90, and 43% greater than observations in Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma, and Louisiana and Mississippi, respectively, but 19, 21, and 27% less in Arkansas and Tennessee, the southeastern states, and New Mexico, respectively. Th ese results clearly show that the original GOSSYM contains substantial biases. Th is necessitated incorporation of the key improvements outlined above into the revised GOSSYM as well as an enhanced irrigation scheme and optimal parameter derivation as described below."}, {"section_title": "Improved Autoirrigation Modeling", "text": "Th e redeveloped GOSSYM produced a much more realistic simulation of the long-term mean cotton yield distribution across the U.S. Cotton Belt. It still largely overestimated the cotton yield interannual variability, however, mostly for irrigated areas in the Southeast. Data analysis showed that the existing automatic irrigation scheme, based only on the static ratio of irrigated water amount to potential evapotranspiration under a fi xed water stress threshold (e.g., Hillel and Guron, 1973; Fischbach and Somerholder, 1974) , was likely to be the major cause for this overestimation. During severe drought years, simulated yields were much smaller than observations, suggesting that plants in the model were constantly subjected to water stress. To simulate a realistic long-term mean, the model has to produce higher than observed yields during wet years to balance the defi cits in dry years, which results in a large overestimation of interannual variability. Given that irrigation is applied once per model integration interval (currently daily) when the initial water stress drops below the threshold, the irrigated water amount in the present automatic scheme is insuffi cient under drought conditions for the model to maintain the relatively wet soil that is required for high observed productivity. Th is problem is particularly serious in the Southeast, where rainfed and irrigation practices oft en coexist, but less severe in the Southwest, where irrigation is the predominant practice.\nIt is more desirable to determine the irrigation amount based on the actual evapotranspiration (ET) and surface plus subsurface runoff . Th ese quantities, however, are not known before crop growth prediction. Instead, empirical estimates of the ratio to ET (runoff was not considered) were applied to incorporate crop characteristics and average soil conditions (Jensen and Heermann, 1970; Allen et al., 1998) . In reality, farmers probably irrigate with a larger amount of water per application in dry years to reduce the overall water stress. We therefore modifi ed the irrigation amount ratio to include an enhancement factor that increases with increasing departure of the threshold from actual water stress. Th e irrigated water amount, I, is expressed as a function of the daily water stress, S w (0.0-1.0, where the value is inversely proportional to stress), on cotton growth and potential evapotranspiration, E p :\nwhere \u03b1 is a geographically distributed coeffi cient for optimization to minimize local model yield biases from observations, \u03b2 is the enhancement factor (=3.0), and S c is the water stress threshold (=0.75) below which irrigation starts. Th is scheme was designed to reduce cotton yield interannual variability from the previous irrigation scheme, where the irrigated water amount was based only on ET and not related to current water stress, i.e., without the max[ ] term in Eq.\n[1]."}, {"section_title": "Optimization to Minimize Yield Errors", "text": "Th e redeveloped GOSSYM was then subject to adjustment by an optimization procedure that focused on the two unknown parameters: (i) the ratio of irrigated water amount to potential evapotranspiration (across the irrigated area only); and (ii) the initial soil NO 3 abundance (everywhere). Th is was accomplished via inverse modeling to determine the irrigation ratio and initial NO 3 values that minimized model biases of observed yields, averaged across the entire integration period at each CWRF grid. Given Eq. [1] , the determination of the irrigation ratio is simplifi ed to the estimate of parameter \u03b1. Note that other irrigation parameters, including the stress threshold S c , the enhancement factor \u03b2, and the application interval, also play important roles for the areas suff ering from water stress, especially in the southwestern states. Unfortunately, there exist no data to determine the accuracy of these adjustable factors and hence they are prescribed at present.\nGiven that all of the above driving conditions are realistically specifi ed, the time-varying annual cotton yields, Y t , at each grid modeled by the redeveloped GOSSYM depend only on the local initial soil NO 3 abundance, N 0 , and irrigation water ratio parameter, \u03b1, both of which were assumed to be time invariant in this study. Ideally, the numerical optimization is achieved by searching from the unlimited ranges of N 0 and \u03b1 for the values that minimize local RMSEs between the modeled and observed Y t . In actual agricultural practices, the amounts of irrigated water and applied fertilization are constrained by the invested costs relative to the fi nal yields. Th us, it is more realistic to construct the optimization to account for the cost eff ectiveness or effi ciency of N and water application. Following the defi nition of agronomic effi ciency (Molden, 1997; Novoa and Loomis, 1981; Grismer, 2002) , we calculated the local N productivity, NP, and water productivity, WP, as functions of N 0 and \u03b1:\nwhere \u03b4 denotes small increments of the adjustable parameters N 0 and \u03b1. Th e constrained optimization then fi nds the appropriate thresholds for NP and WP, below which further increases in N 0 and \u03b1 will not result in suffi cient Y t gains to justify the N and water use. Th is was done by using 1979 to 2005 mean yields. At present, the redeveloped GOSSYM applies all fertilized N (assuming in NO 3 -N form) once at the planting date, while the amounts vary according to the state records (Table  1) . We assumed that these actual amounts were determined by farmers as they assessed (based on past experiences) cotton NO 3 need aft er accounting for initial soil fertility. As a fi rst approximation, we have factored yearly initial soil fertility variations into the fertilization decision made by farmers and hence made N 0 constant with time. Moreover, the initial soil fertility incorporates fertilization diff erences including timing, amount, and composition between the reality and the model. Figure 3a depicts the NP statistics averaged for 1979 to 2005 over the Southwest, Mid-South, and Southeast regions in terms of varying N 0 from 110 to 440 kg ha -1 (in increments of 27.5 kg ha -1 ) for \u03b1 values of 0.05, 0.50, and 1.00. Th e results indicate that NP decreases in each region as N 0 increases and \u03b1 decreases; however, there exist important regional diff erences in NP sensitivity to \u03b1 variations. Th e greatest sensitivity occurred in the Southwest, where productivity exceeded that of any other region when \u03b1 = 1.0 but was zero when \u03b1 = 0.05. Although productivity in the Mid-South is also sensitive to \u03b1, NP was less than that across the Southwest for the larger \u03b1 values, while there was a low level of productivity when \u03b1 = 0.05 and N 0 was <250 kg ha -1 . Th e value of NP across the Southeast was less sensitive to \u03b1 variations than in the other regions, and there was substantial productivity when \u03b1 = 0.05. Th e results show that, while cotton growth is a function of both N 0 and \u03b1, the importance of these stress factors varies among regions. For the Southwest and Mid-South (mainly Texas), rainfall is insuffi cient and irrigation is the primary water source for crops. Th us, water availability is the key limiting factor for NP, regardless of N 0 . In the Southeast, however, where rainfall is much greater, irrigation has a relatively small impact on productivity. Th us, NP in the Southwest responds strongly to increased irrigation, while productivity in the Southeast is much greater than in the other regions when irrigated water is low. Given interstate and regional diff erences, we chose the NP optimization threshed to be 0.75 kg cotton kg -1 NO 3 . Th is corresponds to the lowest observed value reported by Bronson et al. (2003) . Figure 3b shows the WP statistics averaged during 1979 to 2005 across the Southwest, Mid-South, and Southeast in terms of varying \u03b1 from 0.1 to 0.9 in increments of 0.05 for N 0 values of 440, 330, and 220 kg ha -1 . Th e results indicate substantial regional WP diff erences, where productivity was greatest in the Southwest and least in the Southeast. Productivity in the Southwest increased sharply from 971 to 4275 kg ha -1 for all N 0 values as \u03b1 increased from 0.1 to 0.15, and then decreased when \u03b1 exceeded 0.20. Th e WP in the Mid-South increased from 1100 to 2123 kg ha -1 for all N 0 when \u03b1 increased from 0.1 to 0.15, and then decreased when \u03b1 exceeded 0.15. Maximum productivity in the Southeast, 709 kg ha -1 , occurred when \u03b1 was 0.1. Th e WP then decreased as \u03b1 increased. In addition to these regional diff erences, productivity in each region was greatest (least) when N 0 = 440 kg ha -1 (220 kg ha -1 ), where WP sensitivity to N 0 variations was greatest (least) in the Southwest (Southeast). Th ese results illustrate that productivity in the Southwest and Mid-South is highly dependent on water availability when \u03b1 is small. When irrigated water is suffi cient, however, additional water leads to a decrease in WP. Th is is particularly true in the Southeast, where rainfall is suffi cient to maximize water production, and the addition of irrigated water causes WP to decrease for all \u03b1. Th ese results are consistent with those of Zwart and Bastiaanssen (2004), who reported WP increases with fertilization for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields in Niger, Syria, and Uruguay, and Singh et al. (2010) , who found signifi cant WP rises for cotton seeds in response to increased fertilization rates of 80 to 200 kg ha -1 under defi cit irrigation. Finally, note in Fig. 3b that, when \u03b1 becomes large, WP approaches 100 kg ha -1 . Th is means that for large \u03b1, an increase in irrigated water amount will not signifi cantly impact water use effi ciency. Th us, we chose the WP optimization threshold to be 100 kg ha -1 to ensure a high sensitivity of cotton yields to the irrigation water ratio."}, {"section_title": "Optimal Parameter Distribution and Validation", "text": "To examine the responses of the redeveloped GOSSYM to the optimization method described above, we conducted fi ve experiments: 1. CNTL: optimize both the irrigation ratio and initial NO 3 with WP >100 kg ha -1 and NP >0.75 kg cotton kg -1 NO 3 2. OPTI: optimize the irrigation ratio only and hold the residual NO 3 constant at 176 kg ha -1 3. OPTN: optimize the initial soil NO 3 only and apply the original GOSSYM irrigation scheme, i.e., apply irrigation with 19 mm of water whenever the water stress level is <0.75 following Doherty et al. (2003) 4. ULMT: optimize both the irrigation ratio and initial soil NO 3 without any limitation on WP and NP 5. NOOP: apply the original GOSSYM irrigation scheme and initial soil NO 3 of 176 kg ha -1 instead of optimizing them by inverse modeling Th e relative mean biases and ratios of standard deviations of simulated to observed cotton yields are shown for each experiment in Fig. 4 . Th e CNTL simulation performed well, where the long-term mean modeled yields were within \u00b110% of observations in the 30-km grids across major areas of the U.S. Cotton Belt (Fig. 4a) . Compared with the CNTL mean biases, both OPTI ( Fig. 4b) and OPTN (Fig.  4c ) reduced the underestimations in north-central Texas, but they increased overestimations by 4 to 17 and 6 to 15%, respectively, in the southeastern states, with averages of 12 and 7%, respectively. Moreover, OPTI signifi cantly underestimated long-term mean yields along the Mississippi River and Sacramento Valley in California by 11 to 27%, and OPTN overestimated yields by about 17% in areas of North Texas along the New Mexico border. Th e NOOP simulation (Fig. 4e ) systematically underestimated the observed yields in the southwestern states and along sections of the Mississippi River but overestimated yields in the other regions.\nTh e OPTI underestimations that occurred in heavily irrigated regions were caused primarily by insuffi cient soil NO 3 because the irrigated water amounts are adjustable, while the overestimations in the southeastern states indicate that the soil initial NO 3 of 176 kg ha -1 is too large for this region. Th e major cottonproducing areas in the southeastern states and North Texas along the New Mexico border are rainfed, with only limited areas receiving irrigation. Th e OPTN overestimations show that the old irrigation scheme is not suitable and that irrigated cotton yields are far too large and disproportionately impact grid area-weighted yields. Th e NOOP result also shows that use of the old irrigation scheme and initial NO 3 of 176 kg ha -1 generates excessive yield overestimations by 17 and 38% in the southeastern states and Texas rainfed fi elds, respectively, as well as substantial underestimations in the more heavily irrigated regions of the southwestern states (38% in California, 65% in Arizona, and 18% in the Mississippi Delta). Among the fi ve experiments, ULMT (Fig. 4d ) produced the best results because it optimized both the irrigation ratio and initial NO 3 without placing limitations on WP and NP. Compared with the CNTL experiment, ULMT produced slight improvements in the Southeast and Texas by reducing the underestimation by approximately 3%. Th is indicates that constraints on water and N productivities in the mathematical and statistical optimizing processes, which account for the actual cropping practices, do not decrease model performance substantially. Th e improvements generated by OPTI and OPTN in Texas also resulted from the removal of WP and NP constraints, respectively. By optimizing only one key parameter, however, either the irrigation ratio or initial NO 3 , both OPTI and OPTN simulated larger biases than the control experiment in key regions of the U.S. Cotton Belt.\nWhen the experimental long-term standard deviations were compared with observations, CNTL (Fig. 4f ) produced overestimations of 28 to 118% along the Mississippi River, southeastern states, and the southern part of Arizona, with an average of 64%. On the other hand, the average standard deviation was 27% smaller in New Mexico, the Texas High Plains, and southeast Texas. Th is pattern was produced in all experiments. Th e reduced variability probably occurred because the observed consequences of pest damage and improved management practices were not considered. Figure 5 illustrates the geographic distribution of initial soil NO 3 abundance in the top 2 m of soil in the root zone and the ratio of irrigated water amount to potential evapotranspiration derived from inverse modeling in the CNTL experiment. Th e initial soil NO 3 abundances were <103 kg ha -1 in the southeastern states and the Texas High Plains but >210 kg ha -1 along the Mississippi River and in the southwestern states. Th e ratio of irrigated water amount to potential evapotranspiration obtained by optimization did not vary with time. Th e heaviest irrigation, where the ratio of irrigated water amount was >0.8, occurred along the Arizona-California border. Th e areas with the greatest irrigation normally coincide with those that have largest initial soil NO 3 abundances. Moderate irrigation (irrigated ratio of 0.6-0.7) is located in the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys in California and isolated areas of the Mid-South states, while relatively little irrigation (irrigated ratio <0.6) occurs across the remainder of the U.S. Cotton Belt.\nGiven that accurate geographical distributions of observed initial soil NO 3 and irrigated water amount are not available, we compared the simulated state-level irrigated water amount with data from the 1984, 1988, 1994, 1998, and 2003 USDA FRIS to indirectly validate the optimization Cotton Belt states in 1984, 1988, 1994, 1998, and 2003. method used in this study (Fig. 6 ). We did not validate the initial soil NO 3 because credible initial NO 3 information is unavailable and its yearly variation is factored into the farmers' fertilization decisions. Th e results showed that simulated annual irrigated water amounts were in good agreement with the FRIS data in the Southwest and Mid-South during the survey years. In the Southeast, however, FRIS irrigated water amounts had larger uncertainties due to the small fraction of irrigated cotton and large spatial and interannual variations in irrigation practices. Th us, in some survey years, the FRIS irrigated water amounts were zero, such as for Tennessee in 1984, 1988, and 1994 . We assumed that the diff erences between modeled and FRIS irrigated water amounts in the Southeast resulted mainly from FRIS data uncertainties."}, {"section_title": "Result Improvement from the Original to Redeveloped GOSSYM", "text": "When compared with the original GOSSYM ( Fig. 2a ), the redeveloped GOSSYM (Fig. 4a ) substantially reduced longterm yield mean biases from 92 to 4% when averaged across the entire U.S. Cotton Belt. Th e standard deviation ( Fig. 2b vs. 4f ) overestimations in Arizona and southwest Texas were reduced from 138 and 90% to 33 and -21%, respectively. In addition, the redeveloped (original) model overestimated (underestimated) standard deviations in the southeastern states by 71% (27%). Th e larger value (i.e., 71% vs. 27%) does not imply that the redeveloped model has diminished capabilities. In fact, the underestimation produced by the original GOSSYM in this region probably occurred because cotton experiences small N and water stresses (without imposing physical constraints) that cause substantial mean yield overestimations that approximate the optimal values for the cotton cultivar ( Fig. 2a) . Th e standard deviation overestimation by the redeveloped model occurred because cotton yields were overestimated (underestimated) during wet (dry) years. In wet (dry) years, the irrigated cotton fraction in a grid is smaller (larger) and less (more) irrigated water is required. Given that the southeastern states contain a mixture of rainfed and irrigated cotton fi elds, the new autoirrigation scheme can only partially solve this problem because the actual irrigated cotton fraction varies annually and has a large uncertainty due to a lack of creditable data. Figure 7 compares the spatial frequency distributions of all cotton-grid pointwise relative mean biases, standard deviation ratios, and correlation coeffi cients of the original and redeveloped GOSSYM. For the relative mean bias, the occurrence of a larger frequency closer to 0.0 on the horizontal axis indicates that the model simulates more grids with smaller errors relative to observations, and hence is more realistic. Th e redeveloped GOSSYM has a peak frequency of 40% at the relative mean bias of -0.05, while the peak frequency of the original model is 7.5% at the relative mean bias of 1.05. Th is result clearly shows that the redeveloped GOSSYM substantially improved the simulation of long-term mean cotton yields. For the standard deviation ratio, simulation agreement with observations improves as the peak frequency approaches 1.0 on the horizontal axis. Th e frequency distribution diff erence of this ratio between the redeveloped and original GOSSYM is relatively small when compared with their relative mean bias contrasts. Th us, the two models produced interannual yield variability with comparable magnitudes.\nA more important capability in modeling variability is the temporal correspondence between GOSSYM and observed anomalies from 1 yr to another. Th is can be measured by correlating the time series. For this measure, the closer the peak frequency is to 1.0 on the horizontal axis, the better the model captures the observed variations. Th e redeveloped GOSSYM generates its peak frequency at 17% when the correlation coeffi cient is 0.65, whereas the original model has its peak value at 16% when the correlation coeffi cient is 0.25. Based on the Student t-test and assuming yearly independence, correlation coeffi cients >0.32 are statistically significant at the 0.05 level. Signifi cant correlations were simulated by the redeveloped and original GOSSYM in 87 and 40% of harvest grids, respectively. Th erefore, the redeveloped GOS-SYM substantially improved the simulation of the observed yield anomaly interannual variability. "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Th is study focused on the development of the geographically distributed cotton growth model GOSSYM for coupling with the regional climate model CWRF. Th e redeveloped GOS-SYM includes improved physics and interface development, where its key parameters are determined by an optimization method. In particular, model formulation consistency between GOSSYM and CWRF is incorporated for the physical representations of vegetation and soil properties, soil temperature and moisture, evaporation and transpiration, and photosynthesis radiation, as well as the numerical implementation of the dynamic coupling and soft ware engineering. Th e redeveloped GOSSYM then integrates the best available cultural practice specifi cations. As a result, the geographic distribution of irrigation practices and initial soil N content remain unknown due to the lack of credible observations. To close the system, we incorporated an improved autoirrigation model that computes the irrigated water amount once the water stress factor falls below a threshold of 0.75 on the basis of the simultaneous water stress and the ratio of the irrigated water amount to potential evapotranspiration. Hence, inverse modeling (with minimized modeled cotton yield errors) is used to optimize the geographic distributions of the fi nal two key parameters: the ratio of the irrigated water amount to potential evapotranspiration, as a surrogate for the unknown actual irrigation practice (stress threshold, water amount, and application interval), and the initial soil NO 3 abundance in the top 2 m of soil. Th e optimization also includes water and N productivities to account for actual cropping practices and showed that N productivity decreases as N 0 increases and \u03b1 decreases. Th e sensitivity to \u03b1 varied across the U.S. Cotton Belt and was strongest (weakest) in the Southwest (Southeast), where water productivity is greatest (least). Productivity in each region increased when \u03b1 was small and then decreased to a near constant value when \u03b1 became large. Given regional variations in WP and NP, we chose the NP optimization threshold to be 0.75 kg cotton kg -1 NO 3 and the WP optimization threshold to be 100 kg ha -1 .\nInclusion of the above improvements and optimizations in the redeveloped GOSSYM produced good agreement with observations, where simulated 1979 to 2005 mean yields were within \u00b110% of observed values across almost the entire U.S. Cotton Belt. In contrast, the redeveloped GOSSYM with the old irrigation scheme and fi xed initial soil NO 3 of 176 kg ha -1 generated substantial biases, with systematic cotton yield overestimations in the southeastern states, Mississippi River Delta, and Texas High Plains (heavily irrigated regions). Sensitivity studies further showed that optimizing only the irrigation ratio or initial NO 3 increased the mean biases across major cotton growing areas of the U.S. Cotton Belt, including the southeastern states, northern Texas along the New Mexico border, and the Sacramento Valley in California. Introducing the water and N productivity constraints to the optimization process to account for actual cropping practices did not substantially impact the results.\nTh e redeveloped GOSSYM realistically reproduced the geographic distribution of mean annual yields across the U.S. Cotton Belt. Good agreement between simulated annual irrigated water amounts and observations from FRIS data in the major irrigated cotton regions illustrates the improvements that resulted from use of the new irrigation scheme and optimized irrigation ratio. In the companion study (Liang et al., 2012a) , the redeveloped GOSSYM was used to study the responses of cotton growth to climatic stresses in the U.S. Cotton Belt and thereby to evaluate its ability to reproduce the observed cotton-climate relationships. Th e interactive GOSSYM, as coupled with the CWRF model, can be used in future studies to provide more credible and detailed depictions of cottonclimate interactions. Th e coupled modeling system will have wide applications in the fi elds of precision farming and policy development as they relate to food security."}]
