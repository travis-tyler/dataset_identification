Millions of people are currently living with AD worldwide, and the number is expected to grow rapidly as the population continues to age [1, 2] . With the failure of numerous drug trials, it is of great interest to identify modifiable risk factors that can be potential therapeutic targets for AD [3] [4] [5] . Epidemiological studies that directly test associations between measured risk factors and AD are difficult to conduct and interpret because identified associations are in many cases affected by confounding and reverse causality. These challenges in risk factor studies for complex disease are ubiquitous and are particularly critical for AD due to its extended pre-clinical stage -irreversible pathologic changes have already occurred in the decade or two prior to clinical symptoms [6] . In an effort to combat confounding and reverse causality, Mendelian randomization (MR) methods [7] [8] [9] have been developed to identify causal risk factors for disease using data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Despite the favorable theoretical properties in identifying causal relationships, these methods have limited statistical power, therefore they are not suitable for hypothesis-free screening of risk factors.\nMotivated by transcriptome-wide association study -an analysis strategy that identifies genes with genetically-regulated expression values associated with disease [10-12] -we sought a systematic and statistically-powerful approach to identify AD risk factors using summary association statistics from large-scale GWAS. GWAS for late-onset AD have been successful, and dozens of associated loci have been identified to date [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Although direct information about risk factors is limited in these studies, dense genotype data on a large number of samples, in conjunction with independent reference datasets for thousands of complex human traits, such as the UK Biobank [20] , make it possible to genetically impute potential risk factors and test their associations with AD. This strategy allows researchers to study risk factors that are not directly measured in AD studies. Furthermore, it reduces reverse causality because the imputation models are trained on independent, younger, and mostly dementia-free reference cohorts, thereby improving the interpretability of findings.\nHere, we introduce BADGERS (Biobank-wide Association Discovery using GEnetic Risk Scores), a statistically-powerful and computationally-efficient method to identify associations between a disease of interest and a large number of genetically-predicted complex traits using GWAS summary statistics. We applied BADGERS to identify associated risk factors for AD from 1,738 heritable traits in the UK Biobank and replicated our findings in independent samples. Furthermore, we performed multivariate conditional analysis, Mendelian randomization, and follow-up association analysis with a variety of AD biomarkers, AD-related pathology findings, and cognitive subgroup phenotypes to provide mechanistic insights into our findings."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Method overview", "text": "Here, we briefly introduce the BADGERS model. Complete statistical details are discussed in the Methods section. BADGERS is a two-stage method to test associations between traits. First, polygenic risk score (PRS) models are trained to impute complex traits using genetic data. Next, we test the associations between a disease or trait of interest and the PRSs of various traits. Given a PRS model, the genetically-imputed trait can be denoted as: \nis the vector of SNP-level association z-scores for trait \u073b , and \u07c1 is a diagonal matrix with the j th diagonal element being the ratio between standard deviation of the j th SNP and that of \u0736 . This model can be further generalized to perform multivariate analysis. If \u202b\u072d\u202c imputed traits are included in the analysis, we use a similar notation as in univariate analysis: is defined similarly to the univariate case as the vector of SNP-level association z-scores for trait \u073b ."}, {"section_title": "Simulations", "text": "We used real genotype data from the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) to conduct simulation analyses (Methods). First, we evaluated the performance of our method on data simulated under the null hypothesis. We tested the associations between randomly simulated traits and 1,738 PRSs from the UK Biobank and did not observe inflation of type-I error ( Supplementary Table 1 ). Similar results were also observed when we simulated traits that are heritable but not directly associated with any PRS. Since BADGERS only uses summary association statistics and externally estimated linkage disequilibrium (LD) as input, we also compared effect estimates in BADGERS with those of traditional regression analysis based on individual-level data. Regression coefficient estimates and association p-values from these two methods were highly consistent in both simulation settings (all correlations > 0.94; Figure  1A and Supplementary Figures 1-2) , showing minimal information loss in summary statistics compared to individual-level data. To evaluate the statistical power of BADGERS, we simulated traits by combining effects from randomly selected PRS and a polygenic background (Methods). We set the effect size of PRS to be 0.02, 0.015, 0.01, 0.008, and 0.005. BADGERS showed comparable statistical power to the regression analysis based on individual-level genotype and phenotype data ( Figure 1B) . Overall, our results suggest that using summary association statistics and externally estimated LD as a proxy for individual-level genotype and phenotype data does not inflate type-I error rate or decrease power. The performance of BADGERS is comparable to regression analysis based on individual-level data.

We repeated the analysis on two independent GWAS datasets for AD and further combined the statistical evidence via metaanalysis (Supplementary Figure 3) . We used stage-I association statistics from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP; N=54,162) as the discovery phase, then replicated the findings using 7,050 independent samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC). We identified 50 significant PRS-AD associations in the discovery phase after correcting for multiple testing, among which 14 had p<0.05 in the replication analysis. Despite the considerably smaller sample size in the replication phase, top trait PRSs identified in the discovery stage showed strong enrichment for p<0.05 in the replication analysis (enrichment=2.5, p=2.2e-5; hypergeometric test). In the meta-analysis, a total of 48 trait PRSs reached Bonferroni-corrected statistical significance and showed consistent effect directions in the discovery and replication analyses (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 2 ).\nUnsurprisingly, many identified associations were with dementia-related PRSs. PRSs for Family history of AD and dementia showed the most significant associations with AD (meta-analytic p=3.7e-77 and 5.2e-28 for illnesses of mother and father, respectively). The PRS for having any dementia diagnosis is also strongly and positively associated (p=8.5e-11). In addition, we observed consistent and negative associations between PRSs for better performance on cognitive tests and AD. These cognitive traits include those for fluid intelligence score (p=2.4e-14), time to complete a card matching task (p=2.8e-9), ability to remember and comply with an instruction despite interference information (p=9.1e-11), and many others. Consistently, PRSs for educational attainment showed strong inverse associations with AD. The PRS for higher age at which the person completed full time education was inversely associated with AD (p=2.5e-7). PRSs for four out of seven traits based on a survey about education and professional qualifications were significantly associated with AD ( Supplementary Figure 4) . Higher education traits, such as having a university degree (p=4.4e-12), A levels/AS levels or equivalent education in the UK (p=6.9e-9), and professional qualifications (p=7.1e-6), were inversely associated with AD. In contrast, the PRS for choosing \"none of the above\" in this survey (i.e. do not have any listed education or qualification) was directly associated with AD (p=1.6e-11). Other PRSs with notable strong associations included those for high cholesterol (p=2.5e-15; positive) , lifestyle traits such as cheese intake (p=2.5e-10; negative), occupational traits such as jobs involving heavy physical work (p=2.7e-10; positive), anthropometric traits including height (p=5.3e-7; negative), and traits related to pulmonary function, e.g. forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1; p=1.9e-6; negative). Detailed information for all associations is summarized in Supplementary Table 2. "}, {"section_title": "Multivariate conditional analysis identifies independently associated risk factors", "text": "Of note, associations identified in marginal analysis are not guaranteed to be independent. We observed clear correlational structures among the PRSs of identified traits (Figure 3) . For example, PRS of various intelligence and cognitive traits are strongly correlated, and the PRS for consumption of cholesterol lowering medication is correlated with the PRS for self-reported high cholesterol. To account for the correlations among trait PRSs and identify risk factors that are independently associated with AD, we performed multivariate conditional analysis using GWAS summary statistics (Methods). First, we applied hierarchical clustering to the 48 traits we identified in marginal association analysis and divided these traits into 15 representative clusters. The traits showing the most significant marginal association in each cluster were included in the multivariate analysis (Supplementary Figure 5) . Similar to the marginal analysis, we analyzed IGAP and ADGC data separately and combined the results using meta-analysis ( Supplementary Table 3 ). All 15 representative trait PRSs remained nominally significant (p<0.05) and showed consistent effect directions between marginal and conditional analyses ( Supplementary Table 4 ). However, several traits showed substantially reduced effect estimates and inflated p-values in multivariate analysis, including PRSs for fluid intelligence score, mother still alive, unable to work because of sickness or disability, duration of moderate activity, and intake of cholesterol-lowering spreads. Interestingly, major trait categories that showed the strongest marginal associations with AD (i.e. family history, high cholesterol, and education/cognition) were independent from each other. Paternal and maternal family history also showed independent associations with AD, consistent with the low correlation between their PRSs (correlation= 0.052). "}, {"section_title": "Influence of the APOE region on identified associations", "text": "Further, we evaluated the impact of APOE on identified associations. We removed the extended APOE region (chr19: 45,147,340-45,594,595; hg19) from summary statistics of the 48 traits showing significant marginal associations with AD and repeated the analysis. We observed a substantial drop in the significance level of many traits, especially family history of AD, dementia diagnosis, and high cholesterol ( Supplementary Table 5 and Figure 4 ). 38 out of 48 traits remained significant under stringent Bonferroni correction after APOE removal. Interestingly, the associations between AD and almost all cognitive/intelligence traits were virtually unchanged, suggesting a limited role of APOE in these associations. Removal of an even wider region surrounding APOE showed similar results (Supplementary Figure 6 ). "}, {"section_title": "Causal inference via Mendelian randomization", "text": "Next, we investigated the evidence for causality among identified associations. We performed MR (Methods) in IGAP and ADGC datasets separately and meta-analyzed the results. Among the 48 significant traits identified by BADGERS, inverse variance-weighted (IVW) MR identified 23 nominally significant causal effects (p<0.05) on AD ( Supplementary Table 6 ). The signs of all significant causal effects were consistent with results from BADGERS. The most significant effect was family history (p=1.1e-233 and 1.7e-69 for illnesses of mother and father, respectively). Having any dementia diagnosis (p=9.1e-7), high cholesterol (p=4.1e-6), A levels/AS levels education (p=1.7e-4), and time spent watching television (p=2.4e-4) were also among top significant effects. Of note, fluid intelligence score, one of the most significant associations identified by BADGERS, did not reach statistical significance in MR (p=0.06)."}, {"section_title": "Associations with AD subgroups, biomarkers, and pathologies", "text": "To further investigate mechanistic pathways for the identified risk factors, we applied BADGERS to a variety of AD subgroups, biomarkers, and neuropathologic features ( Supplementary Table  7 ). Overall, 29 significant associations were identified under a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.05, and these AD-related phenotypes showed distinct association patterns with PRSs for AD risk factors (Figure 5; Supplementary Figure 7 ). First, we tested the associations between , on te is) ed ng ed of nt er, A so nt S le off for en the 48 PRSs for AD-associated traits and five AD subgroups defined in the Executive Prominent Alzheimer's Disease (EPAD) study of cognitively-defined AD subgroups, i.e. isolated relative impairments in memory, language, and visuospatial functioning, no domain with an isolated relative impairment, and multiple domains with relative impairments (Methods) [21, 22] . The PRS for maternal family history of AD and dementia was strongly and consistently associated with all five cognitively defined AD subgroups (Supplementary Table 8) , with the group with isolated relative memory impairment showing the strongest association (p=3.3e-16), which is consistent with the higher frequency of APOE \u03b5 4 in this subgroup [21] . The PRS for paternal family history was not strongly associated with any of the cognitively defined subgroups but the effect directions were consistent with those found for maternal history. Interestingly, PRSs for intelligence and cognitive traits, such as ability to remember and comply with an instruction despite interference information (p=2.7e-5) and fluid intelligence score (p=6.8e-5), were specifically associated with the group with no domain with an isolated relative impairment. PRSs for high cholesterol and related traits were positively associated with the groups with isolated relative impairments in language and memory and the group with multiple domains with relative impairments but showed weaker associations with the group with isolated relative impairment in visuospatial functioning and the group with no domain with an isolated relative impairment. Next, we extended our analysis to a different GWAS dataset for three AD-related biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): amyloid beta (A\u03b2 42 ), tau, and phosphorylated tau (ptau 181 ) [23] . Somewhat surprisingly, AD risk factors did not show strong associations with A\u03b2 42 and tau ( Supplementary Table 9 ). Maternal family history of AD and dementia was associated with ptau 181 (p=4.2e-4), but associations were absent for A\u03b2 42 and tau. It has been recently suggested that CSF biomarkers have sex-specific genetic architecture [24] . However, no association passed an FDR cutoff of 0.05 in sex-stratified analyses ( Supplementary Table 10 ).\nFurther, we applied BADGERS to a variety of neuropathologic features of AD and related dementias (Methods), including neuritic plaques (NPs), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Lewy body disease (LBD), hippocampal sclerosis (HS), and vascular brain injury (VBI) [25] . PRSs for family history of AD/dementia (p=3.8e-8, maternal; p=1.4e-5, paternal) and high cholesterol (p=2.1e-5) were strongly associated with NFT Braak stages ( Supplementary Table 11 ). NP also showed very similar association patterns with PRSs for these traits (p=2.7e-19, maternal family history; p=2.6e-7, paternal family history; p=0.001, high cholesterol). Of note, the association between the PRS of maternal family history of AD/dementia and NP remained significant even after APOE removal (p=2.3e-4; Supplementary Table 12 ). The other neuropathologic features did not show strong associations. Despite not being statistically significant, PRSs for family history of AD/dementia was negatively associated with VBI, and PRSs for multiple intelligence traits were positively associated with LBD, showing distinct patterns with other pathologies (Supplementary Figure  7) . We also note that various versions of the same neuropathology findings all showed consistent associations in our analyses (Supplementary Figure 8) . The complete association results for all the aforementioned endophenotypes are summarized in Supplementary Table 13 . "}, {"section_title": "Associations with cognitive traits in a pre-clinical cohort", "text": "Finally, we studied the associations between PRSs for AD risk factors and pre-clinical cognitive phenotypes using 1,198 samples from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP), a longitudinal study of initially dementia-free middle-aged adults [26] . Assessed phenotypes include mild cognitive impairment (MCI) status and three cognitive composite scores for executive function, delayed recall, and learning (Methods). A total of 12 significant associations reached an FDR cutoff of 0.05 ( Supplementary Table 14 ). Somewhat surprisingly, although the effect directions were consistent with other related associations reported in our study, parental history and high cholesterol, the risk factors that showed the strongest associations with various AD endophenotypes, were not significantly associated with MCI or cognitive composite scores in WRAP. Instead, PRSs for education and intelligence-related traits strongly predicted pre-clinical cognition (Figure 6) . PRSs for A-levels education and no education both showed highly significant associations with delayed recall (p=4.0e-5 and 7.7e-7) and learning (p=7.6e-6 and 5.0e-8). No education was also associated with higher risk of MCI (p=2.5e-4). Additionally, fluid intelligence score was positively associated with the learning composite score (p=7.5e-4), and time to complete a card matching task was negatively associated with the executive function (p=1.1e-5)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this work, we introduced BADGERS, a new method to perform PRS-based association scans at the biobank scale using GWAS summary statistics. Through simulations, we demonstrated that our method provides consistent effect estimates and similar statistical power compared to regression analysis based on individual-level data. Additionally, we applied BADGERS to two large and independent GWAS datasets for late-onset AD. Among 1,738 heritable traits in the UK Biobank, we identified 48 trait PRSs showing statistically significant associations with AD. These trait PRSs covered a variety of categories including family history, cholesterol, intelligence, education, occupation, and lifestyle. Although many of the identified traits are genetically correlated, multivariate conditional analysis confirmed multiple strong and independent associations for AD. PRS for family history showing strong associations with AD is not a surprise, and many other associations are supported by the literature as well. The protective effect of higher educational and occupational attainment on the risk and onset of dementia is well studied [27, 28] . Hypercholesterolemia is also known to associate with \u03b2 amyloid plaques in the brain and higher AD risk [29] [30] [31] .\nMore interestingly, these identified trait PRSs had distinct association patterns with various AD subgroups, biomarkers, pathologies, and pre-clinical cognitive traits. Five cognitively-defined AD subgroups were consistently associated with maternal family history, but only the group without substantial relative impairment in any domain was associated with PRSs for intelligence and education. In addition, PRSs for family history and high cholesterol were strongly associated with classic AD neuropathologies including NP and NFT while PRSs for intelligence and educational attainment were associated with pre-clinical cognitive scores and MCI. We also investigated the influence of APOE on the identified associations. Effects of PRSs for family history and high cholesterol were substantially reduced after APOE removal. In contrast, associations with PRSs for cognition and education were virtually unchanged. These results suggest that various AD risk factors may affect the disease course at different time points and via distinct biological processes, and genetically predicted risk factors for clinical AD include at least two separate components. While some risk factors (e.g. high cholesterol and APOE) may directly contribute to the accumulation of pathologies, other factors (e.g. intelligence and education) may buffer the adverse effect of brain pathology on cognition [28] .\nFurther, we note that the association results in BADGERS need to be interpreted with caution. Although PRS-based association analysis is sometimes treated as causal inference in the literature [32], we do not consider BADGERS a tool to identify causal factors. Key assumptions in causal inference are in many cases violated when analyzing complex, highly polygenic traits, which may lead to complications when interpreting results. In our analysis, BADGERS showed superior statistical power compared to MR-IVW -among the 48 traits identified by BADGERS, only 7 reached Bonferroni-corrected statistical significance in MR ( Supplementary Table 6 ). We envision BADGERS as a tool to prioritize associations among a large number of candidate risk factors so that robust causal inference methods can be applied to carefully assess causal effects. Limited sample size in the AD endophenotypes datasets is another limitation in our study. We have used data from the largest available GWAS for CSF biomarkers and neuropathologies. Still, small sample size made it challenging to assess the effects of traits that were weakly associated with AD. Finally, emerging evidence has highlighted sex-specific genetic architecture of AD [24, 33] . In our analysis, maternal family history of AD showed stronger associations with various phenotypes than paternal family history. This is consistent with what has been reported in the literature [34, 35] . However, we note that this may also be explained by the sample size difference in UK Biobank (N case =28,507 and 15,022 for samples with maternal and paternal family history, respectively). We also performed sex-stratified analyses for CSF biomarkers but identified limited associations, possibly due to the small sample size. Overall, sex-specific effects of risk factors remain to be investigated in the future using larger datasets. Finally, BADGERS requires training data for genetic prediction models and the downstream disease GWAS to be independent but of similar genetic ancestry. Development of methods that are more robust to sample overlap and diverse genetic ancestry remains an open problem for future research.\nIn conclusion, BADGERS is a statistically powerful method to identify associated risk factors for complex disease. Large-scale biobanks continue to provide rich data on various human traits that may be of interest in disease research. Our method uses GWAS to bridge large biobanks with studies on specific diseases, lessens the limitation of insufficient disease cases in biobanks and lack of risk factor measurements in disease studies, and provides a statistically-justified approach to identifying risk factors for disease. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of BADGERS through extensive simulations, a two-stage BWAS for late-onset AD, and various follow-up analyses of identified risk factors. Our results provide new insights into the genetic basis of AD and reveal distinct mechanisms for the involvement of risk factors in AD etiologies. The ever-growing sample size in GWAS and biobanks, in conjunction with increasingly accessible summary association statistics, makes BADGERS a powerful and valuable tool in human genetics research."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "BADGERS framework", "text": "The goal of this method is to study the association between \u073b , a measured trait in the study, and \u0736 , a trait imputed from genetic data via a linear prediction model: \nAdditionally, we derive the formula for the standard error of\nThe approximation in this formula is based on the assumption that trait \u073b has complex etiology and imputed trait \u0736 only explains a small proportion of its phenotypic variance.

On average, participants were 53.7 years of age (SD=6.6) at baseline and had a bachelor's degree, and 69.8% (n=836) were female. Participants had two to six longitudinal study visits, with an average of 4.3 visits, leading to a total of 5,184 observations available for analyses.\nDNA samples were genotyped using the Illumina Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center. Thirty-six blinded duplicate samples were used to calculate a concordance rate of 99.99%, and discordant genotypes were set to missing. Imputation was performed with the Michigan Imputation Server v1.0.3 [48], using the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) v. r1.1 2016 [49] as the reference panel and Eagle2 v2.3 [50] for phasing. Variants with a quality score R 2 <0.80, MAF<0.001, or that were out of HWE were excluded, leading to 10,499,994 imputed and genotyped variants for analyses. Data cleaning and file preparation were completed using PLINK v1.9 [51] and VCFtools v0.1.14 [52] . Coordinates are based on the hg19 genome build. Due to the sibling relationships present in the WRAP cohort, genetic ancestry was assessed and confirmed using Principal Components Analysis in Related Samples (PC-AiR), a method that makes robust inferences about population structure in the presence of relatedness [53] .\nComposite scores were calculated for executive function, delayed recall, and learning based on a previous analysis [54] . Each composite score was calculated from three neuropsychological tests, which were each converted to z-scores using baseline means and standard deviations. These z-scores were then averaged to derive executive function, delayed recall, and learning composite scores at each visit for each individual. Cognitive impairment status was determined based on a consensus review by a panel of dementia experts. Resulting cognitive statuses included cognitively normal, early MCI, clinical MCI, impairment that was not MCI, or dementia, as previously defined [55] . Participants were considered cognitively impaired if their worst consensus conference diagnosis was early MCI, clinical MCI, or dementia (n=387). Participants were considered cognitively stable if their consensus conference diagnosis was cognitively normal across all visits (n=803).\nThe 48 PRSs were developed within the WRAP cohort using PLINK v1.9 [51] and tested for associations with the three composite scores (i.e. executive function, delayed recall, and learning) and cognitive impairment statuses. MCI status was tested using logistic regression models in R, while all other associations, which utilized multiple study visits, were tested using linear mixed regression models implemented in the lme4 package in R [56] . All models included fixed effects for age and sex, and cognitive composite scores additionally included a fixed effect for practice effect (using visit number). Mixed models included random intercepts for withinsubject correlations due to repeated measures and within-family correlations due to the enrollment of siblings."}, {"section_title": "Software availability", "text": "The BADGERS software is freely available at https://github.com/qlu-lab/BADGERS ].
