One particular example is the extension from disease status to cognitive outcomes. Although beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are two major hallmarks of AD [1] , various cognitive tests remain the most common way to help with clinical diagnosis. Exploring the relationship between multimodal imaging and biomarker measurements and cognitive outcomes is an important research topic. \u2020 Correspondence to Li Shen (shenli@iu.edu).

Recent studies have explored multimodal data and reported improved performance (e.g., MRI, FDG-PET and CSF biomarkers were jointly studied in [2] ). Since multiple modalities are not completely isolated, there exist intercorrelations among those. Existing multimodal methods typically employ a simple strategy to bundle these data together, and thus ignore or oversimplify their relationships(e.g. [3] ).\nIn this paper, we propose a new network-guided sparse learning model embracing both the complementary information and inter-relationships between modalities. The proposed model is applied to evaluate the predictive power of MRI and CSF proteomic measurements towards cognitive outcomes. The empirical results demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-arts competing models, and also yield stable multimodal biomarkers across cross-validation trials."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "We write matrices as boldface uppercase letters and vectors as boldface lowercase letters. Given a matrix M = (m ij ), its i-th row and j-th column are denoted as m i and m j respectively. The Frobenius norm and 2,1 -norm (also called as\nWe focus on multi-task learning paradigm, where MRI and CSF measures are used to predict one or more cognitive outcomes.

Let X = [x 1 , . . . , x n ] and Y = [y 1 , . . . , y n ].\nThe 2,1 norm [4] is a multi-task version of traditional lasso. While lasso only focuses on the feature level sparsity, The 2,1 norm is proposed to couple multiple tasks together in addition to the original sparsity property: Yet in this model the rows of W are equally treated, which ignores the structures among predictors. Group-Sparse Multitask Regression and Feature Selection (G-SMuRFS) method [5] was proposed to exploit the structures within and between the predictors and response variables. It assumes 1) a partition scheme exists among predictors, and 2) predictors within one partition should have similar weights. G-SMuRFS can be thought of as a multi-task version of group lasso.\nIn practice, the relationship among predictors may not be as simple as a straightforward partition used by G-SMuRFS. Many studies have shown that the human brain can be modeled as a complex network. To model these complicated structures among predictors, we propose a new Network-Guided 2,1 Sparse Learning (NG-L21) model as follows.\nLet R be the predictor correlation matrix with R ij indicating correlation between predictors i and j. Given a threshold t, we can construct a network by connecting predictors with high positive and negative correlations (i.e., |R ij | \u2265 t). We hypothesize that positively (negatively) correlated predictors share positively (negatively) similar weights across tasks. Therefore, we try to minimize\nSince the selection of a proper threshold may be trivial, we also propose a threshold-free or weighted method as follows:\nHere sign(R ij ) deals with positive and negative correlations while R ij itself is applied to reduce the constraint impact on the less correlated pairs. Thus, the whole regularization term can be reformatted as ||NW|| 2 F , in which N is a neighboring matrix transformed from the symmetric correlation matrix R. In N, each row corresponds to one element in the correlation matrix R (Fig. 1) . For each pair of predictors i, j, we create a row in N with i-th entry as \u2212R ij , j-th entry as \u2212R ij sign(R ij ) and all the other entries as zeros. The intuition is that the weight difference between two correlated predictors should be minimized, which is reflected by the new regularization term of ||NW|| 2 F . Also by including the weight, the more correlated a feature pair is, the more constraint the pair is imposed by. We call this model NG-L21. Although this model is similar to graph-guided fusion [6] and group weighted fusion [7] , neither of the prior models explored the correlation of predictors and multi-task responses together. The final objective function is formulated as:\nwhere N is a sparse matrix where each row indicates a neighborhood relationship (i.e., edge) in the predictor network. Well known to be non-derivable, 1 -norm can be easily solved by approximate lasso where an extremely small value is added to enable the smoothness. Eq.

RESULTS"}, {"section_title": "Data and Experimental Setting", "text": "The MRI, CSF proteomic, and cognitive data were downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. One goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD [8] . For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org. This study (N=204) included 66 AD, 57 MCI and 81 healthy control (HC) participants (Table 1) . For each baseline MRI scan, FreeSurfer (FS) V4 was employed to extract [9] and surviving quality control process, were also included in this work. The 99 imaging measures and 82 proteomic analytes were used to predict a set of cognitive scores [8] : Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT, 5 scores shown in Table 2 as joint outcomes). Using the regression weights from HC participants, all the MRI, CSF, and cognitive measures were pre-adjusted for the baseline age, gender, education, and handedness, with intracranial volume as an additional covariate for MRI only."}, {"section_title": "Experimental Results", "text": "We denote the weighted network model as NG-L21 w , and the thresholded one as NG-L21 t . For comparing performances between these two models and competing methods (i.e., Linear, Ridge, elastic net and L21), regression analysis was conducted jointly on all five RAVLT scores. Based on the assumption that FS and CSF measures could provide complementary information, we performed 18 experiments based on six different methods and three datasets (FS, CSF, FS+CSF). In each experiment, Pearson's correlation coefficients (CCs) between the actual and predicted cognitive scores were computed to measure the prediction performances. Using 10-fold cross-validation, parameters were estimated and average CCs over 10 trials were reported. In our experiments, CSF proteomic analytes were found to have limited prediction power by itself (typically CC< 0.4). But combining CSF and FS yielded improved results than using FS alone (Table 3) , indicating possible complementary information provided by the two modalities. Both NG-L21 models outperformed the other methods in most cases. Ridge obtained comparable and sometimes better performances than NG-L21; but Ridge's root mean square error (not shown due to space limit) tended to be higher than NG-L21. Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b) show the regression weights in heatmaps and in brain space respectively. Ridge produced non-sparse patterns, which made the results less interpretable. Both NG-L21 and L21 identified a small number of imaging markers, including AmygVol, EntCtx, and HippVol, which were known to be related to RAVLT scores. NG-L21 w achieved similar or slightly better performance than NG-L21 t . This indicates that the NG-L21 performance is mainly determined by the correlations of high values and small weights (those were included in NG-L21 w but excluded in NG-L21 t ) have just modest effect on improving the performance. In addition, we also compared NG-L21 with GSMuRFS using symmetric information as grouping strategy. Generally they achieved similar performance, but tuned parameters of 2,1 -norm in GSMuRFS shrunk to almost 0, and led to non-sparse results. Fig. 2(c) shows regression coefficients of CSF proteomic markers for all 5 RAVLT scores. Since all the scores measure memory performance, the coefficients across these scores are similar for the top proteomic markers. Some proteins known to be related to AD (e.g., APOE, ApoC-III, CD40, FRTN) are detected for all these scores. For example, FRTN (ferettin) is the main iron-storage protein capable of containing thousands of iron atoms. Recently it has been reported that ferritin from AD patients has a content of aluminum higher than that of controls [10] . And the irregular iron accumulative and disrupted iron metabolism have also been previously identified to be related with brain disorders. Detailed analysis of these identified proteomic markers warrants further investigation."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We proposed a new network-guided sparse learning framework, NG-L21, aiming to flexibly incorporate and model structure among predictors. Unlike traditional methods, this model could provide advantages in several folds: 1) explicitly incorporating the relationships among predictors in a more general way, 2) using data-driven patterns without any predefined parameters, 3) effectively identifying biomarkers influencing multiple responses, and 4) selection of correlated markers together rather than picking only one of them to improve the stability. With the application to the ADNI multimodal data (predicting memory scores from MRI and CSF proteomic measures), NG-L21 demonstrated improved prediction performance over the state-of-the-art competing methods, and identified stable and meaningful multimodal biomarkers. Combining MRI and CSF proteomic data yielded enhanced prediction performance than each single modality."}]
