While JJA nighttime SoCAB and SFBA minimum temperatures T min showed expected GHG-induced warming, their T max -values exhibited a complex spatial pattern, with cooling (-0.30\u00b0C decade \u22121 ) in low-elevation coastal-areas open to marine air penetration and warming (0.32\u00b0C decade \u22121 ) at inland areas, which suggests that the inland warming resulted in increased coastal sea-breeze activity. Lebassi et al. (2010) showed that per capita energy consumption for summer cooling in the two coastal-cooling areas decreased during the period, while it increased in inland warming areas. Fig. 1 .

(2008) project a total 21 st century warming of 2-5\u00b0C for California surface temperatures. Downscaled regional climate modeling by Kueppers et al. (2007) showed western-US irrigation lowering average temperature (T ave ) and T max values at rates comparable to the increases from GHG warming. Similar modeling by Miller et al. (2003) showed California T ave warming rates of 2.1-4.5\u00b0C, while ensemble downscaling by Maurer (2007) of 1950-99 JJA median temperatures showed warming rates that decreases from 0.13\u00b0C decade -1 in inland California to 0.08\u00b0C decade -1 at coastal areas north of the SoCAB. While this showed coastal influences, its coarse spatial resolution could not sufficiently resolve local topographic features that affect mesoscale circulations and thus local temperature trends. Local modeling by Lobell et al. (2006) showed California temperature changes generally determined by GHG warming, but with large land-use changes locally dominant. Mesoscale climate-change modeling by Snyder et al. (2003) and Duffy et al. (2006) showed increased GHG-warming strengthens onshore pressure and temperature gradients, as land areas warm faster than ocean areas due to thermal differences. Thus enhance alongshore winds strengthened upwelling, which further increased onshore temperature gradients. McGregor et al. (2007) observed this effect over coastal northwest Africa, while Bakun (1990) hypothesized a similar scenario to explain observed 30 year increases of California upwelling. IPCC (2001) annual temperature trends for 1976-2001 do, in fact, show such cooling (up to 0.6\u00b0C decade -1 ) at all the west coast areas listed above, except Portugal. Recent local observational studies have also detected coastal cooling, e.g., Falvey et al. (2009 Falvey et al. ( ) analyzed 1979 Falvey et al. ( -2006 NCDC and gridded observed (annual-average and maximum) temperature trends over coastal Chile, and found coastal-cooling. Coastal sediment-cores along Peru, analysed by Guti\u00e9rrez et al. (2011) , also showed cooling SSTs for the latter part of the 20 th century. Oglesby et al. (2010) analyzed 4 km WRF modeled-differences (between 2000-2004 and 2050-2054) , forced with CCSM output, for Meso-America; coastal cooling was predicted along the Pacific coasts of Mexico and Central America. This result indicates that the currently discovered SoCAB coastal cooling might likewise continue over the next 50 years, although a similar series of WRF simulations by Zhao et al. (2011) for all of California did not show coastal-cooling, perhaps because they forced their simulations with output from the older Parallel Climate Model (PCM) model. While previous studies generally attributed observed JJA asymmetric warming in coastal California during the last three decades to increases in cloud cover, SSTs, upwelling, land use changes (i.e., urbanization, and/or irrigation); Lebassi et al. (2011) used the RAMS mesoscale meteorological model to quantify global warming effects on SoCAB summer sea breeze patterns and thus on Tmax trends. Thus, this study analyzed large scale input data used by Lebassi et al. 2011) for a difference simulations between summertime past (1966-'70) and present (2001-'05) atmospheric fields of surface air temperature, sea surface temperature and pressure over California. The changes in the vertical profiles of temperatures, wind, marine boundary layer height and subsidence are quantified. This will increase the understanding of the changes in the vertical structure of the boundary layer and possibly impacts of these changes to coastal cooling."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Model description", "text": "The overall goal of the current high-resolution RAMS mesoscale meteorological numericalmodel simulations of current (i.e., 2001-05) and past (i.e., 1966-70) SoCAB summer sea breeze wind and temperature patterns is to analyzed the large scale forcings of the RAMS simulations and the vertical structures of coastal cooling. An outer grid with a horizontal grid spacing of 16 km, and an inner grid of 4 km, are specified to capture larger scale (i.e., GC and synoptic) forcings and to further resolve more complex smaller mesoscale and urban phenomena, respectively. Simulations of 35 years of summer months are not feasible on such high resolution grids, because of the required large computational (i.e., one hour CPU time for one-day simulation-time with a 24 processor cluster) and storage resources. The current simulations are thus only for five consecutive summers during both a current (2001-05) and a past period. Resulting temperature and wind difference-fields are then quantified. RAMS (Version 6.0), developed at CSU, solves the Reynolds-averaged quasi-Boussinesq, non-hydrostatic, primitive equations on a Polar stereographic map projection (Tripoli and Cotton 1986) . It uses terrain-influenced sigma coordinates and an Arakawa-C staggered grid on which thermodynamic and moisture variables are defined at grid-volume centers, with velocity components on grid-face centers perpendicular to each component (Mesinger and Arakawa 1976) . Two fixed two-way interactive grids are centered over the SoCAB, with 30 vertical layers, stretched from a spacing of 0.03 to 1.2 km in the first 7.5 km (to increase near-surface uses time-split differencing (Pielke 1984) , as well as a variable-field model initialization and update process, in which gridded 3-D fields of wind, potential temperature, and relative humidity values from a large-scale, i.e., NCEP in this application, model are assimilated at 6 h intervals via Newtonian relaxation (Davies 1983) . The cloud microphysics formulation of Walko et al. [1995] and Meyers et al. [1997] was used; as it includes complex parameterization of many ice species. A cumulus parameterization was not used, as both grid resolutions were at or below the 9-km resolution needing such formulations. Vertical diffusion coefficients were computed from the 2.5-level closure in Mellor and Yamada (1982) , which employs a prognostic TKE equation. Short-and long-wave radiation were calculated following Mahrer and Pielke (1977) , in which simulated water vapor and specified CO 2 concentrations affect radiative flux divergence optical-path calculations via their effects on atmospheric-emissivity. The CO 2 concentration is assumed uniform in both domains at 330 ppm from the surface to 40 km, while down-welling long-wave flux at the model top is set to zero. The CO 2 value is comparable with the summer 329 ppm value observed by Keeling and Whorf (2004) at La Jolla, California in the early 1970s, while it underestimates the 2001 value of 369 ppm. Radiative effects from long-term global CO 2 -increases, accounted for via the NCEP BCs, are ingested into RAMS every 6 hrs. Local inner-domain radiative effects from CO 2 trends are not accounted for, but should be small over the five-summer simulation period. The 1966 The -1970 The -2005 periods were selected for simulation, as they showed similar large-scale PDO climate-variability factors. Strong winter El Ni\u00f1os produce decreased coastal upwelling in southern California, while strong winter La Ni\u00f1as produce the reverse (LadoChy et al. 2007 ). The more important multi-decaldal index influencing California summer climate, however, is the spring (MAM) PDO, evaluated from north Pacific SSTs. The JJA past-and present-periods were thus selected based on similarities between the trends of the anomalies of this index and those of coastal California JJA T ave -values; i.e., both periods generally show small upward trends in both variables [http://jisaao.washington. edu/ pdo/PDO.latest].\n2.2 Initialization, BCs, and statistical evaluation RAMS was initialized with NCEP gridded data-sets, interpolated (offline) to its grid by its internal isentropic analysis package. The NCEP data contains the following 4-D fields on horizontal pressure surfaces at horizontal increments of 0.5 deg: horizontal velocity components, temperature, geopotential height, and relative humidity. These fields generate 3-D assimilation fields every 6 h during the execution (started at 2400 UTC; 1700 LT in summer) that nudge the coarse-grid lateral boundary-regions. Lateral BCs on the outer grid follow Klemp-Lilly (1978) , a variant of Orlanski (1976) , in which gravity-wave propagation speeds computed for each model-cell are averaged vertically, with the single average-value applied over the entire vertical column. In this scheme, horizontal diffusion coefficients are computed as the product of horizontal deformation rate and length-scale squared (Smagorinsky 1963 (Lee 1992) . OGE LULC data are input into the RAMS BATS scheme, which condenses its 94 classes into 21. OGE data are used in the outer-domain for the current-period simulations, but the inner-domain uses the 30 m resolution, 38-class, 2000 data from the NOAA C-CAP (http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/data/ccapregional/index.html). OGE LULC data are normally condensed to one urban and 20 rural classes in RAMS, but for the current simulations, two SoCAB urban LULC classes dominate: commercial and lowdensity residential; the one additional urban class was thus added to LEAF-3. The LEAF-3 model (Walko et al. 2005 ) is used to calculate time-varying 2-D surfacetemperature and -humidity BCs from linked prognostic surface-energy and -moisture balance equations for each of the following basic LULC type (i.e., group of similar classes): bare soil, plant-canopy covered soil, and urban; water surface temperature is assumed constant. Within any surface grid cell, 30-m patches are used to represent the heterogeneity of LULC classes. Once moisture and temperature values for each LULC category within each surface grid are calculated, the heat and moisture fluxes are area-averaged within each cell, used within SBL-parameterizations as (constant with height) fluxes, and finally used as the lower BCs for the sub-grid diffusion schemes in the finite-differenced prognostic PBL equations. As the inner domain is mainly urbanized, the RAMS surface BCs were modified, to better account for urban processes, by the addition of a time-and spacing-varying Q A for each urban sub-grid 30 m \"patch.\" In US cities, Q A is typically 60% from traffic sources; 40% from residential and industrial activities; and only a few percent from human metabolism (Sailor and Lu 2004) . The current effort implements the time-varying daily profile, which shows morning and afternoon peaks associated with rush hour traffic. RAMS look-up tables provide literature-values (as a function of LULC class) for the radiative, physical, vegetative, and thermal parameters associated with the surface-BC formulation. Values for several of key parameters for urban and rural LULC classes show increased values \u03b1 and Vegetation height (H v ) values in urban areas. As is the spatial distribution of vegetation fraction (F v ) is an important input-parameter, a technique was developed to determine it from high resolution Google\u2122 earth-visible images as follows: (a) start with visible color Google map, (b) reduce map colors to 16, (c) count pixel values of each color in selected \"typical\" area for each urban class, (d) calculate fraction of green-color pixels to determine F v , (e) reduce map colors to two (black and white), (f) count both the black and white pixels, (g) calculate fractions of white pixels to determine rooftop fractions, and (h) calculate street fractions as black fraction minus vegetation fraction. Only the F v -value for each urban class can currently be input in the lookup table in RAMS. Further details can be found in Lebassi (2009) . An evaluation of RAMS-results at the 19-m level (i.e., lowest RAMS half-grid wind and temperature level) against 1-10 June 2002 (first 10-days of the \"present\" simulation) hourly observed 2-m temperatures and 10-m wind speeds from 12 SoCAB METAR weather stations was carried out by use of RAMS-values interpolated to those levels at the grid-point closest to each site. Daily-averaged surface temperatures from 15 COOP station had to be used to evaluate the past (1970) simulation results, as no hourly observations are available for that period. Both the RAMS 19-m level values and all observed values are hereafter referred to as \"surface\" values. Spatial distributions of statistical significance-levels of RAMS-produced temperature and wind-differences (i.e., present minus past) in Domain-2 were also calculated. Mean-values and standard deviations of RAMS surface winds and temperatures were calculated for each Domain-2 grid-point at 1200, 1400, and 1600 LT over each five-or one-year (as appropriate) past and present simulation-period for use in Student-t significance tests of differences. The study focused on these hours, as they are the period of strongest sea-breeze impacts on the coastal temperatures."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Model evaluation", "text": "A validation of present (1-10 June 2002) and past (JJA, 1970) model results against available surface observations was carried out. Figure 2 compares the time series of hourly average surface temperature and wind speed from the 12 SoCAB METAR stations for the period of the present simulations and daily surface temperatures from15 COOP station for the period of the past simulations with values from the RAMS grid point closest to each site. Due to the unavailability of observational data, only the daily maximum temperature is used to validate the past simulations. Present RAMS temperatures (Fig. 2a ) generally compare well with the observations [r 2 =0.87, Fig. (2c) ], as they capture diurnal cycles and day to day trends in peak-values. The 10 day average observed value was 19.1\u00b0C, while the modeled value was 20.3\u00b0C. RAMS captured the large-scale cooling trend over the first three days, the warming trend over the next four days, and the final three-day cooling trend. The largest discrepancies occurred on warm days, with overestimations of maxima by 2.5\u00b0C and minima by 2.0\u00b0C. RAMS wind speeds (Fig. 2b ) also compare well with observations, as they again generally capture diurnal cycles and daily peak values [r 2 =0.8, Fig. (2c) ]. The 10 days average observed value was 2.9 m s -1 , while the modeled value was 3.1 m s -1 . Minor discrepancies exist during the three hottest nights, which had observed near calm winds, when RAMS minima were about 1 m s -1 . Past JJA daily maximum surface RAMS temperatures (Fig. 3) also generally compare well with the observations [r 2 =0.7, Fig. (3a) , blue], as they capture average JJA cycles and day to day trends in peak values. The JJA summer average T max observed value was 26.5\u00b0C, while the modeled value was 27.3\u00b0C. RAMS captured the large-scale cooling trend over the first 13 days, followed by a warming trend over the next 13. The largest discrepancies again occurred on the warm days, with overestimations of maxima by 2.5\u00b0C and minima by 2.0\u00b0C. "}, {"section_title": "General circulation effects", "text": "GC forcing, the main external driver of the mesoscale RAMS model, enters through its initialization and BCs procedures. During summer, the semi-permanent Pacific High pressure system is located on its eastern edge, while a thermal low is over southeastern California. The resulting horizontal pressure gradient creates an onshore sea breeze flow over the SoCAB. This flow peaks in summer, when SSTs are coldest along the California coast within the southward flowing coastal California-current, as upwelling water reaches the surface as Ekman transport carries surface waters away from the coast. NCEP 2.5 deg spatial-resolution sea level pressure p s -values are interpolated from the input geopotential heights that initialize RAMS and provide its updated lateral BCs at 6 h intervals. The JJA-averaged 1000 hPa input NCEP p s -values at 1700 LT for the five-year past-period of Run-2 shows the Pacific High centered west of California (Fig. 4a) , with a central pressure center of 1024.3 hPa. The axis of the thermal low (central pressure of 1006 hPa) extends northward from Mexico to the California-Nevada border. The analogous input p s field for the five-year present-period of Run-1 (Fig. 4b) shows the High basically unchanged in position and orientation, while the thermal low (as expected from the greater global warming over the continent) has extended northward (further into Nevada) and westward beyond the southern California-Mexico coast. Changes in p s magnitude between the two simulations are best seen in Fig. 4c , in which the difference (herein defined as present minus past) pattern shows a broad region of decreased values of up to -0.4 hPa across the center of the High, north of a smaller area of increased values (up to 0.6 hPa). The two areas of decreased p s in Nevada and along the coast (from the SoCAB to Mexico) are due to the expanding thermal low; over-water decreases peak at -1.0 hPa along the Mexican coast. The thermal low, however, has expanded northward and southward, producing two areas of maximum pressure decreases (up to -1.0 hPa). It has also intensified and the pressure at its center has decrease by only -0.6 hPa, a smaller amount than both to the north (over Nevada) and south (over the SoCAB-Mexico coast). These input NCEP p s changes produce an increased west to east large-scale pressure gradient over the area that will strengthen the onshore large-scale background flow, onto which RAMS-produced mesoscale thermally-driven flows will be superimposed. The monthly-averaged ICOADS SSTs used as BCs in the RAMS Run-1 (present) and Run-2 (past) simulations have 2-and 1-deg spatial resolutions, respectively. Five-year average Domain-1 SSTs from the past-period Run-2 (Fig. 5a) show cold values (14\u00b0C) northwest of Domain-2 that increase southward (to 18\u00b0C). Present-period Run-1 results show cool-area values slightly reduced (Fig. 5b) , with warmarea values increased. Differences (Fig. 5c) show the peak cooling at only -0.2\u00b0C, while the warming increased southward (up to 1.2\u00b0C). Global warming is expected, as others have observed increased SSTs over this period (e.g., Hansen 2006). Averaged input JJA NCEP 1000-hPa temperatures 1700 LT for Run-2 (past) at a 2.5 deg spatial resolution (Fig. 6a) show cool ocean values (11 to 25\u00b0C), with warm land areas (25 to 41\u00b0C). The coldest area is west of SoCAB, while the warmest (41\u00b0C) is over Nevada. Run-1 (present) values show that the coldest ocean temperatures moved north-westward, while the hottest inland values moved southeast towards Arizona (Fig. 6b) . Differences (Fig. 7a) show cooling (up to -1.0\u00b0C) over the central ocean area, surrounded by a narrow band of warming ocean areas with values increasing (up to 0.6\u00b0C) southward along the coast from the SoCAB to Mexico. Over land, a narrow band of coastal areas (north SoCAB) showed slight cooling (up to -0.2\u00b0C), while inland areas warmed, with a maximum of 1.8\u00b0C over central Nevada. A vertical east-west cross section of these NCEP temperature changes at 34.0 N (Fig. 7b) shows the cooling over the coastal waters (up to -1.0\u00b0C) contained within the MBL (up to 925 hPa or 400 m); it also shows a local maximum global warming (1.2\u00b0C) at 900 hPa and an absolute peak (1.8\u00b0C) at 850 hPa. While global warming is expected, the cooling has not been found in previous observational or modeling studies (to the best of our knowledge), but is here-in hypothesized could be due to the southward movement of the Thermal Low in Fig. 4 . In summary, the large scale Pacific High is generally unchanged in position and orientation, but shows a diminished central pressure. JJA average 1700 LT NCEP temperatures at 1000 hPa showed cooling over the central California coast that extends up-wards to about 925 hPa. Finally, SSTs generally showed warming, which increased to the south. Vertical Profile of the NCEP data did not resolve the base of the marine boundary layer over the California coast. This large scale results are input for the model as ICs and BCs, and RAMS results in the next section will be analyzed to evaluate the vertical structure of GHG-induced coastal cooling. "}, {"section_title": "MesoScale effects: Modeled vertical structure of coastal cooling", "text": "A cross-section at 33.83 N (through Domain-2) shows the vertical extents of MBL-changes and coastal cooling, i.e., the 1600 LT Run-2 (present) temperature results shows cold marine air (ex post facto defined, see below, as having temperatures \u2264 21\u00b0C) coming onshore and up against the coastal mountains (Fig. 8a) . The subsidence inversion top from the High is at about 750 m and at a temperature between 22 and 23\u00b0C. Its base is at the surface (i.e., at 19-m, the lowest RAMS temperature grid level), as opposed to several hundred meters. According to Thompson (2010, personal communication) , this results as the RAMS TKE scheme does not generate sufficient mechanical turbulence over ocean areas. This occurred in the Coupled Ocean/ Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) model (developed for over-ocean forecasting) until recent changes were made to its TKE formulation. Air temperatures above the inversion-top decreases to 20\u00b0C at 2 km. The Run-1 (present) temperature cross-section (Fig. 8b ) also shows a similar structure, but the inversion-base is now elevated to 60 m (i.e., second lowest temperature grid level), while the inversion-top has grown to 900 m, which could be due to the decreased subsidence discussed below. Near-surface temperatures at the higher inland-elevations have warmed by about 1\u00b0C, while those at 2 km have cooled by a similar amount, both of which are expected from global warming theory. The corresponding difference plot (Fig. 8c ) more accurately visualizes these relatively small temperature changes, i.e., a shallow layer (50 to 120 m) of over-ocean temperature increase (up to 0.4\u00b0C) exists, due to the increased SSTs discussed above and which causes formation of the shallow marine sub-inversion layer in Fig. 8b . Above this, a 450 m layer that has cooled (up to -1.0\u00b0C) resulted due to the large-scale cooling in the NCEP BCs (Fig. 6) . Inland global warming peaks (at 1.4\u00b0C) at 2 km, while coastal cooling (up to -0.6\u00b0C) extends inland to the top of the coastal hills. The cooling is due to the increased sea breeze activity, as unconnected at 19 m to the NCEP-introduced cooling. If the inversion-base was accurately reproduced, then the SST induced near-surface warming-layer in Fig. 8c would extent upwards by several hundred more meters, which would thus also show the disconnectednature of these two cooling areas. The shallow over-ocean SST warming, large scale elevated-cooling, coastal cooling, and global warming where all significant at 99%, while the narrow transition layer was less significant (<90%) due to cancellation effects of coastal cooling and inland warming.

Summer-averaged (over five-year periods of past and present simulations) Domain-2 temperature (\u00b0C) cross-section at 14 LT for Run-2 (past, top left) period, Run-1 (present, top right) period, and (c) present minus past (lower), where dashed lines represents inversion base and top and white dashed box represents area of D2 cross section at 33. 83 N (see Fig. 7 for location).\nThe vertical velocities in the vertical plane of Fig. 9 also showing the disconnected nature of the two cooling areas, i.e., the 1400 LT Run-2 (past) section (Fig. 9a) shows a peak subsidence from the High (up to -1.6 cm s -1 ) over the ocean at 800 m, with peak upward motion areas over both the coastal plane and coastal topography (up to 3.6 cm s -1 above the latter). Similar results are found for Run-1 (present) (Fig. 9b ), but with a weaker subsidence (only up to -0.6 cm s -1 ) over the ocean and decreased upward motion over coastal areas. The \"difference\" vertical-velocity field (Fig. 9c) shows these changes more clearly, i.e., a maximum decreased of over-ocean subsidence of 0.6 cm s -1 at 500 m. The decreased upward motion over both land areas is also clearly shown, i.e., over the coastal basin and coastal mountains (both up to -0.6 cm s -1 ), the former associated with the increased stability of the stronger sea-breeze flow. The decreased over-ocean subsidence is due to the extension of the Thermal Low in Fig. 4c . Fig. 9 .

Results from a simulation with both present summer climate-conditions and LCLU-patterns were compared to one with present-LCLU and past (1966) (1967) (1968) (1969) (1970) climate. Evaluation of model results against hourly surface temperature and wind speed observations during a current 10-day summer period showed that they captured diurnal cycles and day to day trends in peak and minimum values, with an exception on several warm days; average errors were only 1.2\u00b0C and 0.2 m s -1 , respectively. Evaluation of model results against past daily maximum temperatures averaged over 15 COOP stations also showed good agreement in trend and magnitude, with an average error of 0.7\u00b0C. The shallow SST warming layer over the ocean, large scale elevated cooling, coastal cooling, and global warming were all significant at 99%. All transition-layers, in which two opposite effects cancel, showed less-significant (<90%) results. NCEP input BCs to RAMS of summer 1000-hPa at 1700 LT showed that during the 35-years between the past and present simulation periods, the Pacific High was generally unchanged in position and orientation, but slightly diminished in central pressure (up to -0.4 hPa). The over-land Thermal Low expanded northward and southward, producing two areas of maximum pressure-decrease (up to -1.0 hPa) over Nevada and the SoCAB-Mexico coast. These input NCEP SLP-changes produced increased west to east large-scale pressure gradients that thus strengthened onshore large-scale background flows, onto which RAMSproduced mesoscale thermally-driven flows were superimposed. ICOADS SSTs generally showed warming the 35-year period, which increased southward (up to 1.2\u00b0C) and which resulted from global warming. Concurrent input NCEP air temperatures generally showed a maximum global warming of 1.8\u00b0C at an elevation of 2-km over land areas. The warming extended downward to the surface over land areas, while a surface large-scale cooling over central California coastal waters (up to -1.0\u00b0C) extended upwards to about 925 hPa (or 400 m); effects from this imposed-cooling on RAMS results are discussed below. Lebassi et al. 2009 in their observational study analyzed that average-JJA California landsurface min and max temperatures from 1970-2004 showed expected asymmetric-warming, with increases of 0.27 and 0.06\u00b0C decade \u22121 , respectively. The larger min-temperature increase was significant at the 93% level and was comparable with (and correlated to) the coastal daily-mean SST trend of 0.24\u00b0C decade \u22121 (significant at the 92% level). Different rates of max and min temperature increase is consistent with previously observed asymmetric global-warming from increased greenhouse-gasses. The spatial distribution of comparable observed SoCAB JJA max-temperatures, however, showed a more complex pattern, with both cooling at low-elevation coastal-areas open to marine air penetration and warming at inland and high-elevation coastal areas. The scarcity of observational sites in some parts of both regions meant for additional modeling study of the region. Lebassi et al. 2011 further modeled the SoCAB coastal cooling using the RAMS model and results captured many important aspects of the observed surface inland-warming and concurrent coastal-cooling that developed during the 35-years between the present and past summer-daytime simulation periods, i.e., sequentially: weaker global warming over the ocean than over inland areas, increased surface temperature gradients, strengthened sea breezes, and thus coastal cooling. This study showed the vertical structure of coastal cooling in the finer RAMS domain. The model captured the vertical and horizontal extent of GHG-induced coastal cooling while www.intechopen.com there is some limitations discussed below, which are introduced from the meso scale and forcing model, in this case NCEP. Fine-domain temperatures at 1400 LT showed an overocean Pacific High subsidence inversion-top that increased by 150 m (to a height of 900 m) over the 35-year period. Its base, however, was much below a reasonable MBL height (i.e., of several hundred meters). According to Thompson (2010, personal communication) , these too low values resulted as the TKE scheme in RAMS does not generate sufficient mechanical turbulence over ocean surfaces, which also occurred in the COAMPS meso-met model (developed for over-ocean forecasting) until recent changes were made to its TKE formulation. In addition, vertical profiles of NCEP temperatures showed that the model does not resolve the inversion base due the few number of grid point in the boundary layer. Even though further future research is needed to analyze the impacts of the large scale input on the mesoscale model, this could underestimate the base of the marine boundary layer which is several hundred meters in the coast of California. This study showed a too-shallow warming (over the 35-year period) layer of only 50 to 120 m thus developed over the ocean, as the increasing input-SSTs were unable to warm (and thus destroy) the lowest inversion layers and thus produce a realistically deep MBL. Above the lower warming layer, a 450 m layer cooled over the 35-years due to the large scale cooling within the input NCEP BCs. Over-land coastal cooling (to the same height) extended to the first coastal hill-tops due to the increased sea breeze activity. This cooling is unconnected to NCEP-introduced largescale cooling, because the coarse-domain results showed separate areas for each effect. The past vertical-velocity pattern showed peak subsidence (-1.6 cm s -1 ) from the High over the ocean at 800 m, with peak upward motion areas over both the coastal plain (1.2 cm s -1 at 300 m) and first coastal topographic peak (>3.6 cm s -1 at 500 m). Similar present-simulation results were found, but with a smaller (reduction of up to -0.6 cm s -1 ) subsidence over the ocean, in association with the decreased intensity of the High and the increased elevation of its inversion top, discussed above. The (present minus past) difference vertical-velocity field showed decreased upward motion over both the coastal basin and first coastal peaks, with the former associated with the increased stability from the more intense present-case cool stable marine-air sea breeze flow. These distinct vertical velocity difference-areas also demonstrate the disconnected nature of the two cooling areas. In summary, the coarse domain RAMS results captured many important aspects of the observed surface and upper-level coastal cooling and inland warming that developed during the 35-years between the present and past simulation summer-daytime periods, i.e., sequential weaker global warming over the ocean than over inland areas, increased surface temperature gradients, strengthened sea breezes, and coastal cooling. Various significance impacts may result from coastal cooling, e.g., summer daytime max ozone levels are decreased due to reduced rates of: fossil-fuel usage for cooling, natural hydrocarbon production, and photochemical photolysis. Agricultural production, water supply, and human thermal-stress and mortality are also effected by max summertime temperatures. Similar effects could exist in other coastal regions, while other regional reverse-reactions may be found in a variety of topo-climatic areas, possibilities that require further study. Future modelling efforts could enhance the current simulations by inclusion of finer scale horizontal grid resolutions and better large scale that resolved the marine boundary layer base. The failure of the UN climate change summit in Copenhagen in December 2009 to effectively reach a global agreement on emission reduction targets, led many within the developing world to view this as a reversal of the Kyoto Protocol and an attempt by the developed nations to shirk out of their responsibility for climate change. The issue of global warming has been at the top of the political agenda for a number of years and has become even more pressing with the rapid industrialization taking place in China and India. This book looks at the effects of climate change throughout different regions of the world and discusses to what extent cleantech and environmental initiatives such as the destruction of fluorinated greenhouse gases, biofuels, and the role of plant breeding and biotechnology. The book concludes with an insight into the socio-religious impact that global warming has, citing Christianity and Islam."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "How to reference", "text": "In order to correctly reference this scholarly work, feel free to copy and paste the following:\nBereket Lebassi-Habtezion, Jorge Gonza\u013aez and Robert Bornstein (2011) .
