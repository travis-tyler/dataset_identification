To varying degrees, these promote excitotoxicity [9] , autophagy [10] , apoptosis [11] , and necrosis [12] , with resultant synaptic loss and neuronal death [13, 14] . Progressive dementia of insidious onset is the clinical manifestation of these processes that evolve over years to decades prior to expression of clinical symptoms [15] . While the core amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau biomarkers of AD [16, 17] are highly associated with the presence of signature plaque and tangle pathological hallmarks of AD in the brain [16] , they do not assess other fundamental biochemical aspects of the disease, such as non-amyloid and non-tau neurodegeneration or metabolic, immune, and neurovascular dysfunction [18] [19] [20] [21] . A panel of robust biomarkers that directly reflect these concomitant pathophysiologies may prove a better indicator of disease diagnosis [22, 23] , subtypes, staging, and activity, as well as treatment-specific target engagement.\nAs clinical trials continue to move towards pre-symptomatic individuals and disease prevention, it is critical to establish biofluid markers that may sensitively detect biochemical changes associated with disease onset and the intersecting pathophysiologies that drive disease progression [24, 25] . A panel of analytes that represent multiple facets of AD pathology and pathophysiology, as opposed to a single marker, may offer increased specificity and sensitivity in diagnosis [22, 23] , but more importantly, may also profile AD subtypes to enable precision medicine. Current clinical trials for AD focus on disease modification with investigational new agents that target general neuroprotection, neuroinflammation, metabolic and oxidative dysfunction, and neurovascular injury. Determining how active each of these pathophysiologies are in a given patient with pathway-oriented biomarkers may help guide choice of therapy, and would also be important for demonstrating and monitoring the effects of pharmacodynamic target engagement.\nA key consideration for the development of any biomarker is the reproducibility of results within and across times and laboratories. While the core AD biomarkers have been extensively evaluated in terms of precision, pre-analytical factors affecting measures, and utility in clinical research and care [21, [26] [27] [28] [29] , validations for newer candidate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are still in an early phase. Of particular importance for clinical trials is confidence in the stability of biomarkers over short-term repeat collections from the same individual, independent of disease-related pathophysiological changes [30, 31] . Highly dynamic analytes whose levels fluctuate widely from day to day as a result of diet, restless sleep, or other biorhythms or environmental influences, would not prove reliable in a clinical trial where a limited number of samples are collected over long periods of time. Like technical precision of an assay, this \"biotemporal stability\" of a biomarker needs to be considered in sample size determinations and study design so the measurements reflect true disease progression or drug effect as opposed to random noise. Low baseline variability over brief periods of time, as has been established with the core AD biomarkers [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] , increases the value of a CSF biomarker as a routine measurement in a clinical setting, suggesting that it may be sensitive enough to detect disease-related differences, disease progression over longer periods of time, or biochemical changes in response to intervention [31] . While there are a few reports describing short-term intra-individual variation of AD-relevant biomarkers in serum [31, 37] and over longer intervals (annual) in CSF [35] , stability over shorter intervals in CSF is rarely investigated or reported. Opportunities to conduct such analyses are scarce, as multiple lumbar punctures within short timeframes are seldom performed, even in the context of clinical research.\nWe implemented a fit-for-purpose modeled approach for evaluating and qualifying a broad selection of commercially available immunoassays for exploratory use with CSF. The assays represent five key domains of AD pathophysiology: 1) core AD amyloid-\u03b2 and total tau biomarkers, 2) non-A\u03b2 and non-tau neurodegeneration, 3) inflammation and immune modulation, 4) neurovascular markers, and 5) metabolism and oxidative stress. We identified 32 biomarker candidates with excellent performance characteristics by assessing technical assay reliability and biotemporal intra-individual variation of each biomarker in CSFs collected at two timepoints over an eight-week interval from individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia due to AD. These candidate analytes may be used to develop a broad, practical biomarker panel that simultaneously portrays the diverse pathophysiological processes involved in AD and related disorders. These rigorously validated analytes should perform consistently and reliably in profiling the complex pathophysiology of AD and monitoring changes during disease progression and intervention, ultimately enabling clinical trials and allowing personalized treatment."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study participants", "text": "CSFs were obtained at baseline and after 8 weeks as part of a pilot randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the effects of the drug metformin (versus placebo) in MCI/ AD (NCT01965756) [38] .

All subjects had a clinical diagnosis of amnestic MCI or mild dementia due to AD. Demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1 . As previously described [38] , eligibility criteria included: age 55 to 80 years at screening, clinical diagnosis of MCI or mild dementia due to AD with a Clinical Dementia Rating [39] [41] total < 6 to exclude concomitant depression, Modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale [42] score < 4 to exclude subjects with potential vascular etiology to their cognitive complaints, fasting blood glucose < 110 or HgbA1c < 6.0 to exclude subjects with diabetes or prediabetes, and at least one positive biomarker consistent with AD (i.e. previous A\u03b2 CSF, fluorodeoxyglucose or A\u03b2 positron emission tomography, or volumetric MRI). Individuals on an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor were required to be on a stable dose for at least 2 months prior to screening. Based on prerequisites for the intervention under investigation, potential subjects were ineligible if they had past or current diabetes or renal disease, evidence of infarcts, focal intracranial lesions or other neurodegenerative conditions, or unstable medical or psychiatric illness.

Using 24-gauge Sprotte 1 atraumatic needles, 20 mL of CSF was collected into polypropylene syringes according to standard procedure. Within 30 minutes of collection, CSF was aliquoted into 0.5 mL polypropylene tubes, bar-coded, frozen, and stored at -80\u02daC for subsequent analysis. CSFs were tested in duplicate in each of three experimental blocks to assess the intra-and inter-plate reliability of candidate assays. Repeat CSFs from 9 subjects in the 8-week placebo arm were used in paired assays and tested in each block to determine short-term intra-individual variation. After initial data inspection, samples from one participant in the metformin group were disregarded due to hemolytic contamination, resulting in artificially elevated analyte concentrations.

In addition, amyloid-\u03b2 peptide 1-42 (A\u03b2 1-42 ), total tau (tTau), and phospho-tau (pTau) data were available from prior testing in these samples at the ADNI Biomarker Core / Shaw Lab at the University of Pennsylvania [38] ."}, {"section_title": "Biochemical procedures", "text": "The performance characteristics of 60 unique potential biomarker analytes were evaluated in twenty single or multi-plexed panel kits ( Table 2) . CSF concentrations of 54 analytes were examined using the Meso-Scale Discovery (MSD) platform with commercially available simplex and multi-plex electrochemiluminescent (ECL) immunoassays (Meso-Scale Diagnostics, LLC, Rockville, MD). Along with replicating the core AD biomarkers A\u03b2 and tTau, we tested other potential analytes in the pathophysiological domains of neurodegeneration, metabolism and oxidative damage, neurovascular injury, and inflammation/immune modulation. Fourteen MSD assay panels for biomarkers of interest were chosen based on a number of factors including a priori pathophysiological relevance, assay availability, previous assay use in the literature, specific reported features of concentration sensitivity and range, previous use in CSF (if any) and previous findings in AD. An additional 6 colorimetric ELISA kits were used to measure markers not available through MSD. All kits were purchased in bulk to minimize lot-to-lot variability. Assays were performed according to manufacturer's specifications and samples diluted per assay requirements. For kits commercially validated for use with CSF, samples were diluted according to published dilution recommendations. (MRD) prior to final analysis (designated with a \u2020 in Table 2 ). For many of these assays, CSF samples were measured neat to allow concentrations to fall within a detectable range. The plate design scheme for sample wells and reliability measures is shown in Fig 1. Each plate contained the entire cohort of CSF samples, and all paired CSF samples per subject were included on the same assay in adjacent wells. This design ensured that plate-to-plate variability would not compromise biotemporal analysis of analyte concentrations between paired repeatcollection CSFs. Each CSF sample was assayed in duplicate per plate, and each plate experiment was replicated three times. A different 0.5 mL aliquot of sample was used for each assay replicate. Serially diluted standard curves and spiked controls were included on every plate and measured in duplicate.\nNumerical data obtained on the MSD platform were generated using the MSD Discovery Workbench1 4.0 software.

CSF analyte concentrations were natural-logarithm transformed prior to computing relevant statistical tests that required normally distributed residuals.\nA number of assays examined here had not been reported previously in CSF. Consistent detection of an analyte in plasma does not ensure detection in CSF, as the protein may not be generated in the CNS, its levels may be altered by blood brain barrier (BBB) selectivity, and/or its detection may be compromised by matrix effects. To verify whether each assay had sufficient sensitivity to detect an analyte(s) in CSF, we compared sample concentrations of analytes to the assay's lower limit of detection (LLOD), specific to each individual plate and analyte. The LLOD was calculated by the Discovery Workbench 4.0 software as 2.5 standard deviations above the background signal. For colorimetric assays, the published LLOD was used as the assay's sensitivity threshold. A biomarker assay was considered to be satisfactorily sensitive if it was consistently measured above the assay LLOD in > 80% of samples across all plates.\nFor use in any comparative study, it is critical that repeat measures are technically reliable. Moreover, to detect change with treatment in the context of typically slow disease progression, CSF levels should be biologically consistent and not fluctuate widely over short periods of time. An experimental scheme was designed to assess all forms of assay stability for analytes that passed LLOD criteria: intra-assay, inter-assay, and biotemporal stability (Fig 1) .\nIntra-assay reliability was assessed by calculating the median coefficient of variation (CV), or relative standard deviation, for duplicate sample concentrations within each of the 3 plates. Inter-assay reliability was assessed by calculating CV values for duplicate samples across three experimental blocks and tested statistically using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) [45, 46] . ICC estimates and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) were calculated using SPSS Statistics 24.0 based on ICC(3,3), a mean-rating, absolute agreement, 2-way mixed-effects model (recommended in [47] ). Mean normalization was first applied to each plate to correct for day-to-day technical variation, before calculation of the CV. Analytes with both intra-and inter-assay CVs below 15% were considered to have acceptable technical reliability. Data were natural-logarithm transformed prior to ICC analysis. ICCs were interpreted as follows: ICCs > 0.75 indicated strong reliability, ICCs between 0.5-0.75 reflected moderate to good reliability, and ICCs < 0.5 indicated poor reliability [48] .\nSamples from subjects in the placebo group were used for the intra-individual biotemporal variation assessment of each analyte that passed the technical precision criteria. Paired CSFs collected at baseline and after the first treatment block (8 weeks apart) were used to calculate CV values representing the biotemporal stability of analytes. The mean concentrations for each sample across the three experimental blocks was used for analysis. ICCs were not calculated for biotemporal variation as the sample size was not sufficient to satisfy test conditions. Similarly, given that analyte distribution could not be assumed to be normal, a Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks Test was used to assess whether there were significant differences between CSF collection timepoints. Finally, an analyte with a calculated biotemporal CV below 15% was considered to have low baseline variability."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Assay sensitivity for analytes in CSF", "text": "A total of 35 CSF samples collected from twenty study participants were included in this analysis.

In examining both technical reliability and biotemporal stability in CSF (S2 Fig), we established baseline variability in analyte measures, a prerequisite for the design and interpretation of biomarker measures in studies of differential diagnosis, disease staging, and tracking of longitudinal change with disease progression or intervention response. Biotemporal stability is often overlooked as a measure of assay reliability, but is important as metabolic, vascular, inflammatory, and other markers may fluctuate or otherwise vary over time. Analyte levels might be affected by circadian or seasonal rhythms, diet, environmental stressors, and intercurrent health issues. Such factors may compromise the comparative utility of these biomarkers, underscoring the importance of determining intra-individual variation prior to their inclusion as biomarkers in longitudinal studies or clinical trials. Determining baseline fluctuation of analytes also has statistical implications for the interpretation of both cross-sectional and longitudinal data, and can inform study design and sample size necessary to reveal significant differences in the primary outcomes of clinical trials. From our initial screening of 60 unique protein/molecular targets, we identified 32 promising markers that were measurable in CSF, passed our technical reliability performance criteria of better than 15% CV, and presented low intra-individual variation between repeat collected samples. The panel of high performing candidate analytes we identified represent important pathophysiological domains in AD-including neurodegeneration, inflammation/immune modulation, neurovascular injury, metabolism and oxidative stress-allowing for multi-pathway profiling of disease state. Their performance criteria would qualify these assays in research, though better performance would be necessary for clinical use. In addition, the multiplexed nature of these assays requires that more testing be performed if they are to be used in long-term studies, when different \"lots\" of assay kits might be used over time. Multiplexed assays are more subject to lot to lot variability, cross reactivity issues, and matrix effects than single-plex assays, and as a result should be assessed for spike recovery and parallelism on a lot-to-lot basis [50] .\nEach of the core AD CSF biomarkers tested (tTau, A\u03b2 1-38 , A\u03b2 , and A\u03b2 1-42 ) performed well in every measure, meeting the fit-for-purpose standards of sensitivity and stability for the MSD assays. These results were in agreement with published data evaluating the analytic performance of these proteins on this platform [51] . Of the non-core analytes, the non-A\u03b2 and non-tau neurodegeneration markers NfL and FABP3 were also remarkably stable over a twomonth interval, with comparable analytic performance to the classical AD markers. NfL is considered to be a marker of damage to large myelinated axons, and FABP3 is an abundant cytoplasmic protein that is thought to participate in the uptake, intracellular metabolism, and/or transport of long-chain fatty acids, playing a role in composition of lipid membranes [52] [53] [54] . NfL and FABP3 have both been reported to correlate with tTau [18, 55] and/or A\u03b2 [56] . However, neither is thought to be disease specific, but rather general markers of neurodegeneration [54, [57] [58] [59] . They may be useful as complementary biomarkers for staging AD or perhaps quantifying the amount or degree of active neurodegeneration at the time of the sample.\nAbnormalities in inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and immune modulators have been reported in AD, but replications have been less consistent. Among the more robust has been the secreted glycoprotein YKL-40 [18, [60] [61] [62] [63] , while data are less consistent on others such as monocyte chemokine MCP-1 [64, 65] and proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 [66] . The value of these inflammatory analytes as biomarkers in the diagnosis, prognosis, or progression of AD/ ADRD remains to be seen, but we can confirm the reliability and stability of their measurement for this purpose. In addition, we found that seven other inflammatory/immune molecules, not heretofore reported in CSF, also demonstrated good performance characteristics, including the interleukins IL-7, IL-12/23p40, IL-15, IL-16, and IL-8, MDC and MIP-1\u03b2. The role of neurovascular injury has been of increasing interest in AD, but relevant biomarkers are not well established. Some of the more commonly reported include adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 [67, 68] . We identified eleven potential biomarkers ( Table 2 ) of relevance to neurovascular injury that were reliably measurable in CSF and exhibited good biotemporal stability. Having established a method of reliably replicating the measurement of these markers will assist future studies investigating their roles in the pathogenesis of AD/ ADRDs.\nMany markers of metabolism and oxidative stress are reported to be present at very low concentrations in CSF compared to plasma or serum [69] [70] [71] . We were especially interested in measuring insulin levels in CSF, as insulin resistance is of great current interest in the field [7, 72] and insulin levels have previously been reported to be altered in the CSF of AD patients [73] . Using MSD and three additional commercial assays for insulin we found very low concentrations in CSF, at or below the lower limits of detection. Further work, perhaps with new, ultrasensitive single molecule array assays will be needed to reliably measure this important metabolic hormone in CSF for AD studies.\nOf the initial ten metabolism/oxidative stress biomarkers we surveyed, only five were reliably measurable in CSF, including sIR, adipokines adiponectin and leptin, the brain specific cholesterol metabolite 24-OHC, and oxidative stress related DNA modification 8-OHdG. Abnormalities in essential metabolic pathways, including trophic and metabolic signaling and regulation and cholesterol trafficking and turnover, have been reported in AD and associated with disease severity [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] . The relatively few reports prompt interest, and we hope the validation data we provide enable further study in this important area.\nIn conclusion, we have identified a pathophysiologically diverse set of CSF biomarkers that demonstrate consistent, reliable, and biotemporally stable quantification, establishing their potential for use in exploratory studies of AD. Subsequent work will assess the value of these high performing assays for inclusion in a practical biomarker panel for multi-dimensional molecular profiling in dementia as a tool for diagnosis and staging as well as assessing disease mechanisms, novel therapeutic target engagement of drugs or other biological interventions, and response in clinical trials. We conjecture that analyte profiles will differ among patients to varying degrees, thus allowing a personalized profile that may suggest a personalized treatment or prevention strategy.
