Diagnostic and prognostic performance was evaluated using ROC analysis and survival analysis with the Cox proportional hazard model. The three SUVr and all the tested features effectively discriminated AD subjects in cross-sectional analysis (all p < 0.001). In longitudinal analysis, the variables with the highest prognostic value were composite SUVr (AUC 0.86; accuracy 81%), skewness (0.87; 83%), local minima (0.85; 79%), Geary's index (0.86; 81%), gradient norm maximal argument (0.83; 82%), and the SVM model (0.91; 86%). The adjusted hazard ratio for AD conversion was 5.5 for the SVM model, compared with 4.0, 2.6, and 3.8 for cerebellar, pontine and composite SUVr (all p < 0.001), indicating that appropriate amyloid textural and shape features predict conversion to AD with at least as good accuracy as classical SUVr."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Considerable effort is ongoing to identify and develop reliable biomarkers of incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD) in order to target individuals who would most benefit from early treatment intervention , especially among subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Petersen et al. 2013; Ellendt et al. 2016) .\nPositron emission tomography (PET), using 11 C-labeled Pittsburgh B compound (PiB) or fluorinated tracers such as 18 F-florbetapir, allows in vivo visualization and quantification of cortical amyloid-\u03b2 deposition, with high sensitivity and specificity compared to amyloid plaque burden at autopsy (Pontecorvo et al. 2011; Clark et al. 2012) . The prognostic value of amyloid PET using fluorinated tracers (rated visually (Doraiswapy et al. 2014) , semi-quantitatively (Landau et al. 2012; Ong et al. 2015) , or both (Schreiber et al. 2015) ) regarding cognitive decline and conversion to 1 3 AD has been highlighted in MCI patients. Its clinical impact in terms of diagnostic confidence and drug treatment has recently been demonstrated (Boccardi et al. 2016) .\nSemi-quantitative measures of cortical retention with respect to a reference subcortical region provide accurate and robust evaluation of amyloid burden with high test-retest reliability (Joshi et al. , 2015 . Although the standardized uptake value (SUV) has historically been normalized using the brainstem, pons, or whole cerebellum as reference region, evidence is growing that composite reference regions that include subcortical white matter induce less variability in sequential measurements, yielding greater power to detect A\u03b2 accumulation (Chen et al. 2015; Landau et al. 2015; Brendel et al. 2015; Schwaz et al. 2017; . Measures of cortical retention in small specific cortical regions are, however, limited by partial volume effect (PVE) due to the limited spatial resolution of PET scanners and image post-smoothing (Brendel et al. 2015; Schwarz et al. 2017; Gonzalez-Escamilla et al. 2016; Rullmann et al. 2016 ). PVE appears particularly critical when quantifying cortical tracer uptake in subjects with brain atrophy consecutive to aging and neurodegenerative disease. Another shortcoming of the SUV ratio (SUVr) pertains to the variability in SUVr estimates depending on the partitioning method used to define the cortical and subcortical regions. MRI based templates provide higher accuracy and should be preferred whenever an MR scan is available , although dedicated PET templates have been developed to overcome the lack of MR data in clinical routine (Akamatsu et al. 2016; Hsiao et al. 2013) .\nThese last decades have seen considerable development in image-based feature extraction (Lambin et al. 2012) , and textural and morphological characterization of metabolic patterns in 18 FDG PET has become an emerging topic in oncological nuclear medicine (Chicklore et al. 2013; Orlhac et al. 2016; Buvat et al. 2015; Miwa et al. 2014; Apostolova et al. 2016) . Shape assessment of computed tomography or MR images using fractal analysis has also been exploited successfully for abdominal or cerebral tumor characterization (Goh et al. 2009; Hayano et al. 2014; Smitha et al. 2015 ). Yet, textural and shape feature extraction has scarcely been investigated in the field of neurological PET (Klyuzhin et al. 2015) , and particularly in amyloid PET. The study by Nemmi et al. (Nemmi et al. 2014 ) demonstrated that histogram analysis of florbetapir uptake in gray matter yields better performance than SUVr to discriminate between healthy and AD subjects in a small cross-sectional cohort. Shokouhi et al. showed that specific auto-correlation metrics measured on PiB (Shokouhi et al. 2015) and florbetapir (Shokouhi et al. 2016 ) PET images were more robust and better correlated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers than SUVr. Chincarini et al. proposed a global geometrical/intensity score allowing dichotomic assessment of florbetapir scans, based on the observation that both shape and contrast of amyloid deposition differ in normal and AD subjects (Chincarini et al. 2016) .\nIn the present study, we systematically evaluated the ability of several textural and shape parameters extracted from baseline amyloid PET to discriminate healthy and AD subjects. Their predictive value regarding AD conversion in cognitively impaired subjects was assessed against classical semi-quantitative rating using SUVr."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "In this study, we used participant data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a multicenter project with approximately 50 medical centers and university sites across the United States and Canada . The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. Its primary goal was to examine how brain imaging and other biomarkers can be used to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is expected to help researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. A detailed description of the inclusion criteria can be found on the ADNI webpage (adni-info.org). Subjects were between 55 and 90 years old and willing and able to undergo all test procedures including neuroimaging, and all had agreed to longitudinal follow-up.\nCognitively normal participants were the control subjects in the ADNI study. They showed no signs of depression using the Geriatric Depression Rate, mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Significant memory concern (SMC) participants scored within the normal range for cognition but indicated concerns and exhibited slight forgetfulness. Early and late MCI participants reported a subjective memory concern either autonomously or via an informant or clinician. However, other cognitive domains showed no significant impairment, activities of daily living were essentially preserved, and there were no signs of dementia. AD participants met the NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable AD (McKhann et al. 1984; Dubois et al. 2007) .\nData were downloaded from the ADNI database (adni. loni.usc.edu) and included all subjects from the ADNI-2 with available baseline florbetapir PET and cerebral MRI. Patients were recruited between January 2011 and September 2013. Seven patients for whom the automatic registration of amyloid PET with T1 weighted MRI failed were excluded. Our cross-sectional sample was made up of 181 normal controls and 148 AD subjects. Our longitudinal sample was made up 431 subjects who were rated as SMC (104) or MCI (173 early MCI and 154 late MCI) at baseline and underwent an average clinical follow-up of 32 \u00b1 15 months. Baseline and follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months, then yearly, included complete cognitive assessment using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). Diagnostic status at each follow-up visit was extracted from the latest available dataset ('DXSUM_PDX-CONV_ADNIALL.csv').

The florbetapir images consisted of 4 \u00d7 5 min frames acquired at 50-70 min after injection, which were realigned, averaged, resliced to a common voxel size, and smoothed to a common resolution of 8 mm in full width at half maximum (Joshi et al. 2009 ) (further technical details regarding PET acquisition and pre-processing are available online at adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/pet-analysis/). Structural MR images acquired concurrently with the baseline florbetapir images (mean delay 34 \u00b1 32 days) were used as a structural template to spatially normalize the PET images and define regions of interest (ROI) for each subject using SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre, London, UK). In brief, for each subject, the baseline florbetapir scan was rigidly co-registered to the baseline structural T1 weighted MR scan by maximizing normalized mutual information. The individual T1-MR scan was non-linearly co-registered to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space MRI template using tissue probability maps delivered with SPM. The nonlinear transformation was then applied to the co-registered PET data in order to spatially normalize the PET images to the MNI space.

Cortical retention indices (SUV) were computed within six cortical ROIs (frontal, parietal, temporal, precuneus, anterior and posterior cingulate cortices) that were averaged to create a mean cortical SUV. Cortical SUV ratios (SUVr) were obtained by normalizing the cortical SUV with the mean uptake in a subcortical reference region. For the present study, candidate reference regions were the pons, whole cerebellum, and a composite region made up of the whole cerebellum, pons, and eroded subcortical white matter Chen et al. 2015) . In the sequel, the corresponding SUVr will be respectively referred to as pontine SUVr, cerebellar SUVr, and composite SUVr. The boundaries of the three subcortical reference regions are shown in Fig. 1 . White matter erosion was performed by selecting voxels which neighborhood in a 9 mm radius sphere was composed of at least 90% of white matter. For comparison, cerebellar and pontine SUVr provided by the University of California (UC), Berkeley, were retrieved from the latest available dataset on the ADNI website ('UCBERKE-LEYAV45_10_17_16.csv').\nTextural and shape features were extracted in a volume of interest (VOI) that was built using region growing with a threshold constraint. The maximal intensity voxels in each cerebral hemisphere were chosen as seed voxels. Connected voxels that were above a given threshold were iteratively aggregated to the growing region. VOIs were constrained within a 1400 cm 3 enclosing envelope excluding extra-cerebral and sub-tentorial structures (see Fig. 1 ). Voxel values were normalized so that the maximal intensity inside the enclosing envelope was equal to 1. The segmentation threshold was sequentially set to 0.95 to 0 by steps of 0.05 (0.95, 0.90, 0.85\u20260.10, 0.05), each threshold resulting in a cerebral VOI.

That optimal threshold was retained for all subsequent statistical analyses and will be indicated as a subscript of the parameter in the sequel. Four parameters (surface, extension, 2D FrDim, and gradient norm) exhibited a modal distribution as a function of the segmentation threshold. Hence, maximal argument (argmax) of surface, 2D FrDim, and gradient norm, and minimal argument (argmin) of extension were investigated as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers. The distributions of the tested parameters in normal and AD patients were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The diagnostic and prognostic values of the tested parameters were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with clinical status standing as the gold standard. The ROC area under the curve (AUC) stood as a measure of the global performance in discriminating normal and AD subjects, either in cross-sectional or longitudinal analysis. The optimal cutoff value was defined as that maximizing Youden's index (sensitivity + specificity \u2212 1) in the cross-sectional cohort. Sensitivity was computed as the positivity rate in AD subjects, and specificity as the negativity rate in normal subjects. The same cutoff values were employed in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies were compared using McNemars's test.\nA least squares support vector machine (SVM) was used to construct a predictive model of AD conversion based on textural and shape features. An SVM is a nonprobabilistic binary classifier based on a set of hyperplanes that are optimized using a training dataset (Vapnik 1999) . Each tested SVM implied a combination of textural and shape features. The model was trained on the cross-sectional cohort using a quadratic kernel function and validated on the longitudinal cohort. Since an exhaustive search of the optimal combination of features was not computationally possible, the best SVM was built by first finding the optimal combination of three features then adding features one by one to the model. The optimization criterion was the maximization of ROC AUC in predicting AD conversion.\nThe predictive value of SUVr, textural and shape features, and the SVM classifier regarding conversion to AD in the longitudinal cohort was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Hazard ratios (HR) were adjusted using a Cox proportional hazard model including gender, age, ApoE4 status, and baseline ADAS-cog score as explanatory covariates. For patients who did not convert to AD, survival data were considered censored from the time of the last visit on record.\nA two-sided p-value \u2264 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The vertical dashed lines stand for the optimal threshold maximizing the z-score between normal controls and AD subjects in cross-sectional analysis. It is noteworthy that the distributions in normal and AD subjects were highly similar in both cohorts for all the tested features. As already stated, surface, extension, 2D FrDim, and gradient norm were characterized by a modal distribution in which the argument of the local extremum was sensibly different in normal and AD subjects. Table 2 details the performance of SUVr, textural and shape features, and the SVM classifier in the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Inter-quartile ranges in normal controls and AD subjects were significantly different for all the tested parameters (all p < 0.001 after correction for multiple comparison). Regarding SUVr, the composite reference region yielded the best performance with ROC AUCs of 0.85 and 0.86 and accuracies of 83% and 81% in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses respectively, and a hazard ratio for AD conversion of 7.4 (adjusted 3.8; p < 0.001).

Figure 4 shows the ROC curves of the three SUVr and the SVM classifier for predicting AD conversion. "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study based on prospective data from the ADNI-2 cohort, we investigated to what extent the texture and shape of amyloid deposition computed on baseline florbetapir PET were characteristic of AD status and predictive of AD conversion in MCI subjects. Concurrent baseline MRI scans were available and exploited for PET data normalization in order to obtain accurate brain partitioning for SUVr measurements . As expected, all three SUVr were significantly different in normal and AD subjects, in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Composite SUVr showed slightly better diagnostic and prognostic performance than cerebellar and pontine SUVr, in line with previous evidence of the superiority of SUVr accounting for white matter (Chen et al. 2015; Landau et al. 2015; Brendel et al. 2015; ).\nOur results demonstrate that amyloid PET textural and shape analysis is feasible and yields relevant semi-quantitative markers of amyloid plaque burden. The underlying approach eliminates the need for count ratio (SUVr) computations, which is appealing on both sides of the ratio. First, on the cortical side, the method does not require the segmentation of cortical regions of interest. Cortical ROIs are usually obtained after partitioning of the registered PET data using a reference atlas. Registration inaccuracies and segmentation imperfections related to inter-individual anatomical variability have an impact on the measured cortical retention indices. Registration and segmentation are particularly critical in subjects with cortical remodeling due to aging and neurovascular or neurodegenerative disease. Ideally, PET data registration should rely on concurrent MR imaging , which is often not available in routine clinical practice. Moreover, quantification of cortical ROIs inherently suffers from PVE, especially in subjects with cortical atrophy (Rullmann et al. 2016) . Second, on the subcortical side, our textural and shape characterization is independent of any subcortical reference. There is currently no consensus regarding the ideal subcortical reference region. Pontine and cerebellar uptake is prone to noise and longitudinal variability due to the small size of the considered regions and their peripheral location in the PET scanner field of view (Chen et al. 2015 ; Landau et al. . Although composite reference regions seem to allow more robust quantification (Chen et al. 2015; Landau et al. 2015; Brendel et al. 2015; Schwaz et al. 2017) , recent results tend to demonstrate that white matter uptake might not be as aspecific as it was thought to be .\nStandard assessment of amyloid PET is based on qualitative binary reading using established interpretation criteria that are applicable to PiB and fluorinated tracers (Minoshima et al. 2016 ). Quantification of amyloid deposition based on count ratios may be used in addition, although its variability among tracers, scanners, and post-processing methods still requires substantial standardization effort (Klunk et al. 2015) . The results presented here indicate that textural and shape analysis of cerebral tracer uptake are capable of translating visual impression into a relevant quantitative information. The validity of the proposed indices has been assessed using florbetapir images but should hold for other amyloid tracers. Indeed, although differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may induce variations in semiquantitative estimations, uptake patterns are expected to be similar.\nThe shape indices aimed to describe the loss of gray/ white matter contrast and the extension of tracer uptake to the edge of the cerebral cortex in pathological scans. These were thus characterized by a higher volume and surface, lower asphericity, higher convexity and extension, and lower 2D FrDim due to the smooth regular boundary of the cortical uptake (Fig. 6B) . In negative scans, the confinement of tracer uptake to white matter with numerous concave arboreal ramifications yielded the inverse trend in the shape indices (Fig. 6A) . These indices showed diagnostic and prognostic performance that was globally almost as good as that of SUVr. Of note, basic descriptors such as asphericity 55% and convexity 60% demonstrated diagnostic and prognostic accuracies and hazard ratio for AD conversion similar to those of optimal semi-quantitative rating. Although the 55% and 60% segmentation thresholds may appear limiting in the sense that they may vary in function of the tracer used or the scanner resolution, Fig. 2 clearly shows that the discriminative power of the shape parameters remained valid over a broad range of threshold values (40 \u2212 70% as regards asphericity and convexity, for example). Besides, the shape parameters that exhibited a modal distribution as a function of segmentation threshold, like surface or extension, were able to provide a pertinent global characterization of tracer uptake that was independent of any arbitrary segmentation, with excellent diagnostic and prognostic values.\nAlbeit broadly studied in the field of oncological PET imaging, textural features have been little investigated with regard to brain PET (and particularly amyloid PET) imaging. Textural markers of tracer uptake are known to carry subtle information that surpasses classical ROI quantification (Buvat et al. 2015) . The textural parameters tested here included well-established first-order (histogram-based) and second-order (GLCM-based) parameters, as well as standard measures of spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I and Geary's C). The L 2 norm of the image and its first and second derivatives, and the number of local minima, are less usual but appear as natural markers of global heterogeneity. Histogram-based indices (skewness 15% and cumulative histogram AUC 35% ) were highly correlated with the subject's status and strong markers of progression to AD, as they reflected the prevalence of high-intensity voxels in positive scans and low-intensity voxels in negative scans. This was already highlighted in ) based on separate histogram analysis of gray and white matter. Consistent with the results of Shokouhi et al. (Shokouhi et al. 2016) , global measures of spatial auto-correlation were relevant indicators of amyloid load distribution. Our results demonstrate their prognostic value, as Geary's C performance in longitudinal analysis was equivalent to that of composite SUVr (same AUC, accuracy, and adjusted HR).\nAs described in the Methods section, the image acquisition protocols of ADNI-2 were designed to ensure the consistency of PET data within and between sites, particularly in terms of spatial resolution (via post-smoothing) and signal-to-noise ratio (via injected doses, injection-to-acquisition delay, and scan duration). This standardization step was an important prerequisite for obtaining reliable shape and texture indices with minimal intra-class variability. Our results attest that such indices extracted from multi-site data carry relevant information provided that the image quality has been harmonized. PET images were spatially normalized to the MNI space for SUVr computations. For texture and shape characterization, voxel registration and labeling were also required to mask extra-cerebral activity. The lack of small cortical ROIs, however, renders the registration process and the template choice less demanding and dedicated PET templates should provide sufficiently accurate registration when MR data are not available (Akamatsu et al. 2016; Hsiao et al. 2013) .\nAutomated multivariate data analysis tools like discriminant analysis, na\u00efve Bayes classification, and support vector machine are powerful supervised learning techniques meant to deal with complex, high-dimensional data sets. Yet, implementation of such automated computerized methods in clinical routine requires careful preliminary investigation and validation. SVM and similar classification methods based on PET and/or MR data have already been proved useful for diagnosis and prognosis purposes in MCI and AD patients (Westman et al. 2012; Padilla et al. 2012; Dukart et al. 2013 ). This study demonstrates that, when optimally combined, textural and shape features yield at least as good predictive accuracy as classical semi-quantitation using SUVr. Of note, adding the SUVr to the SVM model did not improve its overall performance, attesting that the chosen SVM parameters were self-consistent descriptors of amyloid deposition and independent predictors of AD conversion. Further improvement of the proposed model is ongoing and should include combining additional biomarkers (MR morphometry, 18 FDG PET, CSF markers), training the model based on autopsy records, and long-term follow-up of the ADNI-2 cohort."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this study, we demonstrated that textural and shape analysis of florbetapir images provide relevant diagnostic and prognostic information.
