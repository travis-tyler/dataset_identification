This ambiguity is found across nations and is a characteristic of different educational systems. It produces uncertainty concerning different responses of educational leaders and teachers to ethical cases. This uncertainty can lead to a decrease in the status of educational leaders and teachers, since teachers may express insecurity concerning how they should behave when faced with an ethical issue.\nThe multitude of inappropriate behaviors among educational leaders and teachers harms the teaching profession, the quality of teaching, the schools's learning processes, and its scholastic achievements. Therefore, in order to lower the ambiguity surrounding these ethical cases, to empower the teaching profession, and to improve the educational systems' effectiveness, many countries throughout the world have developed ethical codes that are designed for educational leaders and teachers.\nThe goal of this book is to focus on organizational ethical aspects in the international context in different educational systems of the world, through the development of an integrative approach. It centers on teachers' withdrawal behaviors and the development of an ethical code for educators and teachers, which can serve as a tool for reducing misbehaviors and withdrawal behaviors among teachers. By discussing the leading ethical predictors for withdrawal behaviors, and considering personal and organizational characteristics, this book can contribute to an understanding of the perceptions and attitudes which that lead to teachers' tardiness, absenteeism, turnover, and attrition in educational systems.\nIn light of this, the book is divided into four main sections. The first section focuses on the expression of ethics in the international context by relating to both national culture and global culture. As part of understanding the international aspects of the concept of ethics, by considering educational systems, this section discusses the characteristics of teachers' behaviors in ethical schools. Such a process can lead to the emergence of the concept of ethical school culture -a concept that has not yet been investigated in educational systems via an organizational perspective. In this section, I present an integrative approach, simultaneously considering the concept of ethical school culture, in addition to traditional factors, such as internal and external school factors, in order to explain inequalities in students' achievements."}, {"section_title": "xxiv Foreword", "text": "This section also deals with the development and the assimilation of an ethical code in a number of different countries as a tool for dealing with ethical challenges in varied educational systems. The development of an ethical code for educators and teachers, and its assimilation in different educational systems of the world, can help lower the ambiguity surrounding ways to deal with ethical events that faced by educational leaders and teachers face. As a result, it can help empower the teaching profession, promote teacher education for social justice, and help advance quality educational systems across nations.\nThe second section focuses on the international aspects of ethics in the context of school leadership. This section discusses training processes and focuses mainly on the moral dimension of leadership -authentic leadership of school principals -while describing additional leadership styles imbued with ethical meanings, such as transactional and transformational leadership styles. It focuses on ethical dilemmas faced by educational leaders and provides help for the decision-making process that concerns ethical decisions.\nThe third section focuses on ethical perceptions of teachers, personal and organizational characteristics, and organizational commitment that predict teachers' withdrawal behaviors such as tardiness, absenteeism, turnover, and attrition.\nIn this section, the teachers' withdrawal behaviors serve as the criteria for the ethical challenges that concern all people working in educational systems across nations -from the level of teachers, educational coordinators, principals, supervisors, and district administrations of the ministries of education. While most of the studies on withdrawal behaviors of teachers have focused on socioeconomic factors in order to explain teachers' withdrawal behaviors, such as gender, seniority, and age, this book raises ethical aspects from the field that have not yet been studied in relation to withdrawal behaviors.\nI also describe the concept of organizational citizenship behavior, which is generally perceived as the opposite behavior of withdrawal behaviors, in this section. In addition, I discuss the characteristics of the relationship between teachers' organizational citizenship behaviors and teachers' withdrawal behaviors. At the end of this section, I present updated studies that have explored the relationship between ethical perceptions and withdrawal behaviors and organizational citizenship behaviors, including strategies and learner-centered education, for minimizing withdrawal behaviors in educational systems.\nThe fourth section of the book focuses on the applications of the topics previously presented and discussed previously. It explores how educational leaders throughout the world can deal with ethical challenges in educational systems by employing analyses of critical ethical incidents in group simulations. Furthermore, the section presents the gap between official policy and practice and innovative research in the area as well as the scenarios to use in different training frameworks.\nThe book's content can lead to plans of action for educational leaders across nations -those working in the headquarters of the ministries of education, in the schools, and in the educational departments of local municipalities. These plans of action can help minimize withdrawal behaviors and promote organizational citizenship behavior among teachers, and can help the schools increase excellent achievements and minimization of social gaps.\nThe discussion about the development of the ethical code, from an international viewpoint, which also demonstrates how the processes work in different countries, can influence functionaries and educational leaders, in different strata, who are in charge of human resources in educational systems. It can help educational leaders and teachers, across nations, to formulate ideas for developing, updating, and assimilating an ethical educational code by designing and facilitating educational programs and workshops. This ethical code can also help facilitate the definition of roles of teachers, help empower them, minimize inappropriate behaviors, and increase school effectiveness.\nThe book allows for the development of an integrative approach for coping with ethical challenges among educational leaders and teachers and connects theory to praxis. In light of the fact that many people throughout the world deal, in one way or another, with ethical challenges, this book is relevant for researchers and students in the field of administration and leadership in educational systems. It is also relevant for stakeholders interested in human resources in educational organizations at headquarters' level, in administrative and supervisory positions, directors in departments of education at the local level, and functionaries in school leadership, such as principals, vice principals, and pedagogical coordinators.\nIn sum, I believe that the strength of this book is derived from the fact that it developed from the fieldwork. I was a chemistry teacher and a homeroom teacher in a high school, as well as a mentor and a project manager for science education. Today, I am in research and teach in the academic world. As a result, the book presents an academic perception while also connecting to the field."}, {"section_title": "Section I", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "International Aspects of Ethics", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "This page intentionally left blank", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Chapter 1", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The Ethical Context: A Global Versus a National Approach", "text": "The concept of ethics focuses on perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors that include valuating, choosing, and acting, and taking into consideration desirable actions that connect to the notions of human rights and having responsibility for others (Rausch, Lindquist, & Steckel, 2014; Smith & Smith, 2016) . There are two main approaches to ethics and culture. The first one emphasizes differences in moral perceptions and moral judgments among cultures (Mel\u00e9 & S\u00e1nchez-Runde, 2013) . Researchers, who adopt this approach, perceive ethical national culture as influencing ethical perceptions and behaviors in organizations (Minkov & Hofstede, 2011) .\nHouse, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman, and Gupta (2004), in their Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) project, defined national culture as the common experience of individuals. This common experience results in the members of the culture developing shared values, beliefs, policies, and interpretations of meaningful events. As a result, members tend to perceive the world in distinctive ways. Minkov and Hofstede (2011) created a four-dimensional (4D) model of national culture that adopts this perspective, has become a cornerstone for cross-cultural research, and reflects current social values and practices (Shiraev & Levy, 2015) .\nFor example, research based on the first approach has found that cultural differences influence individuals' ethical reasoning skills (Christians, Fackler, Richardson, Kreshel, & Woods, 2015) . Furthermore, Forsyth, O'Boyle, and McDaniel (2008) undertook a meta-analysis of research from 29 different countries and found Western countries exhibit a more pragmatist ethic, while Eastern and Middle Eastern countries were found to be more subjective concerning moral rules. In another study, Ho (2010) uncovered differences in the ethical perceptions of Malay, Chinese, and Indian leaders. He found that cultural differences focus on various ethical attributes of moral dilemma. Li and Persons (2010) , who undertook a comparative study between Chinese and American students, which used an experimental corporate code of ethics, found that cultural differences resulted in less ethical decision making in the former group than in the latter group. In comparison to the first approach, which emphasizes cultural distinctiveness, the second approach avers that we need to acknowledge the existence of a global ethical culture vis-\u00e0-vis perception of ethics. An example of research based on this school of thought comes from the work of Cullen, Parboteeah, and Hoegl (2004) . These scholars used the institutional anomie theory to develop hypotheses related to four national culture variables (achievement, individualism, universalism, and pecuniary materialism) and found cross-national consistency of perceptions regarding ethically suspect behaviors. Other researchers, who have supported the existence of a universal minimal morality, have demonstrated that collective survival necessitates the universal adoption of certain basic values (Donnelly, 2013; Ivison, 2010) ."}, {"section_title": "International Aspects of Organizational Ethics in Educational Systems", "text": "Empirical studies have also shown that, beyond moral judgment in specific cases, there are core values or principles which are at the basis of these judgments and appear in the major world religions and traditions (Bok, 2002; Terry, 2011 , Tullberg, 2015 . As noted by Mel\u00e9 and S\u00e1nchez-Runde (2013) , it also appears that a global approach is essential for supporting and facilitating the application of a universal ethical policy in human rights that has been detailed in important documents pertaining to human rights. Examples of these documents include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other UN human rights covenants, texts, and principles, such as the UN Global Compact and its 10 ethical principles.\nIn the field of education, research has been undertaken on national ethical culture, which adopts the approach of cultural diversity and dissimilarity among different countries. These studies have explored ethical issues, such as social justice (Banks, 2015) , ethical dilemmas (Milner & Tenore, 2010) , and developing student potential (Klassen, Usher, & Bong, 2010) . On the other hand, different studies have focused on the existence of a global ethical culture, which is based on notions of universalism and similarity. Studies have examined topics, such as human rights in educational systems (Stromquist & Monkman, 2014) , reducing gaps (Zhao, 2010) , and quality education (Wang, 2011) . For example, one of the goals of international assessment, such as Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and Programme for International Student Assessment, is to promote equity policies that can help narrow achievement gaps and reduce differences in text scores between higher and lower scoring groups (Mullis, Martin, Foy, & Hooper, 2016) . In order to achieve this goal, participating countries design educational policies that take into consideration shared ethical values, such as promoting the potential development of students by maximizing the performance of students who have generally been low achievers (Hanushek & Woessmann, 2015) .\nThe most up-to-date research based on TIMSS 2015 questionnaires (ShapiraLishchinsky, 2018a) reveals that in order to better understand organizational ethics, we should consider the combination of universal values and national values.\nIn other words, we should explore the global values that are common in different countries while understanding that their effects may differ in the countries, and these differences will be reflected by different student academic achievements."}]
