[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The initial outbreak of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred during December 2019 in Wuhan, China. 1 Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly, and on March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. 2 By July 24, 2020, there were 4 024 492 confirmed cases and 143 868 deaths in the United States alone. 3 SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted person-to-person via respiratory droplets and is highly contagious with an average basic reproduction number (R0) of 3.28. 4 The incubation period lasts for approximately 5.2 days, after which patients typically experience a fever, cough, and shortness of breath. 5 While many patients with COVID-19 develop only mild disease, approximately 14% progress to a severe state (hypoxia, tachypnea, or >50% lung infiltrates), and approximately 5% progress to a critical state (shock, respiratory failure, or multiorgan failure). 6 Severe disease can occur in healthy individuals of all ages; however, older persons with preexisting comorbidities and racial/ethnic minority groups appear to be most at risk. 7, 8 For instance, a report published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that examined laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalizations in 14 states found that blacks were 1.8 times more likely to be affected by COVID-19 than would be expected based on population data alone. 9 These findings are further substantiated by state health department data that suggest blacks have been disproportionally affected by COVID-19 in a number of states across the United States 10, 11 However, the impact of COVID-19 on other racial/ ethnic minorities in the United States at the state and county levels remains largely uninvestigated since disaggregated data according to race and ethnicity are just recently becoming available. Therefore, further research is required to elucidate the impact COVID-19 has had on various racial/ethnic groups. The primary objective of this study is to identify how COVID-19 has affected all major racial/ethnic groups in the United States on a county, state, and national level. The modifying effects of social distancing, social vulnerability metrics, and medical disparities will also be examined."}, {"section_title": "Data Source and Population", "text": "COVID-19 data.

However, with regard to death rates, blacks, Asians, AIANs, and NHPIs were disproportionally affected compared to whites, while Hispanics were not disproportionately affected. This unexpected finding may be due to inconsistent reporting of Hispanic/Latino status across state health departments, possibly leading to inaccurate comparisons since this anomaly was not observed in aggregated national data from the CDC.\nOverall, older age was associated with increased death rates across all studied racial/ethnic groups. This observed disparity may be due to increased rates of comorbid conditions among minority groups. 20 In particular, several chronic conditions prevalent among minority groups, such as hypertensive disease, diabetes, and ischemic heart disease, were frequently observed in COVID-19 deaths with associated comorbidities. Nonetheless, these findings demonstrate that older age only exacerbates underlying racial/ethnic disparities. Blacks, Hispanic/ Latinos, Asians, and AIANs within the study age groups \u226535 years (35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, and \u226585 years) were disproportionately affected compared to whites. In contrast, NHPIs in the \u226585 years group were less affected compared to whites. In the absence of disaggregated COVID-19 infection rates according to age and race, it is difficult to assess why NHPIs experienced lower death rates than whites since, as a whole, the population has been disproportionately impacted. However, this interesting finding may be partially due to the relatively young age of NHPI individuals residing in the United States (31% of NHPI individuals are <18 years old compared to 19% of the white population). 21 Surprisingly, despite experiencing infection and death rates many times higher than whites experience, Hispanic/Latinos and Asians or Pacific Islanders were hospitalized at rates only slightly higher than whites were, with the smallest difference seen among older persons (\u226565 years). These data indicate that disparities in access to quality care may be more prevalent among Hispanic/Latinos and Asians or Pacific Islanders compared to other populations. In addition, in addition to disparities in access to care, variation in the time taken to seek medical attention may be responsible for poorer outcomes among racial/ethnic minority groups. While not examined in this study, due to limited data availability, this potentially confounding factor should be investigated in future research.\nA number of factors were also identified as being predictive of county-level COVID-19 deaths. Interestingly, an increased percentage of households with no vehicle available was predictive of all deaths regardless of race/ethnicity. This finding indicates that the use of public transportation is a potentially leading risk factor, and efforts should be taken to reduce COVID-19 transmission among people who rely on these services. An increased percentage of white, black, and Hispanic Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes was also associated with an increased number of county-level COVID-19 deaths among these respective racial/ethnic groups. Thus, these findings further corroborate existing evidence that suggests diabetes is a leading risk factor for worse COVID-19 outcomes. 22 Paradoxically, an increased percentage of Asian and Hispanic Medicare beneficiaries with COPD was predictive of fewer countylevel COVID-19 deaths. Since COPD is known to be associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes, it is possible that individuals with this condition are being extra cautious and are taking measures to avoid infection. 23 Further research in this area would be helpful to understand this finding.\nAdditionally, better social distancing scores were only predictive of fewer black and Asian county-level COVID-19 deaths and were not predictive of white or Hispanic deaths. These observed differences in the effect of social distancing may be due to the fluctuating nature of this metric based on current events. For instance, individuals in some counties may take a more proactive approach to social distancing, while individuals in other counties may only start to social distance after death counts rise due to fear. Similar to social distancing, increased unemployment rates were also predictive of fewer black, Asian, and Hispanic county-level COVID-19 deaths. Thus, unemployment rates could potentially serve as a pseudo social distancing metric since being unemployed likely reduces exposure risk. Finally, an increased percentage of persons (age \u22655 years) who speak English \"less than well\" was predictive of an increased number of Hispanic county-level COVID-19 deaths. This finding is particularly impactful since it highlights that precautionary measures in the United States are perhaps not adequately disseminated in other languages.\nThis study has several limitations. First, inconsistencies and incomplete reporting of COVID-19 race/ ethnicity data by state health departments limited our analysis. Also, the county-level COVID-19 death data from the CDC used in this study and the COVID-19associated hospitalization data from the CDC's COVID-NET used in this study did not include data from all 50 states, and therefore, may not be representative of the entire United States However, at the time of writing, more complete data sources have not been made publicly available."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Overall, this study indicates that all major racial and ethnic minority groups have been disproportionally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While older individuals are known to be at increased risk, this study demonstrates that older minority groups are also disproportionally affected. In addition, relatively low hospitalization rates among some racial and ethnic minority groups, combined with higher death rates, may indicate substantial disparities in access to care. Finally, a number of variables, such as social distancing factors, measures of social vulnerability, and medical disparities, were found to be predictive of county-level COVID-19 deaths. In light of these findings, it will be paramount that all racial/ethnic minorities are adequately represented in COVID-19 vaccine trials since response rates may vary among minority groups, limiting our ability to \"flatten the curve.\" Therefore, we recommend developing diversity programs to bolster the enrollment of diverse trial participants to more adequately represent the entire country. Finally, steps also need to be taken to increase minority access to care and access to COVID-19 related information."}, {"section_title": "Declaration of Conflicting Interests", "text": "The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, {"section_title": "Funding", "text": "The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, {"section_title": "Supplemental Material", "text": "Supplemental material for this article is available online."}]
