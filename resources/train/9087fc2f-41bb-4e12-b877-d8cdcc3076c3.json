In 2015, 14.7 million children under the age of 18 were living below the poverty line in the United States (National Center for Education Statistics, 2017 ). An estimated 21% of all children in the United States live in families where the earned income is below the federal poverty line of $23,550 for a family of four (Olszewski-Kubilius & Corwith, 2018) . aliments often prevent students from having good attendance in school; therefore, making students vulnerable to falling further behind. Children living in high poverty concentrated neighborhoods are susceptible to the most challenges such as higher dropout rates and teen births (Center for Public Policy Priorities, 2016) . In Texas, 19% of children (more than 1.3 million) live in high poverty neighborhoods (Center for Public Policy Priorities, 2016) . The lack of proper nutrition can negatively influence the ability of children to focus and function in school. When basic nutritional needs are not met, students tend to have increasingly higher levels of behavioral, emotional, and academic problems (Texas Classroom Teacher Association, 2014) . It is evident that poverty is connected to many challenges, including academic challenges for students in the United States, as well as for students in Texas.\nFamily income poverty is the strongest predictor of academic performance in school (Garrett-Peters, Mokrova, Vernon-Feagans, Willoughby, & Pan, 2016) . More specifically, children living in poverty exhibit poor cognitive and language development skills that hinder their acquisition of vital basic reading skills (Garrett-Peters et al., 2016) . It is due to this lack of basic reading skill acquisition that children below the poverty line do not achieve at adequate levels (Stinnett, 2011) . Many researchers (e.g., Conradi, Amendum, & Liebfreund, 2016; Dearing et al., 2016; McGown, 2016; Tran et al., 2017) have examined the relationship between poverty and academic performance in reading. Amid the multitude of empirical research articles in the extant literature, the influence that poverty has on a student's ability to read fluently and proficiently as measured by standardized assessments has been detailed in several studies.\nFor years, educators have recognized the importance of mastering reading by the end of third grade (Hernandez & Casey, 2011) .\nThird grade is an important grade-level because students in Texas are required to take the state assessment for the first time in this grade. To measure reading proficiency in the state of Texas, students take the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness test (STAAR). The results from the STAAR assessment are not only used to determine the proficiency level for students but to assign yearly ratings to schools and districts. Historically, school districts with high numbers of students in poverty struggle to meet standards. Therefore, researchers (e.g., McGown, 2016) have determined it essential to analyze the effects of poverty on academic performance in reading. Examined in her study were archival data from Grade 3 students in Texas who were administered the STAAR Reading assessment in the 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2014-2015 school years. Each of the three Reading Reporting Categories as well as the percentage of students meeting the Level II Final Satisfactory Performance Standard were analyzed to determine if differences existed in reading performance by student economic status.\nRegarding the STAAR Reading Reporting Categories, the Texas Education Agency provides the following definitions (a) Reading Reporting Category 1: Understanding across genres; (b) Reading Reporting Category 2: Understanding and analysis of literary texts; (c) Reading Reporting Category 3: Understanding and analysis of informational texts (2011) . As documented by McGown (2016) , statistically significant differences were present by degree of economic disadvantage for all three school years for Reading Reporting Categories 1, 2, and 3. Students who were Extremely Poor (i.e., qualified for the federal free price lunch program) scored statistically significantly lower on the Reading Reporting Categories 1, 2, and 3 than did students who were Moderately Poor (i.e., qualified for the reduced-price lunch program). Moreover, students who were Moderately Poor scored statistically significantly lower than did students who were Not Poor (i.e., did not qualify for either the federal free or reducedprice lunch program) on the Grade 3 STAAR Reading assessment. Therefore, both groups of students in poverty had statistically significantly lower average reading scores in Reporting Categories 1, 2, and 3 than students who were Not Poor. Regarding the Level II Final Satisfactory Performance Standard, students who were Extremely Poor had the lowest performance, followed by students who were in the Moderately Poor group, and then by students who were in the Not Poor group. As such, a stair-step effect (Carpenter, Ramirez, & Severn, 2006) was present in the Reading Reporting Category 1, 2, and 3 and in the Level II Final Satisfactory Performance Standard. As student degree of poverty increased, their reading performance became poorer (McGown, 2016) . Based on the findings of this study, it is evident that students in poverty perform at a disproportionately lower rate than their more advantaged peers.\nIn another recent investigation, Harris and Slate (2017) examined the achievement of Grade 3 Black students in Texas as a function of their economic status (i.e., Not Poor, Moderately Poor, and Extremely Poor) at the Phase-In I, Phase-In II, and Phase-In III level on the STAAR Reading exam for the 2015-2016 school year. The STAAR exam is measured by three categories of performance. The Phase-In I level indicates students meeting unsatisfactory academic performance who did not meet the minimum standard set for that subject area. According to the Texas Education Agency, students scoring in this category are not adequately prepared for the next grade level and are not likely to be successful without significant and ongoing instructional support (Texas Education Agency STAAR Performance Level Descriptors, 2016a). The Phase-In II level includes the students who reached satisfactory academic performance. Students at this level demonstrate performance that is at or above passing (Texas Education Agency STAAR Performance Level Descriptors, 2016a). Additionally, students in this category are sufficiently prepared for the next grade level and are highly likely to be successful (Texas Education Agency STAAR Performance Level Descriptors, 2016a). Students achieving at the Phase-In III level demonstrate performance that is considered above passing standards. As indicated in this category, students are well prepared for the next grade level and considered highly likely to be successful in that grade (Texas Education Agency STAAR Performance Level Descriptors, 2016a).\nAll three reading indicators (i.e., Phase-In I, Phase-In II, and Phase-In III) from the 2015-2016 STAAR exam were analyzed separately for Grade 3 Black students in the Harris and Slate (2017) study. Results were that the percentage of Grade 3 Black students who passed the three reading indicators decreased as their poverty level increased. In all three STAAR Reading performance standards, a clear stair-step effect (Carpenter et al., 2006) was present. As the degree of poverty increased, the percentage of Grade 3 Black students demonstrating proficient academic performance on the STAAR Reading assessment decreased. In the Harris and Slate (2017) investigation, poverty was clearly related to the reading performance of Grade 3 Black students.\nEducators have not only seen Grade 3 students underperform as a result of poverty, the impact has also been seen in early childhood. Crosnoe and Cooper (2010) conducted an investigation on the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort to determine factors that mediated the connection between children in poverty and early childhood learning. As noted by Crosnoe and Cooper (2010) , children who are economically disadvantaged enter preschool with fewer developed cognitive skills than their peers. Ultimately, these children make lower grades and fall grade levels behind (Barker & Coley, 2017) , as they move through the educational system (Crosnoe & Cooper, 2010) .\nThe economic disadvantages experienced by these students accumulated over time and they continued to lag behind their peers. As supported by the findings, the startling reality is that students who were economically disadvantaged scored on average seven points lower on reading tests than students who were not economically disadvantaged (Crosnoe & Cooper, 2010) . The associations of poverty were at least two times the magnitude of other factors identified as barriers to student success. Interpreting the results of the study, Crosnoe and Cooper (2010) contended, \"Income poverty plays a greater role in early learning than other elements\" (p. 283).\nFurther examining the effects of poverty on reading achievement, Herbers et al. (2012) investigated the importance of early academic achievement for later achievement trajectories among 18,011 students grouped by their economic status. The economic groups consisted of three groups: (a) students eligible for free meals, (b) students eligible for reduced price meals, and (c) students who were not low income.\nStandardized achievement tests were administered to all Grade 3 through Grade 7 students. Among the students in the study, 55% qualified for free meals, 4% qualifying for reduced price meals, and 31% did not qualify for either program (Herbers et al., 2012) .\nReading fluency measured in Grade 1 predicted both initial levels and growth of reading achievement from Grade 3 to Grade 8. According to Herbers et al. (2012) , the lowest levels of performance on Grade 1 reading assessments were associated with students in poverty. Moreover, students in poverty were at-risk for differences in reading achievement and growth across Grade 3 through Grade 8. Gaps in reading achievement observed at age 18 were already present as early as age 5 (Duncan et al., 2007) . According to Herbers et al. (2012) , poverty has a lasting influence on reading proficiency and early deficits in literacy establishes long-term effects on academic trajectories in Grades 3 through Grade 8."}, {"section_title": "Statement of the Problem", "text": "For many years, connections between poverty and low reading achievement have been well documented (Conradi et al., 2016; Dearing et al., 2016; Harris & Slate, 2017; Hernandez & Casey, 2011; Reardon, Valentino, & Shores, 2012; Tran et al., 2017) . Research has been conducted on Grade 3 students, first year performance on the STAAR assessment, and on students' performance in high school; however, research on Grade 4 student performance in Texas on the STAAR Reading assessment has not been conducted. Educators are charged with the task of ensuring that all students are successful and able to read on grade level. However, as documented by numerous researchers, students in poverty fail to achieve in reading, especially in state-tested grades.

Compared in numerous empirical studies are the relationship between poverty and reading performance as a function of economic status. However, few researchers have examined the relationship between degrees of economic disadvantage (i.e., Not Poor, Moderately Poor, and Very Poor) and the three reporting categories (i.e., Reporting Category 1, Reporting Category 2, and Reporting Category 3) as measured by the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness exam. The STAAR Reading assessment is administered in Grades 3-8. Therefore, in Grade 4, students have a second opportunity to demonstrate their reading proficiency on a standardized assessment. Results from this investigation may be used to add to the existing research, as limited studies have been conducted in this area. In addition, administrators, teachers, and legislators might utilize the findings of this study when making policy decisions with regarding educating students in poverty."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "In this study, the following overarching research question was addressed: What is the difference in the reading performance of Texas Grade 4 students as a function of the degree of their economic status (i.e., Not Poor, Moderately Poor, and Very Poor)?

Differences in percentages between the Not Poor and the Moderately Poor groups of students not meeting the Level II Performance Standard were 19.3%, 18.7%, and 19.7%, respectively for the three school years. Similarly, differences in percentages between the Moderately Poor and Very Poor groups of students not meeting the Level II Performance Standard were 10.1%, 9.2%, and 12.2% respectively for the three school years. Readers are referred to Table 4 for the descriptive statistics for this analysis.\nIn examining the reading performance of Grade 4 students in Texas across the three years of data that were analyzed herein, consistent trends in scores by economic status were identified. In each Reporting Category and in all three years investigated, the Not Poor group had statistically significantly higher reading scores than students in either the Moderately Poor group or in the Very Poor group. In addition, the same trends were present in all three years regarding the Level II Satisfactory Performance Standard by student economic status in that higher percentages of students in the Not Poor group met this standard than students in either the Moderately Poor group or in the Very Poor group. Similarly, a higher percentage of students in the Moderately Poor group met this reading standard than students in the Very Poor group. These trends are depicted in Figures 1 through 4 . "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Analyzed in this investigation was the extent to which differences were present in the reading performance of Texas Grade 4 students by their economic status. Three years of statewide data on the three Grade 4 STAAR Reading Reporting Categories were examined for the Not Poor, Moderately Poor, and Very Poor groups. Statistically significant results were present in all three school years. A summary of these results is presented in Table 5 . Following these statistical analyses, the Level II Final Satisfactory Performance Standard by economic status was examined and determined to yield statistically significant results in all three school years."}, {"section_title": "Connections to Existing Literature", "text": "As indicated by the review of literature, inequities in the income achievement gap have widen over the last several decades (McGown, 2016) . Vast disparities exist between students from impoverished backgrounds and students from affluent backgrounds (McGown, 2016) . In a recent Texas statewide investigation, McGown (2016) examined the reading performance of Grade 3 students on the STAAR Reading exam.\nIn her multiyear analysis, she documented the presence of statistically significant differences in all three STAAR Reading Reporting categories, as well as on the percentages of students who met the passing standard on this exam, as a function of student economic status. In her investigation, as well as in this article, a clear stair-step effect (Carpenter et al., 2006) was established in student reading performance. The greater the degree of poverty, the greater the achievement gaps were in student reading performance.\nThe connection between poverty and poor basic reading skills has also been examined (Garrett-Peters et al., 2016) . According to Tran, Luchters, and Fisher (2017) , children living in poverty are at in the most disadvantaged position in society, therefore, they fail to reach their developmental potential. In this multiyear analysis, students who were in the Very Poor group consistently had the poorest reading performance. Results from this research investigation are consistent with the literature regarding poverty and academic performance in reading.\nAs established by Conradi, Amendum, and Liebfreund (2016) children from high-poverty backgrounds read at a lower proficiency level than their peers. In addition, Jones, Ostojic, Menard, Picard, and Miller (2017) documented that poverty is the strongest predictor of learning challenges and poor academic outcomes for children. When children live in poverty, they simply fail to make parallel gains when compared to their peers in a more affluent background (Jones et al., 2017) . Garrett-Peters et al. (2016) determined that children living in poverty exhibit poor cognitive and language development skills that hinder their acquisition of vital basic reading skills. Due to their lack of basic reading skill acquisition, children below the poverty line do not achieve at adequate levels (Stinnett, 2011) ."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Policy and Practice", "text": "Based on the analysis of three years of Texas statewide data, several implications for policy and for practice can be recommended. First, additional funding needs to be made available to school districts and school campuses that have students who are economically disadvantaged. The additional funding can be used to provide educational support and resources for students in poverty. Therefore, if students have not met the passing standard on the Grade 3 STAAR Reading exam, a specific educational plan should be established to prevent them from repeating the same performance in Grade 4. Third, funding should be provided for full-day pre-Asian J. Interdicip. Res. 83-102 | 100 kindergarten programs which would assist in providing the early literacy foundation that is essential for students to develop as proficient readers.\nFourth, school districts should provide professional development that would assist teachers in educating this population of students. Additional funds and collaborative efforts among the federal, state, and local educational agencies will support these efforts and close the achievement gap between the economic groups analyzed."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Future Research", "text": "Given the results of this empirical multiyear investigation, several recommendations for future research can be made. A first recommendation would be for researchers to examine the connection between economic status and reading performance at other grade levels. In this investigation, only the reading performance of Grade 4 students was addressed. For that reason, researchers are encouraged to examine the reading performance of students in middle school and high school. Second, researchers should also examine reading achievement by gender and ethnicity/race to determine the degree to which these demographic characteristics are related to student reading performance. In this study, only the relationship between student economic status and reading achievement was addressed.\nThird, researchers should determine if differences are present in other subjects such as mathematics and writing. The focus of this study was solely on reading. Grade 4 students are also required by the state of Texas to complete the STAAR Mathematics and Writing assessments. Fourth, researchers should analyze reading performance by economic status in other states. Only data on the students in Texas were examined in this study. The extent to which the results of this study can be generalized to other states is unknown. Fifth, to analyze trends over several years, researchers are encouraged to conduct longitudinal studies that span from Kindergarten through Grade 12. A study of this magnitude will allow researchers to connect economic status with student achievement in multiple grade levels. Last, researchers are also encouraged to conduct mixed and qualitative research studies to provide meaningful data that policymakers and educators can use in making informed decisions regarding educating students in poverty."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The purpose of this research investigation was to determine the degree to which differences were present in the reading performance of Texas Grade 4 students as a function of their economic status. Through the analysis of three years of Texas statewide data, statistically significant differences were revealed in the reading performance of students who were Not Poor, Moderately Poor, and Very Poor. A stair-step effect (Carpenter et al., 2006) was clearly established in all three school years. Students who were Not Poor had better reading skills than students who were Moderately Poor, and students who were Moderately Poor had better reading skills than students who were Very Poor."}]
