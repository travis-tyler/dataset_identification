Generally speaking, these studies have found that Bt corn yields are higher for adopters than for growers of conventional varieties (table   1) . For instance, Marra el al. (1998) showed that yields were approximately 7.1 bushels per acre higher for Bt adopters in Iowa, and 18.2 bushels per acre higher for Bt adopters in Minnesota. Duffy (1999) found that Bt corn yields were approximately 13 bushels per acre higher than conventional yields. Mitchell et al. (2004) found that adoption increased yields by 2.8 to 6.6 %. Dillehay et al. (2004) found that adoption increased yields by 5.5 % in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Fernandez-Cornejo and Li (2005) found that, on average, adopters had 12.5 bushels per acre higher corn yields that nonadopters. Several studies also concluded that adopters used less insecticide than nonadopters (table 1) .\nHowever, most studies have analyzed data collected in the first 5 years of adoption (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) . As a recent report by the NRC concludes \"The environmental, economic, and social effects on adopters and nonadopters of GE crops changed over time...\" However, empirical research into the environmental and economic effects of changing market conditions and farmer practices have not kept pace.\" This paper presents the results of a study conducted to estimate the farm-level effects of adopting Bt corn. The study uses farm level data collected nationally in 2005."}, {"section_title": "The Data", "text": "The data were obtained from the 2005 nationwide Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) developed and conducted by the USDA. The ARMS survey has a multi-phase, multiframe, stratified, probability-weighted design. In other words, farmers with specific characteristics are administered different phases of the ARMS survey during and after each survey year. After data collection, NASS generates probability weights to help ensure that the ARMS sample accurately represents the population of US famers.\nThe ARMS survey has three phases. The ARMS Phase I survey is administered in the summer of the survey year. Phase I verifies that all respondents operate a farm or plant a specific crop. The ARMS Phase II survey is administered in the fall or winter of the survey year.\nThis commodity-based, field level survey collects data on production practices and input use. According to the 2005 ARMS corn survey, 76.5 percent of the farmers adopting Bt corn indicated that they did so in order to increase yields. Other adopters reported reasons for adopting Bt corn were to decrease pesticide costs (11.3 percent), to save management time (3.3 percent). Approximately ten percent of adopters reported using Bt corn for other reasons.\nSurvey results indicate that, on average, actual corn yields were 17 bushels per acre (12.3 percent) higher for adopters than for non-adopters, seed use was 0.02 bushels per acre (4.8 percent) higher for adopters than for non-adopters, insecticide use was 0.04 pounds per acre (43 percent) of active ingredients lower for adopters than for non-adopters, and variable profits were 18.84 dollars per acre (8.75 percent) higher for adopters than for non-adopters (table 2) , Differences in the unconditioned means suggest that Bt adoption may increase profits, yields, and seeding rates, while decreasing insecticide use.\nThe geographical distribution of average corn yields and Bt adoption rates are shown in Figures 1 and 2 , respectively. We also show the location of the the ERS designated Heartland Region, where the yields and Bt adoption rates appear highest (particularly in the northwestern heartland region). farm size, (iii) operator experience, (iv) use of crop insurance (which is used in many studies as a proxy for risk aversion), and (v) operator knowledge about pest infestations."}, {"section_title": "The Impact Model", "text": "The second stage of the model examines how Bt adoption affects pesticide use, yields, and variable profits. To do this in a manner consistent with farmers' optimization behavior, we use the well-developed restricted profit function (Diewert, 1974) . Using the Hotteling-Shephard lemma, the output supply and input demand functions can be derived from the profit function.\nFor the empirical model, we use a normalized quadratic restricted profit function (Diewert and Ostensoe, 1988) . Considering land as a fixed input, imposing symmetry by sharing parameters, imposing linear homogeneity by normalization (using the price of labor as the numeraire), and appending disturbance terms, the per-acre profit function ( ), the supply (yield) where P and W are output and input prices (respectively) and A, C, E, F and G are parameters (Fernandez-Cornejo, 1996) . The vector contains a measure of Bt adoption (as discussed in the next section) as well as exogenous variables to control for pest infestation levels and management characteristics.\nThe Impact Model fits the data relatively well. While it appears that there is no consensus regarding the best measure of \"goodness of fit\" for Mixed Process Models (Kramer, 2005 One possibility involves calculating the likelihood ratio for a parameterized (unrestricted) model and an unparameterized (restricted) model (Magee, 1990) . More specifically, it can be shown that:\n1 exp 2 log 1 exp 2 log log where, is the number of observations, is the log-likelihood of the fully parameterized model and represents the log-likelihood of the intercept only model. Using this measure, the Pseudo-R 2 of the model is 0.77.\nAn alternative involves directly computing the sum of squared residuals and dividing them by the sum of squared means. While identical to the formula used to calculate the traditional R 2 value, it does not have the same interpretation:\nwhere e is a nxl matrix of residuals (with n = to the number of observations in the system, and l = to the number of equations in the system), m is a nxl matrix of the difference in means ( ), and | \u2032 | represents the determinant of \u2032 . Using this measure, the Generalized R 2 of the model is 0.83.\nIn addition to the pseudo R 2 calculations, several Likelihood Ratio tests were also used to test the performance of our model (see table 5 ). These tests strongly reject the following null hypotheses:\n1) That all of the parameter estimates in the model equal 0.\n2) That all of the parameter estimates for Bt adoption equal 0.\nThese tests confirm that our model has explanatory power, and that Bt adoption is strongly correlated with measures of on-farm performance.\nMost of the results derived from the parameter estimates corroborate a priori expectations. Increases in seed prices decrease seed demand. Increases in insecticide prices decrease insecticide demand. Increases in corn prices increase per-acre supply (yields). Pest infestation is associated with decreased yields, while being located in the Heartland region and high precipitation rates are associated with increased yields (table 6) . Notably, increases in insecticide prices appear to decrease seed demand. 9 This implies that seeds and insecticides are complements in the production process.\nInsofar as the impact of Bt adoption is concerned, this study's findings suggest that Bt seed use increases profits, yields, and seed demand (tables 6 and 7). More specifically, a 10%\n9 Parameter restrictions ensure that G12 equals G21. This ensures that the effect insecticide prices have on seed demand is equivalent to the effect seed prices have on insecticide demand.\nincrease in the probability of adoption was associated with a 1.3 percent (2.89 dollars/acre) increase in profits, a 1.2 percent (1.72 bushels/acre) increase in yields, and a 0.6 percent (0.002 bushels /acre) increase in seed demand (table 8) .\nIn contrast to the findings reported in Fernandez-Cornejo and Li (2005) "}, {"section_title": "Self Selection", "text": "As discussed in a previous section, since farmers are not randomly assigned to a treatment group and a control group, adopters and nonadopters may be systematically different from one another.\nIf these differences affect both farm performance and Bt adoption, they will confound the analysis (Fernandez-Cornejo, 1996) . This is a classic case of self-selection (Greene, 1997) .\nSelf-selection is a type of endogeniety (Maddala, 1983 ; Green, 1997) . Endogeneity arises when there is a correlation between the explanatory variables and the model's residuals. If endogeniety is not accounted for (for instance, through the use of instrumental variable techniques), the results of the analysis will be biased.\nFor simplicity, consider self selection in the context of determining whether Bt adoption affects seed demand. Let the true model be,\nWhere represents seed use, 0,1 represents the farmer's decision to adopt Bt seeds, and are vectors of (exogenous) explanatory variables, represents an unobserved variable (e.g., the farmers desire to avoid risk), , , , and are vectors of parameter estimates, and and are error terms.\nRA is assumed to be unobserved. Thus, it is necessary to estimate:\nwhere the error term is = 8 , where the error term Consider Equation 7. Notice that neither , nor , equals 0 because influences both Bt adoption and seed demand (as specified in Equations 5 and 6). This correlation is the source of the self-selection problem. Regressing Equation 7 without accounting for this correlation will generate biased parameter estimates."}, {"section_title": "Controlling for Endogeneity/Self Selection", "text": "There are several methods of controlling for self-selection. The approach used in this study (sometimes called an instrumental variables approach) is to calculate predictions of (denoted by ) using the parameters estimated from equation 8 and to substitute these predictions into Equation 7. Because the variables in are exogenous, is uncorrelated with ,, and is an unbiased estimator."}, {"section_title": "Estimation", "text": "The Adoption Model was calculated using the weighted probit routine in LIMDEP. The system of profit, yield, and derived demand equations (equations 1-4) were jointly estimated using a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) framework.\nThe Impact model was estimated using the Conditional Mixed Process Module (cmp) developed for STATA by David Roodman (Roodman, 2009) . 5 The CMP module fits Seemingly Unrelated Regression Models with normally distributed error terms. Unlike many of the SUR routines available in Stata or SAS, this program enables the estimation of mixed models, allowing linear, probit, ordered probit, multinomial probit, Tobit, interval regression, and truncated-distribution regressions to be jointly estimated within the context of a seemingly unrelated system of equations. For the purposes of this analysis, the profit, yield, and seed demand equations were assumed to have uncensored, linear specifications. Because approximatley 80% of the farmers in the sample do not use insecticides, a tobit specification was 4 An alternate approach (sometimes called a generalized residuals approach) involves explicitly modeling , the endogenous component of . Assuming that the residuals from Equation 8 are normally distributed, a probit equation can be used to estimate Equation 8. The generalized residuals are obtained from the first order condition (or score function) of the probit's log likelihood function. A simple derivation demonstrates that the score function simplifies to the inverse mills ratio for the entire sample. The inverse mills ratio is strongly correlated with . Consequently, the inverse mills ratio can be used as a proxy, or an instrument. Including the inverse mills ratio (denoted ) in Equation 5 yields: 9\nSince , , , 0, is an unbiased estimator. Though this approach relies on parametric assumptions (the normality of ), provides valuable information about how farm performance is effected by unobserved variation. 5 This module is based on work by Cappellari and Jenkins (2003) , Gates (2006) , Geweke (1989) , Hajivassiliou (1998) , and Keane (1992 Keane ( ,1994 used to model insecticide demand. As in the Adoption Model, a weighted least squares technique was used to estimate the Impact Model.\nAfter estimating the Impact Model using the full sample, the standard errors were reestimated using the delete-a-group jackknife method described in Kott (1998) , and employed in other analyses of ARMS data Fernandez and Li, 2005; ).\n6 It is well known that standard errors estimated using the jackknife method are conservative, and \"may understimate the significance of variables under some circumstances . For this reason, standard errors calculated using both the standard estimation procedure and the jackknife method are reported below. The P-values used in this analysis were calculated using the jackknifed standard errors. Table 4 presents results from the Adoption Model. Generally speaking, these results corroborated a priori assumptions. For instance, previous work has established that large operations are more likely than small operations to adopt agricultural innovations (Feder et al, 1985; Fernandez-Cornejo and Li, 2005) . Previous work has also established that farmers who purchase crop insurance are more likely than their uninsured counterparts to purchase Bt seeds (Fernandez and McBride, 2002) . 7 Similarly, it is well known that the opportunity cost of pest infestations tends to be higher on irrigated operations, operations 6 NASS partitions the sample into 15 groups of observations. 15 \"replicate\" groups of observations are formed by excluding one of the 15 original groups from the full sample. NASS calculates sampling weights for the full sample, as well as each of the replicates. In order to estimate the model, parameter estimates are estimated using the full sample. To calculate the standard errors, the model is run 15 additional times (using each of the 15 subsamples and the appropriate replicate weights). The standard errors estimated from each subsample are saved and used to calculate the adjusted standard errors (see FernandezCornejo, Hendricks, and Mishra; 2005) . 7 Bt seeds and crop insurance both reduce expected losses from pest infestations."}, {"section_title": "Model Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The Adoption Decision Model", "text": "in the heartland (that tend to have highly productive soils), and other operations with high expected yields. Finally, it is not surprising that farmers expecting yield loses from corn borers are more likely to plant insect resistant seeds than those who do not expect these loses. In other words, we expected the parameter estimates on Size, Crop Insurance, Irrigation, Heartland, and\nInd_cbor to be positive and significant.\nIt should be mentioned that some of the results did not corroborate our a priori hypotheses. For instance, we expected the parameter estimates for operator experience and the price of corn to be positive. However, both of these parameter estimates were negative and significant.\nInsofar as operator experience is concerned, while we usually expect a positive association of adoption with experience, we also expect a negative association of adoption with age. In this study, adopters had an average of 33.48 years of experience, while nonadopters had an average of 37.74 years of experience (see table 2 ). This implies that many of the survey respondents are in their sixties. It is not surprising that older farmers are less likely to adopt a new technology than their \"younger\" counterparts.\nInsofar as the price of corn is concerned, our results indicate that there is a negative association between the price of corn and the use of Bt corn. This result mirrors the difference between the unconditioned means in corn prices for nonadopters ($2.01) and adopters ($1.95) (see table 2 ). The fact that farmers received higher prices for conventional corn may reflect the fact that consumers are willing to pay a premium for non-GE corn. An alternative explanation stems from the fact that corn prices exhibit a high degree of spatial correlation (this would violate the assumption that corn prices are independently distributed). In cases where there is a high degree of spatial correlation, p-values for parameter estimates may be spuriously high. In other words, there might not be a strong statistical relationship between corn prices and seed choice. Future work should further explore these possibilities."}, {"section_title": "Concluding Comments", "text": "This study estimates how adopting Bt corn affects profits, yields, seeding rates, and insecticide demand using an econometric model that corrects for self-selection and simultaneity.

Differences in the unconditioned means suggest that Bt adoption increases profits, yields, and seeding rates, while decreasing insecticide use.\nRegression analysis confirms that Bt adoption is positively associated with increased profits, yields and seeding rates. However, our results suggest that Bt adoption is not significantly related to insecticide use. This result appears to be related to the fact that insect infestation levels were lower in 2005 than they were in earlier years.\nThe implications of these results should be regarded carefully, and only within the constraints of this analysis. The economic impacts of adopting GE crops vary with pest infestations, seed premiums, and prices of alternative pest control programs. Future work should incorporate other inputs (for instance, fertilizer) and cropping practices (particularly the role of crop rotations and conservation tillage). "}]
