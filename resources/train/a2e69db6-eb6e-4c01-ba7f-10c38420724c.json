[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "As farms have become more specialized, the need for estimating type-of-farm income based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) has become crucial. The objectives of this report are to: 1. Identify the statistical problems involved in estimating farm income by type of farm. 2. Analyze the economic implications of the SIC based measures of income on farmer well-being. 3. Compare the economic accounting relationships of the type-of-farm estimates to the other farm sector accounts based on the SIC distributions, including costs of production, input-output, and productivity. 4. Identify data limitations affecting the reliability of current and future SIC estimates. 5. Outline areas of future type-of-farm research. The SIC is based on the degree of production specialization. The Standard Industrial Classifica tion was developed to promote the comparability of statistics by defining major industries based on their primary economic activity. The industrial classification permits collection, compilation, and analysis of sector industry based on a two-digit, three-digit, or a four-digit level. The four-digit level is the most detailed while the two-digit level is the most aggregated. For example, SIC 01 is the crop \"The authors are agricultural economists in the National Economics Division, Economic Research Service, U.S. Depart ment of Agriculture. production sector; SIC 02 is the livestock produc tion sector. Sector 011 is the cash grain sector. Sec tor 0111 is the wheat sector and sector 0115, the corn sector. For a farm to be classified as a particular type, it must have sales of a particular product or group of products equal to 50 percent or more of the total value of all agricultural products sold by that farm during the year. The 1978 Census of Agriculture summary included data for 14 types of farms.1 The SIC classified the following types of farms as crop farms: cash grain, cotton, tobacco, other field crop, fruit and tree nut, vegetable and melon, hor ticultural specialty, and general crop (table 1). The SIC classified the following types of farms as livestock farms: beef cattle, hog, and sheep, in cluding ranches and feedlots; dairy; poultry and egg; animal specialty; and general livestock. Cash grain farms grew wheat, rice, corn, soybeans, grain sorghum, barley, oats, buckwheat, flaxseed, rye, dry field beans, dry field peas, and other cash grains not elsewhere classified. Other field crop farms grew sugar beets, sugarcane, Irish potatoes, sweetpotatoes, peanuts, hops, mint, broomcorn, field seeds. hay, and flax (except for flaxseed). Horticultural specialty establishments primarily pro duced ornamental plants and nursery products, such as fruit stocks, vegetable seeds and plants, sad, flowers, and shrubbery. General crop farms derived 50 percent or more of their total value of sales from agricultural crops but less than 50 per cent from any particular crop group. IThe 1978 Census collected data on 36 SIC categories. Only 14 gruups were in summary cross tabulations. Twu categories, feedlots and all other beef cattle, hog, and sheep farms, have been combined in this report.

The staff is tabulating Census of Agriculture data to estimate farm income for wheat farms, corn farms, soybean farms, r.' se farms, other cash grain farms, cattle farms, cattle ranches, cattle feedlots, hog farms, and sheep farms. The more detailed SIC farm income estimates will more close ly link product and income on these farms (table 2). Analysts used two measures to describe 1978 prod uct specialization (table 3). SIC sector specialization in primary production, referred to here as the SIC sector specialization ratio, measured the percentage of total SIC commodity receipts accounted for by the corresponding SIC sector. Specialization in primary production was particularly high, so struc tural characteristics differed greatly. Crop farms ac counted for about 89 percent of crop sales, and livestock farms accounted for 94 percent of livestock and livestock product sales. Dairy farms produced about 92 percent of dairy cash receipts. Cash grain farms generated 78 percent of total grain sales, and poultry farms accounted for 98 per cent of poultry sales. Primary cash receipts, as a share of total cash receipts for the farms in each SIC sector, was the second measure of production specialization. In this report, this ratio is the SIC farm specialization ratio. For example, dairy farm income was not limited solely to cash sales of dairy products. About 18 percent of the total farm sales by dairy farms in 1978 were nondairy product sales. Thus, the dairy farm specialization was 82 percent.  1969, 1974, and 1978 Censuses of Agriculture. The $2,500 cutoff existed because the 1969 and 1974 censuses did not summarize SIC data for farms with sales of less than $2,500. More important, the definition of a farm for the 1974 Census was changed to exclude farms with sales of less than $1,000. The reporting and definitional dif ferences increased the difficulty of estimating sec tor income, especially on a per farm basis."}, {"section_title": "Number of Farms", "text": "Changes in the type-of-farm classification occurred between the 1969 and 1974 censuses.

Nongrain farms sold the remaining 22.4 percent of U.S. grain. 2SIC farm specialization in primary production means, for exam ple, that 85 percent of the total cash receipts of grain farms in 1978 was grain cash receipts. The remaining 15 percent of the cash receipts of grain farms was from nongrain agricultural commodities.

This change primarily followed the classification shift of alfalfa, field seed, hay, and timothy farms from general farms in 1969 to other field crop farms in 1974. SIC added four new farm categories in 1974: horticultural specialty farms, animal specialty farms, general crop farms, and general livestock farms. These farms were previously classified as general or miscellaneous farms. Census years 1969, 1974, and 1978 showed the following changes: the number of cotton, dairy, and poultry and egg farms decreased, and tobacco, vegetable and melon, and other field crop farms in creased (table 5). The latter change showed a shift of farms from cash grain to beef cattle, hog, Hnd sheep farms. The shift and classification of these two types of farms seemed to follow the percentage distribution of total cash receipts between crop cash receipts and livestock cash receipts (table 6). Cash grain farmers may have shifted to increased livestock production when it had become profitable. Changes in prices received by farmers also may have shifted the SIC classification of a farm even though physical production practices remained the same. The significant changes in the number of farms in these two major types of farms com plicated the estimation of income per farm by SIC because cash grain farms and beef cattle, hog, and sheep farms numbered about 66 percent of total farms in 1978 and accounted for 57 percent of total cash receipts."}, {"section_title": "Farm Sector NIPA Estimation Procedures", "text": "Two important objectives of economic accounting are the measurement of the creation of production and income and the measurement of the division of production between final consumption and invest ment. Within this framework, tracing the produc tion of economic output from its originating sector to its final disappearance as domestic consumption or export is a primary goal. If this goal is achieved, then the relationship between changes in exports or consumption patterns can be better related to changes in income of the producing sector. However, objectives of economic accounting, as conceived, are not always achievable because of data limitations. The intertwining of production and business relationships may diminish the economic data system's capacity to identify and measure economic production flows in the national economy. For example, corn can be purchased from corn farmers, ground into feed with nutrients added, and resold to livestock farmers. The difficul ty in measurement involves assessing transporta tion, labor, storage, and marketing charges; the farm value of processed feed purchased by farmers is not directly measurable.

Cash receipts, machine hire, and customwork income were directly allocated to SIC farms according to the percentage distributions derived from 1978 Census of Agriculture data (tables 7 and 8). These three items accounted for 93 percent of gross farm income for all farms in 1978, 92 percent for all crop farms, and 94 percent for all livestock farms. The remaining income items, except home con sumption and direct Government payments, were prorated, indirectly using 1979 Census Survey of Farm Finance data. Per farm 1979 averages, multiplied by the number of farms in each type-of farm category in 1978, produced a first approxima tion of 1978 income. A subsequent percentage breakdown helped to distribute 1978 USDA-pub lished income estimates (tables 7 and 8). The market value of the operators' dwellings determined distributions of the net imputed rental value of those dwellings. Farmland rental income and recreational income received by operators appeared in the 1979 Census of Farm Finance. Home con sumption, prorated to each SIC farm category on the basis of the number of operators living on their farms, appeared in the 1978 Census of Agricultme. Direct Government payments included deficiency payments, diversion payments, and conservation payments.

Directly prorated expenses amounted to 55 percent of total farm production expenses for all farms in 1978, 63 percent for all livestock farms, and 46 percent for all crop farms. Indirectly prorated items included property taxes, real estate interest, nonreal estate interest, rent depreciation, and repair and maintenance because data were not collected in the 1978 Census of Agriculture. The authors indirectly prorated property taxes based on the market value of land owned by operators reported in the 1978 Survey of Agriculture. The authors prorated real estate in terest paid, nonreal estate interest paid, and rent based on real estate and nonreal estate debt outstanding and rent-paid data reported in the 1979 Census of Farm Finance. IRS depreciation and repair data formed the basis for prorating USDA depreciation and repair expenses. Indirectly pro rated expenses amounted to 40 percent of total farm production expenses for all farms in 1978, 32 percent for all livestock farms, and 49 per'cent for all crop farms. Indirectly prorated expenses exhibited a close rela tIonship to different but parallel distribution of alternate data sources and economic accounts. The distribution of depreciation and repair expenses based on IRS data was similar to the distribution of the market value of machinery on farms based on 1978 Census of Agriculture data. For example, livestock farms accounted for about 43 percent of the value of machinery on all farms. This percen tage corresponded closely to the 43 percent of depreciation and 44 percent of repair expenses on livestock farms. The distribution of real estate in terest paid based on the 1979 Census of Farm Finance about equaled the distribution of the value of farmland owned based on 1978 Census of Agriculture data. For example, based on 1978 Cen sus of Agriculture data, livestock farms accounted for 46 percent of total land value, which closely paralleled the 47 percent of real estate interest paid by livestock farmers. The distribution of nonreal estate interest paid about matched the distribution of total expenses.

Besides a shift in farm types and changes in sector production levels, the PIK program and drought af fected the statistical reliability .of the 1983 estimates. The PIK program in 1983 probably reduced the expenses of cash grain and cotton farms more than all other types of farms. By using 1978 benchmark data to distribute 1982 and 1983 expenses for all farm types, the authors distributed the PIK-related cost reduction to all farm types. Thus, the reduction in production expenses of cash grain and cotton farms was probably slightly understated, and the reduction in production ex penses of all other farm types was overstated. Although the reliability of the 1982 and 1983 estimates may not have been as high as the 1978 benchmark estimates, the estimates helped improve understanding of economic factors which affected income and financial conditions of crop and livestock farmers. USDA will estimate type-of-farm income for Census years 1959, 1964, 1969, 1974, 1978, and 1982. SIC income will then be forecasted annually based on the historical Census benchmark data combined with current annual production and price informa tion.

Otherwise, type of farm income per farm could be misinterpreted. Measures, and therefore analysis, of SIC frrm income were greatly skewed by small farms (sales of less than $20,000), the primary occupation of the operator, farm business related income, and tax-loss farming. These charac teristics, possibly interrelated, may have affected each type of farm sector differently. To gain a feel for the impact of small farms on U.S. per farm averages, the reader should look to returns to operators per farm as estimated in table 24 for all farms, farms with sales of less than $20,000, and farm with sales of $20,000 or more. The authors estimated returns to operators on sales of $20,000 or more in 1983 by assuming that the per farm returns of all U.S. farms of this type were the same for all farms. By multiplying the per farm average by the number of farms with sales of less than $20,000 in each type of farm category, total returns of small farms can be estimated. Returns to opera tors on sales of more than $20,000 was residually estimated by subtracting the total returns of farms with less than $20,000 in sales from the returns of all farms.3 3The SIC value of sales class estimates will be improved.

First, portions of loans obtained (l'om the FCA by farm operators may actually have been for nonfarm pUI'poses. Second, commercial banks extEnded farmers' lines of credit which may bave been used for nonfarm as well as farm pur poses. Third, loans granted by merchants, dealers, and individuals may have been at concessionary rates. Fourth, many loans by agricultural lending inslilulions and secured by fnrm real estate were probably made to operators nut primarily employed in farming and to Landlords for nonfarm purposes. The FPES specifically asked for interest paid on farm real estate debt and on operating loans for the farm business. The opemtor, in l'esponding to these questions, may have accurately separated farm in terest paid from nonfarm interest paid. Returns to operators for all farms increased $14.9 billion (71 percent) in 1983 after adjustment for farm business-related income and the difference in interest paid (see table 25). The $2-billion adjust ment for wages paid by operators to themselves and their family members and the $l.4-billion adjust ment for farm interest income received was not new income. Instead, these two farm business related income adjustments shifted off-farm income to income from farm sources. The measure of total income of farm families from farm and off-farm sources was not affected. The shift of these two farm business-related income categories from off farm income to income from farm sources provided a more accurate monitor of the benefits and well being realized by farm operators from their farming activities. The capital sales adjustment for farmland and machinery sales of $5 billion and the $6.5 billion interest-paid adjustment accounted for 77 percent of the $14.9-billion total income ad justments. This represented new income that is estimated to have increased the measure of total in come of farm families from farm and off-farm sources. Income adjustments were large for cattle, hog, and sheep farms, general livestock farms, and animal specialty farms. These farms shared four common characteristics: low returns to operators, high off farm income, a high percentage of small farms with sales of less than $20,000, and a low percentage of operators reporting farming as their primary occu pation (table 28). These four characteristics ex emplify tax-loss farming."}, {"section_title": "Tax-loss Farming", "text": "Tax-loss farming may have a significant impact on the SIC measure of farm income, but the actual im pact will be difficult to evaluate (15). About 39 per cent of all farmers reported a net farm loss on their tax returns in 1973, the year of record-high farm in come, and 46 percent reported losses in 1978, a year of good farm income (table 29).

However, SIC farm income by value of sales class data combined with primary occupation data pro vided a broad overview that seemed to help separate large commercially oriented producers from small noncommercial producers. The U.S. all-farm measure of returns to operators was separated between the small farms with the sales of less than $20,000 category and the larger farms with sales or more than $20,000 category in table 24. This separation furnished a rough indica tion of the potential income distortion created by including the negative returns to operators of small noncommercial farms in the USDA all-farm income statistics. For example, by excluding the minus $4 billion in farm returns to operators of the 1.4 million small noncommercial farms, one can deter mine that the 1983 returns to operators for all farms increased 19 percent from $20.9 billion to $24.9 billion. The 1.4 million small, noncommercial farms with sales of less than $20,000 constituted 60 percent of all U.S. farms. Thus, the impact of excluding small farms on the U.S. per farm income average was great. On a per farm basis, returns to operators for all farms increased 302 percent (table 24).

However, certain definitional differences exist in defining output and sectors. For example, value of production is the standard of out put measurement in the productivity series and in the national input-output table whereas value of sales is the standard of output in the farm income series (13). Value of production is monitored in the productivity series because unsold seed, feed, and animals used on the farm where produced are important components of output and determinants of productivity. Value of production is also the standard of output in the Commerce Department's national input output table based on NIPA procedures. A four digit SIC classification scheme was followed because the primary purpose of the input-output NIPA: Estimating Farm Income by Type of Farm table was to monitor production (stated in constant dollar terms) rather than to emphasize the well being of farmers derived from all income from farm business-related sources. The SIC classification for the farm sector was based on the value of sales concept rather than the value of production concept. Adoption of the value of production concept could shift the SIC classifica tion of farms. For example, assume a farm produc ed $50,000 worth of corn and fed $20,000 of it to hogs. At the end of the year, the farmer sold the re maining $30,000 of corn and $40,000 worth of hogs. The farm in this example is classified as a livestock farm under the value of sales concept because the $40,000 value of hog sales exceeded the $30,000 value of corn sales. The farm would have been classified as a grain farm based on the value of pro duction concept because the value of $50,000 of corn production greatly exceeded the value of $20,000 in hog production ($40,000 hog sales less $20,000 fed corn). This distr.rt1:.m in classifying sec tor primary production flows was one reason why the NIPA accounts, including the national input output table and productivity series, followed the value of production concept rather than value of sales. From an economic accounting perspective, the 'SIC farm income concept would equal the commodity accounting approach underlying the input-output table, productivity, and cost of production concepts if it were not for the joiqt production of two or more commodities. Since SIC farm income includes primary and secondary production, the develop ment of cost of production estimates based on SIC data will more than challenge future researchers. Given the lack of detailed data in the SIC farm in come accounts, the first step in estimating the supply of production is disaggregrating production activities. However, the separability or nonjointness of these production activities will have to be tested. In addition, estimation of supply curves of the various types of farms will enhance the ability to understand how four-digit sector responds to price and other economic changes. The recording of the time of payment of production costs can vary between the SIC income and cost of production accounts. For example, interest and rent costs paid after the crop production year may be "}, {"section_title": "Survey2 reports", "text": "Capital stocks: Land Machinery and motor vehicles X X X X X X Livestock and crop inventories If it were not for the value of sales concept, secon dary production, and the differences in the time period (calendar year versus crop year), input output tables, productivity indicators, and costs-of production budgets could be directly developed by dividing sector primary production by the related sector expenses."}, {"section_title": "Input-Output", "text": "Prior to the development of the type of farm in come estimates, the farm sector in the national input-output table was disaggregated by commodity activities. For example, the meat animal sector in cluded. meat animals produced by SIC meat animal farms and SIC non meat animal farms. (Nonmeat animal farms produce primarily crops.) In this ex ample we assume that production of meat by meat animal and nonmeat animal farms can be separated from the production of oonmeat animal farm pro ducts. Then. we can develop a meat product-based sector composed of meat production. NIPA accoun tants refer to this methodology of accounting for production units as the product accounting approach. The product accounting approach emphasizes pro duction. In contrast to the product accounting ap proach, type of farm income (or income approach) includes the production, income, and expenses of all commodities produced on an establishment, that is, a farm where more than one production activity can take place. The appropriateness of either ac counting approach ultimately depends upon the primary purpose of the analysis. For example, financial analysis is probably more appropriate on a type of farm basis than on a product accounting basis. With increasing specialization, the difference between the two accounting approaches has become less distinctive. By incorporating the SIC type of farm income accounts into the national input-output table, the analysis of the economic impacts between nonfarm employment and income and farm income is en hanced. In addition, (he SIC type of farm income accounts based on SIC codes encourage uniformity and comparability of data within the input-output table as well as between the input-output table and other farm economic accounts such as the balance sheet. For these reasons, efforts are underway to in corporate the type of farm income accounts into the national input-output table. Income from farm sources in the USDA farm in come accounts consists of returns to operators, the imputed net rental value of operator dwellings, and net farmland rent received by operator landlords. The imputed rental value of dwellings for input output analysis is classified as farm sector or real estate sector value added depending upon the kind of owner of the farm. If the farm owner is a farm operator, the imputed rental value of the dwelling is accounted for as farm sector value added. The imputed net rental value of dwellings for operator landlords and nonoperator landlords is accounted for as real estate sector income."}, {"section_title": "Productivity", "text": "Productivity is measured based on the concept that the farm sector is one large farm.

Although conducted only once every 5 years, Census Surveys were extremely detailed in sales of crop and livestock commodities, most operating expenses, farm-related income, and operator characteristics. Statistically reliable disag gregations of SIC farm income data by value of sates class, age, primary occupation, business and organization, and for farmers with debt and without debt can be outained through the use of Census, IRS, and other primary and secondary data. Historical SIC data from the Census of Agriculture can provide depth to SIC-based income analyses as well as for the statistical evaluation of the estimates themselves. Estimates of farm income by type of farm relied heavily on Census of Agriculture data. The Census of Agriculture provided the opportunity to publish type-of-farm data in detail. However, increasing costs and reduced budgets affected the available published data. For example, the 1978 Census of Agriculture did not include the Volume II series, which in previous Censuses furnished additional detailed type-of-farm data by value of sales class. Additional funding would allow publication of more detail such as type-of-farm data on corn, soy bean, wheat, and rice farms, and would enhance analysis. Before the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was deveLtJed, large data files, such as the Census of Agficulture, could not be fully exploited to estimate the farm sector economic accounts. The analysis of SIC income, production, ?nd expenses can now be improved and expanded by establishing two types of Census of Agriculture dala files using SPSS for (1) primary farm sectors, such as corn, wheat, and soybean farms, and (2) primary commodities, such as all farms producing cotton. For example, using SPSS to analyze 1979 Census of Farm Finance data, Peterson found that financial characteristics of dairy farms varied substantially by size and age (11). However, finan cial characteristics of dairy farms varied little among regions, after controlling for age and size. This type of effort with SPSS has greatly expanded the usefulness of the Census of Agriculture for farm income, production, and financial analysis. Several estimates in this analysis were based on the 1979 Census of Farm Finance, which was con ducted as an integral part of the 1978 Census of Agriculture. Budget and legal restrictions prevented a repeat of the Farm Finance Survey for the 1982 Census of Agriculture, which reduced the statistical reliability of future SIC farm income estimates.

Monetary and fiscal policy more directly to farm income. 4. The farm sector economic accounts more directly by producing different but parallel measures of costs of production, production efficiency, and input-output. 5. The farm sector data system in support of the farm sector accounts. The ability of the SIC income distributions to im prove traditional farm income policy analysis was readily proven by the analysis of the PIK and dairy deductions program. The SIC distributions revealed that the PIK-induced reduction of production ex penses was important in increasing farm income. \u2022 Schluter and Lee constructed this model using weights from the 1967 input-output table for 16 farm sectors, The farm sector definitions in the input-output table were primarily product oriented, similar to the costs-of-production accounts which ex cluded secondary production. In contrast to the input-output table methodology, the SIC type of farm prices paid and re ceived ratios included secondary and primary production. The SIC income distributions directly measure the full macroeconomic impact for cost reductions as well as from price enhancement portions of market place economic decisions and Government farm policy. The full impact of cost reductions and in come enhancements are measured not only for the primary SIC production sector of the particular agricultural commodity such as cash grains, but also for those other farm secturs indirectly affected such as cattle, hog, dairy, and poultry and egg farms. Farm analysts have long been aware of these intersectoral impacts but have not been able to monitor ;~dm directly in the absence of the SIC in come distributions. For example, the SIC income distributions also revealed that the drought and PIK program had a negative impact on livestock income by increasing feed costs. SIC income distributions enhance the analysis of the impact of general macroeconomic policy in cluding monetary, fiscal, and tax policy on farm in come. In recent years, general economic policy has heen targeted at reducing the rate of inflation, in creasing after-tax income by reducing tax rates, and encouraging investment through more favorable depreciation and investment credit allowances. Each of these general economic policies would be difficult to monitor and evaluate within the costs-of production conceptual framewl.:k. Each of these general economic policies impact differently on each farm type. Development of SPSS to analyze Census of Agricul ture data and the SIC income distributions expands the usefulness of the primary economic and socid data source comprising the farm data system (the Census of Agriculture) with minimal costs. The statistical reliability of Census data are unparalleled in estimating and distributing the farm sector accounts. Future research efforts need to be devoted to ex panding the SIC estimates, improving the statistical base upon which the distributions are based, and examining the relationship of SIC income to tax loss farming and farm business-related income. The development of a prices paid to prices received ratio for each farm type will provide an up-to-date monitor of income conditions within each SIC farm sector. Farm income, production, investment, and financial analysis are greatly improved by the SIC distributions, which introduce an integrated macroeconomic approach to farm sector economic accounting and the policy analysis based on the accounts.
