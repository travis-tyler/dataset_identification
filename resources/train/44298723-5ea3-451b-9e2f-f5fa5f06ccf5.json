[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "A global pandemic emerged in December 2019 from a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).1 Phylogenetics of this virus indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus, has 79.5% homology with SARS-CoV, and is closely related to bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses.2 A recent large case series of 72 314 infected individuals in China showed an estimated 14% with severe disease and a case-fatality rate of 2.3%.3,4\nThe coronaviruses are a common source of upper respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system infections in humans and other mammals.5 SARS-CoV-2 is highly homologous to SARS-CoV, and similar to SARS-CoV, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is also the cellular entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2.6,7,8 Since ACE2 is found in the absorptive enterocytes of the ileum and colon, these absorptive enterocytes can be infected by a host of viruses, including coronavirus, rotavirus, and noroviruses, thereby resulting in diarrhea.7,9 A few bioinformatics studies10,11 found that ACE2-expressing intestinal epithelium cells might be at increased risk of attack by SARS-CoV-2 and that ACE2 was highly expressed in the small intestine, especially in proximal and distal enterocytes. Hence, the digestive system can be invaded by SARS-CoV-2 and serve as a route of infection.\nIn fact, the first reported patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the US reported gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms of loose bowel movements and abdominal discomfort.12 The patient\u2019s stool and respiratory specimens were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).12 This raises the question of inadvertent human-to-human transmission via the fecal route despite public health emphasis on droplet transmission and precautions for contact with respiratory secretions. Hence, additional information and understanding the involvement of the digestive system in transmission of COVID-19 during this pandemic would be useful.\nOur objective was to determine the prevalence of GI symptoms at presentation of COVID-19 and viral shedding in stool of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection based on published literature. We have also included data from preprint publications as a separate category to provide a concise review of the existing knowledge as this global emergency unfolds."}, {"section_title": "Search Strategy ::: Methods", "text": "We performed a literature search combining Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keyword searches using MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase to find studies published from November 1, 2019, to March 30, 2020, using the terms \u201cCOVID-19,\u201d \u201cSARS-Cov-2,\u201d and/or \u201cnovel coronavirus.\u201d We also queried the newly developed artificial intelligence\u2013enabled search engine, CORD-19 (Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence), which has partnered with leading research groups to prepare and distribute the COVID-19 Open Research Data set, a free resource of more than 29 000 scholarly articles, and also archival services, such as bioRxiv and medRxiv.14,15 A secondary search through references of published studies was also performed. The reference lists of all studies were reviewed for additional sources of data. Duplicate citations were removed, and all remaining studies were screened for eligibility by review of their titles and abstracts.

Studies in abstract form only were excluded owing to limited available information satisfying eligibility for analysis of our outcomes of interest.

Quality of included studies was assessed using a validated quality grading instrument, methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS).16 The following criteria were evaluated and a score of 0 (not present), 1 (reported but inadequate), or 2 (reported and adequate) was provided for each: clearly stated aim, inclusion of consecutive patients, prospective collection of data, end points appropriate to the aim of the study, unbiased assessment of the study end point, follow-up period appropriate to the aim of the study, loss to follow-up less than 5%, and prospective calculation of the study size."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis ::: Methods", "text": "The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the rates of GI symptoms (ie, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting) reported among patients with COVID-19. This was calculated as the pooled prevalence rate of these GI symptoms individually. Studies that did not report GI symptoms were excluded from this analysis. Secondary objectives included calculating the pooled estimate rates for GI symptoms and rates of virus shedding in stool of patients with COVID-19 among published and archived studies (ie, preprint studies) as derived from COVID-19 Semantic Scholar.12,17 Statistical analysis was performed using R statistical software (R Project for Statistical Analysis). The extent of heterogeneity across studies was assessed using Q statistics and I2 index. For the I2 statistic, heterogeneity was defined as low (25%-50%), moderate (50%-75%), or high (>75%). Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots, and asymmetry of the funnel was evaluated with Egger regression test. P values were 2-sided, and P < .05 was considered statistically significant.

Most of these studies were single-arm observational studies with retrospective reporting of data from hospitalized patients, and most studies were reported from mainland China. The primary method of data collection was extraction of information from electronic medical records of hospitalized patients. Most studies collected data on adults, 1 study collected data on pregnant patients,18 and 3 studies included data on children younger than 18 years.19,35,36 One study reported information on health care personnel.17\nOverall, the studies included 4805 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.2 [14.8] years; 1598 [33.2%] women).

Pooled detection of patients with fecal samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA for patients who were confirmed by nasopharyngeal swab testing or respiratory secretion analysis for PCR to have COVID-19 was 40.5% (95% CI:27.4%-55.1%) of patients (Figure 4),10,17,20,21,41,42,43,44 including 154 patients with fecal samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 of 407 patients from 8 studies (I2 = 83%; Egger test for bias, P = .86). Characteristics of these studies are presented in eTable 2 in the Supplement.\nIn the study by Wang et al,41 among a total of 153 fecal samples collected, 44 samples (28.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with 126 positive results of 398 pharyngeal swabs (31.7%), which is one of the most prevalent mechanisms of testing. The rates of positivity using other specimens were 14 of 15 tests using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (93.3%), 72 of 104 tests using sputum (69.2%), 5 of 8 tests using nasal swabs (62.5%), 6 of 13; tests using fiberoptic bronchoscope brush biopsy (46.2%), and 3 of 307 tests using blood (1.0%). Of 72 urine specimens tested, 0 were positive for SARS-CoV-2.41 Two stool samples (1.3%) showed live virus on electron microscopy. Xiao et al20 reported that, of 73 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 39 patients (53.4%), including 25 men and 14 women, had results positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens. Moreover, Xiao et al20 found that 17 patients (23.3%) had PCR of stool results positive for SARS-CoV-2 despite having respiratory samples with PCR results negative for SARS-CoV-2.\nIn a study by Young et al,42 in 4 of 8 patients had RT-PCR results positive for SARS-CoV-2 in stool, regardless of diarrhea, for 1 to 7 days. Peng et al43 found that anal swabs from 2 of 9 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a single-patient case study45 comparing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in throat vs rectum samples, the rectal samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 for up to 18 days after hospitalization. A study by Ling et al21 included 66 patients who recovered after treatment for COVID-19, among whom 11 patients (16.7%) still had stool test results positive for viral RNA after a median duration of 11 days after symptom onset. In another study including 17 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with available data (representing 0-13 days after onset), stool samples from 9 patients (52.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR analysis for 0 to 11 days after disease onset.7 The viral loads in stool samples were lower than those of respiratory samples (range, 550 copies per mL to 1.21 \u00d7 105 copies per mL vs 641 copies per mL to 1.34 \u00d7 1011 copies per mL).7"}, {"section_title": "Elevated Liver Enzymes ::: Results", "text": "Of 23 studies included in the final analysis, 8 studies reported data on elevation of either AST or ALT levels at the time of patients\u2019 clinical presentation.

First, most available studies were from China and were large case series or observational studies, which are subject to methodological biases; however, observational studies are currently the only ethical study type to measure presence of GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, the quality of clinical assessment, individual patient record\u2013screening vs hospital database, was not clear in the studies included. Second, sample size calculation and prospective study of GI symptoms during the natural history of the infection and implications were not the primary aims of the studies included in our analysis, thereby limiting deeper interpretation of pooled summary estimates. Third, multiple large series of patients have not reported significant numbers of patients with GI symptoms. However, it is not entirely clear whether minor GI symptoms were underreported in patients presenting later with severe multisystem organ failure, including severe pneumonia, or that these patients actually did not have significant GI symptoms. Similarly, minor changes in liver enzyme levels during the disease trajectory may have been underreported, and studies focusing on enzyme levels could not be incorporated owing to focus of our review. This may affect the precise population mean of reported estimates, but it is difficult to arrive at such conclusions without having had true prospective, longitudinal studies of robust power with adequate follow-up. Moreover, significant heterogeneity is noted for our results. This is likely explained by clinical and methodological heterogeneity resulting from most studies being low-power case series or retrospective in nature with varied reporting of symptoms and labs. It is also due to the fact that high heterogeneity is probable representation of population distribution of the summary estimate. Although we used a random-effects model, there was still some influence on the final results. In the setting of an emerging pandemic, although most data were from 1 region of the world, early reporting of this information could still be very helpful to guide management of COVID-19."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Our findings suggest that the intestinal tropism of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to previous SARS infections and that GI symptoms are a frequent manifestation of this emerging infection. It has to be noted that although GI symptoms are frequent, fever, cough, and respiratory symptoms are still the predominant type of presentation based on data from studies from China. In addition to the call for increasing awareness for this atypical presentation, these findings regarding virus shedding in feces imply that SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by the fecal-oral route and support consideration of stool RT-PCR testing to aid in transmission-based precautions among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, particularly concerning is the presence of detectable RNA in the GI tract, making the use of optimal personal protective equipment and following up-to-date national infection control guidelines highly prudent."}]
