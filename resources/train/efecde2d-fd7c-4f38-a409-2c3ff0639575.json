This cross-sectional study evaluated private well water quality in Maryland, and explored possible environmental sources that could impact water quality. Well water samples (n = 118) were collected in four Maryland counties and were analyzed for microbiological and chemical contaminants. Data from the U.S. Census of Agriculture were used to evaluate associations between the presence of animal feeding operations and well water quality at the zip code level using logistic regression. Overall, 43.2% of tested wells did not meet at least one federal health-based drinking water standard. Total coliforms, fecal coliforms, enterococci, and Escherichia coli were detected in 25.4%, 15.3%, 5.1%, and 3.4% of tested wells, respectively. Approximately 26%, 3.4%, and <1% of wells did not meet standards for pH, nitrate-N, and total dissolved solids, respectively. There were no statistically significant associations between the presence of cattle, dairy, broiler, turkey, or aquaculture operations and the detection of fecal indicator bacteria in tested wells. In conclusion, nearly half of tested wells did not meet federal health-based drinking water standards, and additional research is needed to evaluate factors that impact well water quality.

The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) was originally passed by Congress in 1974 to protect public health by regulating the nation's public drinking water supply and its sources, including rivers, lakes, reservoirs, springs, and groundwater wells [3] . However, private wells that serve less than 25 people or have less than 15 service connections are neither regulated by the SDWA nor monitored by local regulatory agencies for contaminants that may be associated with adverse human health outcomes [3] . Clinic participants (n = 150) were recruited at county health fairs, farmers' markets, and through promotional material on community email listservs and local newspapers. Participants were limited to homeowners in the aforementioned counties with private wells who were interested in participating in the clinics. The safe drinking water clinics were a multi-stage process ( Figure 2 ) that began with a kick-off meeting where registered participants were told of the purpose and significance of the project, provided with water sampling instructions and kits (gloves, two 1 L sterile, polypropylene, wide-mouth Nalgene environmental sampling bottles (Nalgene, Lima, OH, USA) and a large Ziploc bag), and taught how to sample their well water from kitchen or bathroom faucets in accordance with standard protocols. A paper-based survey that was developed by our research and extension teams, and approved by the University of Maryland College Park Institutional Review Board, was also given to participants at the kick-off meetings.

In zip codes that contained cattle operations, the contamination of wells by total coliform bacteria was 1.23 times greater than in zip codes that did not contain cattle operations; however, this finding was not statistically significant (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.23; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.89, 1.68). In zip codes that contained dairy and aquaculture operations, the contamination of wells by total coliform bacteria was more likely than in zip codes that did not contain one of these operations (dairy operations: OR = 1.12; 95% CI = 0.96, 1.31; aquaculture operations: OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 0.59, 2.93).

The presence of broiler, hog, and turkey operations in zip codes was slightly protective for total coliform bacteria, and the presence of hog operations in zip codes was slightly protective for fecal coliform bacteria (Table 3) . However, these findings were not significant for any type of operation with either indicator bacterium."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our data demonstrate that a majority of private wells included in this study are contaminated with fecal indicator bacteria and/or chemical contaminants at levels that exceed the SDWA drinking water quality guidelines set forth by the U.S. EPA. These findings are consistent with previous studies of private water wells that have been conducted in other states. A recent study of private wells in Pennsylvania found that 41% of wells failed to meet at least one drinking water standard [10] , comparable with the 43% of wells that failed to meet one or more standards in our study. Similarly, in Wisconsin, an analysis of private water wells in rural areas found that 47% of these wells exceeded one or more health-based water quality standards [12] . Total coliform bacteria was also the most common microbiological contaminant in the Pennsylvania study and was detected in 33% of wells [10] , comparable with the 25% of tested wells contaminated with total coliforms in our study. A recent study of private wells in Virginia found that 46% tested positive for total coliform bacteria, with 10% testing positive for E. coli [11] . Meanwhile, a North Carolina study of private wells found that 49% tested positive for total coliform bacteria and 6.4% tested positive for E. coli [14] . Previous studies have also indicated that seasonality may play a role in well water quality. [12, 39] . In our study, the county with the highest percentage of wells that tested positive for fecal indicator bacteria was Kent County, which was sampled in the Fall (Table 1) . However, because our study was cross-sectional, we did not collect samples over multiple seasons and, therefore, we cannot evaluate whether seasonal trends influenced our results. Nevertheless, our study adds to the growing body of research nationwide on the water quality of private wells that illustrates the need for improved monitoring of these wells.\nMonitoring of fecal indicator bacteria in private well water is important for assessing the potential health risks associated with these water sources. To improve understanding of environmental factors that may impact private well water quality, we also investigated whether proximity to animal feeding operations was associated with microbial contamination of wells. Our data showed that there were no statistically significant associations between the presence of an animal feeding operation within a zip code and microbial contamination of private wells within the same zip code; however, this may be due to the small number of well water samples obtained during this initial study. Given that exposure to well water has been shown as an important risk factor for gastrointestinal illnesses [40] [41] [42] , such as campylobacteriosis, exploration of this potential association deserves further study involving a larger number of private wells.\nIn a case-control study conducted in Sweden, Carrique-Mas et al. (2005) demonstrated that living in a household with a private well was a risk factor for Campylobacter infection (OR = 2.6; 95% CI = 0.9-7.4), although that association was not statistically significant [40] . Another case-control study conducted in Norway also found that the risk of campylobacteriosis was higher for those who obtained their water from a private household well compared with those receiving water from a public system (OR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.2, 3.2) [41] . Consumption of water from a private well was also identified as a significant risk factor for sporadic campylobacteriosis (OR = 1.92; 95% CI = 1.46, 2.53) in a second Norwegian study by MacDonald et al. [42] . The potential for private wells to influence gastrointestinal illnesses such as campylobacteriosis (that are traditionally thought to be foodborne) remains understudied in the United States and deserves further attention.\nOne major challenge of improving private well water quality and reducing the risk of adverse health outcomes associated with this water source is that the numbers and locations of U.S. private wells are poorly characterized. Neither individual counties nor states have a complete database with addresses and other contact information for private well homeowners. As such, regular communications to homeowners reminding them to test their wells annually and delivering interventions where necessary is challenging. While the U.S. Geological Survey developed a nationwide inventory on the private well population [2] , it was created using data on the population served by public water supply systems by county in each state and lacks the specific geographic locations of private wells. Creating a nationwide database of private well owners that is regularly updated by states could allow for improved evaluation of the factors that may influence well contamination, enhanced communication with well owners, and potential improvements in levels of waterborne illness.\nIn this study, we demonstrated the presence of fecal indicator bacteria in private drinking water wells in Maryland. As the presence of these indicator bacteria suggests a potential human health risk, well owners are often left to mitigate these risks through system repair, enhancement, or decontamination. However, knowledge of the contamination source of the well would be helpful in selecting an appropriate remediation method. Microbial source tracking (MST) is a collection of methods used to determine the likely source of contamination associated with the presence of fecal indicator bacteria [43] . MST has been previously used in a variety of applications, including in the management of surface water contamination and watershed remediation [43, 44] . Allevi et al. (2013) utilized MST techniques to characterize the magnitude and incidence of microbial contamination in private wells in Virginia, and to identify the likely sources of this contamination [45] . Similarly, Krolik et al. (2014 Krolik et al. ( , 2016 analyzed well water samples from southeastern Ontario using MST to elucidate whether human or bovine sources were responsible for well contamination [46, 47] . Future work relating to our study could include the application of MST methods to help identify the source of microbial contamination in Maryland wells, and to elucidate potential relationships between microbial contamination and environmental characteristics, particularly those relating to land use.\nGiven the small, cross-sectional nature of our study, there are several limitations to be considered. Our sample size of 118 households was relatively small, representing only a small fraction of the estimated 1,070,000 people who rely on private wells in Maryland [2] . Another limitation is the possibility that study participants may have improperly collected the water sample in their homes, which could then influence our ability to accurately determine their water quality parameters. We sought to minimize this potential problem by training participants on water sampling techniques during the safe drinking water clinic kickoff meetings, and by providing instruction sheets (along with the water sampling kits) on how participants should collect their water samples. Another limitation of this study is the use of U.S. Census of Agriculture data from 2007 with results from well water samples that were collected between 2013 and 2014. As noted above, the Census of Agriculture data were only available at the zip code level for the 2007 Census, and not for subsequent years. However, it is unlikely that the number of animal feeding operations in Maryland changed significantly between 2007 and 2013.\nDespite these limitations, this is the first study to assess the water quality of private wells across multiple counties in Maryland, and to investigate the influence of animal feeding operations on well water quality, thereby addressing an important research gap in the state. This study also demonstrated the value in partnerships between land grant university research faculty and county-based extension faculty. Finally, the study highlighted the need for more educational outreach to private well owners in Maryland in order to improve private drinking water quality in the state. Additional studies are needed to identify and confirm potential factors that can influence private well water quality in Maryland, such as animal feeding operations, septic tanks, well construction characteristics, soil geology, and climatic conditions."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Our findings suggest that there are a significant number of private domestic wells in Maryland that do not meet the guidelines for well water quality set forth by the SDWA. This finding is similar to studies conducted in other states, including the nearby states of Virginia and Pennsylvania. In addition, while other studies have reported associations between proximity to animal feeding operations and microbial contamination of private wells, this association was not observed in this cross-sectional study and may have been influenced by our limited sample size. Further studies are needed to identify and confirm possible sources of contamination of private wells in Maryland. The lack of regular monitoring of private wells makes periodic assessments at national, regional, and local scales important sources of information about this key source of drinking water throughout the United States. The presence of microbial contaminants at levels greater than human health-based standards in 43 .2% of private wells tested in this study highlights the importance of education and routine monitoring regarding the water quality of domestic wells to protect public health."}]
