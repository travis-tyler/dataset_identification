[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "To improve our understanding of nutrient dynamics at the catchment scale, recent studies have developed catchment nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) budgets that account for inputs and outputs of these nutrients (Baker and Richards 2002;Boyer et al. 2002;David and Gentry 2000;Goolsby et al. 1999). These previous studies illuminate sources and fates of N and P in catchments across the U.S., and permit inferences about the transport and processing of nutrients within catchments. A general Wnding is that much of the N and P inputs are unaccounted for, indicating storage of these nutrients or the presence of additional output Xuxes not considered in the budget. One potential mechanism for this observed storage and loss is removal of N and P in impoundments; however, no budgeting studies to date have explored catchment-scale eVects of impoundments on river export of nutrients. Research demonstrating the capacity of impoundments to remove N and P is mounting. Stanley and Doyle (2002) discussed the potential beneWts of impoundments in removing nutrients from river systems, and argued that P settling and N denitriWcation were the primary mechanisms. Hillbricht-Ilkowska (1999) claimed that impoundments were \"disturbing inserts\" in the framework of the river continuum concept, providing places for N and P removal. Their comparison of 17 impoundments and 10 stream reaches in Eastern Europe documented NO 3 production in stream reaches and NO 3 removal in impoundments. In a large reservoir and its upstream reach in agricultural Illinois, Wall et al. (2005) found high NO 3 loss rates due to denitriWcation within an impoundment. In their study of 35 large rivers around the world, Caraco and Cole (1999) found a close relationship between N inputs and river export for most rivers. Three of the rivers had 3fold lower river N exports than predicted by the model, which was attributed to the presence of large reservoirs with long residence times. Suspended sediment particles with their associated P have been shown to quickly settle from the water as velocity decreases during the transition from a lotic to lentic system (Kufel 1993). P stored in the sediments of an impoundment remains in place unless internal P loading (due to desorption of sediment P or decomposition of organic matter) exceeds P sedimentation (Hillbricht-Ilkowska 1999), or the dam that created the impoundment is removed, causing sediments to be mobilized (Hart et al. 2002). Vorosmarty et al. (2003) estimated that impoundments trapped more than 50% of sediment Xux in regulated rivers around the world, further conWrming the important role of impoundments in reducing P loads through settling of P adsorbed to sediments. The present study compares two catchments in southeastern Michigan, the Huron and Raisin, which diVer in land use and extent of impoundments, to investigate nutrient processing and transport at the catchment scale. To determine the inXuence of impoundments on river export of nutrients, we compared N and P budgets for the Huron and Raisin. To assess the generality of our results, we constructed comparable budgets from results of prior studies using the approach of the present study. We found that catchments with more impoundments export fewer nutrients, that catchment inputs generally were highly correlated to river export, and that the catchments retained P more eVectively than N."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study area", "text": "The Huron (2,377 km 2 ) and Raisin (2,737 km 2 ) are catchments of mixed land use in southeastern Michigan that drain into the western end of Lake Erie (Fig. 1). They are characterized by hilly to moderately undulating topography in their upper catchments, underlain with moraines, till deposits, and outwash plains. The lower portions of the Huron and Raisin are underlain by sands and clays from glacial Lake Erie (Knutilla and Allen 1975). These two adjacent catchments fall within 3 ecoregions, the Southern Michigan/Northern Indiana Till Plains, the Huron/ Erie Lake Plain, and the Eastern Corn Belt Plains (Omernik 1987). Land use in the two catchments is similar with both being largely agricultural (Table 1), but the Huron has less agriculture and more forest and urban land area compared to the Raisin. Precipitation is slightly higher in the Huron catchment, but river water yields are lower. This likely is due to more evapotranspiration in forested areas and evaporation from impoundments in the Huron catchment. Both catchments originate in \"lake district\" areas, but their middle and lower sections diVer notably in degree of river impoundment. The Huron catchment has a total of 88 impoundments that have surface areas of at least 10 ha, while the Raisin has only 14 impoundments of this size. These river impoundments are both artiWcial (created by dams) and natural (lakes), and most are controlled through dam operations or lake level control structures. This discrepancy in number of impoundments leads to a large diVerence in water residence times for the mainstem channel of each river network. Huron and Raisin nutrient budgets N and P budgets were developed for each catchment following methods described in Boyer et al. (2002) for N and Baker and Richards (2002) for P, with slight modiWcations described below. Catchment N budgets included inputs (atmospheric deposition, fertilizer application, N Wxation in agricultural and natural lands), system storage (the N stock or pool stored in the catchment), and outputs (NH x volatilization, export of food and feed, and river export) ( Fig. 2). Boyer et al.'s (2002) methodology was modiWed by the inclusion of NH x volatilization as an output rather than combining it in net atmospheric deposition, and also by the inclusion of food and feed as an export rather than an input due to lower consumption needs and higher crop production in the Huron and Raisin compared to northeastern U.S. catchments studied by Boyer et al. (2002). Note that denitriWcation was not included in the budget, but its potential inclusion is discussed later. P budgets included inputs (atmospheric deposition, fertilizer and manure application, point source river discharge, and sludge application to agricultural lands), system storage (the P stock or pool stored in the catchment), and two outputs (crop export and river export) ( Fig. 3). Nutrient budgets diVer not only in input and output terms, but also in how the system or accounting unit is deWned. In P budgets we included the soils and water inside the deWned catchment. This is a modiWcation from Baker and Richards (2002), who included only the soils compartment as the deWned system. The system boundary in the N budgeting approach is deWned "}, {"section_title": "Watershed", "text": "Nitrogen outputs more broadly. Within the deWned catchment, the system included water and soil, the air above the land and water surface, as well as everything living in the water, soil, and air. This is an important distinction because the diVerence in system boundaries dictates inclusion of certain inputs and outputs. In the P budget, for example, manure application was a new input of P into the system, whereas in the N budget, manure application was considered internal cycling and thus not included in input or output calculations. A more detailed description of budgeting methodology can be found in Bosch (2007)."}, {"section_title": "Atmospheric deposition and NH x volatilization", "text": "Atmospheric deposition included both inorganic and organic deposition. Data for wet inorganic N deposition in the forms of nitrate (NO 3 \u00a1 ) and ammonium (NH 4 + ) were obtained from the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP 2006), which has an active sampling site in Ann Arbor, Michigan, centrally located to both catchments. Dry inorganic N deposition data were available for the same sampling site from the EPA Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET 2006), and included Xuxes of nitric acid (HNO 3 ), NO 3 \u00a1 , and NH 4 + . Atmospheric organic nitrogen (AON) deposition has been shown to consistently make up 30% of total N deposition (NeV et al. 2002). Following Boyer et al. (2002), we assumed that only half of this deposited AON is from outside of the catchment, so AON was estimated as 15% of total N deposition. NH x volatilization represents a loss of N to the atmosphere and out of the system. This N emission is produced by livestock operations and fertilizer application. Livestock population statistics (NASS 2006) for dairy cows, beef cattle, young cattle, pigs and hogs, sheep and lambs, horses and ponies, layer chickens, broiler chickens, and turkeys in the 2 catchments were combined with literature NH x emission rates (Battye et al. 1994as reported in Boyer et al. 2002 to calculate volatilization from animal waste. Volatilization losses from fertilizers were calculated as a percentage of application in each catchment-15% for urea, 0.1% for anhydrous ammonia, and 2% for other combined fertilizers (Battye et al. 1994as reported in Boyer et al. 2002. Only atmospheric deposition of P in wet deposition from rainfall was considered in the P budgets.

Human waste with associated P enters municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and either becomes sludge or is directly discharged into receiving waters. In the WWTPs of the Huron and Raisin catchments, about 95% of incoming P is incorporated into sludge (J. Johnson, personal communication) and the other 5% is a point source discharge into rivers. Most WWTPs in southeastern Michigan apply this sludge to agricultural Welds, and the remainder incinerate their sludge and deposit the ashes in landWlls. EZuent P loads were obtained for all active point source dischargers (most of which are WWTPs) in each catchment from the EPA Permit Compliance System database. These point P discharge sources were summed for both catchment budget areas.

A human N consumption rate of 4.53 kg N person \u00a11 y \u00a11 (David and Gentry 2000) along with 2004 and 2005 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau were used to estimate human N consumption. Animal-speciWc N consumption rates from several sources (Luginbuhl et al. 1998;Ritchie 1994;UMES 1995; Van Horn 1998) were combined with livestock population statistics (NASS 2006) to estimate animal N consumption. Crop N production was estimated identically to crop P production, using crop product N content (Kellogg et al. 2000) and the same crop yield statistics. Animal production was based on the diVerence between animal consumption and animal excretion as in Boyer et al. (2002). Animal N excretion rates were calculated in the same way as manure P applications, but using manure N production rates (OSU 2006)."}, {"section_title": "River export", "text": "Annual river export loads for 2004 and 2005 were estimated for each catchment based on N and P concentrations from direct water sampling and stream discharge data ( Fig. 4). Daily river export concentrations of N and P are available at the Monroe sampling site on the Raisin (Fig. 1)  Annual river export loads were estimated for the Raisin River at Monroe and the Huron River at French Landing Dam using AutoBeale, which is an implementation of the Beale Ratio Estimator (Richards 1998). This estimation procedure Wrst computes an average daily load based on dates with concentration data and then adjusts this average daily load according to the proportion of the annual Xow included within the subset of dates with corresponding concentration data. This adjusted average daily load is then multiplied by 365 to obtain an annual load estimate. Use of AutoBeale allowed breaking of the year into several time intervals, each with their own average daily load, to account for seasonal and Xow diVerences throughout the year. Nutrient concentrations were determined using standard automated colorimetric procedures on a Technicon Auto Analyzer II as detailed by Davis and Simmons (1979). Ammonia (NH 4 ) was determined by the phenate method based on the indophenol blue reduction. Nitrate/nitrite (NO 3 ) was determined by the cadmium reduction method based on the azo dye reaction. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) was determined by the molybdate/ascorbic acid method based on the formation of a phosphomolybdate blue complex. Total phosphorus (TP) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) (Menzel and Corwin 1965) as well as total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) (D'Elia et al. 1977) were determined like SRP and nitrate/nitrite respectively, after digestion with potassium persulfate in an autoclave. Samples for total particulate nitrogen (TPN) were processed through pre-combusted (4 h at 450\u00b0C) Whatman GF/F Wlters and frozen until analysis. Prior to analysis Wlters were thawed and dried at 80\u00b0C for 24h. TPN concentrations were then determined on a Carlo-Erba model 1110 CHN elemental analyzer. Monitoring data for the Raisin catchment did not include TDN or TPN, but total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), NO 3 , and NH 4 were included. TN concentrations were then calculated for the Raisin catchment by summing TKN and NO 3 . Total organic nitrogen (TON) was calculated as TN minus NO 3 and NH 4 . Re-calculation of budgets from other studies using the reference method Comparing the results of this investigation to similar budget studies allows conclusions to be broadened beyond southeast Michigan and identiWes limitations of current budgeting approaches. However, amongstudy comparison of nutrient inputs and outputs as well as the proportion of inputs accounted for as budget outputs is diYcult because of diVerences in budgeting methods. This was addressed by employing a number of assumptions and approximations in order to reconstruct all budgets to be consistent with the budgeting approach used for the Huron and Raisin, which is considered the \"reference method\" for the remainder of this paper. In addition to the Huron and Raisin, phosphorus budgets were constructed for the State of Illinois, the Maumee and Sandusky catchments in northern Ohio, the Muskingham and Minnesota catchments in the Mississippi Basin, and the entire Mississippi Basin using the reference method. Baker and Richards (2002) did not include surface waters in their system deWnition for the Maumee and Sandusky, and they assumed point source discharges were transported to the river mouth without any load reduction. To adjust the original budgets, point source discharges were added back into the river export loads and also included as an input. David and Gentry's (2000) P budget methodology for the state of Illinois is similar to those used for N budgets, in which system boundaries include above-ground terms, and Xuxes are combined to form net input and output Xuxes. Few of the inputs and outputs included in the Huron and Raisin P budget approach were explicitly included by David and Gentry 2000, so re-calculation of their budgets to conform with the reference method was only an approximation. Though Goolsby et al. (1999) did not formally construct P budgets, most of the important inputs and outputs are reported, so it is possible to re-calculate their budgets. Reported fertilizer application rates, manure application rates, and point source discharges were used from David and Gentry (2000) and Goolsby et al. (1999) for the state of Illinois, Muskingham, Minnesota, and the entire Mississippi basin. Point source discharge and manure application for Illinois were interpolated from time series plots included in David and Gentry (2000). A precipitation rate of 14 kg P km \u00a12 y \u00a11 was added as well as sludge inputs based on Baker and Richards (2002). Crop and river P exports were reported for all 4 of these geographic units except crop export for the state of Illinois, which was estimated from the crop export rate for the Illinois River catchment (1,353 kg P km \u00a12 y \u00a11 ) included in Goolsby et al. (1999). To enable comparisons between prior studies and N budgets for the Huron and Raisin, analogous budgets were re-calculated for the state of Illinois and three catchment units in the Northeast (Mohawk, Rappahannock, and all the northeastern U.S. catchments combined), using input and output Xuxes provided in David and Gentry (2000) and Boyer et al. (2002) to accord with the reference method. The Muskingham, Minnesota, and the entire Mississippi Basin could not be included in these budget comparisons because the approach of Goolsby et al. (1999) deWned system boundaries diVerently and included diVerent Xuxes. Since Boyer et al. (2002) used a net term for atmospheric deposition, N lost to NH x volatilization had to be added to the northeastern catchments for comparison to the present study. Fortunately, these Xuxes were explicitly included in Boyer et al. (2002). N Wxation included in budgets was the sum of agricultural and natural (forest and wetland) N Wxation, except for the state of Illinois, which only reported agricultural N Wxation. N in food and feed was included as an input Xux for the three northeastern U.S. units and as an output Xux for the Huron and Raisin catchments as well as Illinois. NH x volatilization from fertilizer and animal waste was not included in David and Gentry (2000) for Illinois, so this Xux was estimated using the proportion of NH x volatilization to fertilizer application for the Raisin catchment, which was 0.013."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Huron and Raisin nitrogen budgets", "text": "Atmospheric N deposition contributed 22% of N inputs to the Huron catchment and only 12% of all inputs to the Raisin catchment over the two year study period ( Table 2). Deposition rates were considered to be the same for both catchments because the closest deposition monitoring station was central to both catchments. Inorganic wet deposition accounted for 61% of the total atmospheric deposition, and inorganic dry and organic deposition contributed 24% and 15%, respectively. Wet deposition of NH 4 + and NO 3 \u00a1 was lower in 2005 when the catchments experienced below-average rainfall, and total dry deposition was higher in 2005. Nitric acid was the largest contributor to N in dry deposition. Nitrogenous fertilizer was the largest single input of N to both catchments, accounting for 42% of N inputs into the Huron catchment and 54% of inputs to the Raisin. Application rates per unit area of N in fertilizer were more than two times higher in the more agricultural Raisin catchment compared to the Huron catchment. Most fertilizer N was applied as anhydrous ammonia, with minor contributions from urea (3%) and other forms (14%). Nitrogen Wxation in agricultural, wetland, and forested lands was another important source of N to both catchments (Table 3). Overall, N Wxation accounts for about 35% of total N inputs to both catchments, and row-crop agricultural land provided a large majority of N Wxation. NH x volatilization only accounted for 4% of the Huron's outputs, and only 1% of the Raisin's outputs. Most of this volatilization was from livestock-associated emissions rather than from volatilization of fertilizers. Food and feed export was the largest output for both catchment N budgets, making up 67% of N outputs for the Huron and 79% for the Raisin. N production by crops and livestock exceeded N consumption needs for humans and animals in both catchments during 2004 and 2005 (Table 4). N production from wheat was the most important crop N source to humans in both catchments, and soybean crop N production was the largest source to livestock. River export loads of total N were over four times larger for the Raisin compared to the Huron (see below). Nitrate/nitrite accounted for most of the TN exported from each catchment via river export. All inputs and outputs were aggregated to produce N budgets for the Huron and Raisin catchments for 2004 and 2005 (Table 5). A greater proportion of inputs were accounted for in outputs from the Raisin catchment (80%) than the Huron catchment (22%). Assuming the diVerence between inputs and outputs represents losses of N due to storage and denitriWcation, the Huron stored and denitriWed 2,418 kg N km \u00a12 y \u00a11 compared to 1,538 kg N km \u00a12 y \u00a11 for the Raisin. Total N inputs were approximately two times higher for the Raisin catchment because of higher fertilizer application and crop N Wxation. Total N outputs were nearly six times higher in the Raisin catchment compared to the Huron catchment, due primarily to high exports of agricultural products."}, {"section_title": "Huron and Raisin phosphorus budgets", "text": "Inputs of P from precipitation were small, accounting for only 3% of all P inputs to the Huron catchment   W e t l a n d 4 4 4 4 1 7 1 7 T o t a l 6 5 6 5 4 0 4 0 and 2% to the Raisin. The same rate was used for both catchments (14 kg P km \u00a12 y \u00a11 ). Fertilizer application was the largest single input of P, accounting for 56% of total P inputs to the Huron catchment and 71% for the Raisin. There was more than twice as much fertilizer applied in the Raisin catchment relative to the Huron. Manure inputs to the system contributed about one-Wfth of total P inputs for each catchment. The Raisin had higher manure inputs because of larger livestock populations. Human waste inputs to the catchments consisted of point source eZuents directly into receiving waters and sludge application to agricultural Welds. Point source discharge made up a very small portion of total P inputs to the system, about 1.2% in the Huron and 0.4% in the Raisin. Approximately 98% of P from point source discharges came from municipal WWTPs rather than industrial facilities in both catchments. Sludge application contributed 21% and 7% of P inputs for the Huron and Raisin, respectively. Thus, there was more sludge than animal manure P applied to agricultural Welds in the more urban Huron catchment. Crop export was a much larger P output than was riverine P export in both catchments. Crop export from the Raisin catchment was about 3 times higher than estimated for the Huron catchment. Corn and soybean crops accounted for most crop P exported from each catchment. River exports accounted for only 2% and 3% of the total outputs for the Huron and Raisin catchments, respectively. Raisin River P exports were about Wve times higher than those of the Huron. Combining all inputs and outputs into a P budget (Table 6) shows that more P inputs are accounted for as outputs in the Raisin catchment than in the Huron, as was seen for N. In fact, the Raisin catchment exported more P than it received as inputs in both 2004 and 2005. Assuming the diVerence between inputs and outputs represents P storage, the Huron stored 156 kg P km \u00a12 y \u00a11 , while the Raisin had a net export of 102 kg P km \u00a12 y \u00a11 . Considering both catchments, more of the inputs are accounted for in the outputs for the P budgets (96%) than are accounted for in the N budgets (59%). Total P inputs to the Raisin were about twice those to the Huron catchment, due to higher fertilizer and manure application rates in the Raisin catchment."}, {"section_title": "Huron and Raisin N and P river exports", "text": "River nutrient export as a percentage of total inputs was higher for N than for P (Tables 5, 6). Combining both catchments and years, river export accounted for about 2.6% of P inputs, versus 11.4% of N inputs.  Stoichiometric N:P ratios were 8.9 for total inputs and increased to 38 in river export. Comparing catchments, river export was a threefold larger percentage of both P and N inputs in the Raisin than in the Huron, due to much higher river TN and TP export loads in the Raisin. Examination of the speciWc forms of N and P in river export revealed that more of TP export was SRP in the Raisin, compared to the Huron catchment (Table 7). TON and NH 4 accounted for much larger portions of TN loads in the Huron compared to the Raisin catchment. Nitrate/nitrite, however, was relatively more important in the Raisin TN load compared to the Huron. Budget comparisons with other studies Several broad observations can be made after applying the reference method to P budgets from the eight geographic units described previously. P outputs as a percentage of inputs ranged from 60% in the Sandusky catchment to 112% in the Raisin catchment, and averaged 77% (Table 8). Thus, about a Wfth of P coming into these systems was unaccounted for or missing based on a common method of estimation. The percentage of missing P did not correlate well with any of the Xuxes or with extent of cropland. However, total P inputs and outputs were tightly correlated (R 2 = 0.80), and river export was highly correlated to total P inputs (R 2 = 0.83) when compared broadly across these eight geographic units. The fraction of P inputs exported by rivers ranged from 1.3% to 7.4%, with an average of 5%. As with P budgets, N budgets for the six geographic units described above varied substantially (Table 9). N outputs as a fraction of inputs ranged from 14% in the Rappahannock catchment to 80% in the Raisin, averaging 39%. Thus, on average, the majority of N inputs were unaccounted for or missing using the reference method. Outputs as a fraction of inputs were strongly correlated with the proportion of cropland (R 2 = 0.84). Total inputs and outputs for N were tightly correlated (R 2 = 0.92), and river export was correlated to total N inputs (R 2 = 0.74). The fraction of N inputs exported by the river ranged from 6.6% to 22.9% of total inputs, with an average of 16%."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Huron and Raisin nutrient Xuxes", "text": "QuantiWcation of N and P budgets for the Huron and Raisin provided insight into the origin, transport, and fate of N and P in these two southeastern Michigan catchments.

Much of this diVerence is likely due to the exclusion of denitriWcation as an output Xux, as discussed below. A greater fraction of inputs were accounted for as outputs for both N and P in the Raisin catchment compared to the Huron. It is probable that this greater imbalance in the Huron catchment is due to greater removal of N and P via impoundments. River exports of N and P diVered considerably as a fraction of nutrient budgets and between the Huron and Raisin catchments. Combining both catchments and years, river export on average accounted for about ten times more of total inputs of N (11.4%) than P (2.6%). Stoichiometric ratios for N:P in inputs compared to river export conWrm that substantially less P is exported from these two catchments by river transport than is true for N, suggesting that proportionally more P than N is stored in either the terrestrial or aquatic parts of the catchment. This was expected since P is considered the primary limiting nutrient in freshwater systems. Comparing the two catchments, the Huron stored more P than the Raisin and also stored and/or denitriWed more N. The greater number of impoundments in the Huron catchment is the most likely explanation for these diVerences, allowing more P to settle out of the water column and more N to be denitriWed as suggested by Stanley and Doyle (2002). The inference that impoundments are the primary reason why smaller proportions of catchment N and P inputs are exported through the Huron River is supported by other work in these and other catchments. Comparison of input and output loads above and below impoundments and across river reaches in the Huron and Raisin documented that impoundments consumed N and P whereas stream reaches showed no removal (Bosch 2007). Increased nutrient removal in impoundments was attributed to N loss through denitriWcation in sediments, long-term settling of P, and longer residence times of water, allowing more time for processing to occur. Direct sampling showed that two adjacent impoundments in the Huron catchment together removed 18% and 32% of TN and TP annual loads, respectively. In addition, model simulations using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) showed that P and N export loads would approximately double if all impoundments were removed from the Huron watershed (Bosch 2007). In a survey of 27 impoundments across Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, Walker and Kuhner (1978) reported a median annual TP removal of 47% and TN removal of 23%. David et al. (2006) found that 19% of TN inputs were removed in an agriculturally inXuenced impoundment in Illinois. In a global study of 35 large rivers which compared catchment N inputs and river export, Caraco and Cole (1999) discovered substantially decreased export of N in the three rivers which contained large impoundments. Substantial N and P removal in the numerous impoundments of the Huron catchment provides a likely explanation for the relatively low N and P river export. DiVerences in nutrient retention between forested and agricultural ecosystems could provide an alternative explanation for low N and P export through the Huron River, relative to the Raisin River. The River Raisin has a greater proportion of its area in agricultural use and less forested land compared to the Huron (Table 1). In a comparison of N and P Xuxes in cropland versus forested riparian ecosystems in Maryland, Peterjohn and Corell (1984) found much Table 9 Comparison of N budgets for various catchments and geographic areas after adjusting results from other studies so they are comparable to the \"reference method\" N budget described in this study (kg N km \u00a12 y \u00a11 ) greater retention of N and P in forested ecosystems, relative to those dominated by agricultural practices. Pregitzer et al. (2004) observed that leaching losses of inorganic and organic N from northern hardwood forests were small, apparently because the majority of atmospheric N deposition was retained by plant and microbial sinks. With proportionally more forested and less agricultural land in the Huron catchment, it is reasonable to expect that more N and P would be retained within terrestrial ecosystems, thus reducing nutrient delivery to stream channels via groundwater or subsurface Xow."}, {"section_title": "Comparisons with other studies", "text": "The majority of N entering the various geographic units was missing or unaccounted for in catchment outputs when compared using the reference method. In contrast, only about one-Wfth of P inputs were unaccounted for in measured outputs. This diVerence likely is at least partly due to the absence of a denitriWcation Xux in N budgets, as well as more storage of P than N within catchments. Unlike P budgets, N outputs as a fraction of N inputs were strongly correlated with the proportion of cropland, indicating that N storage and removal increased as the extent of agricultural land in the catchment declined. Presumably this missing N was lost from the system via denitriWcation, although storage is also a possibility. Total inputs and outputs were tightly correlated for both P and N budgets, which is expected if the budgets are reasonably accurate. Since the percent of inputs exported by the river was three times higher for N than P, these catchments retain P more eVectively than N. The Huron had the lowest percent of riverine export for both N and P, which likely is due to the many impoundments in the Huron relative to most other catchments. Howarth et al. (1996) and Boyer et al. (2002) each reported that rivers typically export about 25% of their net inputs. Our estimates of river export percentages using the reference method were not directly comparable to these values. To compare their results to N budgets for the Huron and Raisin catchments and the state of Illinois, NH x volatilization and food and feed export Xuxes were subtracted from total N inputs to calculate total net N inputs as Boyer et al. (2002) used. Using comparable calculations to those reported in Boyer et al. (2002), the Huron River exported only 8% of catchment net inputs of N, which is lower than any of the 16 northeastern U.S. catchments. The more agricultural Raisin and catchments in Illinois exported 45% and 52% of net N inputs in their rivers, respectively, which were higher percentages than any catchments included in Boyer et al. (2002). This indicates that this 25% generalization does not apply broadly, possibly because the 16 catchments in the northeastern U.S. included in Boyer et al. (2002) do not represent the diversity of land use proportions, geology, extent of impoundment, or climate that is present in other catchments."}, {"section_title": "Budgeting uncertainty and limitations", "text": "Although budgets were constructed with the best data available, there were some fundamental gaps due to unmeasured inputs or outputs. For example, P budgets did not include human waste inputs from septic tanks, which may be important as large proportions of each catchment that we studied are unsewered. Because septic inputs are diYcult to estimate, this term commonly is omitted (Baker and Richards 2002;David and Gentry 2000). Using information from local county oYcials and population census data, we roughly estimated the number of people in each catchment that were serviced by septic tanks. We then multiplied these population numbers by a human P loading rate of 2.74 kg P y \u00a11 person \u00a11 (Goolsby 1999). Inclusion of this additional P in the budget estimates lowers the percentage of inputs accounted for as outputs (to 43% and 98% for the Huron and Raisin respectively, see Table 6) and implies greater P storage in the system. The N budget approach used in this study and others (Boyer et al. 2002;David and Gentry 2000) does not include denitriWcation as a catchment output because of the large degree of uncertainty associated with this Xux. If we estimate denitriWcation output Xuxes for soil, ground water, and surface water based on Seitzinger et al. (2006), N outputs from the Huron catchment would account for 82% of inputs, rather than 22%, and N outputs from the Raisin would exceed inputs (111% vs. 80%). Overall, then, the Huron stores more P than the Raisin and also stores and denitriWes more N compared to the Raisin. The much greater number and extent of impoundments in the Huron catchment is the most likely cause for these diVerences, presumably allowing more P to settle out of water column and more N to be denitriWed. N and P catchment budgeting approaches vary widely, making it diYcult to synthesize results and make comparisons. Budget approaches diVer in how the system is deWned, in what Xuxes are considered to be internal to the system versus inputs or outputs from the system, and in which Xuxes are excluded because they are considered insigniWcant or highly uncertain. There is also variation in how some Xuxes are combined to form net Xuxes. Our eVorts to compare budgets from diVerent studies by applying a common estimation approach suggests the value of further eVorts to develop a standardized approach to N and P budget calculation."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "For the Huron and Raisin catchments and 2004 and 2005 budget years, a greater fraction of inputs were accounted for as outputs for P budgets (96%) than for N budgets (59%). The amount of missing N is consistent with rough estimates of denitriWcation. Comparing the two catchments, it is clear that the Huron catchment overall stored more P than the Raisin, and also stored and denitriWed more N. It is likely that the many impoundments in the Huron catchment allowed the river to remove a greater percentage of N and P from the water, compared to the Raisin. Comparison of input and output Xuxes from the Huron and Raisin with Wndings of other studies, supported by the construction of comparable budgets for geographic units included in these studies, corroborated Huron and Raisin budget results and allowed some synthesis. On average, P outputs accounted for 77% of inputs, whereas quantiWable N outputs only accounted for 39% of inputs. In addition, these values vary widely. As in the case of the Huron and Raisin catchments, inclusion of denitriWcation as an additional N output Xux likely would signiWcantly increase the proportion of inputs that could be accounted for as outputs. The percent of inputs exported by the river averaged 16% for N and 5% for P, indicating that these catchments retain P more eVectively than N."}]
