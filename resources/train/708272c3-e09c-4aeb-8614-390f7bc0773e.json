The largest group, group 1, includes 41 sequences obtained between April 3 and April 22 and represents a distinct Russian transmission lineage (lineage 8, star in Fig. 2 ). This lineage derives from a very prolific ancestral node which has seeded multiple lineages throughout the world, including five of the Russian transmission lineages, so its origin cannot be positioned phylogeographically. Group 2 contains 7 out of 9 sequences in another clade, which also carries one non-Russian (English) sequence (triangles in Fig. 2 ).

This is based on the deep split between group 3 and groups 1-2. The MRCA of all three groups dates to February 4 (95% CI January 1 -March 7). This is almost two months prior to the assumed date of introduction (March 27), implying that group 3 and the remaining Vreden samples were introduced independently.\nA third introduction into the Vreden hospital is also highly probable. Indeed, the MRCA of groups 1 and 2 dates to March 15 (95% CI February 25 -March 31). As there was no sign of infection at the hospital before the end of March, it is quite likely that these two groups originated through separate introductions. The root of the group 1 dates to March 23 (95% CI March 11 -March 30), which is consistent with the suspected illness period of the zero patient. Additional evidence that groups 1 and 2 originate from distinct introductions is provided by the fact that the clade that includes group 2 also carries a non-Russian (English) sequence (Fig. 2) .\nFinally, a fourth introduction is also possible, suggested by the deep split within the group 3 ( Fig. 7) . The MRCA of this group 3 dates to March 17, although this estimate has a broad confidence interval which overlaps the supposed illness period of the zero patient.\nWe estimated the phylodynamic parameters before and after the quarantine measures were introduced. In all three analyzes, the estimates of phylodynamic parameters were stable and consistent with each other. We found that the effective reproductive number Re was 3.72 (95% CI 2.48-5.05) before April 8, and dropped to 1.38 (95% CI 0.48-2.41) after April 8 (Fig.   6 ). Remarkably, the credible intervals for these estimates do not overlap, indicating a statistically significant slow down of the outbreak. The sampling proportion decreased with time, indicating that the number of sequenced samples did not keep up with the rapidly growing case counts (Fig. 6, Supplementary Table 3 ).\n.

By using direct travel data, we show that both these problems hold. Indeed, we find transmission lineages apparently co-introduced from multiple countries (Fig. 3b) or singletons without any history of travel (Fig. 4c) . The uncertainty in the number of introduction events is the highest for identical sequences with broad geographic distribution, e.g., the last common ancestor of lineage B.1.1. This node constitutes a stem cluster of 100 identical Russian sequences, as well as 4323 sequences from outside Russia. It is the immediate ancestor to five Russian transmission lineages and 19 stem-derived Russian singletons, so how many times this sequence has been introduced into Russia strongly affects the overall counts of the number of introductions. Travel data indicate that a stem .

Since this corresponds to roughly one introduction per each three sequences sampled, the actual number of introductions was probably much higher, and its estimate will likely increase as more sequences are sampled.\nContrary to some previous reports 47, 53 , we find that the phylogeographic position of a lineage is predictive of its origin. For some of the Russian samples, we are able to infer unambiguously or with little ambiguity their origin, and when direct travel data is available, it supports our claims. The difference from the UK study may be due to the fact that most Russian lineges originated late, when the source European lineages were already well established. Still, for many of the introductions, phylogeography is not informative of their origin; moreover, phylogeographic inferences are expected to be biased in the presence of uneven sampling between countries. This illustrates the need of combining multiple data sources, including direct travel data, for understanding viral origin and spread 54 .\nAlthough it is hard to ascribe epidemiological results to specific NPIs, our analysis suggests that the border closure with China implemented in February has effectively curbed the virus introduction into Russia from the Asian direction. Indeed, only four of our samples belong to lineages A, B and B.2 (GISAID clades S, L and V, respectively), which predominantly originated in Asia; and two of those sequences are nested within other European subclades, indicating that the import was through Europe. This fraction is not representative of global case counts at that time, and is instead reflective of travel patterns and history of border closures. It is also in contrast to the situation in other countries where the outbreaks started earlier, and were probably seeded by direct introduction from Asia 55-57 .\n.

We see robust evidence for transmission within Russia, but no evidence of export of SARS-CoV-2 outside Russia. This is consistent with a lower number of international travelers leaving Russia compared to the number returning to Russia after the start of the pandemic; later start of the outbreak compared to that in neighboring countries; and/or higher efficiency of border closure at later stages of the outbreak. More generally, this is consistent with Europe being a global source, rather than a sink, of infections up to early March 58 .\nFor most of the discovered transmission lineages, the earliest sampled sequence was collected between March 11 and 24 (Fig. 5b) . In the larger UK dataset, the mean time between the importation date of a lineage and its earliest sampling date within the UK was estimated to be approximately two weeks, although this depends on many factors including lineage size and sampling intensity 47 . If this can be extrapolated to Russian transmission lineages, this implies that these lineages typically originated from imports in the last week of 64 . In all but one of these cases, the outbreaks were genetically homogenous, indicating that they each arose from a single case. In the community living facility, multiple introductions have occurred, but there was a dominant clade that included nearly all the samples, while .

By contrast, at the Vreden hospital outbreak, we observe multiple (2) (3) (4) introductions, each of which gave a prolific clade. This indicates that this outbreak could have originated from multiple superspreading events. Furthermore, we estimate the initial effective reproductive number Re during the pre-quarantine period at ~3.7, which is rather high. Multiple superspreading events and the high Re can be due to some of the conditions specific to a hospital not specifically equipped for infection control, including dense contacts (in particular, spread by medical workers), absence of protective measures, and lack of awareness. In the second phase of the outbreak, we observe a significant decrease in Re down to ~1.4. This change can be explained by two factors. Firstly, it can be due to increased awareness and quarantine measures which were in effect after April 7.\nSecondly, it can be due to a large number of people already ill, preventing further infection;\nindeed, around 30% of people at the hospital had been infected by April 22. We cannot quantify the contribution of these factors to the slowing rate of infection spread with available data and methods.\nThe Vreden hospital outbreak has apparently contributed to COVID-19 spread in Saint Petersburg. By May 26, more than 14,000 cases had been confirmed in Saint Petersburg. In our dataset, the three predominantly-Vreden groups include five non-Vreden samples (out of the 84 non-Vreden Saint Petersburg samples; Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3) , indicating transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the hospital to the outside population. For two of these samples, 6840 and 6846, their relation to the Vreden hospital could be identified: these two cases were probably infected by family members of a Vreden hospital employee. As we didn't specifically target Vreden-related samples collected outside of the Vreden hospital, the high proportion of Vreden-related samples (5/84) implies that the Vreden hospital outbreak has conceivably contributed to a substantial fraction of non-Vreden cases in Saint Petersburg.\n.

For stem clusters, the possible source of introduction were the countries of origin for the sequences identical to those in the stem cluster. As a possible source of introduction, we only considered those countries with the earliest collection date earlier than the earliest collection date among all samples in the lineage (or than the collection date of the singleton). For patients with known travel history, we considered the country (continent) of origin as uniquely identified by phylogeography if it was either the only country (continent) on the ancestral stem, or the one with the earliest collection date. For samples with no travel data, the same logic was applied, except we only infer the country or continent of origin if it was the only one on the stem. If there were more than eight countries in the list, countries were merged into regions: Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. To study the possibility of introduction from China, we performed the same analysis, but considered China, Hong Kong and Taiwan separately from the rest of Asia.\nTo estimate the number of possible exports out of Russia, we used maximum parsimony, asking whether any non-Russian sequences were nested within Russian clades. In this analysis, we conservatively assumed that the phylogenetic nodes carrying both Russian and non-Russian sequences were positioned outside Russia. No evidence for export was observed.\nTo understand whether introductions to Russia occurred through major transportation hubs (Moscow and Saint Petersburg), we considered all Russian samples not included in Russian transmission lineages. For these samples, we calculated the branch lengths from each sample to its immediate ancestor, and labeled all samples by two categories: major hubs (Moscow, Moscow region, Saint Petersburg and Leningrad region) and other locations (samples from all other locations in Russia). On this data, we performed a permutation test, shuffling labels across the dataset 1000 times. The two-sided p-value was calculated.\n.

Phylogenetically, each of the 211 Russian sequences belongs to one of the three categories ( Supplementary   Fig. 2 ). Firstly, 77 (36%) of these sequences form the 9 distinct Russian transmission lineages (Fig. 2, 3) , defined as monophyletic groups (clades) carrying more than one sequence all of which are Russian. These lineages indicate within-Russia transmission of introduced variants.

Such lineages, hereafter referred to as \"stem-derived transmission lineages\", could also result from distinct introduction events; alternatively, their last common ancestor could already reside in Russia. To estimate the number of introductions giving rise to the stem-derived lineages, we make use of the direct data on travel history (or lack thereof) available for a fraction of our patients. Using a statistical model, we estimate that these lineages together resulted from roughly one additional introduction event (Supplementary Note). This number could be an underestimate .

Indeed, one of the identified lineages ( Fig.   3b ) involves two samples that had travel history to two different countries, indicating likely double introduction within the same lineage.\nSecondly, we observe 73 (34%) singletons each possessing their own characteristic mutations not shared by any other sequences (Fig. 4) . These include 33 singletons without any predating Russian ancestral sequences, and 40 singletons stemming from ancestral nodes with earlier Russian sequences (hereafter, \"stem-derived singletons\"). We assume that the former correspond to sole introduced cases, for a total of 40 such introductions.\nMost of them had probably not resulted in any within-Russia transmission. However, we find that some of the singleton sequences were sampled from patients without any travel history ( Fig. 4c ). This indicated that at least some of the singletons likely correspond to distinct introductions that yielded domestic transmission clusters, of which just one representative was sequenced. Using travel data, we estimate that stem-derived singletons resulted from ~6 additional introduction events (Supplementary Note).\nThirdly, the remaining 61 sequences (29%) fell into 12 sets of identical sequences, further referred to as stem clusters, each of which was also identical to some of the non-Russian sequences (Fig. 4d) . Again, individual samples within a stem cluster could correspond to distinct introductions or domestic transmission. When data on travel history is available, we find that some of such clusters include multiple individuals with travel history, suggesting that identical sequences were repeatedly introduced into Russia at least in some instances (Fig.   4d ). On the other hand, we also observe individuals without travel history, indicating domestic transmission of these variants. From travel data, the estimated number of introductions leading to stem cluster sequences is ~22.\nOverall, we estimate the number of independent transmissions into Russia as ~6 resulting in transmission lineages, ~39 resulting in singletons, and ~22 resulting in stem clusters, for a .

The uncertainty associated with this estimate is largely dependent on the approach for treating the numbers of introductions leading to stem clusters. If each stem cluster is assumed to originate from exactly one introduction, the estimated number of introductions is 47. If instead each introduction within a stem cluster is distinct, the estimated number of introductions rises to 103.\nPhylogenetic analysis indicates that for most Russian transmission lineages, the earliest sample collection dates fall into the range between March 11 and 24, indicating that the corresponding lineages were introduced into Russia not long before (Fig. 5b) . Indeed, out of the nine Russian transmission lineages, only two (lineages 6 and 8) had later dates of the oldest sequences. However, those were stem-derived lineages, and the oldest stem sequences corresponding to them dated to March 13, suggesting that these transmission lineages could have also been established by this date. Many (15 out of 33) of the singletons were also collected within this timeframe, although some were collected later (mean date:\nMarch 29); together with the fact that many of the singletons have not travelled (Fig. 4 , Supplementary Fig. 4 ), this indicates that they in fact correspond to as yet unsampled transmission lineages. By contrast, most stem-derived singletons were sampled at later dates (mean date: April 7, Mann-Whitney U-test, p=0.014), indicating that they were more likely than non-stem-derived singletons to originate from within-Russian transmission.\nBy the time introduction into Russia has started, the virus had already spread through other countries, with the same variant frequently present at multiple locations. Therefore, the source of most introductions could not be established unambiguously. Still, for many of the samples, phylogenetic position is informative of the source. For example, the earliest patient with known travel history has returned to Russia from France, and her sample is nested within a clade with just French and Danish sequences at the ancestral node, with French having earlier dates and therefore a more plausible source (Fig. 4a) .

This was the case for the import of clades from Switzerland into Yakutia (the Sakha Republic) (Fig. 3c) 35, 36 and from Saudi Arabia to the Chechen Republic (Fig. 4b) 37 .\nOverall, out of the 13 patients with known travel history (11 direct + 2 from media reports), the country of origin is consistent with the sampling locations of the same or ancestral nodes in 9 cases, including the 3 cases when it is uniquely identified. In one case ( Supplementary   Fig. 5b ), the travel direction (Egypt) is inconsistent with the phylogenetic position of the sample, and in the remaining three cases, there is not enough phylogeographic data to make a call. For the same 9 out of the 13 patients, we were able to correctly and uniquely identify the source continent (Europe in all cases). The individuals importing the virus and seeding the Russian transmission lineages were not a random sample of the population. Very early samples were collected from patients who were on average younger than those sampled later (Fig. 5a) . This is consistent with the major role of younger Russians in the import of virus into Russia 38 , possibly because they comprised a larger share among the people returning from business trips or holidays.\n.

As Moscow and Saint Petersburg are major transport hubs, together responsible for 77% of the international air traffic in Russia, we hypothesized that the virus was introduced through these cities, and spread throughout Russia from them. Contrary to this hypothesis, among the Russian stem clusters and singletons, the samples from Moscow or Saint Petersburg do not sit on shorter branches than samples from other regions; in fact, branches leading to them tend to be slightly longer (0.88 vs. 0.37, p=0.006, permutation test), probably because of more extensive regional sampling early in the outbreak. Thus, we see no evidence for a preferential direction of transmission within Russia, suggesting that the Russian epidemic has been seeded by near-concurrent introduction into multiple regions.

A Russian transmission lineage is a set of two or more sequences that form a Russian-only clade. A Russian singleton is a single Russian sequence that forms a clade of its own (i.e., possesses one or more private mutations) and is not a part of a Russian transmission lineage. A Russian stem cluster is a set of Russian sequences identical to each other and to some non-Russian sequences. A Russian stem-derived transmission lineage is a Russian transmission lineage whose immediate ancestor is a Russian stem cluster, and at least one of the sequences in this stem cluster was collected earlier than the earliest sequence in the lineage. A Russian stemderived singleton is a Russian singleton whose immediate ancestor is a Russian stem cluster, and at least one of the sequences in this stem cluster was collected earlier than the singleton. These categories are schematically represented on Supplementary Figure 2 .\nAs sampling dates, we used the collection dates reported in GISAID. For some samples, either the day or both the day and the month of collection were missing. In such cases, the date was set to the latest date possible, e.g. \"2020-03\" to \"2020-03-31\" and \"2020\" to \"2020-12-31\". The date for the lineage introduction was estimated as the earliest collection date among all samples in the particular lineage.\nIn phylogeographic analysis, we assumed that the possible source(-s) of introduction for Russian transmission lineages and Russian singletons were the sampling country(-ies) of the non-Russian sequences ancestral to the considered lineage; for Russian stem-derived transmission lineages and Russian stem-derived singletons, these were the non-Russian .

To account for this, we constrained the phylogeny as follows: (((group1), group 2),(group 3)). We independently ran BEAST2 on three datasets: (i) the whole Vreden dataset comprising groups 1, 2 and 3; (ii) groups 1 and 2; and (iii) group 1 only. The model details were as follows. The effective reproductive number was allowed to change on March 27 (which delimits the suspected out-of-hospital period) and again on April 8 (which corresponds to the introduction of quarantine). The sampling proportion was set to zero prior to March 27, and was allowed to change on April 8 and April 15. The prior on the clock rate was set to be a normal distribution with mean 9.41*10 -4 and standard deviation 4.99*10 -5 , based on the estimates from the UK study 47 . Dates were fixed for the 11 sequences (all from group 1) for which the dates of symptom onset were available; for the remaining 41 sequences, we applied tip date sampling with a uniform prior as detailed below. Other priors are provided in Supplementary Table 7. Supplementary Tables 4, 5 and 6 contain the Bayesian estimates of the model parameters for three datasets comprising groups 1, 2 and 3, groups 1 and 2 and group 1, respectively.\nThe fifty two Vreden samples were collected on 5 distinct dates, with a substantial lag between subsequent collection dates (see Supplementary Table 3 ). For some of the samples, sample collection date could differ substantially from the symptoms onset date. To address the bias in collection dates, we used the symptoms onset date instead of the collection date in BEAST2 analysis, estimating it as follows. For 11 samples, the symptoms onset dates were known (Supplementary Table 2 ). For each of the remaining 41 samples, we produced a posterior estimate of its symptoms onset date by using a uniform prior between March 31st and the collection date.\n.
