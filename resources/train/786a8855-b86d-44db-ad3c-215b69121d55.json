[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally, with over 6 million confirmed cases and over 300 000 deaths in the USA since January, 2020. 1 Patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases have considerable concerns regard ing the risks of severe outcomes after COVID-19, although the risk of such outcomes in these patients compared with the general population remains unclear. Some studies found higher odds of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases than in the general population, 2,3 and two times higher odds of hospitalisation in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases on prednisone doses above 10 mg daily than those not on prednisone, 4 whereas other studies have not shown higher incidence or severity of COVID-19 in patients with rheu matic and musculoskeletal diseases than in the general population. 5, 6 Although these early reports provide insight into the impact of the pandemic on patients with rheumatic and musculo skeletal diseases during the initial crisis phase, over the subsequent 6 months, there have been improvements in testing capacity, supportive care (eg, prone positioning), and treatments (eg, remdesivir and dexamethasone) for COVID-19, leading to a reduction in the case-fatality rate in the general population and specula tion that other COVID-19 outcomes might have also improved over time. 1,7-9 However, temporal trends in COVID- 19 outcomes have not been quantified in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. It is important to understand these temporal changes given that historical comparator groups are increasingly used to gauge the efficacy of potential treatments for COVID-19 and to inform patients with rheumatic and musculo skeletal diseases and their health-care providers of the current risks. 10 , 11 We aimed to investigate differences in mortality and other critical outcomes after COVID-19 diagnosis between an early cohort and late cohort of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases within the first 180 days of the pandemic in the USA."}, {"section_title": "Data source", "text": "In this population-based comparative cohort study, we used US-based data from the Dataworks network TriNetX, a large federated health research network with real-time updates of electronic health record data including demographics, diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory values, and vital statuses.

We identified four cohort or case-control studies examining whether patients with rheumatic disease had more severe COVID-19 outcomes than did the general population, with two studies reporting that patients with rheumatic disease had a higher risk of mechanical ventilation compared with the general population, and two studies reporting no such risk. However, none of the studies identified by our search reported whether severe COVID-19 outcomes have improved over time in patients with rheumatic disease during the ongoing pandemic. Additionally, we reviewed online dashboards, including the WHO COVID-19 Dashboard, the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, and Our World in Data for trends in COVID-19 outcomes, including the case-fatality rate.

We compared the incidences and relative risks (RRs) of these outcomes among the unmatched and exposure score matched cohorts at 30 days after the index date, and we generated cumulative incidence curves of the composite outcome over that timeframe. We did a subgroup analysis restricted to patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases who were hospitalised within 7 days of diagnosis with COVID-19. Among the hospitalised subgroup, we addi tionally assessed the use of medications in the 30 days after the index date, including remdesivir, dexa methasone, tocilizumab, and hydroxychloroquine. We did a sensitivity analysis with a washout period between the early and late cohorts and compared patients diag nosed with COVID-19 in the first 60-day period with those diagnosed in the final 60-day period, excluding patients diagnosed in the middle 60-day period. We additionally did a sensitivity analysis restricted to patients with two or more ICD codes for a rheumatic or musculoskeletal disease. For all measures, we calculated 95% CIs.

The rheumatic and musculo skeletal dis ease diagnoses (not mutually exclusive) were gout ( The composition was similar between the early and late cohorts (appendix p 1). The mean patient ages were 62 years (SD 16) in the early cohort and 60 years (17) in the late cohort. Patient baseline characteristics are reported in table 1. After exposure score matching, the 2701 patients in each cohort had similar demographics, comor bid i ties, rheu matic and musculo skeletal disease diagnoses, creatinine, BMI, glucocorticoid use, oral DMARD use, bio logical DMARD use, and previous hospitalisations (all standardised differences <0\u00b71).\nBefore matching, the risks of hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury, initiation of renal replacement therapy, and death were lower in the late cohort than in the early cohort (table 2).

Results were similar in an analysis restricted to patients with two or more ICD codes for a rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease (appendix p 4)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this large, population-based cohort study in the USA, we found improved outcomes for patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases after COVID-19 diagnosis in more recent months of the pandemic compared with earlier months, including lower risks of death, respira tory failure, and renal failure. This finding is probably multifactorial, due to increased testing capacity allowing for detection of milder cases, improved supportive care, and improved treatments. 1, 7, 8, 19, 20 When we restricted our analysis to patients who were hospitalised, and therefore had more similar illness severity, these differences were attenuated, suggesting that some of our observed improvements in the primary analysis could be driven by tem poral Use of investigational agents for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir 21 and dexamethasone, 22 has increased over time, but these medications were used by a minority of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases and were therefore unlikely to have been a major factor contributing to the observed improvement in severe COVID-19 outcomes. We have insufficient data on the use of specific supportive measures such as prone positioning, 23, 24 which might have contributed to our findings. Additional studies are needed to understand the effect of specific interventions on severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients with rheumatic and musculo skeletal diseases. We cannot exclude the possi bility that other potential temporal changes in the care of patients with COVID-19 could have contributed to our observations. For example, if standards for when to hospitalise or proceed with invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases and COVID-19 changed over time, this could explain a reduction in those endpoints. However, this hypothesis does not explain our observed improvement in mortality between the early and late cohorts.\nDespite the temporal improvements we observed in our study, there continues to be a considerable risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 among patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. The risk of death remains substantial, with 5\u00b76% of patients dying within 30 days of a diagnosis of COVID-19 in our study. This death rate is similar to other population-based estimates 1,25 and indicates the ongoing severe nature and guarded prognosis of this illness. Further more, among patients with rheumatic and musculo skeletal diseases who were hospitalised with COVID-19 during recent months, more than a third had an acute kidney injury and nearly 30% had inten sive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death.\nOur findings also indicate that comparison of COVID-19 treatments with a historical reference group might overestimate the efficacy of proposed COVID-19 treatments. Observational studies of therapies for COVID-19 have used historical controls as a reference group-eg, a study of methylprednisolone followed by tocilizumab if needed versus historical care found lower mortality in the methylprednisolone plus tocilizumab group compared with the historical comparator group (hazard ratio 0\u00b735; 95% CI 0\u00b719-0\u00b765). 10 Similarly, a study of colchicine treatment versus a historical comparator showed a lower risk of death with colchicine use compared with the historical standard of care (hazard ratio 0\u00b715, 95% CI 0\u00b706-0\u00b737). 11 These results must be interpreted in the context of improving temporal trends.\nOur study has several limitations. As with all observational studies using electronic health record databases, there might be misclassification, for example, inaccu racies in ICD code documentation. Secular trends in ICD-10 documentation (with the approval of U07.1 as an ICD-10 code specific for COVID-19 on April 1, 2020) and availability and performance characteristics of molecular testing for COVID-19 are a potential limitation of this study. Although we adjusted for many confounders, residual confounding might exist. Outcomes could have been incompletely captured for patients who received subs equent care outside the multicentre network. How ever, we would not expect these limitations to have different effects on the early and late cohorts. We do not have information on the geographical locations of patients because of privacy requirements, and different regions of the USA might have had variable access to COVID-19 testing and treatments. Additionally, although we included gluco corticoid use in the exposure score, we did not have information on glucocorticoid dose, and previous studies have found an increased risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes associated with higher doses of glucocorticoids. 4, 26 This study had multiple endpoints, and we did not correct for multiplicity in our estimation of type 1 error. However, the consistent findings across all endpoints in our primary analysis support the validity of our findings. Despite these limitations, our study has several strengths. The multicentre electronic health record database allows for broad geographical represen tation across academic and community settings in the USA, supporting the generalisability of the temporal trends observed in this study. Additionally, the real-time updated data from the multicentre network allows for timely analysis of population-level trends.\nIn conclusion, we have shown lower risks of respiratory failure, renal failure, and death after COVID-19 diagnosis in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases in more recent months compared with the earlier months of the ongoing pandemic in the USA. However, risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes remain substantial. Major improvements in prevention and treatment are urgently needed to reduce the overall burden of COVID-19 among patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases in the USA."}, {"section_title": "Contributors", "text": "AJ and KMD conceived the study, did the literature search, and did the data analysis.
