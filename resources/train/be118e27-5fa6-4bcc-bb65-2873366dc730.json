[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The emergence and rapid global spread of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome 80 coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 19), has led to an unprecedented worldwide public health crisis, crossing the species barrier 82 and disseminating rapidly through the global population [1] . Like any other rapidly evolving 83 emerging pathogens, effective preventive measures and treatment approaches call for an in- The transmembrane spike glycoprotein protrudes from the viral surface and is 92 responsible for viral attachment, fusion and entrance into the host cells, thereby establishing 93 the infection [4, 5] . The two most notable genetic features of this protein are (a) the binding 94 of its surface unit (S1) to the human cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 95 (hACE2), and (b) the fusion of viral membrane with a host cell membrane via its 96 transmembrane unit (S2). The S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domains (RBD) 97 supporting the stabilization of the membrane-anchored state of the S2 subunit along with its 98 fusion machinery [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Some previous works have acknowledged that extensive and 99 irreversible conformational changes stimulate the cleavage of spike protein, thereby 100 activating it for membrane fusion [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Though it is not yet confirmed if the differences 101 owing to conformational changes are aiding to the expansion of SAR-CoV2 varieties 102 increasing or decreasing its infectivity or transmissibility, but the researchers confirmed the 103 5 spike proteins to be the key pathogenic determinant that differentiates SAR-CoV2 from other 104 SARS-related coronaviruses [17] . It is predicted that mutations in the spike protein increases 105 or decreases protein glycosylation, thereby enhancing or reducing the viral uptake by host 106 cells [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Although the RBD in the spike protein is known as the most important player 107 to recognize the host receptor, it is highly likely that the region outside of this C-terminal 108 domain in S1 subunit as well as the domains of S2 subunit also influence the host-receptor 109 binding allosterically. 110 The present study analyses spike protein variants from Indian isolates to understand 111 the evolutionary patterns and driving forces behind the emerging SARS-CoV-2 infection and 112 its potential epidemiological footprints in India. We detected a strong correlation between the 113 average stability of complexes formed by the circulating spike protein variants with the host 114 receptor (S-R complex) and the disease severity of a given location, suggesting the S-R 115 complex stability as a potential marker to assess the severity of the disease.

We found a countrywide average 170 pairwise nucleotide diversity (\u03c0) of 0.048\u00b10.02%.

Of these, the variant K77M evolved further to yield three more variants 181 isolated from three different states (Bihar, Tamil Nadu and Telengana), suggesting the 182 emergence of K77M as another stable variant. On the other hand, the ancestor 2 showed 183 about twice more diversity by giving rise to 47 variants (Fig 1 and S2 Table) . In this ancestor circulating in India, we detected a total of 16 variants of spike proteins that were represented 188 by multiple isolates (Fig 1) , from 2 to as many as 9 isolates, indicating the possible fixation 189 of some of these variants in the population irrespective of the stability of S-R complex. Of Table) . Interestingly, 53% of the 193 total set of variants detected in Indian population was found unique, i.e. not found in 17529 194 worldwide genomic isolates analyzed from the GISAID database till May 09, 2020 (S2 195   Table) . We believe that this considerable level of uniqueness could be an expected scenario 196 in almost all geographical regions where a newly emerging, rapidly evolving viral pathogen 197 tries to adapt to a new host, and many of these variants might be detrimental to the fitness of 198 the organism. However, specific positive selection pressures could also play a role in this 199 mutational pattern which needs to be studied separately in some greater depth. The average stability index of S-R complex correlates strongly with the fatality rates in 215 a given location. 216 We next looked into the distribution of these spike protein variants across Indian 217 states (S3 Table) . As we computed the diversity based on both richness and evenness of spike "}, {"section_title": "226", "text": "It is expected that these variations might be in response to strong selection pressures 227 acting on the spike protein, especially its S1 subunit which, being a major immunogenic 228 target for the host, plays the pivotal role to evade the host immune response and to offer a 229 successful viral entry. Therefore, the mutational variations in spike proteins can essentially 230 affect the stability of the S-R complex. To assess this, we modeled each of the spike protein 231 variants, and then docked to the binding site of host receptor, hACE2, using HADDOCK Therefore, we could assess the association of average stability index with fatality rates for 252 three states and one union territory (Maharashtra, Gujarat, Telengana and Delhi) which 253 qualified our sample size threshold. Importantly, these four regions harbored 70% of all 254 samples analyzed across 19 states, while their variant diversity ranged from the highest to one 255 of the lowest (S3 Table) . 256 We detected a strong exponential correlation (R 2 =0.96) between the average stability 257 index of circulating spike variants of the region with the fatality rate in that region (Fig 2) .

Interestingly, 13 of these variants with multiple occurrences 291 accumulated mutations exclusively in S1 subunit, while only 3 variants showed all mutations 292 in S2 subunit, which might be suggesting an increased selection pressure in the S1 subunit 293 because of its key role in the viral entry and the presence of the receptor binding domain.

Conforming to this proposal, we found that, 307 after an initial steady increase of fatality rate for the first four weeks, the fatality rate reached 308 a peak at 38.2% on April 11, 2020, followed by a continuous sharp decline at 5.3% on June 309 28, 2020 until when the data were available (Fig 4) , fitting a power law function (R 2 =0.94) 310 (data source: http://covidindiaupdates.in/). This was despite the fact that the rate of mutations 311 was found to be increasing during the three-month period from March till May 2020 during 312 which our analyzed samples were collected. Interestingly, the increase in nonsynonymous 313 (i.e. amino acid replacement) mutation rate (from 0.027% in March to 0.033% in May 2020) 314 was detected to be about 14% higher than the increase in synonymous mutation rate (from "}, {"section_title": "337", "text": "It is known that the apparent tendency to directly correlate the high mutation rate of 338 virus with its infectivity and transmissibility is without merit [42] . On the other side, it has 339 been suggested that Muller's ratchet, via mutational meltdown, could be a key player in 340 leading the SARS-CoV-2 population to gradual extinction due to accumulation and fixation 341 of deleterious mutations in future [40, 43] . On one hand, we observed that the stability of S-R 342 complex is directly linked to the fatality rates, while the continuous emergence of variants 343 from the ancestral ones were found to be less stable compared to their ancestors. As we 344 combine these findings with the countrywide data of a sharp decline in the fatality rate over 345 time, we propose the possibility of mutational meltdown in action for SARS-CoV-2 in India, 346 indicating Muller's ratchet as a plausible game-changer for COVID-19 scenario here in near 347 future. 348 We understand that, only in three months, we cannot expect a radical increase in the 349 mutation rate to give rise to any significant accumulation of deleterious mutations that could showed that the spike protein -hACE2 complex is crucial for viral pathogenesis by causing 368 acute lung damage [46, 47] , which suggests a direct link between S-R complex stability and 369 fatality rate. However, the robustness of the potential of S-R complex stability index for the 370 spike protein variants as a tracker of fatality rate or disease severity needs to be studied in 371 greater depths with more structured region-specific patient data (that are primarily available 372 to selected government/non-government agencies) in connection with larger population-level 373 sequence datasets for the given locations."}, {"section_title": "374", "text": "As expected for any fast-moving pathogen outbreaks [42], we find an increasing rate 375 of mutations, while the extent of increase is much higher for the nonsynonymous (amino acid 376 replacement) changes.
