[{"section_title": "S ubmerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) has", "text": "been widely recognized for its importance in the sustainability and ecological function of aquatic habitats (e.g., Kenworthy et al., 1988; Fredette et al., 1990) . Both declines and recoveries of SAV have been documented in estuaries throughout the United States and Gulf of Mexico (e.g., Olinger et al., 1975; Robbins, 1997; Tomasko and Ried, 1997) . Two Gulf of Mexico estuaries, Florida Bay (Roblee et al., 1991) and Laguna Madre (Dunton, 1994) , have recently undergone major declines in these important habitats. Declines in SAV are often associated with changes in the water quality of the ecosystems (Dennison et al., 1993) . Changes in coverage of SAV beds are important and may be useful in establishing indicators of future adverse impacts. Annual monitoring of individual SAV beds or discrete sites is needed to determine if incremental changes are a problem for Gulf of Mexico estuaries in general. Annual monitoring in conjunction with water quality monitoring can improve our understanding of the factors that affect SAV survival and distribution.\nThe SAVin the Escambia-Pensacola Bay System underwent a substantial decline in the late 1940s through the early 1970s (summarized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], Olinger et al., 1975) . Although scientific documentation of SAV distribution since that time is lacking, some observations suggest SAV growth in the oligohaline regions of estuaries in northwestern Florida has shown recent improvements (i.e., Mobile Bay, Escambia Bay and Perdido Bay: ]. Stout and W. Davis, pers. comm. and unpubl. data) . There is also evidence to suggest that these same areas are losing SAVin the euryhaline regions (Heck et al., 1996) . Improvement in water quality of the upper bay regions is thought to be leading to recovery of low salinity grasses such as Vallisnnia americana, whereas the continuing increases in coastal development in the lower bay region, with resulting increased nutrient input and sediment loading/resuspension, may be having an adverse impact on the health and productivity of high salinity grasses such as Thalassia testudinum.\nWater quality and the associated effects on light availability are generally considered to be the major factors related to SAV survival (e.g., Kenworthy and Haunert, 1991; Tomasko and Lapointe, 1991; Dennison et al., 1993; Stevenson et al., 1993) and depth of distribution (Dennison, 1987; Dawes and Tomasko, 1988; Duarte, 1991) . Duarte (1991) suggested a linear relationship between depth of colonization and the light attenuation coefficient. The ecological assessment team of the U.S. EPA Gulf Ecology Division (GED) initiated a water quality monitoring program and has been collecting data quarterly in the Escambia-Pensacola Bay System since May 1996. The location of the sampling stations is based on a probabilistic design that can be extrapolated to provide con- Gulf of Mexico Science, Vol. 18 [2000] ditions over the entire bay system. There were two objectives of this research; the first was to map the current distribution and condition of SAV beds at several sites in northwestern Florida relative to historical distributions, and the second was to examine the relationship between changes in SAV beds and changes in water quality in the study area. To accomplish these objectives, two techniques for mapping and monitoring SAV beds were initiated to link annual changes in SAV with changes in water quality. Understanding the relationship between water quality and SAV survival and distribution will improve predictive abilities for management purposes."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Aerial Mapping.-", "text": "The USGS National Wetlands Research Center in Lafayette, LA produced maps of SAV along much of the Gulf of Mexico on the basis of photo interpretation of aerial photographs (1: 24,000 resolution) taken in 1992.

Processing and classification followed the National Wetlands Inventory protocol (Cowardin et al., 1979) . Horizontal positional accuracy is within 12.2 m. Maps of the SAV in Escambia and Santa Rosa County based on those aerial photographic interpretations are included (Fig. 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Escambia River Delta visual survey in conjunction with differential global positioning system (DGPS)", "text": "mapping.-The survey of Escambia Bay was \u00b7conducted with a small boat piloted along the shoreline or along the visible edge of grass beds around the entire perimeter of Escambia Bay from the entrance of Bayou Texar to Garcon Point (Fig. 1) . In 1997, a Magellan\u00ae (Magellan Systems Corp., San Dimas, CA) handheld global positioning system was used to record the position of the edge of the grass beds and significant points such as corners, ends, and beginnings of beds. Accuracy of this system was estimated to be ::'::50 m. When necessary, grasses were collected by coring for identification (Tarver et al., 1978 (Fig. 2) . To monitor SAV beds in Pensacola Bay, Santa Rosa Sound, and Big Lagoon, a series of 10 sites was selected to measure the changes in the deepwater margin of the SAV beds. The sites were chosen to provide a general coverage of the existing SAV beds in the area monitored for water quality. Site selection was based on our best judgment in an attempt to select a range of impacted and unimpacted areas and to provide a range of responses to correlate with changes in water quality. When possible, sites were located along the margins of SAV beds where other research was, or is, being conducted.\nBecause SAV beds in Pensacola Bay, Santa Rosa Sound, and Big Lagoon are often found in water more than 2 m deep and are often not clearly visible from the surface, divers were used to mark the existing deepwater margins collected include hydrological measurements of salinity, pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen that were taken using a Hydrolab H20 Sonde\u00ae 1 (Hydrolab, Inc., Austin, TX) and measurements of light penetration at an interval of 1 m from the surface to the bottom. In addition, surface water samples were collected for measurement of dissolved inorganic nutrients, chlorophyll a, particulate carbon and nitrogen, and dissolved organic carbon and were filtered on site, frozen on dry ice for transport back to the laboratory, then stored at -70 C until analyzed. Ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, ortho-phosphate and silica concentrations were obtained with an Astoria Pacifica\u00ae autoanalyzer (Astoria Pacifica Inc., Calackamus, OR). Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) light measurements were determined with a LI-COR\u00ae LI-1000 digital data logger and light meter with dual quantum (2TI) light sensors (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE) and Secchi disc transparency depth. Light was measured simultaneously above the water surface (ambient light) and at intervals of 1 m from the surface to the bottom. The underwater sensor was lowered to just below the surface of the water, and the outputs from both the surface sensor and the underwater sensor were recorded. The underwater unit was lowered in 1-m intervals, repeating the process until the underwater sensor reached bottom. The depth of the bottom was recorded, and the process was repeat-ed as the underwater sensor was raised to the surface, providing two measurements at each depth. Intensity readings for each depth were averaged, and the attenuation coefficients for each depth were calculated with the use of the pairs of simultaneous readings of underwater and surface light intensity. A station for monitoring PAR light availability was established on the west dock of Sabine Island (near the center of the study area) in October 1996. Light was measured around noon, usually on a daily basis. These measurements also included simultaneous surface irradiation and underwater measurements as described above and provided some additional insight into short-term changes in light availability due to surface irradiation and water column attenuation."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Escambia Bay.-Maps of SAV coverage in Escambia Bay based those generated from the 1998 DGPS survey show an increase in SAV distribution when compared with the USGS maps from the 1992 aerial survey (Fig. 1) . Some of the areas where SAV margins increased by more than 10 m (alongshore or offshore) or beds that were not found in the USGS survey are marked in Figure lB .\nThe dominant SAV in Escambia Bay is V. americana Michaux, and from our observations, it is estimated to constitute greater than 80% of the total SAV. Ruppia martima L. was found in a well-established bed (solid coverage) southwest of the mouth of Escambia River, in patchy beds (less than 50% coverage) off the mouth of Indian and Trout Bayou on the east shore of Escambia Bay, and in sparse beds (less than 10% coverage) covering severallOO m 2 in Mulatte Bayou. The only other SAV observed in Escambia Bay was a Myrophyllum sp. L. that was found intermixed with V. americana in some of the beds in upper Escambia Bay. Most of the beds observed appeared healthy and without epiphytes, and many were flowering profusely. However, some of the smaller patches (less than 5 m across) were covered with epiphytes where there was a notable absence of gastropods. The major portion of the SAY in Escambia Bay is above the Interstate (I-10) Bridge. On the west side of the bay, only one V. americana bed less than 3 m across was identified south of the bridge. On the east side, only the R maritima near Indian and Trout Bayou was found below I-10.\nPensacola Bay, Santa Rosa Sound, Big Lagoon.-Pensacola Bay, Santa Rosa Sound, and Big Lagoon were part of the area surveyed by the USGS with aerial photography in 1992 (Fig. 2) . To date, the USGS survey may be the only complete survey of SAY in Santa Rosa Sound and Big Lagoon. The seagrass beds in this area are extensive and are populated mostly by T. testudinum and H. wrightii, although Syringodium filifonne Kutzing is interspersed (pers. obs.).\nResults of the first-year measurements of horizontal changes in the deepwater margins of selected T. testudinum and H. wrightii beds from Santa Rosa Sound, Pensacola Bay, and Big Lagoon are shown in Figure 3 . The measurements represent the distance that the margin of the bed changed relative to the individual markers deployed along the deepwater margins in 1997. Although 30 stakes were deployed at each site, there were several sites where one to three stakes were missing. New stakes were deployed to replace missing stakes along the current margin at those sites. Most of the seagrass beds showed increases in coverage (Table 1) . Only the seagrass bed at the Big Lagoon site had an overall decline (negative average) .\nThe maximum horizontal growth rate of T. testudinum observed for the 1-yr period in this study was 175 em at Deer Point; however, maximum horizontal growth of T. testudinum in most beds was between 40 and 90 em. For H. wrightii, the overall maximum horizontal growth rate observed in this study was 205 em at Fair Point, whereas the maximum horizontal growth of most beds was between 80 and 120 em. These maximum horizontal growth rates correspond to 0.48 cm\u00b7d-1 for T. testudinum and 0.56 cm\u00b7d-1 for H. wrightii. Using an average growth rate of 50 em observed at many of the beds, the average daily growth is approximately 0.14 cm\u00b7d-1 . These growth rates correspond to 270 m 2 \u2022 km -1 of grass bed perimeter in the east end of Santa Rosa Sound and 540 m 2 \u00b7km-1 in the west end of Santa Rosa Sound and Pensacola Bay. SAV beds are almost continuous on both sides of Santa Rosa Sound from Navarre to the west end of the sound. Assuming a linear edge of SAV on both sides of the sound over a distance of approximately 30 km, this represents a net increase in coverage of more than 1.6 hectares. Given the higher growth rate at the west end and including the SAV beds in Pensacola Bay, the total area of new coverage is probably closer to 2 hectares.\nLight.-The results of PAR light intensity readings from Sabine over the past 1.5 yr show periods of high ambient light (Fig. 4) and de- "}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "Gulf of Mexico Science, Vol. 18 [2000] creased water column light attenuation (Fig. 5 ) during the fall of 1997. The ambient light intensity (Fig. 4) also shows a sustained period of relatively low light during the winter and early spring of 1998. The light intensity at 1 m shows the same general pattern, with only a few days in the fall of 1997 having intensity below 400 J.Lmol\u00b7m-2 \u00b7s-1 and the winter/spring period having sustained periods below 400 J.Lmol\u00b7m-2 \u00b7s-1 . Attenuation coefficients at 1m, calculated from the light intensity measurements at Sabine Island (Fig. 5) , indicate that the water column transparency did not change much except for a significant decline in March 1998, which may be attributed to sediment-laden water from heavy rains and extremely high river discharge. The period of heavy rains was unusual in that surface salinity near this laboratory in Santa Rosa Sound was below five for several weeks. It is likely that most of the sites in this study were affected similarly considering the scale of these events. highest in Pensacola Bay near the area of high\u00b7 est growth (36 J.Lg\u00b7l-1 ), followed by Big Lagoon (8.9 ~J-g\u00b7l-1 ). Mean light at 1 m was lowest in Big Lagoon (400 J.Lmoles\u00b7m-2 \u00b7s-1 compared with more than 450 in other areas). Mean values for salinity were the same for all areas; however, the standard deviation of salinity measurements was more than twice as high in Big Lagoon and thus may not eliminate salinity as a contributing cause of decline in SAV in Big Lagoon. DISCUSSION Olinger et al. (1975) documented a signifi\u00b7 cant decline in SAVin Escambia Bay from the late 1940s through the early 1970s (Fig. 6) . Few surveys of the SAVin Escambia Bay have been conducted since 1975. The recent USGS and DGPS surveys document a significant improvement in SAV coverage relative to the last years of the report by Olinger et al. (1975) . Possible reasons for the decline of SAVin Escambia Bay observed by Olinger et al. (1975) high nutrient input as a primary cause. Since 1975, improvements in water quality have been achieved through improved wastewater treatment to both the municipal and industrial effluents that were cited in Olinger et al. (1975) . In that report, annual mean dissolved inorgan- Map of SAY distribution in Escambia Bay from Olinger et al. (1975) .\nmonitor SAV have their advantages and disadvantages. The maps of the decline of SAV beds in Olinger et al. (1975) were generated from black and white aerial photographs. More sophisticated geographic information systems (GIS) and photo interpretation techniques based on remote sensing or color photography are now used. Aerial photography and photo interpretation are relatively expensive and require sophisticated equipment and photo interpretative skills that are not widely available.\nConditions required to obtain suitable photographs can be restrictive. Processing of the data can require a significant period of time, and significant effort must be devoted to ground truthing. The area that can be mapped in this manner is extensive and it provides a valuable reference for the future. The accuracy of this technique is generally in the 3-5-m range (Art Calix, USGS, pers. comm.) but is dependent on the altitude of the photography. Robbins (1997) reported the accuracy in lo-cation of seagrass polygons in the range of 15-30 m based on 1:24,000 photography. Overall, aerial photography and photo interpretation provide a comprehensive assessment of SAV distribution, but this method is time consuming and expensive and requires specialized skills. The use of DGPS and direct observation can be limited by water depth and clarity if the grasses are not apparent from the surface. However, although most of the difference between the USGS map and the current map (Fig. 1) is probably because of increased growth of SAV; part of the difference may be attributed to an increased ability to see the submerged grass through the opaque water from the surface. The accuracy of DGPS is also in the 3-5-m range. If applied on an annual or biannual basis, it can provide an indication of trends on a time basis of 3-5 yr. It is not labor intensive: the entire Escambia Delta area was mapped in less than 3 days. This technique is best applied when the grasses are at their maximum growth (August-September) during low tides or periods of high water clarity and bright sunlight. One other technique that was considered for mapping of submerged grass beds was hydroacoustics, but this technique does not work well in shallow turbid waters (pers. comm.).\nThe idea to monitor SAV beds through the measurement of annual changes in the deepwater boundary was based on the concept that the maximum depth of plant survival is associated with the plants' light requirements, and this method incorporates all of the light-limiting factors (i.e., suspended sediments, epiphyte growth, and water column chlorophyll). The technique of marking the deepwater boundary and measuring change is limited in its applicability to systems that offer sufficient water clarity to allow divers to make measurements and in the area that can be covered. This technique is expected to provide accurate and timely information on the rate and direction of change and, depending on the geography and choice of sites, can be representative of larger areas. The accuracy of this technique is in the centimeter range, and the relatively large number of measurements provides a good estimate of variability. This technique does require the use of divers, but it does not require expensive equipment. Overall, it is not labor intensive because an individual site can be measured by two divers in less than 2 hr. More frequent measurements and additional parameters (i.e., epiphyte load) could also be made. The results in this study suggest that the method is useful in measuring small short-term changes that may be associated with changes in water quality and/ or light availability.\nWater column transparency is not the only factor that affects the availability of light to SAV. Light availability to the plant leaf can be affected by epiphytes which can be affected by grazers as well as nutrient availability. There were no measurements of epiphyte loads in the first year of this study, and it is possible that changes in the epiphyte loading may have contributed to changes seen here. An estimation of the epiphyte load is planned for future visits to the study sites. Other factors that can affect growth are stressors such as bioturbation (Valentine et al., 1994) , salinity, temperature and disease. Another factor that can affect the light availability to SAV is the total irradiance at the surface of the water. Total irradiance can be affected by climate factors such as cloud cover and atmospheric conditions. Changes in global climate may have significant positive or negative impacts on SAV growth because a heavy cloud cover can reduce surface irradiance by as much as 90%. Light intensity measurements made at Sabine Island over the past 2 yr (Figs. 4, 5) reflect both the water quality factors driven by nutrients, such as phytoplankton blooms, and those driven by climatic factors, such as changes in ambient light availability, wind driven resuspension, and riverborne turbidity. It is possible that the period of increased light availability in the fall of 1997 (Figs. 4, 5) is related to the increase in SAV growth in the Pensacola Bay-Santa Rosa Sound area. This assumption is based on the fact that cloudy conditions and reduced water transparency through much of the spring of 1998 do not appear to meet the minimum light requirements of T. testudinum (Fourqurean and Zieman, 1991) . It is expected that suggestions such as this can be tested statistically as the study continues. Fourqurean and Zieman (1991) have described the whole plant carbon budget for T. testudinum in Florida Bay and provided a measure of minimum light required to produce growth. On the basis of their irradiance curves, a midday irradiance of just over 200 JLmol\u00b7m-2 \u00b7s-1 is needed to provide a positive carbon budget. However, because T. testudinwn in this area has a dormant season, it is possible that grasses in northwestern Florida may require more light during the growing season to meet respiration requirements during the dormant season. On the basis of the regression formula for the depth of colonization and attenuation coefficient for T. testudinum given by Duarte (1991) , an attenuation coefficient of 1 m-1 should result in a colonization depth of approximately 1.87 m. This value is fairly close to the colonization depth found throughout most of Pensacola Bay and Santa Rosa Sound, and, as can be seen in Figure 5 , the average attenuation coefficient at 1 m was approximately 1 m-1 over the past year. There was a significant period in the fall of 1997 when the attenuation coefficient was less than 1 m-1 , which would therefore support growth at greater depths.\nThe technique of marking the deepwater SAV margin used in this study allows an accurate measurement of horizontal growth rates.\nOur annual growth rates in situ averaged 20-50 cm\u00b7yr-1 (0.05-0.15 cm\u00b7d-1 ) and are similar to in situ rates reported by Klady and Dunton (2000) in Texas where the growing season is similar. In microcosm experiments on effects of nutrient enrichment, Lapointe et al. (1994) reported horizontal growth rates for H. wrightii and T. testudinum of 0.11 and 0.06 cm\u00b7d-1, respectively, in control treatments and lower rates in nutrient treatments. Growth rates at several sites in this study exceed those reported by Lapointe et al. for controls. Tomasko and Lapointe (1991) reported an average growth rate of 0.4 cm\u00b7d-1 over a 5-wk period for T.\ntestudinum in outdoor aquaria with low nutrients. The maximum annual growth rate reported here is less than the daily rhizome growth rates reported by and Tomasko and Lapointe (1991) , however the growing season in this area is significantly shorter than in South Florida, where there is no dormant season (dormant season here is at least 4 mo). The summary of water quality data that has been collected quarterly for the past 2 yr from the local estuaries (Table 2 ) allows some insight into the driving forces affecting water column transparency. Grouping the mean growth rate of SAV beds for comparison with the water quality summary, the average growth for beds in the east end of Santa Rosa Sound (Naval Oaks, Tiger Point, Navarre, Big Sabine, and Range Point) was 27 cm\u00b7yr-1 , while mean P0 4 was 4.9 (\u00b13.9) j.Lg\u00b7l-1 . Phosphate was lower in the west end of Santa Rosa Sound (East and West Sabine and Deerpoint), 2.5 (\u00b14.0) j.Lg\u00b7l-1 , and the average growth was 53 cm\u00b7yr-1 . Total N was similar in the west and east ends of Santa Rosa Sound, 14 (\u00b130) and 13 (\u00b123) j.Lg\u00b7l-1 , respectively. In Big Lagoon, where the average SAV loss was 10.1 cm\u00b7yr-1, the total N was 74 (\u00b185) j.Lg\u00b7l-1 and P0 4 was 8.9 (\u00b12.3) j.Lg\u00b7l-1 \u2022 However, the growth at Fair Point (the only site in Pensacola Bay) was 57.4 cm\u00b7yr-1, whereas the mean P0 4 was 35.8 j.Lg\u00b7l-1 and the total N was 18 (\u00b130) j.Lg\u00b7l-1 \u2022 The use of more site-specific nutrient data should allow a more precise nutrient correlation at all sites. These initial values suggest that nutrients, especially total N, are correlated with changes in SAV beds in the Pensacola-Escambia Bay system; however, a longer term study and more comprehensive statistical analysis will provide insight for environmental management decisions.\nBig Lagoon is the only area with an overall loss in SAV coverage, and it has the highest average N0 2 -N0 3 (73 \u00b1 83 fLg\u00b7l-1 ) and lowest mean light at 1 m (400 \u00b1 294 j.1mol\u00b7m-2 \u00b7s-1 ). The Big Lagoon area was first reported to be in decline by Heck et al. (1996) . Reasons for the decline in Big Lagoon are unknown at this time; however, suggested causes include decreasing salinity, increasing nutrient input, and increasing turbidity (informal meeting in Pensacola, FL, held by Florida Department of Environmental Protection in 1998). Our data substantiate the decline reported by Heck et al.(1996) and suggest that nutrients and turbidity may at least in part explain this phenomenon. Housing development in this area may be contributing to changes in the salinity by increasing stormwater runoff or contributing to increased nutrient supply, but other physical factors such as the closing of an old channel and sediment resuspension from boat traffic may also be involved. Whether this SAV loss is because of changes in water clarity or other factors such as salinity change cannot be determined at this time. Further studies in this area are needed to determine the cause(s) of the loss.\nOver the longer term, this study is expected to improve our understanding of the relationship between water quality and SAV distribution and allow more significant correlations between water quality and SAV response to be established. At this time, the data do not allow significant trends to be established; however, this study does include important observations supporting the decline in SAV in Big Lagoon reported by Heck et al. (1996) along with water quality measurements that provide insight into possible causes. The overall positive values seen here indicate that the perception of loss of high-salinity SAV in this area may be true only in Big Lagoon."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The techniques described in this study offer a relatively simple means for assessing shortterm changes in SAV coverage on a timescale that can be associated with changes in water quality or ambient light availability. SAVin Escambia Bay, Pensacola Bay, and Santa Rosa Sound are showing significant improvements.

Big Lagoon was the only area we observed that showed a decline in SAV coverage; however, more research is needed to establish the cause of this decline.
