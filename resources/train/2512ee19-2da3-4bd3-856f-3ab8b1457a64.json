In Ohio, where breeding seaarguably a driving force behind changes in avian son densities of red-wings were once the highest species composition. For example, the clearing of any U.S. state or Canadian province (Dolbeer of U.S. forests east of the Mississippi River for agri -and Stehn 1979 -and Stehn , 1983 Dolbeer 1980) , breeding culture precipitated the demise of the passenger populations also have declined (2 % change/yr in pigeon (1:ctopiste.s migrc~torius; Schorger 1955) and contributed to the growth and expansion of members of the Icteridae, particularly the red-winged blackbird (Dolbeer and Stehn 1983) . Today, the red-\\tinged blackbird (hereafter red-wing) is 1 of the most abundant avian species in North America (Dolbeer and Stehn 1979, 1983; Dolbeer 1980; Beletsky 1996; Peterjohn et al. 1996) . Although its preferred breeding habitat is emergent marsh (Dyer 1970 , Dyer et al. 1972 , Beletsky 1996 , this species has successfully adapted to breeding in upland habitats, particularly managed grasslands, pasture, and fallow fields (Dyer 1970 , Dyer et al. 1972 , Robbins and Erskine 1975 . Moreover, Dyer et al. (1972) suggested that although marshes hold the highest densities of red-wings, expansive upland habitats provide a greater potential for redwing production and, thus, population growth. birds per route = -3.9, P < 0.0 1, 1966 Fig. 1; Sauer et al. 1997 ). Dolbeer and Stehn (1983) reported that from 1966 to 1981, a mean of 229 red-wings was seen per Ohio BBS route (n = 46). In contrast, from 198 1 to 1996, a mean of 104 redwings was seen per Ohio BBS route (n = 74). Given the serious economic consequences realized by farmers as a result of the rapid expansion of the red-wing into the agricultural niche and the species' damage to crops such as corn in Ohio, and rice (Oryza sativa) and sunflowers in other states ( [Helianthus annuus] Dyer 1967 , Weatherhead et al. 1980 , Clark et al. 1982 , Beletsky 1996 , Linz and Hanzel 1997 , identifylng factors contributing to the decline of the species in Ohio is important from both ecological and management perspectives. Besser et al. (1984) attributed declining numbers of breeding red-wings in the Dakotas ( 1965-198 1) to biennial precipitation that affected growth of emergent vegetation used for nesting, such as cattail (Typha sp.) and the amount of land under tillage (i.e., replacement of wetlands). Herkert (1994) examined the effects of habitat structure and area on bird species in grassland fragments in Illinois and found that red-wings were associated more with edge (not necessarily vegetation structure) and negatively affected by grassland area. O'Connor et al. (1999) used a geographical information system and regression tree analysis to model the effects of habitat characteristics (at the macroecological scale) on the distribution of 17 grassland bird species (not including red-wings) in the conterminous United States; strong associations were noted between species distribution and longterm annual precipitation, January and July temperatures, and agricultural land use. Most recently, Horn and Koford (2000) agricultural and climatic factors were not also closely tied to the negative trend for the Ohio red-wing population. Here, we examine the statistical relationship between BBS annual population indices for the red-~vinged blackbird in Ohio (1966 Ohio ( -1996 and 35 crop and climatic variables."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "We obtained our preliminary set of independent variables (Table l ) , which represent the predominant crop coverage (ha) harvested annually in Ohio (1965 Ohio ( -1996 , from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). The NASS statistics were available only as annual reported harvest and yield totals. Because habitat changes can affect population levels in a subsequent year, crop coverage variables were evaluated for each year prior to a BBS index for red-wings (i.e., 1965-1995) as well as each index year . We then selected 9 climatic variables (Table I) , also obtained from the NASS, for potential effects RED-WINGED BWCKBIKD DECLINE B f a~k~e I l and Dolbe~~. 663 on nest success (see Francis 197 1, Besser et al. 1984 , O'Connor et al. 1999 . Also, we used the mean annual January temperature (also used by O' Connor et al. 1999) in Alabama (1966 Alabama ( -1996 ; Southeast Regional Climate Center) as an index of potential climatic effects on red-wing survival in wintering areas in the southeastern United States (see Dolbeer 1978 Dolbeer , 1982 . Data relative to historic trends in wetland area in Ohio, representing potential breeding habitat for red-wings, were not available. A priori functions (i.e., testable candidate models) relating aspects of red-winged blackbird population indices to land-use data for Ohio also were not available. Therefore, we pursued our analysis in a conventional exploratory format, but guided our selection of candidate variables (above) and any combined functional relationships to BBS indices on the basis of biological relevance (see, however, Burnham and Anderson 1998). We first regressed (SAS Institute 1990) annual BBS breeding population indices (residuals from the predicted trend obtained by routeregression analysis; Geissler and Sauer 1990) for red-wings in Ohio from 1966 to 1996 (Sauer et al. 1997) on each of 26 crop and 9 climatic factors ( Table 1) . The BBS encompasses approxin~ately 3,700 randomly located survey routes (39.4 km each) throughout the continental United States, southern Canada, and Alaska that are surveyed annually in June (Peterjohn and Sauer 1993) . Each route has 50 stops (at 0.8-km intervals), at which all birds seen within 0.4 km or heard at any distance are tallied during a 3-min point count (Robbins et al. 1986 ). Variables were retained as potential independent variables if K~ 2 0.1 at a I 0.05. We then regressed the breeding population indices on the retained variables using stepwise linear regression (SAS Institute 1990). Variables were considered 1 by 1 and entered the model if the Fstatistic was significant at the 0.5 level (SAS default level selected arbitrarily). As each variable I$-as added to the model, the STEPWISE option evaluated all model variables and retained only those producing an F statistic significant at the 0.05 level. We used partial regression residual plots to further corroborate the functional relationship between each variable examined in the stepwise procedure and the red-wing breeding population trend. We investigated potential interactions between variables retained in the final of variables in the model, however, was dependent first on their biological relevance and second on the variance explained (see below)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "In the initial regression of red-wing BBS indices on each of 35 habitat and climatic variables, 17 habitat variables were retained ( Table  2 ). Variables that pertained to the respective areas of soybeans and oats (Auena satiua, A. byzantina) harvested annually ; n = 4 variables) had R~ values ranging from 0.72 to 0.85 and exhibited strong, but biologically questionable (see below), effects in the stepwise analysis. Therefore, we did not include the 4 variables that pertained to soybeans and oats individually in the model, but rather as components of other variables (Table 2) . Specifically, although the planting of soybeans in Ohio reduced potential breeding habitat for red-wings, the effects of this loss of area on the red-wing breeding population must be considered relative to planting practices. For example, the area of soybeans harvested annually exhibited a negative correlation coefficient with redwing population indices of -0.9 , increased at an exponential rate of 2.5% per year, and represented on average 34.3% (SD = 5.4) of total crop area in Ohio. However, soybeans are interchanged regularly with corn-which composed the greatest amount of the total crop area harvested annually in Ohio (1966-1996)-but was not retained as a variable in the initial regression.\nAlthough the Ohio corn crop exhibited a 0.6% decrease in area harvested annually , it represented 35.7% (SD = 2.7) of total crop area for the same period. Further, no difference (ttest assuming unequal variances: t = 0.94, df = 57, P = 0.35) occurred between mean area of corn harvested annually (1,435,532 ha; SD = 164,832) and that of soybeans ( 1,384,460 ha; SD = 252,003).\nAs for our omission of the 2 variables pertaining to oats from the stepwise analysis, the effect of these variables on the regression was more statistical than biological. Although the area of oats (a food source for red-wings) harvested annually exhibited a positive correlation coefficient with the red-wing breeding population trend indices of 0.9, oats represented on average only 3.4% (SD = 1.9) of the total area of crops harvested annually in Ohio.\nStepwise linear regression of the population indices on the remaining 17 variables resulted in a model ( R~ = 0.88, mean square error = 2.1% of total error, F = 48.4, P = 0.0001) that contained 4 variables ( Fig. 2; Table 3 ); we noted no interactions between variables. Each year, the area of non-alfalfa hay harvested, the combined area of corn and soybeans harvested, the area of nonalfalfa hay cut by 30 May of the index year , and the area of hay (all types) cut by 30 May of the year prior to the index (i.e., 1965-1995) best explained the variance in the breeding population trend of red-wings in Ohio. However, the area of non-alfalfa hay harvested and the combined area of corn and soybeans harvested were correlated ( r = -0.50, df = 29, critical value = 0.355), thus bringing into question the relative importance of the 2 variables to the model. Still, the correlation between the area of nonalfalfa hay harvested and the combined area of corn and soybeans harvested was expressed (upon the addition of the corn and soybean variable to the stepwise procedure) only as an inflation of the regression coefficient of the non-alfalfa hay variable (21.5%) and its standard error (4.6%). Otherwise, all variables evaluated in the procedure, as well as the 4 variables retained, maintained correct algebraic signs relative to their anticipated effects on the dependent variable. Further, all variables evaluated or retained in the model exhibited significant results when tested individually (see above). Table 3 . Final model (R2 = 0.88, F = 48.4, P = 0.0001) resulting from stepwise linear regression of North American Breeding Bird Survey population indices for the red-winged blackbird in Ohio, USA (1 966-1996) on 17 crop variables (see Table 2 ). The first variable in the model-the area of nonalfalfa hay harvested in Ohio ( 1966-1 996)-represented on average 8.5% (SD = 1.9) of total crop area harvested and decreased by 2.1% per year (Fig. 3a) . The combined area of corn and soybeans (1966-1 996) represented on average 70.0% (SD = 4.4) of total crop area harvested and increased by 1 .O% per year (Fig. 3b) . Next, the area of non-alfalfa hay cut by 30 May of the index year fluctuated widely ( 2 = 34,400 ha; SD = 3 1,600; Fig.  4a ) but represented on average only 0.9% (SD = 0.8) of total crop area harvested. Further, the total area of hay cut by 30 May of the year prior to the red-wing index also fluctuated widely (2 = 92,300 ha; SD = 73,700; Fig. 4b ) and represented on average 2.3% (SD = 1.8) of total crop area."}, {"section_title": "Partial", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Our analysis revealed a relationship between the breeding population indices of the red-winged blackbird (1 966-1996) , a facultative grassland species (Vickery et al. 1999) , and Ohio agricultural practices. Further, in addition to explaining some aspects of the variance associated with the red-wing breeding population trend, our regression model is biologically realistic. Specifically, the decrease in the area of non-alfalfa hay harvested annually likely has reduced the availability of q~iality nesting habitat. Also, I\\-hereas corn attracts potential insect prey for red-wings-as well as representing a source of energy during the \"milk\" stage (Dolbeer 1980 )-both corn and soybeans (soybeans are not a food source for red-wings) are ill-suited for nesting. The combined area of corn and soybeans harvested annually in Ohio represented on average 70% of the crop coverage from 1966 to 1996 (i.e., >2.8 million ha). Similarly, wide fluctuations in the annual area of non-alfalfa hay and total hay cut by 30 May, both in the year prior to and a current reproductive year, likely disrupted nesting and subsequent reproductive success (for data relative to effects of hay mowing on nesting of grassland birds, see Warner and Etter 1989, Warner 1994) .\nImportantly, our results support hypotheses regarding the effects of changing land-use practices on grassland avifauna populations. For example, Dyer et al. ( 1972) suspected that since the expansion of red-wing populations into upland habitats, a regulatory link has been established with land-use practices in the agricultural community. However, nearly 3 decades earlier, Moseley (1947) noted that advances in mecha-nized farming (e.g., the \"alfalfa mill\") allowed farmers to process hay early and in quantity, thereby disrupting habitat and nesting of grassland bird species in the north-central United States. Several authors have suggested that the following changes have contributed to the declines in grassland avifauna: (1) transition over the last century from farms 14th structurally diversified habitats containing cool-season grasses and legumes to monocultures of alfalfa and other row-crops, (2) fragmentation of remaining grasslands, and (3) earlier mowing of hay (Warner and Etter 1989; Warner 1992 Warner , 1994 Johnson and Schwartz 1993; Herkert et al. 1996; Dale et al. 1997) . Similarly, changing patterns of agriculture in the forms of increased mechanization, narrowing crop complexity and timing of rotations, and increased cereal (Gramineae) acreage have also been associated with declining numbers of avian species once conlmon in the fields and edge associated with farms in Great Britain (O'Connor and Shrubb 1986, Gregory and Baillie 1998) .\nIn Ohio, dramatic changes in the landscape occurred from 1910 to 1977, with the human population increasing from 4.7 to over 10.7 million and metropolitan complexes, towns, and villages growing as well (Trautman 1977) . Since 1915, Ohio farmers have become more mechanized, increased field size by a factor of 3 or more, and began using chemical fertilizers, herbicides, and insecticides. By 1975, the Ohio farmer began specializing, limiting crops grown to only 1 or 2 varieties and, in some cases, planting the same crop in the same field over several years (Trautman 1977) . Peterjohn (1989) noted that intense urbanization and population expansion in Ohio over the last century, combined with mechanized agricultural practices and use of chemicals in farming (e.g., herbicides), produced an overall loss of traditional and nontraditional nesting habitat, resulting in a decrease in avian species diversity and richness. We suggest, therefore, that our findings demonstrate a plausible hypothesis for the decline of this abundant bird in Ohio. Specifically, the red-~vinged blackbird has been negatively affected by the decline in hay production, earlier mowing of hay, and the increase in row crops-a scenario synonymous with the plight of less numerous grassland bird species."}, {"section_title": "MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS", "text": "Our results suggest that the red-winged blackbird, a species that has shown remarkable adaptability to human-induced habitat changes (Dolbeer 1990), has been negatively affected by the increasing efficiency and narrowing diversin. of modern agricultural practices in Ohio. Further, the decline in the red-wing population may be perceived as a positive event by Ohio corn producers (Dolbeer 1990) , as well as those in the sunflower industry (Linz and Hanzel 1997) . However, the agricultural practices that have precipitated the red-wing's decline in Ohio likely have had more severe effects on other, less common grassland species, such as the upland sandpiper (Bartrlzmia longicatida) and grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannnrum; see trends in Sauer et al. 1997 ). Thus, our findings lend support to efforts like the Conservation Reserve Program (see Johnson and Schwartz 1993) . illoreover, particularly in the United States, farming traditionally has represented not only a means of feeding our nation and others, but a system of stewardship for wildlife and other natural resources associated with agricultural lands. We therefore concur with recent research recommendations (Herkert et al. 1996 , Dale et al. 1997 , Horn and Koford 2000 that within the CRP and on other lands, management regimes (including mowing, burning, and grazing) should be modified by area, season, and annual rotation to increase opportunity for successful reproduction of grassland avifauna."}]
