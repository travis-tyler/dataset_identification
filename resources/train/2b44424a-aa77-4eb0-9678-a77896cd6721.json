[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "We examined longitudinal associations between the apolipoprotein E 4 allele (ApoE4 \u03e9 status) and several cognitive outcomes and tested effect modification by sex. Data on 644 non-Hispanic Caucasian adults, from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) were used. Dementia onset, cognitive impairment and decline were assessed longitudinally. After 27.5 years median follow-up, 113 participants developed dementia. ApoE4 \u03e9 predicted dementia significantly (hazard ratio [HR] \u03ed 2.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.93-4.33), with nonsignificant sex differences. Taking all time points for predicting cognition, women had significantly stronger positive associations than men between ApoE4 \u03e9 status and impairment or decline on the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT; delayed recall and List A total recall) and on Verbal Fluency Test-Categories. This ApoE4 \u03eb sex interaction remained significant with Bonferroni correction only for CVLT-delayed recall. Taking time points prior to dementia for cognitive predictions, the positive association between impairment in CVLT-delayed recall and ApoE4 \u03e9 status remained stronger among women, though only before Bonferroni correction. While ApoE4\u03e9 status appears to be a sex neutral risk factor for dementia, its association with verbal memory and learning decline and impairment was stronger among women.

Despite general consistency in the related findings, some studies found no association or an inverse association between ApoE4 \u03e9 status and poor cognitive performance, while others indicated a positive association between ApoE4 \u03e9 status and poor cognition only among dementia patients (Kim et al., 2002; Riley et al., 2000; Small et al., 2000; Smith et al., 1998; Winnock et al., 2002; Yip et al., 2002) . Moreover, it is unclear whether this excess risk ascribed to ApoE4 \u03e9 status is specific to certain cognitive domains over others, and whether this association is differentially modified by sex.\nMultiple studies have found associations between the ApoE4 \u03e9 status and impairment or decline of episodic memory, particularly delayed recall (Bondi et al., 1995; Chey et al., 2000; Hyman et al., 1996; Jorm et al., 2007; Lehmann et al., 2006; Luczywek et al., 2002; Nilsson et al., 2006; Packard et al., 2007) . This allele may also adversely influence verbal ability (Mortensen and Hogh, 2001) , executive functioning (Chey et al., 2000; Romero et al., 2002; Swan et al., 2005) , perceptual/psychomotor speed and visuo-spatial skill (Blair et al., 2005; Jorm et al., 2007; O'Hara et al., 2008; Packard et al., 2007) , in addition to global cognition (Berr et al., 1996; Bretsky et al., 2003; Bunce et al., 2004; Kuller et al., 1998; Sawyer et al., 2009; Slooter et al., 1998; Winnock et al., 2002) . Moreover, while a number of those studies had a cross-sectional or case-control design, among 25 recent longitudinal studies, 21 had a follow-up of less than 10 years (Aggarwal et al., 2005; Blair et al., 2005; Brayne et al., 1996; Bretsky et al., 2003; Bunce et al., 2004; Feskens et al., 1994; Henderson et al., 1995; Hoyt et al., 2005; Hyman et al., 1996; Jonker et al., 1998; Lam et al., 2006; Martinez et al., 1998; Molero et al., 2001; Packard et al., 2007; Payami et al., 1997; Qiu et al., 2006; Romero et al., 2002; Swan et al., 2005; Wilson et al., 2002; Winnock et al., 2002; Yaffe et al., 1997) . Moreover, study populations were relatively small in the majority of these longitudinal studies with 8 out of 25 having baseline sample sizes of less than 300 participants (Aggarwal et al., 2005; Brayne et al., 1996; Hoyt et al., 2005; Lam et al., 2006; Martinez et al., 1998; Mortensen and Hogh, 2001; Romero et al., 2002; Swan et al., 2005) .\nTwo cross-sectional and several longitudinal studies have specifically or additionally examined ApoE4 \u03e9 status and sex interactions in relation to cognition or dementia risk (Hyman et al., 1996; Lehmann et al., 2006; Martinez et al., 1998; Molero et al., 2001; Mortensen and Hogh, 2001; Payami et al., 1997; Swan et al., 2005) and an earlier meta-analysis indicated that sex was potentially an effect modifier in the ApoE genotype-Alzheimer's disease (AD) association (Farrer et al., 1997) . Moreover, experimental and neurobiological evidence suggests that ApoE4 \u03e9 status may play a greater role in the neurodegenerative process among women than among men (Fleisher et al., 2005; Juottonen et al., 1998; Villasana et al., 2006) . Thus far, no long term large prospective cohort study has specifically examined the possible effect modification by sex for the association of ApoE genotypes with incident dementia, as well as decline and impairment in specific neuropsychological domains of cognition.\nIn the present study, we examined whether the risks of cognitive impairment, cognitive decline, and dementia in older adults were associated with the ApoE 4 allele. In particular, we investigated effect modification by sex for the association between the 4 allele and cognitive outcomes and whether certain domains were more likely to be affected than others by this putative interaction."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data were obtained from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). Initiated in 1958, the BLSA is an ongoing prospective open cohort study of communitydwelling, generally highly educated, upper to middle class adults with a total enrollment of 3005 (N 1 ) participants aged 17-97 years (60.1% men) (Shock et al., 1984) . Participants undergo medical and psychological examinations, including neuropsychological testing, a neurological examination, and medical history and physical examination; the details and exclusionary criteria have been summarized elsewhere (Zonderman et al., 1995) . In the present study, participants were eligible for analyses only when they had at least 1 visit at or beyond age 50 years and when they were at risk for dementia (N 2 \u03ed 2321).\nApoE genotyping was performed on consecutive series of participants selected in 2 phases based on funding at the time, the first selecting participants 60 years or older and the second selecting 400 participants of any age. Among the eligible sample (N 2 \u03ed 2321), ApoE genotypes were available for 724 eligible participants. Additionally, only nonHispanic Caucasians (N 3 \u03ed 644) were included because associations between ApoE4 \u03e9 status and dementia risk or cognition may differ between Caucasian and other ethnicities (Farrer et al., 1997; Sawyer et al., 2009 ). The numbers of eligible participants with complete genetic and cognitive test data varied between 515 for Trails B and 640 for Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT) (median frequency of repeated measurements ranged between 14 and 15), when all time points were considered for predictions.\nBeyond the last visit per individual, 237 deaths occurred (162 men and 75 women) in the non-Hispanic Caucasian sample with complete ApoE genotypes (N 3 \u03ed 644). Mean ages at death and standard deviations (SD) among participants who died (n 3 \u03ed 237) was 86.1 years (SD \u03ed 7.8) for men and 88.6 years (SD \u03ed 8.0) for women (p \u03fd 0.05, based on t test with 1 df)."}, {"section_title": "Clinical evaluation of dementia", "text": "All participants were followed annually and were reviewed at a consensus conference if their Blessed Information Memory Concentration score (Blessed et al., 1968) was \u0546 4, if their informant or subject Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) (Morris, 1997) score was \u0546 0.5, or if their Dementia Questionnaire (DQ) (Kawas et al., 1994) was abnormal. Dementia diagnosis was determined according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd Ed., Revised (DSM-III-R; American Psychiatric Association, 1987) criteria. Year of dementia onset was estimated based on consecutive case conference findings. A diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was made when participants had either single domain cognitive impairment (usually memory), or cognitive impairment in multiple domains without any significant functional loss in activities of daily living (ADLs), following the Petersen algorithm (Petersen, 2004) . In our present analysis, MCI cases were retained in the \"at risk for dementia\" group. Diagnoses of dementia type were formulated during multidisciplinary evaluations based on prospectively collected evidence using National Institute of Neurological and Communication Dis-orders-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria (McKhann et al., 1984) . Secondary analyses were also conducted in which the outcomes were incident MCI and AD."}, {"section_title": "Cognitive assessment", "text": "A battery of 5 cognitive tests were used, namely Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein et al., 1975), Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT; , California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) List A and delayed recall score , verbal fluency tests, both letter (VFT-L; Spreen and Benton, 1969) and category (VFT-C; , and Trails A and B ) (see Appendix A). Linear mixed models with a quadratic age term (to allow for nonlinear age effects) were used to predict their values at specific ages, particularly mean individual age at follow-up prior to the onset of dementia or prior to the end of follow-up, and to predict the slope for annual cognitive change at that particular age. The latter can be interpreted as the annual rate of change in the cognitive score between ages 50 and the mean age of follow-up per individual and cognitive test (see Appendix B). Using quintiles, the poorest performance ('cognitive impairment') or steepest 'cognitive decline' were determined and compared with all other quintiles combined. Additionally, the continuous scores ('cognitive function') and rates of 'cognitive change' were also considered as cognitive outcomes in a separate set of analyses."}, {"section_title": "ApoE genotypes", "text": "ApoE genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification of leukocyte DNA followed by HhaI digestion and product characterization, a process described by Hixson and Vernier (Hixson and Vernier, 1990) .

In addition, first visit blood pressure (systolic and diastolic in mm Hg), plasma total and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose (in mg/dL) were only analyzed in relation to ApoE4 status and sex for descriptive purposes, given their higher proportion with missing data compared with the self-reported conditions."}, {"section_title": "Data analysis", "text": "Means of continuous measures across categorical variables were tested using t test and 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Associations between categorical variables were examined with the 2 test. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests were used to compare the number of incident dementia cases by ApoE4 status (Freedman, 1982) . In addition, dose-response to the number of 4 allele in the ApoE genotype (none vs. 1 [i.e., 2/4 or 3/4]; none vs. 2 [i.e., 4/4]) was assessed using a Log-rank test with its associated p-value for trend for the total eligible population. Cox proportional hazards (PH) models were conducted to assess risk of dementia associated with ApoE4 \u03e9 status, stratifying by sex, and controlling for potentially confounding covariates. The dependent measure was age at onset of dementia or the last observed (censored) age of nondiagnosed participants (Cox, 1972) . Moreover, predicted values of cognitive scores and associated slopes from multivariate linear mixed models with a quadratic age term added-controlling for selected demographic and lifestyle factors-were obtained at mean age when cognitive tests were conducted, taking all time available time points in 1 predictive model and time points prior to onset of dementia in another (see Appendix B). Further, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to examine the association between ApoE4 \u03e9 status and significant cognitive decline or impairment (\u03fd20th percentile of cognitive change or predicted cognitive score at mean age of followup, except for BVRT, Trails A and B, where the cutpoint was the 80th percentile). As a sensitivity analysis, we conducted ordinary least square (OLS) multivariate regression models to assess the association between ApoE4 status and cognitive function or annual rate of cognitive change as continuous outcomes, controlling for the same covariates as for the logistic models.\nA type I error of 0.05 was considered for all analyses, and p-values between 0.05 and 0.10 were considered as borderline significant. To assess interaction between ApoE4 status and sex, a separate model was conducted (either Cox PH model or logistic regression) in which sex was included among the main effects and an ApoE4 \u03eb sex interaction term was examined for both direction and statistical significance. Assuming that a type I error for interaction of 0.05 is statistically significant for each of the 8 tests, Bonferroni correction was carried out to set that type I error to 0.05/8 \u03ed 0.00625. All analyses were performed using Stata version 10.0 (STATA, 2007) ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Among the 644 eligible non-Hispanic Caucasian participants who were at risk of dementia starting at age 50 and had available genotype data, the distribution of ApoE genotypes was 2/2 \u03ed 2; 2/3 \u03ed 83; 2/4 \u03ed 10; 3/3 \u03ed 387; 3/4 \u03ed 147; and 4/4 \u03ed 15. There were 113 incident dementia cases with an incidence rate of 707 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI), 588 -850). Median follow-up time was 27.5 years. Ninety-four of the 113 dementia cases (83%) had died by the end of follow-up in 2006 (60 men and 34 women). Sixty-one of the total eligible population (n \u03ed 644) were diagnosed as incident MCI by the end of follow-up and were retained in the risk set in the analysis for dementia risk. Among incident dementia cases that were retained in our analysis (n \u03ed 113), 76 were differentially diagnosed as AD.\nNon-Hispanic Caucasian eligible study participants with complete genetic data (n \u03ed 644), were generally younger (mean \u03ee SD first-visit age: 54.7 \u03ee 16.0 vs. 59.2 \u03ee 16.3) and healthier compared with the eligible non-Hispanic Caucasian BLSA subpopulation without genetic data (n \u03ed 1274) in terms of first visit current smoking status (17.7% vs. 25.6%), body mass index (24.6 \u03ee 3.3 vs. 25.1 \u03ee 3.4), and some self-reported comorbid conditions (e.g., type 2 diabetes [1.6% vs. 3.6%] and hypertension [30.3% vs."}, {"section_title": "40.8%])", "text": ", and had a higher proportion of women (42.9% vs. 28.1%) (p \u03fd 0.05 based on 2 or t test) (data not shown). Men and women positive for the 4 allele (ApoE4 \u03e9 ) had a similar sociodemographic and metabolic profile as those who were ApoE4\n\u03ea . Incidence proportion of dementia was significantly higher among ApoE4 \u03e9 compared with ApoE4 \u03ea genotypes in women (26.2% vs. 13.0%; p \u03fd 0.05 based on 2 test) but not in men. However, comparing men to women's profiles, women had a significantly higher proportion with ApoE4 \u03e9 status (31.2% vs. 23.5%), they were less educated, less likely to be former or current smokers, were older at first visit (mean age 58.1 years [SD, 14.0] vs. 52.3 years [SD, 16.8] among men), had a significantly lower mean first visit BMI, but a higher proportion obese, and had a generally better metabolic profile than men in terms of diastolic blood pressure, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and fasting glucose levels at first visit (Table 1) . Fig. 1 shows Kaplan-Meier survival curves of incident dementia by ApoE4 \u03e9 status with time starting at age 50 years. In the total population, cumulative incidence of dementia was significantly higher among ApoE4 \u03e9 compared with ApoE4\n\u03ea participants particularly by age 75. The log rank test for equality of survivor functions indicated that the divergence between the 2 curves was statistically significant (p \u03fd 0.05). Modeling instantaneous hazard functions against ApoE4 \u03e9 status and controlling for potential confounders-namely sex, first-visit age, educational attainment, smoking status, self-reported comorbid conditions (see section on covariates), and firstvisit body mass index-using Cox PH models yielded a hazard ratio (HR) for dementia by ApoE4 \u03e9 status of 2.89 with a 95% CI of 1.93-4.33. Both survivor functions and Cox models indicated a stronger relationship with ApoE4 \u03e9 status among women compared with men (HRs: 4.36 with 95% CI, 2.21-8.61 among women vs. 2.42 with 95% CI, 1.39 -4.22 among men), though effect modification by sex was not statistically significant (p \u03ed 0.219 for ApoE4 \u03eb sex interaction term in a model including sex among main effects). A secondary analysis in which ApoE4 status was replaced with ApoE2 status (at least 1 2 allele vs. other ApoE genotypes) did not show evidence of an association between the 2 allele and dementia risk (HR \u03ed 0.99 with a 95% CI, 0.58 -1.68). Another secondary analysis in which the outcome was incident AD (n \u03ed 75 cases) and exposure was ApoE4 \u03e9 status, showed even greater homogeneity of HRs between men and women (HR \u03ed 2.53 with a 95% CI, 1.30 -4.95 for men and HR \u03ed 2.82 with a 95% CI, 1.33-5.94 for women) and p \u03ed 0.59 for ApoE4 \u03eb sex interaction. However, when incident MCI was considered as the outcome of interest, there was no significant association observed with ApoE4 status for men or women (data not shown). Failure is defined as first incidence of dementia at or after age 50.

Moreover, using a similar methodology in including all time points to predict cognitive outcomes at mean age of follow-up, significant sex interaction with ApoE4 \u03e9 status was found for impairment in CVLT delayed recall (p \u03ed 0.005), CVLT List A (p \u03ed 0.020), VFT-C (p \u03ed 0.030), and for decline in CVLT delayed recall (p \u03ed 0.001), and CVLT list A (p \u03ed 0.022); the associations being stronger among women. After Bonferroni correction, significance of ApoE4 \u03eb sex interaction was retained only for decline and impairment in CVLT (delayed recall). No significant sex differences were noted for other binary cognitive outcomes, particularly after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Additionally, although sex differences were noted in many continuous cognitive outcomes (i.e., using multivariate OLS regression; 6 out of 16), including CVLT, none remained significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (Table 2) .\nExcluding cognitive data from assessments administered after some participants developed dementia for cognitive predictions (Table 3 ), ApoE4 \u03e9 status had a stronger positive association with impairment in CVLT (delayed recall) among women compared with men. Bonferroni correction, however, indicated that this interaction term was not significant taking into account multiple testing. Moreover, both men and women were at significantly or borderline significant increased risk of global cognitive decline (i.e., in MMSE) with ApoE4 \u03e9 compared with ApoE4 \u03ea , although this positive association was significant for BVRT decline only among women, without appreciable ApoE4 \u03eb sex interaction."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The current study assembles a large and long term prospectively assessed sample to test the association between genetic factors and dementia risk as well as cognitive im- \u03e9 status had a stronger positive association with impairment in CVLT (delayed recall) among women compared with men. Bonferroni correction, however, indicated that this interaction term was not significant after taking into account multiple testing.\nDespite the strength of the association between ApoE4 \u03e9 status and dementia risk, the literature is equivocal about its relation to cognitive function, impairment, or decline. This apparent inconsistency is due to several factors. Aside from their relatively smaller sample sizes (\u03fd300 participants at first visit), their case-control or cross-sectional designs, or short follow-up periods (\u03fd10 years), a large portion of null studies (Riley et al., 2000; Small et al., 2000; Smith et al., 1998; Winnock et al., 2002; Yip et al., 2002) have evaluated only overall cognitive status. Furthermore, unlike our study which used logistic regression models with cognitive decline and impairment as outcomes, these studies used linear statistical models for the most part. On the other hand, a wealth of evidence supports the presence of sex differences in the associations between cognitive deficits and ApoE4 \u03e9 status. For instance, Molero et al. (2001) and Payami et al. (1997) found an increased risk of familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women carriers of the 4 allele but not in men carriers. In a third study, women had a 2-fold increased risk of AD compared with men among relatives of 4 carriers, but not among relatives of noncarriers (Martinez et al., 1998) . In another study, 4 carrier women but not men had steeper cognitive decline in performance intelligence quotient (IQ) and 3 performance subtests (digit symbol, block design, and object assembly) compared with noncarriers (Mortensen and Hogh, 2001 ). This finding was also replicated by another study, though the main domain of interest was the development of impairment in delayed recall task (Hyman et al., 1996) . Swan and a Cognitive scores were predicted at mean age at follow-up prior to onset of dementia using a multivariate linear mixed model controlling for sex, race/ethnicity, education (years), and smoking status, with age added among the fixed effect variables to allow for quadratic nonlinear change. The lowest quintile in the total population with data on this test was considered as \"cognitive impairment\" for most tests except BVRT, Trails A and B where the highest quintile was considered as impairment. The slope or annual rate of change was also predicted from these models at the mean age at follow-up (i.e., between age 50 and individual mean age of follow-up for each cognitive test).

In addition, a cross-sectional study by Lehmann and colleagues indicated that among women, heterozygous ApoE genotype 3/4 was associated with cognitive impair- a Cognitive scores were predicted at mean age at follow-up prior to onset of dementia using a multivariate linear mixed model controlling for sex, race/ethnicity, education (years), and smoking status, with age added among the fixed effect variables to allow for quadratic nonlinear change. The lowest quintile in the total population with data on this test was considered as \"cognitive impairment\" for most tests except BVRT, Trails A and B where the highest quintile was considered as impairment.

In our study, there was no statistically significant sex difference in the ApoE4 status-dementia association in contrast to that found for decline and cognitive impairment in delayed verbal memory and learning. This may be due to either of the following: (1) a lack of statistical power to detect significant interactions in the Cox PH model; (2) domains other than verbal memory and learning needed to diagnose dementia did not show sex differences in the ApoE4 statuscognitive outcome association; or (3) sex differences in the ApoE4 status-cognitive outcome associations (other than dementia) were inverse to the hypothesized direction for some cognitive tests such as Trails A impairment (i.e., ApoE4 \u03e9 status was positively associated with Trails A impairment only among men). Finally, most large studies reported in the literature have observed a positive association between ApoE4 \u03e9 status and poorer performance on tests of overall cognitive status, episodic memory, and executive functioning. The present study shows that this association also includes verbal learning and category fluency as well as visual short-term memory and constructional ability. ApoE genotype has been associated with a wide spectrum of neurobiological factors known to be implicated in dementia: beta-amyloid deposition, tangle formation, oxidative stress, lipid homeostasis dysregulation, synaptic plasticity loss, and cholinergic dysfunction (Cedazo-Minguez, 2007) . Sex and ApoE genotypes both may affect the distribution and covariance between plasma lipids and apolipoproteins. Specifically, the heterogeneity in the plasma lipid-apolipoprotein correlation coefficients between ApoE4 \u03e9 and ApoE4 \u03ea groups was shown to be more significant among women than among men (Reilly et al., 1994) . Moreover, females seem to be more efficient at using apolipoprotein E for redistributing myelin cholesterol during nerve repair (Poirier, 1994) . Additionally, both animal and human studies demonstrate that the hippocampus, a brain region involved in memory, may be differentially affected by sex and ApoE4 \u03e9 status. For instance, in experimental studies on rats, females that were ApoE4 \u03e9 compared with those who were ApoE4 \u03ea took more trials to criterion on a passive avoidance test designed to measure hippocampal integrity (Villasana et al., 2006) . Among humans, the hippocampal volumes of ApoE4 \u03e9 early AD women were 45% smaller compared with sex-matched controls, and encountered a 10% greater reduction in volume compared with early AD men (Juottonen et al., 1998) . Furthermore, women with MCI and heterozygous for the 4 allele had smaller hippocampal volumes compared with ApoE4 \u03ea women, but similar reductions were found only in homozygous (4/4) MCI men (Fleisher et al., 2005) . Taken together, these findings suggest an interplay between various plasma lipids and apolipoproteins, particularly among women, may be mediating the association between ApoE genotype and cognitive decline. However, further studies are needed to confirm the mechanisms in the ApoE4 \u03eb sex interactions. By contrast, some studies suggest that sex-specific differences in longevity, perhaps involving ApoE, could determine who is available for cognitive evaluation. Thus, early ascertainment of dementia or cognitive decline (e.g., between ages 50 and 80) should be made to examine real sex differences in the effect of ApoE genotype on cognition, excluding the potential competing risk of death which is higher among men and among ApoE4 \u03e9 individuals (Corder et al., 1995) . Restricting the mean age of follow-up at which cognitive function and rate of cognitive change was predicted to \u054587 years (mean age at death for men and women combined), we found that significant ApoE4 \u03eb sex interaction at an alpha level of 0.05 was retained for most tests, particularly in the case of CVLT-delayed recall cognitive decline (p \u03ed 0.001). This interaction remained significant even after adding the variable (status \u03ed 1 if dead by end of follow-up; status \u03ed 0 if alive by end of follow-up). Finally, in addition to the previous 2 restrictions and adjustments, we conducted a 2-stage Heckman selection model (Heckman, 1979) in which an inverse mills ratio was added to the logistic regression model to account for sample selectivity in terms of baseline sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-related variables, an approach we had applied elsewhere (Beydoun et al., 2009 ). This adjustment did not change the interaction term appreciably for CVLT-delayed recall cognitive decline (data not shown).\nOur study has several strengths. First, the frequency of follow-up was high compared with other studies (median frequency ranged between 13 and 15 depending on the outcome), which allowed to detect incident dementia around onset time and an accurate depiction of cognitive trajectories with aging. Moreover, we combined linear mixed models with logistic regression analyses to examine significant cognitive impairment and decline.\nHowever, the BLSA is a sample of convenience; the cohort was not fixed, and recruitment and dropout were continuous throughout the follow-up. We used statistical modeling to mitigate the effects this might have on the final results, including survival analysis (Freedman, 1982) , restriction to younger age ranges to account for competing risk of death (Corder et al., 1995) , adjustment for death status in logistic models, and a 2-stage Heckman selection model (Heckman, 1979) . Furthermore, while the frequency of observations was high, first visit age and duration between visits varied among participants making the data structure unbalanced in terms of follow-up. To this end, we used mixed models to predict cognitive scores at specific ages where a large proportion of the data were available (mean age at follow-up for each subject) and controlled for the mean age at follow-up as well as first-visit age in the statistical models we conducted. Finally, several of our positive findings such as significant interactions between ApoE4 \u03e9 and sex in predicting cognitive decline or impairment in specific domains, may have been due to chance, residual confounding or selection bias, while other negative findings may have been caused by lack of adequate power (e.g., lack of sex interaction with ApoE4 \u03e9 in the case of Cox PH models with dementia risk as outcome). In particular, there were no adequate data on dementia-related therapies, which may have acted as additional potential confounders in the main associations of interest. Thus, until those findings are replicated elsewhere, they should be interpreted with caution.\nOur study suggests that older adults with at least 1 ApoE 4 allele are at increased risk of developing dementia and are more likely to decline or have impairments in various cognitive domains compared with those without this allele. Our study also showed that the association between ApoE 4 allele and cognitive decline in specific domains including verbal memory and learning is not sex neutral because women are at higher risk compared with men when possessing the 4 allele. Future mechanistic studies should investigate the lack of sex neutrality in the ApoE4 \u03e9 and cognitive decline or impairment associations in specific domains of cognition."}, {"section_title": "Disclosure statement", "text": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, {"section_title": "Appendix A.
