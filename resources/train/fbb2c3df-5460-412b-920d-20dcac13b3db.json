[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] In particular, the National Institute for Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria propose positivity on both amyloid and neurodegeneration biomarkers (A1 and N1, respectively). 6, 10 Recent negative phase III clinical trials of antiamyloid therapies did not consider biomarkers for inclusion and recruited a significant portion of amyloid-negative subjects who did not progress substantially on primary endpoints.

The present study was performed on 274 participants with MCI and 444 healthy controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://www.loni.usc.edu/ADNI). 31 For the MCI cohort, we selected all participants with amnestic MCI (labeled MCI in ADNI-1 and L-MCI in ADNI-2) who met the following inclusion criteria: 1.5T (ADNI-1) or 3T (ADNI-2) MRI scan available at baseline, baseline assessment of amyloid status (from CSF or AV-45 amyloid PET) available, and clinical scores For the healthy control cohort, used as a normative reference population to define a hippocampal volume (HV) cut point, all participants who had an MRI available at baseline from both ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 were used. We have previously demonstrated minimal differences in HVs calculated from 1.5T and 3T scans on the same participants. 32 An overview of the included participants, together with key characteristics, is presented in table 1. A more detailed description of ADNI and its study design and the image acquisition parameters are given in appendix e-1 at Neurology.org.\nBiomarker measures. Amyloid deposition measured through PET imaging and CSF analyses of b-amyloid (Ab) levels has been shown to be highly concordant and to show a similar diagnostic accuracy. 33 Consequently, the selection of either marker is driven mainly by geographic availability and cost, as well as patient and doctor preferences. 33 For the purpose of identifying participants as amyloid positive or negative, we used CSF Ab42 for participants from ADNI-1 and florbetapir-PET for participants from ADNI-2; cut points derived from both biomarkers have been shown to perform consistently. 30, 33 Specifically, ADNI-1 participants were considered A1 with Ab42 levels #192 pg/mL, while ADNI-2 participants were considered A1 with a florbetapir-PET standardized uptake value ratio .1.11 for the mean of 6 predefined regions of interest relative to the whole cerebellum. Appendix e-2 presents results from the ADNI-2 cohort on the concordance between amyloid positivity from the 2 biomarkers and its impact on patient selection. However, our cost estimates are based on the assumption that PET imaging is used to determine amyloid positivity for our simulated clinical trial scenarios.\nHV was calculated with the learning embeddings for atlas propagation (LEAP) algorithm 34 incorporated into the CEmarked medical device Assessa (www.assessa.com). HV was adjusted for age and head size as measured by intracranial volume, and left and right hippocampi were averaged for each subject (details are presented in appendix e-3). After a detailed validation of HV cut points, 19 participants were considered N1 if their adjusted HV was smaller than the 25th percentile of the agematched healthy subject cohort.\nCombinatorial enrichment strategies. We examined the following enrichment strategies: NIA-AA I (A1), enrichment by abnormal amyloid alone (neurodegeneration status undetermined); NIA-AA II (N1), enrichment by low HV alone (amyloid status undetermined); and NIA-AA III (A1N1), enrichment by both Experiments. The effect of biomarker-based enrichment was assessed with respect to the 2-year change in widely used clinical scales of global cognition, MMSE and ADAS-Cog 13 , in terms of 2 key trial characteristics: the rate and homogeneity of clinical progression in the included trial cohort and the additional screen failure fraction due to the biomarker selection criteria. As a joint measurement of rate and homogeneity of clinical progression, we defined a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the mean 2-year change on the clinical scale in the included group divided by the SD of the 2-year change. On the basis of representative values from multisite trial operations, we also estimated how the change and interplay of these key measurements influence required sample sizes, the number of participants who need to undergo screening to obtain the required sample size, and indicative overall trial duration and cost. 19 Calculations of the latter take into account the tradeoff between increased screen failures and the reduced number of participants needed to be randomized. Sample size calculations were performed for a 25% reduction in the worsening of either MMSE or ADAS-Cog 13 at 80% power and 5% significance. Detailed models for sample size, number needed to screen, and trial time and cost are presented in appendix e-3. Although amyloid positivity is defined from CSF (ADNI-1 participants) and PET imaging (ADNI-2 participants) in this work, the use of PET imaging is assumed in the cost calculation.\nRESULTS All 3 NIA-AA-based enrichment strategies yielded increased 2-year SNRs for both MMSE and ADAS-Cog 13 (figure 1A) compared to the unenriched population. Enrichment with HV (N1) showed the smallest improvement, followed by enrichment based on amyloid positivity (A1), whereas enrichment based on both biomarkers (A1N1) provided the overall best enrichment performance. SNR was increased by 18% (MMSE) and 25% (ADAS-Cog 13 ) by N1 enrichment, 31% and 38%, respectively, by A1 enrichment, and 45% and 57%, respectively, by A1N1 enrichment. The biomarker screen fail fractions were 28% for enrichment by A1 or N1 alone and 45% for the combined A1N1 enrichment ( figure 1B) . However, the required sample size to enroll was substantially reduced, by 26% (MMSE) and 33% (ADAS-Cog 13 ) for N1 enrichment, by 40% and 50% for A1 enrichment, and by 53% and 60% for A1N1 enrichment ( figure 1C ). In terms of overall estimated trial duration and cost, all 3 enrichment strategies resulted in quicker, cheaper clinical trials (table 2) . That is, the gain due to the reduced sample size more than compensated for the increased screen fail rate. Performing N1 enrichment before A1 enrichment leads to a further reduction in trial cost (table 2) .\nTwo-year change on both clinical scales showed a nominally more rapid progression in the selected cohort relative to the unenriched cohort for all 3 enrichment methods, and this was statistically significant with the use of the A1 and A1N1 enrichment schemes for both scales (p , 0.05; figure 2 ). The excluded group showed substantially slower clinical progression rates for both scales using all 3 enrichment schemes (p , 0.01). When shorter 6-month and 12-month trials were simulated, SNR was increased for both measures by amounts similar to that found for the 24-month trial (appendix e-5).\nDetailed results for the comparator enrichment strategies, based on ApoE e4 genotype, cognition (ADAS-Cog 13 ), function (FAQ), and memory (RAVLT), are presented in appendix e-4. Briefly, enrolling ApoE e4 carriers (a strong risk factor for amyloid positivity) yielded an improvement in SNR of 24% (MMSE) and 28% (ADAS-Cog 13 ) at a screen failure rate of 46%. Enriching with ADAS-Cog 13 .15 improved the SNR by 40% on MMSE at the cost of an additional 31% screen failure rate, while FAQ-based enrichment gave an SNR increase of 40% (MMSE) and 20% (ADAS-Cog 13 ) with an associated screen failure rate of 30%. Enriching with RAVLT ,35 gave an SNR increase of 23% (MMSE) and 36% (ADAS-Cog 13 ) at the cost of an additional 32% screen failure rate. A corresponding reduction in sample sizes was observed with all 4 of these alternative, non-biomarker-based enrichment strategies.\nDISCUSSION These results demonstrate the effect of using the current NIA-AA research diagnostic criteria as an enrichment strategy for amnestic MCI clinical trials. Compared to previous work that looked at multibiomarker enrichment, we explicitly examined the effects of these diagnostic criteria using specific, established cut points on both measures. With a view to operationalizing these criteria, we also assessed their effect on trial design by exploring the changes in a set of practical trial characteristics, including time and cost, using parameters from recent trials. Although these input values may vary, our findings of a substantial relative improvement in trial parameters should be relatively robust to realistic differences in these inputs and the assumptions underlying our model. The presented results show that enrichment with either biomarker individually (A1 or N1) increases the SNR of the change in clinical endpoint measures and reduces the required sample sizes and the projected trial cost. When combined enrichment (A1N1) is applied, the SNR values increase and the required sample sizes decrease relative to no enrichment by 45% to 60%, depending on the clinical endpoint. The mean 2-year change in ADAS-Cog 13 in the enriched population was increased from 3.9 points (unenriched) to 5.0 to 6.5 points, and the mean decrease in MMSE increased from 1.8 points (unenriched) to 2.2 to 2.8 points. These results show that when a trial with fixed power is designed, biomarker enrichment does not increase the number of participants who need to be screened because the reduction in the required sample size outweighs the increased screen failure rate. Projected trial durations were overall predicted to be no longer than in the unenriched scenario. These results were robust to trial duration because simulations with shorter follow-up times resulted in very similar relative characteristics of the enriched population (appendix e-5).\nSeveral recent trials have enrolled amyloid-positive participants only. Our results show that using HV- Table 2 Screen failure fraction (SFF), 2-year change on clinical outcome measures (mean 6 SD), 2-year signal-to-noise ratio (SNR: mean/SD), number of participants who need to undergo screening (NNS), trial cost, and overall trial duration based enrichment in addition further reduces sample sizes by z20% and cost by z25% when the cheaper exclusion criterion (MRI) is administered first because PET imaging is then required in fewer participants. Because an MRI scan is typically acquired at screening for other reasons, the added operational complexity of automated and rapid computation of a HV estimate is minimal but can lead to significant savings in trial cost. Automatically derived HV provides robust enrichment with relatively little sensitivity to the cut point used. 19 To confirm this in the present study, we compared enrichment with a cut point at the 40th percentile (as an alternative to the 25th percentile used above) of HV in the healthy control population. Screen failure rate changes from 28% to 24%, yet the assessed trial characteristics change by ,10% (details are given in appendix e-2). While HV is an important downstream biomarker of AD and therefore can help to identify patients close to accelerated clinical decline, 1 it is not directly linked to Ab, one of the hallmarks in the amyloid cascade hypothesis of AD. 35 HV alone therefore cannot replace an amyloid marker to accurately select patients in amyloid targeting therapies but can complement it to help to identify subpopulations more likely to progress on primary trial endpoints. Even when not defining a specific exclusion criterion on HV, it can be a valuable stratification or subgrouping measure as shown by the recently presented post hoc analysis of the MCI Gantenerumab SCarlet RoAD study in which all the enrolled participants were amyloid positive but a significant treatment effect was observed only in the subgroup of participants predicted to progress more rapidly with a model that used HV and clinical scales. 15 Our cost analysis assumed that PET imaging was used to determine amyloid status. Although some reports suggest that CSF levels of Ab become abnormal earlier in the disease stage, 33 the results presented in appendix e-6 confirm previous publications that showed high concordance between amyloid markers from CSF and PET. 33, 36 A recent systematic comparison of PET and CSF concludes that choices can be based on other factors such as availability, cost, and doctor/patient preferences because both have equally high diagnostic accuracy. 36 While a CSF analysis can potentially be incorporated more easily with other biomarkers, it is highly invasive and requires careful standardization; PET imaging, on the other hand, requires highly advanced instruments and is less available in clinical practice in some countries. 36 In a separate analysis, this article shows how alternative enrichment strategies that avoid imaging measurements can also increase the longitudinal progression rate of a patient population thus selected. The proposed models were applied to enrichment with ApoE e4 status and measures of global cognition and function that are widely used in clinical trials of mild AD and have furthermore been shown to perform well in the prodromal stage of the disease. 37 The results using ApoE e4 status and measurements of cognition, memory, and function (appendix e-4) show an enrichment performance similar to that obtained with the 2 imaging biomarkers and following the NIA-AA criteria. A limitation of the presented work is its validation on the ADNI study alone. Even though inclusion and exclusion criteria in ADNI were defined to be comparable to those in clinical trials, it is unclear how well the recruited participants compare to a typical clinical trial population, let alone a real-world treatment population. However, preliminary results from current clinical studies using biomarker enrichment (e.g., aducanumab) and the post-hoc analysis of the SCarlet RoAD study discussed above provide additional evidence for the benefit that single-biomarker and multibiomarker enrichment strategies can have.\nIntegrating different biomarkers, clinical measurements, and patient attributes into integrated disease progression models represents a next step toward a more detailed understanding of disease progression and the efficient use of available measurements for trial inclusion, as well as the selection of suitable patients once treatment is available."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "Robin Wolz: study concept and design, collation of data, analysis and interpretation of data.
