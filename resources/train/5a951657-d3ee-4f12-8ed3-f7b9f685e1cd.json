[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Numerous studies have proposed biomarkers based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect and predict the risk of evolution toward Alzheimer's disease (AD). While anatomical MRI captures structural alterations, studies demonstrated the ability of diffusion MRI to capture microstructural modifications at an earlier stage. Several methods have focused on hippocampus structure to detect AD. To date, the patch-based grading framework provides the best biomarker based on the hippocampus. However, this structure is complex since the hippocampus is divided into several heterogeneous subfields not equally impacted by AD. Former in-vivo imaging studies only investigated structural alterations of these subfields using volumetric measurements and microstructural modifications with mean diffusivity measurements. The aim of our work is to study the efficiency of hippocampal subfields compared to the whole hippocampus structure with a multimodal patch-based framework that enables to capture subtler structural and microstructural alterations. To this end, we analyze the significance of the different hippocampal subfields for AD diagnosis and prognosis with volumetric, diffusivity measurements and a novel multimodal patch-based grading framework that combines structural and diffusion MRI. The experiments conducted in this work showed that the whole hippocampus provides the most discriminant biomarkers for advanced AD detection while biomarkers applied into subiculum obtain the best results for AD prediction, improving by 2% the accuracy compared to the whole hippocampus."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative process leading to mental dysfunctions. Subjects presenting Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) have higher risk to develop AD 1 . To study the preclinical phase of the disease, the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) was set up based on two MCI definitions: early MCI (eMCI) and late MCI (lMCI). eMCI represents subjects with cognitive impairment milder than lMCI which is composed of amnesic MCI 2 . Such clinical symptoms caused by changes like synaptic and neuronal losses that lead to structural and micro-structural alterations. Neuroimaging studies performed on AD subjects revealed that brain structure alterations are advanced when diagnosis is established and emphasized the need to study the early stages of the disease.\nThe improvement of medical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enabled the development of efficient biomarkers detecting alterations caused by AD 3 . Over the past years, many methods have been proposed to perform automatic detection of alterations associated with AD. First, studies proposed methods based on specific regions of interest (ROI) capturing alterations at an anatomical scale. Among structures impacted by AD, previous investigations focused on hippocampus (HIPP) [4] [5] [6] , entorhinal cortex (EC) [7] [8] [9] , parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala 10 or parietal lobe 11, 12 . Alterations on each subject. ADNI-2 provides T1-weighted (T1w) MRI and DTI scans for 54 CN, 79 eMCI, 39 lMCI and 47 AD subjects. Only patients whose have T1w and DTI were selected in our work. Hence, in this work we used 52 CN, 99 MCI composed of 65 eMCI, 34 lMCI and 38 AD instead of the whole initial ADNI-2 dataset. Table 1 shows the distribution of the data for each group. The s-MRI and d-MRI scans used for all considered subjects in this study were acquired with the same protocol (https://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/ADNI2_GE_3T_22.0_T2.pdf). T1w MRI acquisition protocol had been done with the 3D accelerated sagittal IR-SPGR, according to the ADNI protocol 60 . The d-MRI were composed of 46 separate angles, 5 T2-weighted images with no diffusion sensitization (b0 images) and 41 directions (b=1000s/mm 2 ). The d-MRI protocol was chosen to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio in a fixed scan time 61 . The native resolution of s-MRI and d-MRI was set to 1mm 3 and 2mm 3 , respectively. "}, {"section_title": "MRI processing", "text": "T1w images were processed using the volBrain system 62 (http://volbrain.upv.es). This system is based on an advanced pipeline providing automatic segmentation of different brain structures from T1w MRI. The preprocessing is based on: (a) a denoising step with an adaptive non-local mean filter 63 , (b) an affine registration in the MNI space 64 , (c) a correction of the image inhomogeneities 65 and (d) an intensity normalization. Afterwards, segmentation of hippocampal subfields was performed with HIPS 66 based on a combination of non-linear registration and patch-based label fusion 67 . This method uses a training library based on a dataset composed of high resolution T1w images manually labeled according to the protocol proposed by Winterburn et al. (2013) 35 . To perform the segmentation, the ADNI images are up-sampled with a local adaptive super resolution method to fit in the training image resolution 68 . The method provides automatic segmentation of hippocampal subfields gathered into 5 labels: Subiculum, CA1SP, CA1SR-L-M, CA2-3 and CA4/DG (see Figure 1) . Finally, an estimation of the total intra-cranial volume is performed 69 ."}, {"section_title": "DTI processing", "text": "The preprocessing of the diffusion weighted images is based on: (a) a denoising with a LPCA filter 70 , (b) a correction of the head motion using an affine registration and (c) an affine and a non-rigid registration to the T1w MRI in the MNI space 64 . Afterwards, a diffusion tensor model 71 is fitted at each voxel using Dipy library 72 . To analyze microstructural modifications, the MD is estimated within each hippocampal subfield and the whole HIPP structure with the segmentation described in the previous section. MD is defined as\nwhere \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 , \u03bb 3 are the three eigenvalues of the fitted tensor. Finally, a quality control was proceeded to exclude data presenting miss-segmentation or miss-registration after image preprocessing step."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Patch-based grading Patch-based grading was firstly proposed for s-MRI 9 . The main idea of this exemplar-based method is to use the capability of patch-based techniques to capture subtle signal modifications related to anatomical degradations caused by AD. To date, PBG methods demonstrate state-of-the-art performances to detect the earliest stage of AD 73 . To determine the pathological status of the subject under study, PBG method estimates at each voxel the state of cerebral tissues by a similarity measurement. This measurement is performed between the anatomical pattern of the subject under study and those extracted from two training populations, one healthy and another one unhealthy.\nFirst, a training library T composed of two datasets of images is built: one with images from CN subjects and the other one from AD patients. Next, for each voxel x i of the region of interest in the considered subject x, PBG method produces a weak classifier denoted g x i . This weak classifier provides a surrogate of the pathological grading at the considered position. The weak classifier is computed using a measurement of the similarity between the patch P x i surrounding the voxel x i belonging to the image under study and a set K x i of the closest patches extracted from the library T . The most similar patches are found using an approximative nearest neighbor method 74 . The grading value g x i at x i is defined as:\nwhere P t j is the patch surrounding the voxel j belonging to the training template t \u2208 T . w(x i ,t j ) is the weight assigned to the pathological status p t of the training image t. We estimate w such as:\nwhere h = min ||P x i \u2212 P t j || 2 2 + \u03b5 and \u03b5 \u2192 0. The pathological status p t is set to \u22121 for patches extracted from AD patient and to 1 for patches extracted from CN subject. Therefore, PBG method provides at each voxel a score representing an estimation of the alterations caused by AD. Consequently, cerebral tissues strongly altered by AD have grading values close to \u22121 contrary to healthy one with scores close to 1."}, {"section_title": "Multimodal patch-based grading fusion", "text": "Patch-based method presented in the previous section was firstly designed to capture structural alterations in T1w MRI. Recently, we proposed to extent this method to DTI modality in order to detect microstructural modifications 57 . We showed the efficiency of MD grading to improve the classification of the early stages of AD.\nIn this study, we propose a new framework to perform multimodal patch-based grading (MPBG). To this end, we developed adaptive fusion of grading maps derived from different modalities (see example of grading maps on Fig. 2 ). As shown in the following, this fusion provides more robust and accurate biomarkers compared to monomodal PBG biomarkers.\nFirst, as in previous section, for each modality a training library of CN and AD subjects is built. Next, at each voxel within the ROI of the considered subject and for each modality, a set K of most similar patches is extracted. This step provides one set K of patches per modality m \u2208 M, where M corresponds to the set of the different modalities provided. Nevertheless, at each voxel the quality of the grading estimation is not the same for all the modalities. Therefore, the degree of confidence is estimated with the function \u03b1 defined as:\nthat reflects the confidence of the grading value g x i for the modality m at the voxel x i . This confidence measure is derived from multi-feature fusion 75 . Thus, each modality provides a weak classifier at each voxel that is weighted with its degree of"}, {"section_title": "4/14", "text": "confidence \u03b1 ( x i,m ). The multimodal grading, denoted g x i , is given by:\nIn other words, the weight w and K x i,m are estimated independently for each modality and combined afterwards. Therefore, the proposed combination framework is spatially adaptive and takes advantage of having access to a local degree of confidence \u03b1 x i,m for each modality m. Basically, when the set of patches found for a modality in the training library is composed of good candidates (i.e., patches very similar to the patch from the subject under study), our confidence \u03b1 x i,m in the grading estimation for this modality is high. At the end, this modality will have a high weight in the mixing procedure described in (4). "}, {"section_title": "Features estimation", "text": "Features were estimated in each hippocampal subfield and over the whole hippocampus as the union of all hippocampal subfields masks. To reduce the inter-individual variability, all volumes are normalized by the total intra-cranial volume 76 . Afterwards, we aggregate local weak classifiers of the grading map into a single feature for each considered structure (i.e., hippocampal subfields and whole HIPP) by averaging them. Therefore, patch-based grading features are computed by an unweighted vote of the weak classifiers using the segmentation masks (see Fig. 3 ). Finally, to prevent the bias introduced as the structure alterations due to aging, all the features (i.e., volume, mean of MD and MPBG) are age corrected with a linear regression based on the CN group 77 ."}, {"section_title": "Implementation", "text": "To find the most similar patches in the training library, we use the OPAL method 78 . OPAL is a fast approximate nearest neighbor patch search technique. This method enables to process each modality in about 4 seconds on a standard computer. The training library is equally composed of 37 images for both CN and AD subjects, leading to |T | = 76. The number of patches extracted from each the training library is K = 160 (i.e., 80 from CN subjects and 80 from AD patients) and the patch size is 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 voxels. Furthermore, as done in our PBG DTI study 57 , we used zero normalized sum of squared differences for T1w to compute the L2 norm (see Equation (2)). On the other hand, d-MRI is a quantitative imaging technique. Therefore, to preserve the quantitative information, a straight sum of squared differences is used for MD in Equation (2),"}, {"section_title": "Validation", "text": "To evaluate the efficiency of each considered biomarker to detect AD alterations, CN group is compared to AD patients group.

In the first part, we compare the different approach applied within the entire HIPP structure to evaluate the performance of our new MPBG compared to usual biomarkers such as volume and average MD.

Finally, in a last part, we compare the results of our proposed multimodal biomarker with state-of-the-art methods based on d-MRI to show the competitive performance of our approach. "}, {"section_title": "Whole hippocampus", "text": "Results of the comparisons over the whole HIPP are represented in Table 2 . In this experiment, we compared the results of volume, mean of MD and PBG applied with both modality and MPBG over the whole hippocampus. First, the hippocampus volume and its average of MD were compared. For CN versus AD classification the volume obtains 86.6% of AUC and the average of MD obtains 80.6%. For eMCI versus lMCI classification the volume and the average of MD obtain 59.4% and 55.6% of AUC, respectively. Experiments demonstrate that the hippocampus the volume obtains better classification results than the average of MD for all comparison, especially for CN versus AD. Second, PBG biomarkers applied with T1w and MD were compared. The results showed that T1w PBG provides better results than MD PBG with 92.6% of AUC for CN versus AD classification. However, for eMCI versus lMCI classification MD grading provides the best results with 69.5% of AUC. MPBG methods combining both modalities reaches the best results for CN versus AD and eMCI versus lMCI with 92.1% and 69.5% of AUC, respectively. Finally, the proposed MPBG biomarker provides results similar to the best modalities for all considered comparisons. Compared to volume, MPBG improves CN versus AD comparison result by 5.5% of AUC and by over 10% of AUC for eMCI versus lMCI comparison. Thus, MBPG biomarker has a good capability to capture modifications caused by AD at different severity stages (see Figure 2) . Figure 4 shows the distribution of volumes (A), average of MD (B) and MPBG (C) for each hippocampal subfield at each different AD stages. For each comparison a p-value was estimated with a multi-comparison test 79 . We can note that for all hippocampal subfields, alterations caused by the disease are related to a volume and MPBG decrease with a MD increase. Subiculum subfield presents the most significant differences for several comparisons. More importantly, it is the only subfield providing a p-value inferior than 0.05 for the comparison CN versus eMCI with volume, a p-value inferior than 0.01 to lMCI versus AD with MD and a p-value inferior to 0.001 to eMCI versus lMCI with MPBG, which are the most challenging comparisons. The distribution of MPBG shows a better discrimination between each group for all hippocampal subfields. Indeed, MPBG applied within CA1SP, and CA1SR-L-M provides p-values inferior than 0.01 for eMCI versus lMCI. Moreover, MPBG applied within the subiculum provides p-value inferior than 0.001 for the same comparison. Thus, MPBG enables to perform a detection of AD with each subfield with an advantage for subiculum for the comparison of eMCI versus lMCI ."}, {"section_title": "Hippocampal subfields", "text": "To estimate the efficiency of the considered biomarkers for AD detection, we also performed a classification experiment. Figures 5 shows the results of two comparisons, CN versus AD (part noted A in the figure) and eMCI versus lMCI (part noted B).

Moreover, the most discriminant MD biomarker is given by the subiculum with an AUC of 88.1%. For this comparison, MD of subiculum is the only biomarker performing better results than whole hippocampus. The best results obtained by MPBG feature is provided by the CA1SP with an AUC of 92.1% followed by CA1S-R-L-M and subiculum. Second, for eMCI versus lMCI classification, the subiculum provides the best results for each considered feature. Indeed, subiculum obtained an AUC of 66.1% for the volume, 62.4% for the average of MD, and 71.8% for MPBG. Moreover, subiculum provided better results than whole hippocampus for each feature. Thus, the experiments conducted with three different biomarkers showed that the use of hippocampal subfields, especially the subiculum, enables to obtain better results for AD prediction than the whole hippocampal analysis.

Indeed, most of the proposed biomarkers based on hippocampus focused only on the whole structure or study alterations of hippocampal subfields with methods that do not provide sensitive biomarkers to detect early modification caused by AD. The lack of work studying alterations of hippocampal subfields with advanced biomarkers could be explained by the fact that automatic segmentation of the hippocampal subfields is a complex task due to subtle borders dividing each area.\nIn this work, we compared the efficiency of diffusion MRI and multimodal patch-based biomarkers for AD detection and prediction over the hippocampal subfields. Comparisons based on MD, volume and multimodal patch-based biomarkers showed that the subiculum is the most discriminant structure in the earliest stage of AD providing the best results for AD prediction (see Figure 4 and 5). However, whole hippocampus structure, followed by CA1SR-L-M, obtains best results for AD detection.\nThese results are in accordance with literature studies based on animal model and in vivo imaging combining volume and MD demonstrating that subiculum is the earliest hippocampal region affected by AD 42, 43 . Moreover, postmortem studies showed that the hippocampal degeneration in early stages of AD is not uniform. After the apparition of alterations in the EC, the pathology spreads to the subiculum, CA1, CA2-3 and finally the CA4 and DG subfields 36, 37, 42, 83 . It is interesting to note that the results of our experiments using volume-based biomarkers are also coherent with the previous in-vivo imaging studies that analyzed the atrophy of each hippocampal subfield at advanced stage of AD. These studies showed that CA1 is the subfield impacted by the strongest atrophy 38, 39, 84, 85 . Furthermore, studies using ultra-high field at 7T enabling CA1 layers discrimination showed that CA1SR-L-M is the subfields showing the greater atrophy at advanced stages of AD 40, 41 ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we analyzed hippocampal subfield alterations with a multimodal framework based on structural and diffusion MRI.
