In public schools, no differences were detected in the use of entrance or placement testing by school poverty. Thirteen percent of schools with kindergarten programs used entrance/placement tests to inform entry decisions when a child is below the cut-off age, with no differences by school type, level of instruction, or school size.

They use this information from tests, along with the child's age, to decide whether a child is ready to begin kindergarten. The information from tests may also be used to support a decision on whether to admit a child who is old enough, or who is too young, according to the age cut-off set by the state, school district, or school. Test information is also used to help structure instruction to meet the needs of individual children or groups of children and to identify children who may need additional evaluation and testing. A survey of state education departments was conducted between October 1999 and January 2000 to collect information on state policies and practices pertaining to the assessment of kindergarten children (Saluja, Scott-Little, and Clifford 2000). According to the findings from this survey, 18 states have statewide screening or assessment of children when they begin kindergarten, 26 states responded that though there was no statewide assessment effort, some local districts were assessing children before or as they entered kindergarten, 16 states said they were working toward a statewide assessment program and 6 states responded there was no assessment effort at either the state or local levels. The most often cited use of the information from these tests was to improve instruction by providing teachers with information about their incoming kindergarten class (12 states). The data were also used for school improvement purposes by helping to identify high-need schools (7 states), and to identify children with special needs (6 states). Because many states give local school officials the authority to make decisions about whether or not to assess kindergarten children, how to assess these children, and how to use the information from these assessments, it is important to know more about these practices at the school level. This report uses data from the base-year (kindergarten) collection of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLSK), sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics, U.S. Department of Education. The report describes the use of entrance or placement tests prior to kindergarten by schools in the United States that offer kindergarten classes. It examines the use of assessment 2 EST COPY AVAITIABLIE tests by public and private schools, by schools with different concentrations of low-income children,' by schools with different levels of instruction (grade levels taught in the school), and by schools with different numbers of children enrolled."}, {"section_title": "National Data on Entrance and Placement", "text": "Testing Prior to Kindergarten fourth, fifth or sixth; combined, highest grade is seventh through twelfth). School size refers to the number of students enrolled or school enrollment (i.e., less than 150, 150-299, 300-499, 500-749, and 750 and above). In terms of school poverty, low-income schools are identified by the presence of a schoolwide Title 1 program. In 1998-99, in order to have a schoolwide Title 1 program 50 percent of the student body had to be from families in poverty. Since this is highly unlikely for private schools, the comparisons by school poverty are limited to public schools only."}, {"section_title": "Findings", "text": "The ECLS-K data show that 61 percent of schools administer entrance or placement tests prior to kindergarten (figure 1). Schools are more likely to use information from such tests to evaluate the needs of children and to help guide instruction than to make decisions about whether children should be allowed to enter school or not (figure 1). These findings are described below in greater detail."}, {"section_title": "Use of Entrance or Placement Testing Prior to Kindergarten", "text": "As mentioned, 61 percent of schools administer entrance or placement tests to children prior to entering kindergarten. A higher percentage of public schools (69 percent) than private schools (47 percent) administer entrance or placement tests to children prior to kindergarten. Combined (71 percent), elementary (65 percent), and primary (68 percent) schools are more likely than schools that end with kindergarten (21 percent) to administer entrance or placement tests prior to kindergarten. Schools with larger student enrollments (>300 students) are more likely to administer entrance or placement tests (69 to 72 percent) than schools with enrollments of less than 150 students (44 percent). In public schools, no differences were detected in the use of entrance or placement testing by school poverty. Testing to Determine Eligibility When a Child is Below the Cut-off Age Schools use tests prior to kindergarten to inform admission decisions (Rafoth 1997). For example, if a child is age-ineligible for kindergarten (i.e., younger than the district's kindergarten cut-off age) but the parent wishes the child to attend, a test may be administered to inform the decision regarding whether to admit the child. Thirteen percent of all schools with kindergarten programs use entrance or placement tests prior to kindergarten to inform entry decisions when a child is below the cut-off age (figure 1). No significant differences were detected in the use of tests for this purpose by school type or level of instruction. Also, no clear pattern of difference was detected by school size. Among public schools, no differences were detected by school poverty in schools' use of testing to ending with kindergarten (6 percent). This finding is not entirely unexpected, for schools ending with kindergarten (i.e., preschools terminating with kindergarten) tend to be smaller and may not contain as many kindergarten classrooms; therefore, testing for this purpose may be a non-issue. Public schools with a high percentage of low-income children are more likely than public schools with fewer low-income children to use tests to determine children's class placements."}, {"section_title": "Testing to Identify Children Who May Need Additional Testing and Evaluation", "text": "Schools may use placement test information to identify children who need additional evaluation for possible receipt of special services. In fact, the initial purpose of using entrance and placement tests was to identify children with special needs. Developmental assessments are used to help ensure that children with disabilities receive appropriate services (Shepard 1994). Overall, 47 percent of schools use tests to identify children who may need additional evaluation (figure 1). Public schools (55 percent) are more likely than private schools (33 percent) to administer entrance or placement tests for this purpose (figure 2). Primary (57 percent), elementary (51 percent), and combined (50 percent) schools are more likely than schools that end with kindergarten (22 percent) to administer entrance or placement tests for this purpose. Also, a higher percentage of schools with between 300 and 499 students (57 percent) use these types of tests to identify children who may need additional evaluation, compared to schools with less than 150 students (35 percent). Among public schools, low-income schools are more likely than non-low-income schools to use tests to identify children who may need additional evaluation."}, {"section_title": "Testing to Help Teachers Individualize Instruction", "text": "Tests can help teachers to understand specific children's learning needs and can be used by teachers to individualize instruction. About half 3 4 of all schools (52 percent) use entrance and placement testing for this purpose (figure 1). Public schools (59 percent) are more likely than private schools (38 percent) to administer entrance and placement tests to help teachers individualize instruction. Primary (54 percent), elementary (57 percent), and combined (54 percent) schools are more likely to administer entrance or placement tests to help teachers individualize instruction than schools that end with kindergarten (24 percent). Small schools (less than 150 students, 37 percent) are less likely to administer entrance or placement tests to help teachers individualize instruction than larger schools (300-499 students, 58 percent; 500-749 students, 60 percent; 750 or more student, 58 percent). In public schools, no differences were detected by school poverty level in the use of testing to help teachers individualize instruction."}, {"section_title": "Testing to Support a Recommendation for Delay of Entry", "text": "Schools may administer tests prior to kindergarten to support a recommendation to delay a child's entry to kindergarten (May and Kundert 1997). Here, the child meets the age requirement to begin kindergarten, but the child's parents or school, or both, may have a concern about the child's readiness for school. About one-quarter of schools (27 percent) use tests to support recommendations that children be held out of kindergarten (figure 1). No differences by school type were detected for this use of testing. Combined schools (38 percent) and elementary schools (26 percent) are more likely than schools ending with kindergarten (10 percent) to administer tests for this purpose. Schools with enrollments of 300-499 students (33 percent) are more likely than schools with 500-749 students (19 percent) to administer entrance or placement tests prior to kindergarten for this purpose. In public schools, no differences were detected in schools' use of tests to support a recommendation for delay of entry.  2000and results from earlier surveys conducted in the mid-1990s (Shepard, Kagan, and Taylor 1996) and mid-1980s (Gnezda and Bolig 1988) focus on the policies and practices of states (not schools). The ECLS-K provides information about schools' use of assessments. However, both at the state level and at the school level, the findings seem consistent. Specifically, it seems that test information is more likely to be used to evaluate the needs of children and to help guide instruction than to make decisions about whether children should be allowed to enter school.  "}, {"section_title": "Data Reliability", "text": "Estimates produced using data from the ECLS K are subject to two types of error, sampling and nonsampling errors. Nonsampling errors are errors made in the collection and processing of data. Sampling errors occur because the data are collected from a sample rather than a census of the population. A detailed discussion of these types of error can be found in America's Kindergartners (West, Denton, Germino Hausken, 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Standard Errors and Weights", "text": "In order to produce national estimates from the ECLSK school administrator data, the sample data were weighted. Weighting the data adjusts for unequal school selection probabilities and adjusts for nonresponse. The first stage of the weighting process assigns weights to the sampled primary sampling units (PSUs) equal to the inverse of the PSU probability of selection. The second stage of the weighting process assigns weights to the schools sampled within PSUs. The base weight for each sampled school is the PSU weight multiplied by the inverse of the probability of selecting the school. The base weights for eligible schools are adjusted for nonresponse. These adjustments are made separately for public and private schools. The base year school weight was used to produce all estimates in this report. In addition to properly weighting the responses, special procedures for estimating the statistical significance of the estimates were employed because the data were collected using a complex sample design. Complex sample designs, like that used in the ECLSK, result in data that violate the assumptions that are normally required to assess the statistical significance of the results. Frequently, the standard errors of the estimates are larger than would be expected if the sample was a simple random sample and the observations were independent and identically distributed random variables. WesVarPC version 4.1was used in this analysis to calculate standard errors. Replication methods of variance estimation were used to reflect the actual sample design used in the ECLSK. A form of the jackknife replication method (JK2) using 90 replicates was used to compute approximately unbiased estimates of the standard errors of the estimates in the report."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "Comparisons made in the text were tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. When comparisons are made, t statistics were calculated. The formula used to compute the t statistic was: As part of a larger questionnaire completed by school administrators, the ECLS-K collected information about schools' use of assessments for kindergarten children. School administrators were asked, \"Are any children given a readiness or placement test before or shortly after entering kindergarten?\" If they responded yes, they were then asked five follow up questions to ascertain if the placement tests were used: to determine eligibility for enrollment when a child is below the cut-off age for kindergarten; to determine children's class placements; to identify children who may need additional testing (for example, for a learning problem); to help teachers individualize instruction; and to support a recommendation that a child delay entry for an additional year. The estimated percent of schools that use assessment information in specific ways found in this report pertain to all schools, not just to those that use readiness or placement testing."}, {"section_title": "Derived Variables", "text": "Some variables used in this report were derived by combining information from one or more questions in the ECLSK school administrator questionnaire or from other study sources. The derivation of key variables is described in this section. School type: (S2KPUPRI) The type of school in which children attended kindergarten was collapsed into two broad categories: public and private. Private schools include those with both religious (e.g.,f Catholic) and nonreligious affiliations. This information is derived from the sampling frame and information provided by the school administrator. Administrators provided information on total school enrollment. The information was then collapsed into five categories: 0-149, 150-299, 300-499, 500-749, and more than 750. If there was no School Administrator Questionnaire or this item was left blank, then sample frame data were used.   "}]
