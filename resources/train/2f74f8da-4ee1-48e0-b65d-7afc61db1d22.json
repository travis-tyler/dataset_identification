[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "During the fall and winter of 2001-2002, the New Hampshire Estuaries Project's Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) developed a suite of environmental indicators to track progress toward the NHEP's management goals and objectives. These indicators were fully described in terms of their performance criteria, statistical methods, and measurable goals in the NHEP's Monitoring Plan, which was most recently updated in March 2003(NHEP, 2003. The next step is to use these indicators to produce an updated \"State of the Estuaries\" report by mid-2003. The TAC decided to break this task into three sections: shellfish indicators in the fall of 2002; water quality indicators in the winter of [2002][2003]; and land use/habitat indicators in the spring of 2003. For each group of indicators, the NHEP Coastal Scientist would prepare an \"Indicator Report\" that summarizes the available information and results of statistical tests for each of the indicators. The TAC would review and comment on this report, and then recommend a subset of the most important or illustrative indicators to be presented to the Management Committee. Finally, after being presented to both the TAC and the Management Committee, the indicator charts and interpretation would be incorporated in the State of the Estuaries report. This report is the last of four indicator reports to be presented to the TAC. The focus of this report is the NHEP's species and habitats indicators (see list below). In an effort to be brief, the details of the monitoring programs for each indicator are not included. Please refer to the NHEP Monitoring Plan (NHEP, 2003) for additional details for each indicator."}, {"section_title": "NHEP Indicators Included in this Report", "text": "Critical Species and Habitats HAB2: Eelgrass distribution HAB7: Abundance of juvenile finfish HAB8: Anadromous fish returns HAB9: Abundance of lobsters HAB10: Abundance of wintering waterfowl *Note: Other species and habitats of particular interest to the NHEP are clams and oysters.

This indicator will provide information relevant to the following question: \u2022 \"Do the following indicators show that water quality is suitable for aquatic life: aquatic insects/invertebrates, wildlife, fish, diatoms/algae, large bivalves, eelgrass, marshes? which will, in turn, provide supporting information on the following management goal: \u2022 Land Use Goal #6: \"Maintain habitats of sufficient size and quality to support populations of naturally occuring plants, animals, and communities."}, {"section_title": "b.

Data Analysis and Statistical Methods", "text": "The method for eelgrass mapping in the Great Bay Estuary generally followed the standardized \"C-CAP\" protocol for mapping submerged aquatic vegetation (Coastal Change Analysis Program, NOAA). The aerial photographs were taken at 3,000 ft at low spring tide with roughly 60% overlap on a calm day without preceding rain events and when the sun was at a low angle to minimize reflection (between 7 and 10 am). The photographs were near-verticals, taken with a hand-held 35mm camera, which deviates from C-CAP's protocol, but follows a published method (Short and Burdick, 1996). Photographs were taken in late summer, usually late August or early September, depending on tides and weather, to reflect the time of maximum eelgrass biomass. Ground truthing was done from a small boat at the same season as the photographs were taken. Observations were made at low tide. Samples were collected with an eelgrass sampling hook. Positions were determined using GPS. The ground truth surveys assessed 10 -20% of the eelgrass beds in the estuary. The photographs, in the form of 35mm slides or digital computer images, were projected on a screen and the eelgrass images were transferred to a base map. These maps were then digitized and verified using the ground truth data by placing the GPS points onto the digital image in ArcInfo. For data analysis, ArcView/ArcInfo software was used to calculate the area of eelgrass coverage in the different areas of the Great Bay Estuary (see table below) from GIS files produced by the UNH Seagrass Ecology Group. For the purposes of calculating acreage totals, all areas mapped as being eelgrass by UNH were included equally in the total regardless of whether the eelgrass at the location was noted as \"dense\" or \"scarce\". \nMeasurements of abundance for five anadromous fish species were compiled for each year using data collected by NHF&G. For most anadromous fish, the measurements were counts of fish passing through fish ladders. The following table lists the species that were analyzed for this indicator. \nMeasurements of lobster abundance were tracked for each year using data from NHF&G (NHF&G, 2002). Specifically, the average total catch per trap haul set over day (Total CTHSOD) and marketable catch per trap haul (Marketable CTH) for all areas of the NH coast during July through October was plotted against year to illustrate trends over time. Annual statistics for total CTHSOD and marketable CTH were taken from the NHF&G Lobster Sea Sampling reports (NHF&G, 2002). Annual average marketable CTHSOD was calculated from data presented in the 2000 and 2001 reports and will be tracked in the future. Information on commercial landings of lobsters was obtained from the National Marine Fisheries Service.\nEach January, biologists from NHF&G use aircraft surveys to count the number and species of waterfowl present along the NH coast. Simultaneous surveys are conducted in other Atlantic Flyway states. Annual mid-winter waterfowl counts were compiled for the NH coastal region and the Atlantic Flyway. The latest years results (2002) were compared to the 10-year average population for reference. The waterfowl species that were compiled were: The most abundant waterfowl in both the NH coast and the Atlantic Flyway is the Canada Goose, which constitutes approximately half of the birds counted. The next most abundant species are Scaup in the Flyway and Black Duck on the NH coast. In 2002, nearly 8,000 wintering waterfowl were observed on the NH coast, which is higher than the 10-year average of 5,500 birds observed. The birds stopping in the NH coast are just a fraction of the nearly 2 million waterfowl that migrate along the Atlantic Flyway. Bird counts in the NH coast and the Atlantic Flyway are shown in Table 12, Figure 13, and Figure 14.  1,400,000 1,600,000 1,800,000 2,000,000 1 9 5 5 -1 9 6 0 1 9 6 6 -1 9 7 0 1 9 7 6 -1 9 8 0 1 9 8 6 -1 9 9 0 1 9 9 6 -2 0 0 0 The objective of this indicator is to report on the total acres of lands protected from development in the coastal watershed. By repeating this assessment over time and stratifying the results by private and public lands, the indicator will be able to answer the following monitoring question:\nThe most recent (October 2002) coverage of conservation lands in the state was the primary data source for this indicator. The database was queried to identify the conservation lands within the coastal watershed (HUC8 01060003). Lands were grouped into categories of publiclyowned and privately-owned and then further stratified based on the type of owner using fields in the conservation lands database (query details provided in NHEP, 2003). The total acres of public and private conservation lands in the coastal watershed and the 17 coastal communities was calculated by summing the areas of individual conservation polygons in these two zones. Error bars on acreage totals were not calculated because it was assumed that parcels under easement had been surveyed and therefore had accurate acreage values.\nImpervious surfaces were mapped throughout the coastal watershed using satellite imagery (Landsat TM, 30-meter resolution) from 2000 which was post-processed using subpixelization analysis (Justice and Rubin, 2002). Each pixel was assigned a value between 0 and 10 proportional to the percentage of that pixel that is covered by impervious surfaces. A pixel was considered \"developed\" if it was assigned a value representative of 30 to 100% impervious cover. The threshold of 30% was chosen after consulting with the Complex Systems Research Center at UNH and reviewing impervious surface coefficients for different land use types (NOAA, 2002). For example, developed land has a median imperviousness coefficient between 30 and 40%. The coefficients for other land use types were between 10% and zero. Shorelands were defined as land within 250 feet of tidal waters, salt marshes (\"E2EM\" wetlands from the National Wetlands Inventory), great ponds/lakes, and third order or higher rivers. This definition matches the jurisdiction of the Comprehensive Shoreland Protection Act (RSA 483-B) with the exception that the Act only covers 4 th order or higher rivers. If a pixel straddled the shoreland buffer boundary, the pixel was clipped to the boundary and only the portion of the pixel inside the buffer was counted. Lands protected from development by conservation or other easements were taken from the most recent version of the conservations lands database (October 2002). ArcView/ArcInfo software was used to combine the impervious surface, shorelands buffer, and conservation lands datalayers. Spatial queries were used to calculate the total area of (1) developed shorelands; (2) undeveloped shorelands not protected by easements; and (3) undeveloped shorelands protected by easements. Using these area totals, the percent of shorelands in each category was calculated. Unlike the \"conservation lands\" indicator discussed previously, there is uncertainty in the results of this indicator due to potential errors in the classification of lands as \"developed\" or \"undeveloped\" from the remote sensing data as well as from erroneously omitted or added shorelands. Therefore, confidence intervals for the percent of shorelands in each category were generated using the method of partial derivatives from Kline (1985) assuming 10% error in the developed/undeveloped area totals and 1% error in the protected lands and total shoreland areas. The developed/undeveloped classification was based on the impervious surface data from Justice and Rubin (2002). The overall accuracy of the impervious surface classification was between 93% and 99%. Therefore, 10% is a conservative estimate of the error in the sum of the impervious surface pixels within the shorelands buffer. The 1% error in the protected lands and total shoreland areas was assumed to account for any defects in the shoreland buffer theme due to vagaries of the hydrography coverages. For each category, the error was added to and subtracted from the calculated percent to approximate a 95 th percentile upper and lower confidence interval. No goal has been set for this indicator so this confidence interval was not used to determine whether the goal was being met. However, the confidence intervals were still useful for understanding the accuracy of the estimates.\nUnfragmented lands data was obtained from the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests (SPNHF). SPNHF had processed 2001 land cover data from GRANIT using USGS digital line graphs of roads and NHDOT's G_roads datalayer to identify blocks of unfragmented lands in southeastern New Hampshire. The methodology and assumptions used by SPNHF to process the data are included below. Natural land cover types were extracted from the GRANIT land cover data for the study area as a precursor to generating an unfragmented blocks datalayer. These land cover types included: all forest cover types except Alpine (440), forested and non-forested wetlands, and tidal wetlands; and bedrock/vegetated, sand dunes, and cleared or disturbed land covers. Active agriculture was excluded. A special roads datalayer was generated for use as a fragmenting feature; only traveled roadways were included. The USGS-based datalayer and the NHDOT datalayer were merged after selecting out all jeep trails, Cl 6 roads, and other non-traveled roadways; private roads in the NHDOT datalayer were included in the merged dataset even though some function only as occasional use access roads. Note that the influence of urban land uses and transportation land cover types as fragmenting features was automatically accounted for in the selection of natural land cover types above, but the transportation land cover type was found to be insufficient within the GRANIT land cover mapping due to tree cover occluding many road segments. Furthermore, frontage development could not be accounted for in the GRANIT land cover mapping, so a 300' buffer was created from the merged road datalayers. NHDES clipped the unfragmented data layer from SPNHF to the coastal watershed boundary (HUC8 01060003) and then selected only those blocks that covered greater than 250 acres inside the watershed. The selected blocks were then unioned with the latest conservation lands datalayer (October 2002) to identify the portions of these blocks that were already protected from development. Unlike the \"conservation lands\" indicator discussed previously, there is uncertainty in the results of this indicator due to potential errors in the identification of unfragmented blocks as well as from incorrect records in the conservation lands datalayer. Therefore, a confidence interval for the percent of unfragmented lands under conservation easement was generated using the method of partial derivatives from Kline (1985) assuming 10% error in the unfragmented block classification and 1% error in the protected lands classification. The error value for both the unfragmented blocks and conservation lands are assumed. The 1% error in the conservation lands coverage was assumed to account for any defects in the coverage. An error ten times larger (10%) was assumed for the unfragmented block coverage because of the complexity of the classification process. The error was added to and subtracted from the calculated percent to approximate a 95 th percentile upper and lower confidence interval. No goal has been set for this indicator so this confidence interval was not used to determine whether the goal was being met. However, the confidence interval was still useful for understanding the accuracy of the estimate.\nIn February 2003, the NH Natural Heritage Bureau queried the NHB database (using unshifted georeference points and polygons and data current through January 2003) for the total number and area of the NHB records that were within the coastal watershed. The following quadrangles from the NH Natural Heritage Bureau were used: 114-115, 126-128, 138-142, 152-156, 166-171, 182-186, 202. The records from these quadrangles were clipped using the watershed boundary of HUC8 01060003. Only records whose location was known to within 300 feet (PRECISION=\"S\") and that had been field verified since 1980 were used. The NH Natural Heritage Bureau then determined the number and area of the records that occur on land protected from development using all the properties in the conservation lands database (February 2002). A record was considered to be \"on protected land\" if >50% of the polygon representing the record overlapped with protected lands.\nThe total acres of salt marshes that have been restored since January 1, 2000 will be recalculated each year and compared to the goal of 300 total acres. The salt marsh will be considered \"restored\" at the conclusion of the restoration project. The total area of restored salt marsh will be determined by the restoration project manager. No statistical tests will be applied.\nThe total acres of eelgrass beds that have been restored since January 1, 2000 will be recalculated each year and compared to the goal. The eelgrass bed will be considered \"restored\" at the conclusion of the restoration project. Only projects that actively plant eelgrass in areas will be considered restoration projects. Expanded eelgrass coverage due to improving water quality will not be considered eelgrass restoration. The total area of restored eelgrass bed will be determined by the restoration project manager. No statistical tests will be applied.\nThe total acres of oyster beds that have been restored since January 1, 2000 will be recalculated each year and compared to the goal. The oyster bed will be considered \"restored\" at the conclusion of the restoration project. Only projects that actively transplant oysters to reefs will be considered restoration projects. Expanded oyster density or bed size due to improving water quality or decreasing effects of disease will not be considered oyster restoration. The total area of each restored oyster bed will be determined by the restoration project manager. No statistical tests will be applied."}, {"section_title": "d. Results", "text": "Eelgrass (Zostera marina) is an essential habitat for the estuary because provides food for wintering waterfowl and habitat for juvenile fish (Thayer et al. 1984). The UNH Seagrass Ecology Group has mapped the distribution of eelgrass in Great Bay every year from 1986 to 2001 in the Great Bay. The entire Great Bay Estuary system (Great Bay, Little Bay, tidal tributaries, Piscataqua River, and Portsmouth Harbor) was mapped in 1996, 1999, 2000, and 2001. Table 1 summarizes the acres of eelgrass in each assessment zone from [1986][1987][1988][1989][1990][1991][1992][1993][1994][1995][1996][1997][1998][1999][2000][2001]. Figure 1 shows the trend in eelgrass cover in Great Bay over time. Eelgrass cover in Great Bay has been relatively constant for the past 10 years at approximately 2,000 acres. In 1989, there was a dramatic crash of the eelgrass beds down to 300 acres (15% of normal levels). The cause of this crash was an infestation of a slime mold Labryrinthula zosterae, commonly called \"wasting disease\" (Muehlstein et al., 1991). The greatest extent of eelgrass was observed in 1996 following several years of good water quality (Fred Short, pers. comm.). Current (2001) eelgrass coverage in the estuary is shown in Figure 2.  HAB7. Abundance of Juvenile Finfish a. Monitoring Objectives Juvenile finfish are sensitive to estuarine conditions. Many juvenile fish species spend significant portions of their life history in the estuary, and are an important source of food. Since juvenile finfish occupy a lower niche in the food web, population dynamics are less complicated and more predictable. The objective of this supporting variable is to illustrate year to year trends in the abundance and diversity of juvenile finfish in the estuary. It will address the following monitoring question related to Land Use Goal #6: \u2022 \"Has the relative abundance, biology, and species composition of resident finfish changed significantly over time?\" which will, in turn, provide supporting information on the following management goal: \u2022 Land Use Goal #6: \"Maintain habitats of sufficient size and quality to support populations of naturally occuring plants, animals, and communities.\nThe average CPUE for the dominant species are shown in Table 2 and In all areas, the most abundant juvenile fish was the Atlantic Silverside. This species was 3-5 times more abundant than any other species in Hampton Harbor, Little Harbor, and the Piscataqua River in 2001. In Great Bay/Little Bay, Atlantic Silversides were over 20 times more abundant than any other species in 2001. The values of the Simpson diversity index (D) reflect the dominance of the Atlantic Silversides. Values of D have hovered around 0.7 and 0.5 for the Great Bay/Little Bay and the three other areas, respectively. D is a measure of the probability of selecting a pair of individuals of the same species from a single random sample of the community. Therefore, there is a 70% chance that any two juvenile fish selected from the Great Bay/Little Bay at random will be Atlantic Silversides. The species richness index shows that there are slightly more fish species present in the Great Bay/Little Bay and Piscataqua River (19-20 species) than in the coastal harbors (12-14 species). In general, the abundance of the dominant species in 2001 matched previous observations. Herring abundance was the only exception. In the Great Bay Estuary, both Atlantic Herring and Blueback Herring were less abundant than has been observed in previous years. In the coastal harbors, Atlantic Herring were less abundant but Blueback Herring were more abundant than in previous years. Only four years of data are available on juvenile fish populations so the range of previous observations is not expected to represent \"baseline\" conditions or to define the full range of possible outcomes. However, by making comparisons to previous data, the results from the latest year can be viewed in the context of what has been seen before.       As a subset of the adult finfish, anadromous fish returns are indicative of conditions in the upper watershed. The juvenile fish need suitable habitat in the rivers and streams to thrive, adults need passage through dams and suitable upstream habitat to spawn. Therefore, changes in the anadromous fish returns could be due to many factors. The TAC felt that, despite the complexity of this indicator, tracking the returns of river herrings and smelt would be a useful indicator of ecological conditions in the coastal watershed as long as consideration was given to other factors that might affect fish returns (e.g., efficiency of the fish ladders, amount and quality of spawning habitat, predation levels, harvest pressure, stock enhancement). The objective of this supporting variable is to illustrate year to year trends in the abundance of anadromous finfish in the estuary. It will address the following monitoring question related to Land Use Goal #6: \u2022 \"Has the relative abundance, biology, and species composition of resident finfish changed significantly over time?\" which will, in turn, provide supporting information on the following management goal: \u2022 Land Use Goal #6: \"Maintain habitats of sufficient size and quality to support populations of naturally occuring plants, animals, and communities.\nMany factors influence the returns of anadromous fish. Each species has its own life cycle history and has different habitat needs as larvae, juvenile, and adults. The following comments are simply summaries of the reported data. More in-depth analysis of the data is not possible. Data on river herring returns are shown in Table 5 and Figure 6. In the late 1970s, extremely high returns were reported for the Taylor River. In recent years, the total returns have been steady at 150,000 fish with most of the counts coming from the Oyster, Cocheco and Lamprey rivers. Returns of American Shad have been increasing in recent years. Table 6 and Figure 7 show that most of the returns are to the Exeter River. Very few salmon have returned to NH's rivers. From 1992 to 2001, only 38 fish were recorded in fish ladders. The returns by year and location are shown in Table 7 and Figure 8. Rainbow smelt abundance has followed a moderate cyclical pattern of increasing and decreasing values. Peak abundance in recent years was in 1989 and 1995 ( Figure 9). Table 9 and Figure 10 contain records of Lamprey returns to the Cocheco River. Although Lampreys have been sporadically recorded at other fish ladders, the records are best and most consistent at the Cocheco River ladder. From 1978 to 1988, a biological supply company harvested lampreys for their products. The number of returning fish was depressed following this harvest and only recently has begun to rebound.  \nOver 2 million pounds of lobsters were harvested commercially in NH in 2001 (Table  10). The value of this harvest was over $8 million (Figure 11). The lobster harvest in 2001 was the largest since 1991 when the records began. Over the past 10 years, the abundance of lobsters along the NH coast has been variable. In recent years, the expected total catch per trap haul set over a day (CTHSOD) has been approximately 0.6 to 0.8, with marketable lobsters making up approximately one-third of this catch (marketable CTHSOD=0.20-0.25) (Table 11, Figure 12). The abundance of lobsters changes with the seasons. Total CTHSOD tends to be lowest in July, while marketable catch per trap haul tends to be lowest in July and highest in October (NHF&G, 2002).  2,000,000 3,000,000 4,000,000 5,000,000 6,000,000 7,000,000 8,000,000 9,000,000 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999    1.60 1 9 9 2 1 9 9 3 1 9 9 4 1 9 9 5 1 9 9 6 1 9 9 7 1 9 9 8 1 9 9 9 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 Year Catch per Unit Effort Approximately 75% of all the waterfowl that winter in New Hampshire do so in the seacoast region, mainly in the Great Bay or Hampton Harbor (NHF&G, 1995). Salt marshes and tidal flats of estuaries are the most important types of wetlands for waterfowl. Eelgrass and tidal flats provide winter forage for the birds (NHF&G, 1995). The population wintering over in any particular estuary along the Atlantic Flyway depends on multiple factors including the local and regional climatic conditions and the total number of birds in the migration (e.g., ice cover, amount of forage available, weather patterns). Data collected on waterfowl in New Hampshire is combined with data from states along the Atlantic flyway to provide meaningful estimates of the total waterfowl population (NHF&G, 1995). Therefore, the objective of this supporting variable is track the abundance of wintering waterfowl in Great Bay and the Atlantic Flyway to illustrate changes over time. This supporting variable will be used to partially answer the following question: \u2022 \"Do the following indicators show that water quality is suitable for aquatic life: aquatic insects/invertebrates, wildlife, fish, diatoms/algae, large bivalves, eelgrass, marshes? which will, in turn, provide supporting information on the following management goal: \u2022 Land Use Goal #6: \"Maintain habitats of sufficient size and quality to support populations of naturally occuring plants, animals, and communities.\nThe baseline condition for the watershed is that, in 2002, there were 42,585 acres of protected land. This area is equivalent to 7% of the watershed area. Three-quarters of the protected lands are owned and managed by public agencies. The total amount of conservation lands in the 17 coastal communities was 18,116 acres, which is 12% of the total area of these communities. Table 13 summarizes the acres of different types of conservation lands in the coastal watershed. In order to reach the goals for 2010, an additional 48,084 acres should be protected in the watershed, including at least 4,795 acres in the 17 coastal communities. The objective of this indicator is to track the amount of development in the tidal and freshwater shorelands of the coastal watershed. Development will be measured by the presence of significant amounts of impervious surface. The undeveloped shorelands will be further stratified into \"protected\" and \"unprotected\" categories depending on whether they are permanently protected from development. This indicator will answer the following monitoring question: \u2022 \"Has the acreage of permanently protected important habitats (tidal shorelines\u2026.freshwater shorelines\u2026) significantly changed over time?\" which will, in turn, report on progress toward the following management objectives: \u2022 LND6-1: \"By 2005, determine the existing acres of permanently protected land in the NH coastal watershed in the following categories: tidal shoreland, large contiguous forest blocks, wetlands with high habitat values, freshwater shorelands, and rare and exemplary natural communities.\" \u2022 LND6-2: \"Increase the acreage of protected land containing significant habitats in the NH coastal watershed through fee acquisition or conservation easements by 2010.\" \u2022 LND6-4: \"Increase the use of buffers around wildlife areas and maintain contiguous habitat blocks in the NH coastal watershed by 2010.\"\nThere are 5,873 acres of tidal shorelands and 24,390 acres of freshwater shorelands in the coastal watershed. Therefore, freshwater shorelands represent approximately 80% of the total shorelands in the watershed. Table 14 summarizes the acres of tidal and freshwater shorelands in the different classes (protected, developed, undeveloped/unprotected) in 2000. Figure 18 illustrates the overlays of impervious surfaces, shoreland buffers, and conservation lands in Portsmouth Harbor. In 2000, 20-24% of all tidal shorelands were already developed (Table 14, Figure 16). Another 54-59% of tidal shorelands were undeveloped but were not protected from future development. Some of these lands are not developable in reality due to zoning or physical constraints. The remaining 21-22% of tidal shorelands were already protected from development by easements or public ownership. These results are consistent with what the NHEP found during a critical lands analysis for the Technical Characterization Report (NHEP, 2000). For this analysis, lands within a 300 foot buffer on tidal shorelands were classified as either protected, developed, developable, or undevelopable. Developed land was identified through classification of large scale aerial photographs. Definitions of the other classes and the datasets used are described in Rubin and Merriam (1998). The results were that 32% of the tidal shorelands were developed, 16% were protected, and 52% were undeveloped (combination of \"developable\" and \"undevelopable\" classes). These results are reasonably consistent with the numbers reported above given the differences in the methods (e.g., use of imperviousness as an indicator for development), the different size buffer (e.g., 300 feet versus 250 feet), and changes to the conservation lands database. For freshwater shorelands, a much lower percentage of the total have already been developed (Figure 17). Only 6-7% of the freshwater shoreland were classified as developed in 2000. Approximately 80% of the freshwater shorelands were undeveloped but could be developed in the future. As stated above, zoning or physical constraints will prevent some of these properties from being developed. Finally, 14% of the freshwater shorelands were already protected from further development in 2000.    The objective of this indicator is to report on the total acreage of protected, large, unfragmented forest blocks in the coastal watershed. This indicator will answer the following monitoring question: \u2022 \"Has the acreage of permanently protected important habitats (\u2026large contiguous forest tracts\u2026.) significantly changed over time?\" which will, in turn, report on progress toward the following management objectives: \u2022 LND6-1: \"By 2005, determine the existing acres of permanently protected land in the NH coastal watershed in the following categories: tidal shoreland, large contiguous forest blocks, wetlands with high habitat values, freshwater shorelands, and rare and exemplary natural communities.\" \u2022 LND6-2: \"Increase the acreage of protected land containing significant habitats in the NH coastal watershed through fee acquisition or conservation easements by 2010.\" \u2022 LND6-4: \"Increase the use of buffers around wildlife areas and maintain habitat blocks in the NH coastal watershed by 2010.\"\nAs of 2001, there were 282 unfragmented blocks greater than 250 acres in the coastal watershed. The majority of the blocks are less than 1000 acres in size. There are only 4 blocks greater than 5000 acres (Table 15). Figure 19 shows the locations of the unfragmented blocks in the coastal watershed. Ten percent (10%) of the blocks are currently protected from development.  The objective for this supporting variable is to track the percentage of known rare and exemplary natural communities in the coastal watershed that exist on land protected from development. The NH Natural Heritage Bureau (NHB) will be the primary data source for this indicator. The following monitoring question will be addressed: \u2022 \"Has the acreage of permanently protected important habitats (\u2026rare and exemplary natural communities\u2026.) significantly changed over time?\" which will, in turn, report on progress toward the following management objectives: \u2022 LND6-1: \"By 2005, determine the existing acres of permanently protected land in the NH coastal watershed in the following categories: tidal shoreland, large contiguous forest blocks, wetlands with high habitat values, freshwater shorelands, and rare and exemplary natural communities.\" \u2022 LND6-2: \"Increase the acreage of protected land containing significant habitats in the NH coastal watershed through fee acquisition or conservation easements by 2010.\" \u2022 LND6-4: \"Increase the use of buffers around wildlife areas and maintain contiguous habitat blocks in the NH coastal watershed by 2010.\" b. Measurable Goals Since rare and exemplary natural communities is a supporting variable that will not be used to answer an management question, no goals have been set.\nThe results of the NHB analysis are shown in Table 16. Approximately one-quarter of the NHB records are on protected lands. Protected lands are parcels that are mostly undeveloped and that are protected from future development. However, they may be managed for uses (e.g., timber extraction or off-road vehicle use) that can have negative impacts on rare species and exemplary natural communities. Only 7% of the coastal watershed is covered by protected lands (see \"Conservation Lands\" indicator). The high rate at which NHB records collocate with conservation lands is probably due to targeted natural resource assessments on conservation lands.  (2000). This indicator will directly report on progress toward the following management objective: \u2022 RST1-1A: Increase acreage of restored estuarine habitats by 2010: Restore 300 acres of salt marsh with tidal restrictions. and partially answer the following monitoring question: \u2022 Have restoration efforts resulted in a significant increase in the acreage of tidal or freshwater wetlands? b. Measurable Goal The goal is to restore 300 acres of salt marsh by 2010.\nThere has been significant progress toward the goal of restoring 300 acres between 2000 and 2010. The current tally of restored salt marsh by tidal restriction removal since 1/1/2000 is 176.5 acres (59%). Many more salt marsh restoration projects were completed before 2000. The NH Coastal Program is currently planning another 129 acres of salt marsh restoration by tidal restriction removal, which, if completed, would surpass the NHEP goal.

In 2001, an eelgrass mitigation project for the US Army Corps of Engineers was completed in Little Harbor. Eelgrass was transplanted over 5.5 acres. The restoration was monitored for one year following the transplant and found to be successful. However, because the impetus for this project was to replace eelgrass beds that were destroyed, it is not appropriate to consider this project a \"restoration\". A smaller, community-based project was attempted in South Mill Pond in 2000. Eelgrass was transplanted over twenty frames (0.25 m 2 /frame). None of the transplants survived. Therefore, there have been no successful eelgrass restoration projects since 1/1/2000.\nThe only oyster reef restoration project conducted since 1/1/2000 was the construction of a set of experimental reefs in the Salmon Falls River by UNH in May and October 2000 (Grizzle et al, 2003). One of the reefs was constructed from transplanted native oysters from the Upper Piscataqua River. The other reef was seeded with disease-resistant oyster strains. The intent was not to increase reef acreage but rather to test two possible methods that might be used in larger scale efforts. The constructed reefs have persisted for over two years but only cover 0.12 acres (<1% of the NHEP goal). A major impediment to oyster restoration efforts in the Great Bay is the ongoing oyster mortality due to MSX infections in native oysters."}, {"section_title": "c. Data Analysis, Statistical Methods and Hypothesis", "text": "Data on juvenile fish abundance was provided by fish counts from standardized beach seine hauls conducted by NHF&G for the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act . The data were analyzed several ways. First, the average catch per unit effort (CPUE) for the most abundant species was calculated and compared to the range of observations from previous years. The geometric mean CPUE for all months combined for the selected species was taken from the annual reports by NHF&G. Results from Great Bay/Little Bay, the Piscataqua River, Little Harbor and Hampton Harbor were averaged separately because these areas have different environments with different fish assemblages. The average CPUE for each species in each area was compared to the range of all the previous observations. Second, the Simpson diversity index (D) was calculated based on the counts of all juvenile fish species caught during the season. The equation for the Simpson index (Simpson, 1949) is: where p i is the proportion of each species i in the community, n i is the number of fish collected for species i and N is the total number of fish collected. The CPUE values reported by NHF&G were multiplied by the effort required to capture one fish of the least abundant species and then rounded to the closest integer to transform the data into a format compatible with this equation. Third, the species richness index (S) was calculated. The species richness index is simply the number of species observed each year."}, {"section_title": "Returns of River Herring to NH Coastal Tributaries", "text": "1 9 7 2 1 9 7 5 1 9 7 8 1 9 8 1 1 9 8 4 1 9 8 7 1 9 9 0 1 9 9 3 1 9 9 6 1 9 9 9  1 9 8 3 1 9 5 1 9 8 7 1 9 8 9 1 9 9 1 1 9 9 3 1 9 9 5 1 9 9 7 1 9 9 9 2 0 0 1"}, {"section_title": "Number of Fish", "text": "\nCocheco River\nLamprey River  1 9 7 8 1 9 8 0 1 9 8 2 1 9 8 4 1 9 8 6 1 9 8 8 1 9 9 0 1 9 9 2 1 9 9 4 1 9 9 6 1 9 9 8 2 0 0 0 CPUE (fish/angler hour) (1) (1)   2500( 1)   2662(1) 1547"}, {"section_title": "WINNICUT RIVER TAYLOR RIVER LAMPREY RIVER OYSTER RIVER EXETER RIVER COCHECO RIVER", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Lamprey River", "text": "Exeter River  1 9 9 2 1 9 9 3 1 9 9 4 1 9 9 5 1 9 9 6 1 9 9 7 1 9 9 8 1 9 9 9 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 1"}, {"section_title": "Cocheco River", "text": "(1) 2 0 0 1 1 9 9 9 1 9 9 7 1 9 9 5 1 9 9 3 1 9 9 1 1 9 8 9 1 9 8 7 1 9 8 5 1 9 8 1 9 8 1"}, {"section_title": "Number of fish", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "HAB9.

This goal is consistent with the NH Everlasting campaign of the Society for the Protection of NH Forests which calls for 25% of each town to be protected in the next 25 years (SPNHF, 2001). The goal is also compatible with the Gulf of Maine Council on the Marine Environment's goal to protect an additional 5,000 acres in \"coastal communities\" (i.e., towns that border salt water) by 2006 (GOMC, 2002).
