[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract | Our understanding of the importance of blood vessels and angiogenesis in cancer has increased considerably over the past decades, and the assessment of tumour vessel calibre and structure has become increasingly important for in vivo monitoring of therapeutic response. The preferred method for in vivo imaging of most solid cancers is MRI, and the concept of vessel-calibre MRI has evolved since its initial inception in the early 1990s. Almost a quarter of a century later, unlike traditional contrast-enhanced MRI techniques, vessel-calibre MRI remains widely inaccessible to the general clinical community. The narrow availability of the technique is, in part, attributable to limited awareness and a lack of imaging standardization. Thus, the role of vessel-calibre MRI in early phase clinical trials remains to be determined. By contrast, regulatory approvals of antiangiogenic agents that are not directly cytotoxic have created an urgent need for clinical trials incorporating advanced imaging analyses, going beyond traditional assessments of tumour volume. To this end, we review the field of vessel-calibre MRI and summarize the emerging evidence supporting the use of this technique to monitor response to anticancer therapy. We also discuss the potential use of this biomarker assessment in clinical imaging trials and highlight relevant avenues for future research."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "An abnormal vasculature characterized by disorganized, permeable and dilated vessels is a hallmark of cancer tissue. 1, 2 Unlike the ordered microcirculatory arrangement of blood vessels found in normal tissue, the heterogeneous tumour vascular bed comprises a chaotic network of mixed vessel types, from small-calibre, capillary-like vessels to oversized and permeable post-capillary venulelike vessels, and vascular malformations. The formation of vessels with a wide spectrum of calibres-that is, the crosssectional width of the vessel-in cancer tissue is attributed to compression of the vessel walls by tumour and host cells, as well as vessel dilatation owing to imbalance between proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] The formation and development of abnormal tumour vessels have pivotal roles in the progression of cancers towards metastatic phenotypes and in determining the success of anticancer therapy. 5, 8 Whereas contrast-enhanced MRI is generally considered the gold standard clinical approach for in vivo radiographic imaging assessment of the structural and haemodynamic status of solid tumours, 9 vessel-calibre MRI has emerged as a potentially useful approach for clinical trial response monitoring only over the past decade and is not widely established. With the advent of antivascular and antiangiogenic therapies that seem to be cytostatic rather than predominantly cytotoxic and, therefore, do not simply result in decreased tumour sizes, traditional assessment of radiographic response and progression-free survival according to MRI-based tumour-volume criteria can no longer be considered an adequate biomarker of therapeutic response. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Herein, we provide a comprehensive and critical review of vessel-calibre assessment by MRI. We present a historical overview, ranging from the early development of this approach to current clinical trials, and explain the basic concepts underlying the technique. We summarize the proangiogenic and antiangiogenic influences that determine the structure of tumour vasculature, and explain how blood vessels can be imaged in vivo using MRI protocols. In addition, we discuss potential reasons for the lack of uptake of this methodology, and provide recommendations for imaging that we believe will enable realization of the full potential of vessel calibre as a biomarker in clinical trials. Finally, we highlight key advancements and future directions relating to vessel-calibre MRI.\ndescription of these aspects is outside the scope of this Review. Nevertheless, we provide a brief overview of the relevant mechanisms that directly affect tumour-vessel calibres in the following sections."}, {"section_title": "The vasculature of solid cancers", "text": "For a tumour to grow beyond a few millimeters in diameter, the formation and remodelling of new blood vessels is essential. 16 Growth of the tumour vasculature is thought to occur in a variety of ways that includes: use of the preexisting host vasculature (vessel co-option); growth of new vessels as branches from existing vessels (sprouting angiogenesis); splitting of existing blood vessels to form new branches (intussusception); de novo formation of blood vessels independent of existing vessels, either comprising endothelial cells (vasculogenesis) or tumour cells in the absence of endothelial cells and fibroblasts (vascular mimicry); and transdifferentiation of tumour cells into endothelial cells. 5 Initially, many tumours grow by vessel co-option; however, at some point an angiogenic switch occurs that leads to overproduction of proangiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2) and chemokines, which in turn leads to new vessel formation and vessel maturation ( Figure 1) . 1, 5, 17 The new vessels are predominantly immature and abnormal (overdilated, hyperpermeable, tortuous and disrupted), resulting in variable perfusion; 2,7 some tumour tissues receive too much blood, whereas others do not receive enough and are, therefore, starved of oxygen and nutrients. 2, 7 In parallel, solid stress imparted by proliferating cancer cells, stromal cells and the extracellular matrix can lead to compression of vessels, reducing blood flow ( Figure 1) . 3, 4, 20, 21 Consequently, the tumour vascular bed is spatially and temporally heterogeneous with regard to multiple vessel parameters, not least vessel calibre, which creates an irregular microenvironment that adversely affects drug delivery and introduces variation in cellular responses to therapeutic agents, resulting in decreased efficacy of cancer therapy. 8 Indeed, this microenvironment is characterized by hypoxia (low oxygen concentration), 22, 23 low pH, increased solid stress 4, 20 and high interstitial fluid pressure 24 -factors that can all contribute to tumour progression and resistance to various treatments (such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy). 8, 21 Cancer therapies that affect vessel calibres Treatments for cancer not only affect cancer cells, but also have broader effects on the tumour microenvironment, including the vasculature. Following radiation treatment, oxygen-deprived tumour tissue might become reoxygenated owing to radiation-induced death of surrounding radiosensitive and oxygen-rich cell populations that were previously obstructing nearby tumour blood vessels. 5 This alteration in the microvascular environment could potentially lead to decompression of tumour vessels, increased vessel calibres and increased perfusion of tumour tissues. 23 In addition, some chemotherapeutic drugs might kill prolifer ating endothelial cells and, therefore, act as antiangiogenic agents, 17 with the possible consequence of modifying blood-vessel calibres. Clearly, distinguishing treatment-related changes in tumour-vessel calibres from the alterations induced by tumour growth is important for patient management and clinical trial design.\nBlocking angiogenesis was initially proposed as a strategy to starve tumours of blood flow and halt the delivery of nutrients required for cell survival, growth and proliferation. 25 However, the therapeutic potential of antiangiogenic agents also seems to be attributable to mechanisms other than simple destruction and 'pruning' of the tumour vasculature; 8 Jain and colleagues 1, 26, 27 have proposed that antiangiogenic agents can transiently normalize the tumour vasculature, converting the heterogeneous, abnormally dilated and hyperpermeable vessels to a more-efficient state that results in improved blood perfusion and decreased vessel diameters. This effect might create a window of opportunity during which various concomitantly administered therapies (radiation, chemotherapy or immunotherapy, for example) are likely to be most effective. 27, 28 Additionally, antiangiogenic therapy could potentially disrupt the vascular cancerstem-cell niche. 17 Probably, a range of mechanisms are in fact operative at different time periods during antiangiogenic therapy; thus, the proposed diverse mechanisms of action are unlikely to be mutually exclusive. 17, 29 Challenges to antiangiogenic therapy Heterogeneity within an individual tumour, as well as among and across cancer types, suggests that each tumour responds differently to therapies depending on the biology of the component cancer-cell populations and their microenvironment. 6 As is true for cancercell-directed therapies, some tumours are intrinsically resistant and others develop resistance to antiangiogenic therapies. 5, 18 Tumours can develop resistance by upregulating distinct compensatory proangiogenic pathways that can circumvent therapy, or might continue to grow because of the seeming inability of the antiangiogenic agent to prune established blood vessels. Both of these possibilities highlight the need for direct measurements of vascular response-or lack thereof. Furthermore, studies of a number of anti-VEGF agents have highlighted the importance of dosing regimens tailor ed to individual tumours and time-dependent drug scheduling. 28 Whereas low doses of anti-VEGF agents might induce vascular normalization and improve the delivery of adjuvant therapies, high doses might result in an excessive decrease in the number of functional tumour blood vessel pathways and, therefore, compromise drug delivery. 8 For example, in patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer, tumour perfusion and the net influx rate of docetaxel, a taxane targeting the microtubular network, were reduced within 5 h after administration of a 15 mg/kg dose of the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab. 30 A lower dose of bevacizumab might have had the opposite effect according to the concept of vascular normalization, although this possibility remains to be proven in patients. In two mouse models of breast cancer, 31 low doses (5 mg/kg) of an anti-VEGFR2 antibody, DC101, increased perfusion of nanoparticles, whereas a higher dose (10 mg/kg) seemed to hinder tumour perfusion. Similarly, the size of the concomitantly administered therapeutic agent also seemed to be important in this study; the lower dose of DC101 was shown to reduce vessel diameters and improved the permeability of the tumour to 12 nm particles, but not 60 nm or 125 nm particles. 31 Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel), which is around 10 nm in size, was increased by DC101 treatment, whereas the outcome of therapy with doxil, which is approximately 100 nm in size, was not affected by this anti-VEGF agent; doxil and nab-paclitaxel had similar efficacy in the absence of DC101 therapy. These results suggest that selected doses of DC101 can induce a vascular normalization effect that increases tumour perfusion, but only to smaller molecules, possibly by creating a more homogeneous vasculature, but with smaller vessel-or 'pore'-diameters. In addition, a preclinical study of bevacizumab in mouse xenograft models of human ovarian and oesophageal cancers demonstrated decreased tumour uptake of trastuzumab and bevacizumab antibodies, and human immunoglobulin G, as well as reduced ex vivo mean vessel densities. 32 Thus, the dose of bevacizumab used in this study might have resulted in 'pruning' of too many blood vessels and caused a decrease in the size of vascular pores, owing to increased pericyte coverage, to below that of an antibody. 31 Together, these findings provide additional evidence of the gaps in our knowledge relating to the vascular responses to anticancer therapies that necessitate the development of assessments of vascular outcomes.\nThe dose-dependence of antiangiogenic agents has implications not only for conventional chemo therapeutics and low-molecular-weight targeted therapies, but also for the delivery of nanotherapeutics. Tumour blood vessels are more permeable to large molecules than many normal vessels, which provides an intriguing mechanism for selective delivery of macromolecules to tumours. 33 Moreover, large molecules are retained within tumours because of poor clearance by impaired lymphatic systems. These concepts are collectively known as enhanced permeability and retention (EPR). [34] [35] [36] [37] Successful outcomes of EPR-based nanotherapeutics will probably-similarly to conventional therapies-be governed by the tumour type as well as the dose and timing of concurrent antiangiogenic therapies. 35 Furthermore, because the extracellular matrix can also retard the penetration of nanotherapeutics in tumours, 38 improved delivery of nanoparticles might require normalization of both tumour vessel and the extracellular matrix. 8 Thus, vessel-calibre MRI might be equally important in optimizing and monitoring such approaches."}, {"section_title": "Traditional MRI in cancer therapy", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Conventional MRI in monitoring response", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Current approach", "text": "Use of conventional MRI for monitoring response to therapy in solid tumours has been reviewed extensively. 11, 12, 14, 15 In short, most aggressive pathological lesions are easily identified using T 1 -weighted MRI protocols after administration of a standard gadolinium-based contrast agent, on the basis of the increased vascularity and permeability of tumour vessels. T 1 -weighted images are sensitized to the longitu dinal magnetic-relaxation time of protons in water molecules (T 1 ), and paramagnetic contrast agents, such as gadolinium, increase the MRI signal intensity in the blood by shortening the T 1 -relaxation times. These images are usually complemented by T 2 -weighted MRI, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI ( Figure 2 ) and diffusion-weighted MRI for assessments of peritumoural oedema and changes in cellular density. 39, 40 Traditional T 2 -weighted images are sensitive to local inhomo geneity of the magnetic field, a phenomenon known as the 'magnetic susceptibility effect' , 41 which describes the tendency of fat, water and fluids to produce hyperintense signals whereas blood appears dark (hypointense). Definitions of the most-common terminologies used in vessel-calibre MRI are provided in Supplementary Table 1 online.\nFormalized imaging-based response criteria are usually based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines 42 -a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded initiative-that are applicable to data derived from MRI, CT and most other modalities used for noninvasive in vivo imaging. The aim of the RECIST criteria is to provide simple and objective m easures of therapeutic response based on assessment of the post-treatment change (or lack of change) in the longest in-plane diameters of target lesions located throughout the body (Supplementary Table 2) . A slightly different approach is used for the evaluation of tumours in the CNS, termed the MacDonald criteria, 43 which focus on indicators of response related to the extent (area) of contrast enhancement on imaging, cortico steroid dose, and clinical status. In 2010, the MacDonald criteria were updated by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group 11 to include changes in the non-enhancing lesion on FLAIR MRI; however, the definition of increased FLAIR hyper intensity is subjective and was not clearly defined in these guidelines (Supplementary Table 2 ), leading to variability in application of the RANO criteria."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of the current approach", "text": "The RECIST and RANO working groups acknowledged the inherent limitations associated with imaging-based response criteria focusing on tumour size alone; 42, [44] [45] [46] nevertheless, these criteria, which predominantly rely on radiographic measures of the response of tumours to therapy, are frequently criticized. [47] [48] [49] The controversy surrounding these guidelines includes debate over the definition of true radiographic response and whether response criteria should be based solely on anatomical tumour load or in conjunction with metrics that better reflect vascular or metabolic changes in the tumour. 47, 50, 51 In particular, the dynamic nature of the perfusion of vascularized lesions cannot be characterized accurately using traditional measurements of contrast-agentinduced signal enhancement alone, 9 whereas potential monitoring of the EPR effect will require quantitative measures of the permeability rate-constant. 35 Moreover, not all cancer types are expected to follow similar definitions of response; for example, obtaining repeated measurements in adherence with the RECIST criteria is difficult for localized or locally recurrent cancers of the prostate because of the location and small size of such tumours, whereas increased levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) are closely correlated with imminent radiographic progression and are, therefore, used widely as the preferred indicator of tumour status. 52 Whether the RECIST criteria reflect a meaningful end point of response to many specific antiangiogenic therapies also remains unclear. For example, although sunitinib treatment in hepatocellular carcinoma seems to cause tumour necrosis or cysts, no subsequent tumour shrinkage was observed in one study. 53 Furthermore, manually defined response criteria that are dependent solely on tumour size are prone to reader bias attributable to inconsistencies in the interpretation of irregular tumour edges, regional variations in contrast enhancement within surgical cavities and permeability changes resulting from radiotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy, as well as the lack of consensus in the type and dose of contrast agent used. 12, 54, 55 In addition, variations in positioning of the patient's head in the scanner between examinations can have a substantial influence on the reader's assessment of the data. Indeed, repeated assessment of therapeutic response using the RANO criteria was shown to return an intra-reader error rate of 22%, which might have resulted in patients without true tumour progression being incorrectly identified as having progressive disease, and could potentially have led to discontinuation of treatment or their removal from a clinical trial. 56 A transient, therapy-induced increase in radiographic oedema and contrast enhancement following radiotherapy, termed 'pseudoprogression' , has been the cause of much research and debate, especially in relation to brain tumours. 57 Radiotherapy has a profound effect on tumour blood-vessel morphology, inducing vasodilation, increased vascular permeability and oedema, 57, 58 that can resemble radiographic characteristics of tumour progression. However, unlike true disease progression, pseudoprogression is typically associated with reversion of MRI indications of tumour progression after a few weeks or months without any change in therapy. Of note, up to 30% of patients with intra-axial brain tumours show signs of pseudoprogression, 11, 57 and distinguishing these treatment-related changes from active tumour growth is critically important for patient management and the administration of clinical trials. By contrast, blockade of VEGF using antiangiogenic therapies can result in reduced tumour-vessel permeability and vasogenic oedema that enhances radiographic-response rates, but, unfortunately, this improvement does not always translate into increased survival. 13, 45 Thus, an urgent need exists, particularly in the setting of antivascular and antiangiogenic clinical trials, for validated methods and standards for assessment of tumour vascular structure and function beyond the current conventional MRI modalities. Before estimation of perfusion and vessel-calibre MRI parameters, the macrovessel (GE) and microvessel (SE) blood-volume relaxation rate images shown here are computed according to the relative decrease in MRI signal intensity over the course of a sequence of GE MRI and SE MRI images, respectively (images 30-34 in this case), thereby adjusting for baseline intensity values and image sampling time (echo time). The so-called 'first-pass effect' denotes the initial and transient passage of a relatively tight bolus of the contrast agent following intravenous administration of the agent and is observed as a peak in the relative relaxation rate signal (peaks for normal tissue approximately at image 32). The contrast agent first-pass effect is particularly dominant in large vessels in the macrovessel images because of high contrast agent concentrations combined with high sensitivity to the magnetic susceptibility effect induced by the agent. After the initial first-pass contrast agent passage, repeated passages of what remains of the circulating and increasingly dispersed contrast agent bolus can be appreciated as smaller and dissipating signal oscillations. c | Macrovessel and microvessel volume fractions are estimated from the area under the GE and SE first-pass curves (top left), respectively. The concept of vessel-calibre MRI stems from the relationship between increased macrovessel volume fractions for increasing vessel calibres, and microvessel volume fractions, which are selectively sensitive to small (radius <10 \u03bcm) vessel calibres (bottom left). Mean vessel density maps (Box 1) are thus derived from the quotient of macrovessel and microvessel volume fractions, whereas the vessel-calibre index also accounts for water diffusion and the absolute blood volume fraction.

A large number of early phase clinical trials have reported values of blood flow, blood volume, and permeability determined using perfusion MRI (recently reviewed in this journal 9 and elsewhere 63, 64 ). However, these data are beyond the scope of this Review, and we provide only a brief overview of relevance of this technique to vessel-calibre MRI.\nPerfusion imaging techniques are based on the central volume principle, 65 which states that in a closed flow system with a single inflow orifice and a single outflow orifice, the blood volume of a given tissue is equal to the constant rate of blood flow (volume of blood in tissue per unit time) multiplied by the mean transit time of the blood tracer (that is, the MRI contrast agent) passing through the capillary structure of the tissue. Two main contrast agent-based perfusion MRI techniques are available, depending on whether the acquisition is made using T 1 -sensitive or T 2 -sensitive imaging protocols. 66 In T 1 -weighted perfusion MRI, the signal intensity increases dynamically as a function of the local concentration of contrast agent; this technique is primarily used for estimating vessel permeability and is generally referred to as dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI. Alternatively, a T 2 -weighted perfusion MRI sequence is used for accurate measures of blood-flow rate, blood volume and vessel calibre following a rapid, intra venous injection of contrast agent. More specifically, rapid echo-planar imaging techniques, which enable imaging of the entire volume of interest within a few seconds, are typically employed. Using this approach, a decrease in the dynamic MRI signal intensity is observed following injection of contrast agent, as the echo-planar imaging technique is particularly sensitive to the magnetic suscepti bility effect ( Figure 2b ). Consequently, this imaging technique is referred to as dynamic s usceptibility c ontrast (DSC)-MRI (Supplementary Methods)."}, {"section_title": "Vessel-calibre MRI", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Basic concepts", "text": "In 1991, Fisel, Rosen and colleagues [67] [68] [69] at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA, pioneered the theoretical foundation for the vessel-calibre MRI technique. In a series of studies, [67] [68] [69] these researchers used Monte Carlo simulations to provide evidence that T 2 -weighted perfusion MRI images were sensitive to the vessel-sizerelated scale of the magnetic susceptibility effect created by blood and contrast agents flowing through vessels. This initial work was performed in conjunction with substantial efforts to understand MRI signal alterations resulting from changes in oxyhaemoglobin concentrations in blood. 70, 71 These initiatives were followed by comprehensive models for quantification of magnetic susceptibility effects in vivo. [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] The first image representative of the use of the vessel-calibre technique in cancer, specifically a rat C6 glioma xenograft model, was reported in 1998 by Dennie and collegues. 77 19 days after cell implantation, the gliomas showed evidence of a 90% increase in the average vessel diameter compared with adjacent normal grey matter. The first clinical experience of this technique was reported in 2000 by Donahue and colleagues, who published vessel-calibre images of 15 patients with intracranial tumours; a positive correlation between average vessel calibres and tumour grade was also demonstrated. 78 Although vessel-calibre MRI was conceptualized >20 years ago and can provide a direct link between tumour vascular status and therapeutic response, 5 the technique has received limited attention in the literature on perfusion MRI. 9, 63, 66, [79] [80] [81] One important reason for this apparent deficit is the complex image acquisition process used in vessel-calibre MRI, which has hindered the technique from becoming readily accessible to the general clinical community. 59 The methodology necessitates the acquisition of images using both gradientecho and spin-echo protocols (Figure 2b ). This approach enables relative (unitless) measures of average vessel diameters and average vessel densities for arteries, capillaries, and veins combined to be estimated in each image pixel using the quotient of gradient-echo blood volumes to spin-echo blood volumes (Box 1). 82 Efforts have also been made to quantify the average vessel calibre in an image voxel (in \u03bcm), which is often referred to as the vessel size index (VSI), using a weighted average of vessel calibres and accounting for water diffusion and the absolute blood volume fraction. [82] [83] [84] [85] These measurements are possible because of the high sensitivity of the gradient-echo sequence to the magnetic susceptibility effect in both small (radius <10 \u03bcm) and large (radius >10 \u03bcm) vessel calibres, whereas the spin-echo sequence has an extra imaging component that minimizes the magnetic susceptibility effect for large-calibre vessels and is, therefore, selectively sensitive to detection of small calibre vessels (Supplementary Methods). 73, 74 Henceforth, for simplicity, the gradient-echo images will be referred to as 'macrovessel' (also referred to as total blood volume 86, 87 ) images and the spin-echo images as 'microvessel' images. For standard clinical contrast agent dosages, Q is independent of the contrast agent concentration. www.nature.com/nrclinonc Currently, three distinctly different analytical approaches to vessel-calibre MRI have been described, each having dedicated imaging protocols, caveats and postprocessing routines (Table 1) . Firstly, a common approach is the direct assessment of the point-by-point difference in the macrovessel and microvessel DSC-MRI signal-intensity curves following injection of a lowmolecular-weight (hydrodynamic diameter of <10 nm) gadolinium-based contrast agent (Figure 2c ). [73] [74] [75] 77, 88, 89 Secondly, vessel calibres can be estimated from macrovessel and microvessel imaging readouts before and after injection of super-paramagnetic iron-oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles, which are particularly useful in evaluating permeable cancer blood vessels outside the CNS. 77, 85, 90, 91 Because most ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron-oxide molecules have diameters of approximately 30 nm, 92 SPIO-based agents are restricted to the intravascular space and might, therefore, more accurately reflect the average vessel calibre compared with contrast agents that leak out from the intravascular to the extravascular space (such as gadolinium-based agents). The relative long half-life of SPIO-based agents (up to approximately 24 hours) 92 also increases the image signal-to-noise ratio. 93 Finally, vessel-calibre MRI in the brain can also be acquired without the use of contrast agents, simply by stimulating the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) effect in both macrovessel and microvessel images (so-called BOLD-VSI; Supplementary Methods). 70, 94, 95 Compared with baseline signal intensities, image contrast is attributable to a change in the level of deoxygenated blood from brain activation stimuli or by normoxic or carbogen gas challenges. As this approach relies on the assessment of deoxygenated blood volume fractions, the method can provide a measure of apparent tissue oxygenation levels, 96 but is inherently limited to measures of venous vessel calibres. 95 Because vessel calibres can be estimated from macrovessel and microvessel MRI before and after injection of a tracer, or by BOLD-VSI, the vessel-calibre technique can be readily implemented in the clinic using commonly available sequences. 83, 97 Alternatively, for a combined simultaneous macrovessel-microvessel DSC-MRI readout, 89 most if not all major manufacturers of MRI apparatus provide dedicated image protocols upon request through their research and development programmes."}, {"section_title": "Vessel size index (VSI)", "text": "Assumptions underlying the calibre estimates Vessel-calibre MRI is performed according to certain assumptions that in most clinical scenarios hold true. However, a few considerations specific to estimating vessel calibre in tumours need to be highlighted (Table 1) . 85 First, as noted by Tropr\u00e8s and colleagues in 2001, 83 reliable average VSI estimations (in \u03bcm) are difficult to obtain and must be interpreted with care, appreciating the complex relationships between macrovessel and microvessel blood volume and diffusion. A correct proportionality constant that accurately scales the MRIbased vessel-calibre estimate with the true vessel calibre and tissue blood volume is not currently available. 84, 98 Also, owing to the additional influence of the relaxation rate of deoxygenated blood on the T 2 relaxation rate and signal intensities, the relationship between tissue oxygenation and the absolute vessel-calibre estimate is not straightforward in pathological conditions with impaired oxygen saturation levels, and warrants further investigations in the context of cancer therapy. 73, 99 The accuracy of the VSI estimate should, however, improve with the use of higher magnetic-field strengths (>3 Tesla [3T]) and of dedicated ultrafast MRI measures of the arterial inflow, 100 and as better approximations of the relationship between the MRI signal and true blood volume values are established. 83, 94 Thus, the current clinical hardware and imaging protocols limit the traditional VSI estimate to vessel radii considered larger than 'very small' (>2 \u03bcm) but smaller than 'very large' (<50 \u03bcm). 94, 101, 102 The range of vessel calibres that can be acceptably defined using BOLD-VSI is probably even narrower because of the inherent small changes in magnetic susceptibility during activation of the target tissue. 94 Second, SPIO-based agents 90, 103 are currently restricted to off-label use and should be applied with care because they have been associated with adverse effects, including allergic reactions, back pain and, in some extreme cases, cardiovascular events. 104, 105 Although good agreement (r 2 ~0.8-0.9) has been observed between gadoliniumbased VSI and SPIO-based VSI estimates, similarly high agreements might not be seen in direct comparisons of the macrovessel and microvessel parameter values obtained using the two agents owing to differences in the image acquisition protocols (Table 1) . 106 Third, unlike intravascular SPIO agents, gadolinium leaks out of the blood vessels into the interstitium, necessitating permeability compensation. Such compensation can be achieved using time-accelerated imaging t echniques combined with multiple macrovessel image readouts, 85, 107 preloading of a small gadolinium dose 106, 108 or by rigorous post-processing corrections of the DSC-MRI signal curves (Supplementary Methods)."}, {"section_title": "109-111", "text": "Finally, whereas contrast-agent-based MRI vesselcalibre estimates typically provide values for static mean vessel calibres, Packard and colleagues used partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) challenges to show that tumours have decreased vascular reactivity, and that the native cerebral vasculature might also be dilated and constricted in response to transient or local changes in the PaCO 2 .\n86 BOLD-VSI analyses based on gas challenges is also influenced by vasodilation. 101 Increased cerebral vasodilation and flow is observed for hypercapnia (abnormally elevated CO 2 concentrations in the blood), whereas the opposite effect is seen in hypocapnia (low blood CO 2 levels); 112 however, the effects of gas-induced vasodilation on blood volume and, therefore, BOLD-VSI are not fully understood, 101 although venous volume f ractions seem to be relatively unaffected by vasodilation. 113 Validation of vessel-calibre MRI in cancer Vessel-calibre MRI has been extensively validated against histology as well as other imaging modalities, such as ex vivo micro-CT and in vivo two-photon micro scopy, to determine the value of MRI-based vessel-calibre measure ments as a sensitive biomarker for cancer imaging (Supplementary Table 3 ). Absolute average MRI-determined vessel calibres tend to be slightly overestimated compared with histological vessel-calibre measurements, probably because of the incomplete understanding of the relationship between the blood MRI signal and the underlying physiology. Alternatively, the histological data might have been underestimated as a result of vessel collapse during cryosectioning (Supplementary Methods). 83, 114 However, this differential between MRI and histological measurements seems to be relatively constant, with a subsequent strong correlation between the ratios of vessel calibres in tumour and reference tissue derived using each method ( 118 The validity of vessel-calibre MRI in mice bearing xenografts of poorly vascularized melanomas and highly vascular hemangioendotheliomas have been confirmed using both immunohistology and two-photon microscopy. 118 In addition, Ungersma et al. 119 used a HM7 colorectal tumour model to demonstrate strong correlations between vessel calibres and between vessel densities determined using MRI, histology and micro-CT. Models of bone metastasis from breast cancer cell lines also show the same trend in MRI-derived and h istological vessel calibres during a ntiangiogenic therapy. 120 Collectively, these studies provide corroborating evidence that MRI-determined vessel calibres can serve as a surrogate marker of the microvasculature of cancers. Although a quantitative correction that enables accurate determination of physiologically correct vessel calibres by MRI is currently unavailable, reasonably accurate vessel-calibre ratios between tumour and normal tissue can be expected using this approach. Nevertheless, for vessel-calibre MRI and perfusion MRI to develop beyond expensive boutique methods, the true role and added value of these imaging techniques in clinical trials will remain unanswered until proper validation has been achieved in large, m ulticentre studies."}, {"section_title": "9,64,121", "text": "Vessel-calibre MRI in human cancers In keeping with the substantial increase in preclinical studies on vessel-calibre MRI over the past decade, the number of clinical studies is also increasing, providing data on vessel-calibre MRI in cancer, stroke and hypercapnia (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary  Table 4 ). To date, vessel-calibre MRI studies in human cancers have focused on optimization of imaging and acquiring vessel-calibre measurements comparable to those in the literature (Table 3) ."}, {"section_title": "Clinical studies in CNS cancers", "text": "Unsurprisingly, considering the well-developed kinetic models for vascular tissue of the CNS, 122 ,123 the first human vessel-calibre MRI data in cancer were of intracranial tumours.

In parallel, Kiselev, Breyer, Xu and their colleagues 84,126-128 also presented supporting data from patients with brain lesions across several publications between 2003 to 2013; higher average MRI vessel calibres were reported in 20 intracerebral tumours (84 \u00b1 73 \u03bcm) compared with adjacent white matter (32 \u00b1 10 \u03bcm) and grey matter (34 \u00b1 8 \u03bcm) tissue, 126 and a wider range of vessel calibres were observed in glioblastomas compared with lower grade gliomas. 84 These findings have also been confirmed in 31 patients at a higher clinical magnetic-field strength-3T, as opposed to 1.5T. 127 At Massachusetts General Hospital, prior to administration of targeted therapies, abnormal and dilated vessel calibres were observed using MRI in a range of glioma grades, 129 recurrent glioblastomas 99,130,131 and newly diagnosed glioblastomas. 132 An almost threefold increase in average tumour-vessel calibres compared with whole-brain normal-appearing tissue was detected in 30 patients with recurrent glioblastomas (21 \u00b1 6 \u03bcm versus 8 \u00b1 1 \u03bcm), 99 and in two separate cohorts comprising 40 and 14 patients with newly diagnosed, untreated glioblastomas (24 \u00b1 15 \u03bcm versus 8 \u00b1 2 \u03bcm, and 33 \u00b1 20 \u03bcm versus 11 \u00b1 5 \u03bcm, respectively), 132 confirming the findings of Kiselev and colleagues. 126 Owing to refinements to the acquisition methods used in these studies, 99, 132 including the use of a pre-dose injection of contrast agent to saturate the tissue and arterial input function normalization, 83, 126 the absolute vessel-calibre values were lower compared with those reported by Kiselev et al. 126 Although this inconsistency emphasizes the need for caution when considering absolute vesselcalibre values (Table 1) , data from the Massachusetts General Hospital show low intrapatient variations in MRI-derived tumour-vessel calibres. 133 The vessel calibres in normal-appearing tissue are also in good agreement with the findings of a study involving healthy volunteers and the use of an intravascular SPIO contrast agent (12-13 \u00b1 2-3 \u03bcm). 93 "}, {"section_title": "Clinical studies in non-CNS cancers", "text": "L\u00fcdemann and colleagues 134 used MRI with a gadolinium-based contrast agent to compare vessel calibres in untreated prostate cancer tissue from 13 patients to peripheral normal-appearing tissue from the same patients, and observed a trend towards larger vessel diameters in tumour tissues; the prostate vasculature had heterogeneous signatures across patients, with a wide range of vessel diameters in tumours (112 \u00b1 158 \u03bcm) and normal-appearing tissues (105 \u00b1 205 \u03bcm). 134 The reprodu cibility of vessel-calibre MRI has also been evalu ated in a pleomorphic sarcoma in the left pubic bone; stabil ity over a 6-min acquisition window (4-5 \u03bcm) was high and, more importantly, vessel-calibre estimates were independent of dilution of the contrast agent. 85 Fredrickson et al. 103 successfully evaluated the feasibility of SPIO-based mean vessel density estimations using vessel-calibre MRI protocols (Box 1) in patients with colorectal liver metastases. Overall, the tracer kinetics of intravascular SPIO contrast agents and the sub sequent uptake in the reticuloendothelial system of the liver and spleen over time does not seem to affect the vessel-calibre estimates in healthy and tumour tissues outside the CNS during the typical image acquisition period and at clinical m agnetic-field strengths (\u22651.5T). 85, 106, 135, 136 "}, {"section_title": "Vessel-calibre MRI in clinical trials", "text": "Lessons learnt from preclinical studies Changes in vessel calibres determined using MRI compared with control or pretreatment values have been evaluated for a double-digit number of therapies in small rodent cancer models (Table 4) .

To the best of our knowledge, Massachusetts General Hospital is the only institution that has reported on vessel-calibre MRI data obtained during antiangiogenic therapy in clinical studies (Table 3 ). In two phase II clinical trials of cediranib that enrolled 30 patients with recurrent glioblastomas, 158 and 40 patients with newly diagnosed glio blastomas, 159 our data demonstrated substantial reductions in abnormal macrovessel and microvessel calibres within tumours as early as 1 day after administration of this VEGFR inhibitor (Figure 3) . 99, 130, 132 In the patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas who responded to therapy, the reduction in tumour-vessel calibres was sustained throughout the 6-week period of cediranib treatment combined with temozolomide chemotherapy (75 mg/m 2 ) and radiotherapy (2 Gy per day). 132 Furthermore, reduced tumour permeability and increased tumour perfusion were seen in up to half of the patients included in these studies. 99, 130, 132 These findings are in line with the vascular normalization hypothesis, 26, 160 and were also reflected in increased overall survival. 132 However, after the 6-week period of antiangio genic and adjuvant therapy, vessel normalization was reversed and relapse of vasogenic oedema was observed in most patients, 132 suggesting an end to the vascular normalization window. In a contemporary control study 161 in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas undergoing an identical MRI and chemoradiotherapy regimen, but without cediranib, reduced tumour-vessel calibres were only observed in one out of 14 patients (Supplementary Figure 2) . 132 These promising findings at our institution are in contrast to randomized phase III trials of cediranib in recurrent glioblastomas 162 and also trials of bevacizumab in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (AVAglio and RTOG 0825 trials 163, 164 ) that failed to show an overall survival benefit. On the basis of radiological response alone (according to a modified version of the MacDonald criteria) or in combination with improved neurological status, progression-free survival was prolonged after bevacizumab and chemoradiation (temozolomide) therapy in the AVAglio study, but not the RTOG 0825 study. 165 These disappointing effects of antiangiogenic therapy on survival indicate that the use of some targeted therapies is probably not favourable or ideal in unselected groups of patients with cancer and, in light of the findings from Massachusetts General Hospital, also suggests that imaging para meters from conventional MRI are inadequate biomarkers of response.\nSuggestions for vessel-calibre MRI in trials A number of key elements determine the success of a cancer-imaging clinical trial, including selection of an appropriate set of biomarkers for monitoring response to the therapy being studied, optimal imaging time points, and the use of a well-designed image acquisition proto col and correct methods of data analysis. Although advanced MRI is not part of the RECIST criteria, 42 the NCI Cancer Imaging Program does provide a set of guidelines for the application of advanced imaging modalities in clinical trials, including suggestions for DCE-MRI (for measuring tissue permeability). 166 We support these efforts to provide guidance to researchers, and complement these consensus guidelines with our suggestions for use of vessel-calibre MRI in the initial phases of trial design for studies of antiangiogenic and vascular-targeting agents (Box 2).\nIn short, the design of imaging trials is critically dependent on at least one baseline scan as close as possible to initiation of therapy, which should be followed by a second scan within the first days of therapy for assessment of early therapeutic response. 29 For studies of targeted therapies, repeated weekly or monthly follow-up imaging assessment is ideal-although counterbalanced by patient burden and costs-to observe the responses and plateaus in the various advanced-MRI parameters used, and to identify the end of the vascular normalization period (Figure 4) . 8 Because of the apparent sensitivity of the technique to changes in vascularization, vessel-calibre MRI seems to have the potential to inform personalized therapy and to enable the optimal window of vascular normalization and potentially, therefore, drug administration to be determined in individual patients.\nTo achieve a sufficiently large patient population over a relatively short period of time (typically 1-3 years), presently, most clinical trials are multi-institutional studies. As discussed by others, and although logistically challenging, a multicentre study design is essentially the only way of assessing the real physical pro cess of therapeutic intervention independent of institutional variations. 64, 121 With some exceptions, 167, 168 vessel-calibre MRI-similar to most advanced imaging methods-suffers from lack of multicentre validation when applied alone in a research setting, or as part of a clinical trial. With careful planning, 121 vessel-calibre MRI is no more difficult to perform during a clinical trial than conventional contrast-enhanced MRI. Before the trial commences, multicentre variability in scanner performance and post-processing routines , and oedema was subsequently reduced (yellow arrowhead; day 50). Treatment effects of antiangiogenic and adjuvant combination therapy were also observed after the end of CRT (up to day 400); however, the cancer eventually relapsed and progressed, although this outcome is not clear using standard contrast and FLAIR MRI protocols. Volume fractions and vessel calibres show reductions that are related to the responses observed by conventional contrast-enhanced and FLAIR MRI following therapy (white arrow; day 50), but the vessel-calibre response also reveals unique properties of tissue that do not match the spatial distribution of the volume-fraction map. In contrast to the major vessels identified by standard MRI angiography (bottom panels), the vessel-calibre map depicts changes in the tumour microvasculature that are well below the image resolution achievable using the conventional approach; note the increased vessel calibres in the relapsed tumour region (white arrowhead; day 400), which is not easily appreciated on conventional MRI nor on the volume-fraction map.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) phantom programme 169 is dedicated to this purpose, and has the added advantage of a centralized imaging-standard review process, which can reduce errors that contribute to quantitative imprecision. Indeed, this collaborative agreement was shown to identify MRI system failures that, if not corrected for, might have contributed to up to 25% imprecision in quantitative m easures across institutions. Most importantly, the ADNI demonstrates that multi centre imaging standardization is achievable. For vesselcalibre MRI in particular, sufficient image quality with high signal-to-noise should be established early in the trial development processes in a small pilot study, before deciding on a standardized imaging protocol that should be used across multiple centres. Protocols should also capitalize on existing scanner-based and postprocessing software solutions to minimize the effects of imperfect patient positioning in the scanner, stochastic or free-breathing movements, as well as extravasation of gadolinium-based contrast agents (Supplementary Method s)."}, {"section_title": "12,134,170", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Future directions", "text": "The most-pressing issue for imaging-response criteria for targeted therapies is the need for the introduction and validation of advanced imaging beyond the current RECIST and RANO criteria. 11, 42, 171 Future updated response criteria should include volumetric measurements, dynamic imaging and molecular imaging. The goals of these efforts are: firstly, smaller, cheaper, and selectively targeted patient populations for clinical trials; secondly, earlier and more-focused response assessments; and, thirdly, faster regulatory approvals of therapies than is currently possible for antiangiogenic and antivascular therapies.

However, for such composite biomarkers to have a role in clinical trials, they need to be validated in large, multi centre studies to overcome the 'curse of dimensionality' , which is the concept that multiple input parameters require large amounts of data to support physiologically and s tatistically sound conclusions. 173 Next-generation vessel architectural imaging Vessel architectural imaging (VAI), which exploits a temporal shift in the macrovessel MRI signal compared with the microvessel signal (Supplementary Methods), 84, 99, 128 has been introduced as a new concept in vessel-calibre MRI assessment of cancer therapy. 99 This effect was first observed by Kiselev et al. 84 in 2005 and was attributed to the high sensitivity of the macro vessel MRI signal for deoxygenated capillary and venous blood volume; thus, the temporal shift might reveal information on the vessel types present (arteries, capillaries, or veins), as well as the relative difference in radii and oxygen saturation levels between these vessel types. 93, 95, 99, 145 The highly intriguing link between this effect and oxygen saturation is in line with the BOLD effect, 174 as well as numerical modelling by Jespersen et al. 175 showing that heterogeneous perfusion from torturous microvessels and capillaries, resulting in varying contrast-agent arrival times and mean transit times, influences the maximum oxygen extraction fraction and the metabolic rate of oxygen use in tissues. In our imaging studies in trials of antiangiogenic therapy with cediranib, VAI revealed that overall survival duration was increased in 30-50% of patients with glioblastoma who had an observed reduction in abnormal tumour vessels, improved tumour perfusion, and normalization of the arteries-to-capillaries-to-veins branching hierarchy and oxygen saturation levels. 99, 132 We are currently exploring the use of VAI in other tumours types and organs, including brain metastases, and breast and kidney tumours (Supplementary Figure 3) . Importantly, an apparent wealth of information beyond a simple measure of the average vessel calibre can be obtained using VAI, such as tumour vascular structure and physiology."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The identification and interpretation of valid prognostic and predictive biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and assessment of therapeutic response is a major challenge in the field of oncology.

On the basis of our experience with cediranib, 99, 130, 132, 176 the initial responses, plateaus and reversals in tumour response that are observed using advanced MRI parameters occur at different timepoints after initiation of therapy. In this example model of tumour-vessel architecture, showing a typical vascularnormalization response after cediranib treatment and CRT in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas, 132 the perfusion estimate (blood flow) peaks after approximately 1 week of therapy (day 8), whereas the maximum reduction in vessel calibres occurs 1 week later (day 15; note the reduced diameter of the example vessels). These effects are preceded by an early, substantial, and prolonged normalization of the abnormal arterio-venous ratio evident in the model of the baseline data (day 1; arteries/arteriole shown in red, with veins in blue), estimated using vessel architectural imaging. Consistent with the vesselcalibre response, the apparent change in abnormal \u0394SO 2 levels reaches its minimum at two weeks (day 15; purple colour). After the end of CRT, all of these parameters reverse, thereby indicating an end to the vascular-normalization window. Furthermore, in patients who were deemed unresponsive to therapy, limited evidence of such responses was seen. Collectively, advanced MRI protocols might facilitate the design of improved early-phase trials by informing the optimization of the dosing regimen for antiangiogenic agents and could also potentially support a personalized-medicine approach by enabling therapy to be tailored to individual patients based on parameters indicative of biological and, in particular, vascular responses. In addition, early identification of patients who are unlikely to respond to therapy could help decision making regarding whether therapy should be discontinued, particularly in patients who experience adverse events.
