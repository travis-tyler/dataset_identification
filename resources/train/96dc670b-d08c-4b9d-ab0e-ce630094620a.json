The evidence that endothelial cells express a vitamin D receptor and possess the enzymatic system to convert the primary circulating form of vitamin D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D , to the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, has provided new working hypotheses into the function of this vitamin (3, 4) . Vitamin D influences endothelial and smooth muscle cell function by exerting antiproliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle (5) , mediates inflammation by regulating lymphocyte and monocytes/macrophage differentiation and release of inflammatory cytokines (6) , and modulates the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) (7) . This in turn might determine monocyte infiltration and cholesterol retention in the vascular wall contributing to the atherosclerotic process (8, 9) .\nThe aim of this project was to investigate the relationship between 25-OH D plasma levels and arterial stiffness, with the hypothesis that arterial stiffness [measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV)] is associated with vitamin D levels independent of age.

After adjusting for age, gender, race, and season of blood draw, the association between PWV and 25-OH D levels remained highly statistically significant (Table 3 , model 1). The association between PWV and 25-OH D levels remained unchanged after eGFR was added to the model (Table 3 , model 2). Similarly, this association remained significant after adjusting for physical activity level and a cardiovascular risk score (visceral obesity, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and diabetes; Table 3 , model 3). Finally, the association between PWV and 25-OH D levels still remained significant after adjusting for calcium and vitamin D supplements, serum calcium (Cac), and iPTH levels (Table 3, model 4). A 25-OH D by-sex and -race interaction term was also included in the fully adjusted model. The interaction term was not statistically significant, suggesting that the nature of association between PWV and 25-OH D levels is substantially similar among the sex group.

We studied a large multiethnic population over a wide age range and with a relatively low risk factors burden, and we used state-of-the art methods to assess arterial stiffness. These findings are in line with the well-established associations between vitamin D deficiency and a broad range of cardiovascular disorders and risk factors (1), providing a possible explanation of how lower vitamin D levels, by precipitating vascular stiffening, might predispose individuals to a higher risk for development of cardiovascular disease and adverse events. Arterial stiffness increases with advancing age (19) and is a powerful predictor of mortality and morbidity (20, 21) , hypertension (22) , and decline in cognitive function (23) . Accumulating evidence suggests that cardiovascular disease is associated with vitamin D deficiency. Various epidemiological studies have reported reduced 25-OH D concentrations in patients with previous and prevalent cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases (24, 25) . Population-based studies have partially, but not consistently, documented that poor vitamin D status is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality (26 -28) . Meta-analyses performed so far on this topic support the finding that low 25-OH D concentrations are associated with incident cardiovascular disease (29) . In this context, Grandi et al. (25) found that the risk of cardiovascular mortality was increased by 83% (hazard ratio, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.19 -2.80) in individuals with low 25-OH D levels. Data from randomized controlled trials are sparse and have partially, but not consistently, shown some beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation on cardiovascular risk factors (30, 31) . Of note, Al Mheid et al. (32) recently reported that vitamin D insufficiency is associated with increased arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction in healthy subjects. Interestingly, these authors found that in 42 subjects with vitamin D insufficiency, normalization of 25-OH D at 6 months was associated with increases in reactive hyperemia index and subendocardial viability ratio, and a decrease in mean arterial pressure (32) . In a random sample of 560 subjects selected from the general population, Mayer et al. (33) reported a negative trend in PWV among 25-OH D quartiles. These authors found that subjects in the lowest 25-OH D quartile (\u03fd20 ng/ml) showed the highest aortic PWV (9.04 m/sec), compared with second to fourth quartiles (8.07, 7 .93, and 7.70 m/sec, respectively; P for trend \u03fd0.0001) (33) . The association between 25-OH D and PWV remained significant after adjustment for age, gender, and other potential confounders including hypertension, obesity, lipid profile, kidney function, drug treatment (statin, antihypertensives), and history of cardiovascular disease (33) . More recently, Lee et al. (34) reported that low 25-OH D levels independently predicted PWV (P \u03fd 0.001) in individuals with type 2 diabetes (n \u03ed 305) after adjustment for other risk factors such as age, smoking, hypertension, C-reactive protein, diabetes duration, hypertension duration, glycated hemoglobin, and BMI.\nEvidence is accumulating that vitamin D may also exert various direct effects on the cardiovascular system (1). Heart and blood vessels are target tissues for vitamin D and express both vitamin D receptor (VDR) and 1\u2423-hydroxylase. VDR-knockout and 1\u2423-hydroxylaseknockout mice develop heart failure despite normalized calcium levels (35) . Increased activation of the RAAS seems to be the mediating pathway because RAAS blockade with, for example, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril reverses cardiac abnormalities in these mouse models (35, 36) . The crucial role of vitamin D for myocardial health is further supported by increased VDR expression in myocardial hypertrophy (37) . VDR expression increased in cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts after treatment with the prohypertrophic vasoactive peptide endothelin. Experimental studies documented antihypertrophic and antiproliferative actions of vitamin D metabolites, which down-regulate several genes involved in the development of myocardial hypertrophy. VDR activation modulates cardiac calcium flux and thereby induces an accelerated relaxation of cardiomyocytes, which may improve diastolic function of the heart. Vitamin D-mediated regulation of cardiac extracellular matrix turnover may also be important to maintain cardiac health (38) . Vitamin D may also protect against atherosclerosis, vascular calcification, and endothelial dysfunction. Antiatherosclerotic vitamin D effects may include inhibition of macrophage cholesterol uptake and foam cell formation, down-regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, and suppression of inflammation-triggered endothelial activation and expression of endothelial adhesion molecules (8, 27, 39) . Vitamin D effects may also protect against endothelial dysfunction, for example, by antioxidative actions and by inhibiting lipid peroxidation (27) . Finally, vitamin D may reduce vascular calcification, for example, by inhibiting bone morphogenic proteins, but data on this topic are somewhat controversial (27) . Conversely, vitamin D overload is used as a model of vascular stiffening (39) . Therefore, poor vitamin D status as well as vitamin D intoxication may contribute to vascular calcification (8, 27, 40) . Observational and interventional studies showed inconsistent results regarding the association of vitamin D with subclinical atherosclerosis markers such as carotid intimamedia thickness (27, 41) . Several, but not all, interventional studies showed that vitamin D supplementation im-proves endothelial function (8, 36, 42) . Therefore, large trials assessing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on vascular structure and endothelial function in individuals with vitamin D deficiency are encouraged."}, {"section_title": "Study limitations", "text": "The cross-sectional, observational design of the present study precludes definitive conclusions regarding the causal relationship between arterial stiffness and vitamin D levels. It should be also highlighted that the magnitude of contribution of low 25-OH D status to arterial stiffness might be variable and modest. The BLSA population is a series of volunteers who are healthy at the time of enrollment and tend to be highly educated and to have a high socio-economic status. Thus, not surprisingly, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the BLSA is lower than in other published studies. A limitation of this study is that information on important determinants of serum 25-OH D concentration, such as sun exposure and vitamin D intake from food sources, were not collected. In addition, we did not explore the putative mediating effect of alcohol consumption. Moderate, regular alcohol consumption by apparently healthy people is associated with lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than in abstainers (15) . Mechanisms supporting this include beneficial regulation of lipids and fibrinolysis, decreased platelet aggregation and coagulation factors, beneficial effects on endothelial function, and inflammation and insulin resistance. Of note, 43% of participants reported more than three servings per week. However, because such information is missing for about 25% of the study population (297 participants), alcohol consumption data were not included in the regression model as covariate. Finally, in this study we did not explore the putative mediating effect of inflammatory status. Despite the aforementioned limitations, this study has several unique strengths. First, this study measured carotid-femoral PWV, which is the \"gold standard\" for the noninvasive assessment of arterial stiffness. Second, this study was performed in the context of a normative aging study that included both sexes with careful assessment of several potential confounders of the arterial stiffness/vitamin D status relationship."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Vitamin D levels are associated with increased arterial stiffness in a normative aging population, irrespective of traditional risk factors burden.
