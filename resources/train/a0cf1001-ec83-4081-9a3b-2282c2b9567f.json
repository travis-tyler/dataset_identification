[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The number of farmers' markets in the United States is growing. Although there are tools to analyze food availability at grocery stores, corner stores, and convenience stores, little research exists about the availability of food types at farmers' markets. This research developed an audit tool to measure the food environment at farmers' markets in rural and urban food environments and examined its psychometric properties, including face validity, interrater reliability, and discriminant validity. The Farmers' Market Audit Tool was reviewed by content experts, revised, and then tested in six farmers' markets by researchers across three states in 2013, including Kentucky, North Carolina, and Montana. Seven food categories were developed, including vegetables, fruits, meats, cheeses, eggs, grains, and samples. Interrater reliability was high within farmers' market across states. As expected, discriminant validity indicated a systematic disagreement within and between states due to seasonality and ability to grow different types of food across different farmers' markets. The total scores assessing the healthfulness of each farmers' market was 38 (range = 28-50). Using the Farmers' Market Audit Tool at farmers' markets is a reliable and valid method to capture the availability of food offerings."}, {"section_title": "> > IntroductIon", "text": "The U.S. population has consistently consumed a low-quality diet, with lower consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and higher consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (Popkin, 2010) and processed foods (Krebs-Smith, Guenther, Subar, Kirkpatrick, & Dodd, 2010) over time. These dietary patterns have led some researchers and policymakers to focus on more upstream, distal determinants of diet and weight status, including the food environment (Story, Kaphingst, Robinson-O'Brien, & Glanz, 2008) . The food environment is broadly operationalized as the community food environment (defined as access to food venues) and the consumer food environment (defined as what consumers encounter in each food venue; Glanz, Sallis, Saelens, & Frank, 2005) . Neighborhoods with a higher proportion of minority, low-income residents have fewer healthy food retailers (Bodor, Rice, Farley, Swalm, & Rose, 2010) and fewer healthy foods within stores (Izumi, Zenk, Schulz, Mentz, & Wilson, 2011) . The lack of healthy food options is associated with consumption of fewer fruits and vegetables and higher body mass index 597899H PPXXX10.1177/1524839915597899Health Promotion PracticeFarmers' Market Audit tool (Jilcott, Keyserling, Crawford, McGuirt, & Ammerman, 2011; Gustafson, Hankins, & Jilcott, 2012) . Thus, ameliorating food environment disparities, such as inadequate access to healthy food retailers, is paramount to achieving national nutrition goals (Voss, Masuoka, Webber, Scher, & Atkinson, 2013) . However, the food environment is a rather complex construct, and, to date, standard measures for measuring the healthfulness of venues have not been established."}, {"section_title": "> > BAckground", "text": "To begin addressing disparities in access to healthy foods, standard assessment tools are needed. To assess the consumer food environment, food store audit tools measure healthy and unhealthy food availability, price, promotion, placement, and quality (Cummins & Macintyre, 2006; Gustafson et al., 2012; Kelly, Flood, & Yeatman, 2011) . Such tools have been used in a wide variety of traditional and nontraditional food venues (McKinnon, Reedy, Morrissette, Lytle, & Yaroch, 2009 ). Desirable features of a tool include an established scoring protocol, adequate characterization of healthy versus unhealthy foods, assessment of price, availability, quality, and promotion of foods (as these are likely to influence consumer behavior), reliability, and validity. To date, most tools have accessed the consumer food environment within supermarkets, grocery stores, or convenience stores (Kelly et al., 2011) but have not been able to capture nontraditional food venues such as farmers' markets.\nBetween 2011 and 2012, there has been a 9.6% increase in the number of farmers' markets operating in the United States: 7,175 in 2011 and 7,864 in 2012 (U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA], 2013). The USDA (2014) defines a farmers' market as \"a multi-stall market at which farmer-producers sell agricultural products directly to the general public at a central or fixed location.\" While the total number of farmers' markets is relatively low compared to the number of supermarkets in the United States (Food Marketing Institute, 2013) , there has been consistent growth in operations among farmers' markets relative to the slow or stagnant growth among supermarkets and grocery stores (IBIS World, 2014) . Given the growth in number of farmers' markets and the federal food aid programs that promote use of farmers' markets (Kim, 2011) , a tool to assess the foods available at farmers' markets is needed (National Collaborative on Child Obesity Research, 2014). Thus, the aim of this study was to develop an audit tool to measure the food environment at farmers' markets and to examine its psychometric properties, including face validity, discriminant validity, and interrater reliability."}, {"section_title": "> > MetHod", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Setting", "text": "This study was conducted in six counties (one rural and one urban county in each state) in North Carolina, Kentucky, and Montana. These states were selected based on coauthors' membership in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded Nutrition and Obesity Policy Research and Evaluation Network (2013) . Farmers' markets meeting the following criteria were included in the sampling frame:\n(1) open at least 5 months per year and (2) listed on the state department of agriculture listing. Produce stands, communitysupported agriculture, roadside stands, farmers' markets with less than three vendors, and personal home gardens were excluded. A list of farmers' markets for each state was collected from each state's department of agriculture. Once farmers' markets' addresses were collected, each county was coded as rural (0) or urban (1) based on the 2013 USDA rural-urban continuum codes (USDA, Economic Research Service, 2013) . Rural-urban continuum codes range from 1 to 10, with 1 being metro and 10 being nonmetro. Counties designated as 1, 2, or 3 were classified as urban, and counties designated as 4 to 10 were classified as rural. Researchers limited this study to a driving radius of 2 hours from the researcher's place of work. One urban and one rural county were randomly selected from the master list using a random number generator. If two farmers' markets existed in the selected county, the market registered by the county and included on the state Department of Agriculture list was selected. If the farmers' market was open more than 1 day per week, the market manager was contacted and asked which day had the most vendors and customers. After market selection, each market was contacted to ensure that the market manager was willing to allow data audit collection, to verify the address, and to verify that there was a minimum of three vendors selling produce at the market. A total of six farmers' markets were selected for this study. As we did not collect data on human subjects, this study was exempt from review by an institutional review board."}, {"section_title": "Development of Farmers' Market Audit Tool and Face Validity", "text": "The Farmers' Market Audit Tool (F-MAT) is a short paper-and-pencil form that records the availability of food items within the market, as well as key characteristics about the operations of the market. The F-MAT was developed based on our collective experience measuring the consumer food environment in nontraditional food venues.\nFirst, authors conducted a review of available audit tools that measure availability, placement, promotion, quality, and price within grocery stores, supercenters, supermarkets, and convenience stores. There were many consumer food environment assessment tools, including tools to examine the availability of ethnic foods, such as the Hmong Food Store Survey (Franzen & Smith, 2010) and the Texas nutrition environment assessment of retail food stores (Gloria & Steinhardt, 2010) , or tools specific to urban areas, such as the Baltimore Healthy Stores Project (Song et al., 2009 ). However, we found no audit tool to assess the availability and quality of food found at farmers' markets. Thus, we based the newly developed F-MAT on the Nutrition Environment Measures Survey in Stores (NEMS-S; Glanz, Sallis, Saelens, & Frank, 2007) .\nFace validity ensures that an instrument measures what it proposes to measure by having content experts provide feedback (Nunnully & Bernstein, 1994) . To establish face validity, we circulated the first draft of the F-MAT to content experts. The experts were given an explanation of the purpose of the tool, provided with the survey and accompanying instructions, and asked to review the F-MAT for its apparent ability to measure the food environment at farmers' markets."}, {"section_title": "F-MAT Pilot-Testing", "text": "The research team in each state consisted of two auditors (undergraduate and/or graduate students) and one lead researcher (study authors). Each lead researcher trained the auditors on use of the F-MAT. In addition to in-person training, written user guides were given to each auditor in order to promote interrater reliability. During June and July 2013, pilot-testing of the tool included one audit of each selected farmers' market.\nTo examine interrater reliability, the two auditors on each team attended the farmers' market on the same day and at the same time. The researchers conducted the farmers' market audit as soon as possible after opening hours to ensure that all food items available for consumers to access were stocked. Auditors then independently (without consulting one another) completed all information required on the F-MAT: counting the total number of vendors and unique number of vendors that sold fruits and vegetables; finding each type of indicated produce, meat, egg, cheese, and grain on the tool; indicating availability (Yes/No), number of vendors selling each item (#), and quality (Acceptable/ Unacceptable); and number of vendors offering samples and number of vendors offering fruits or vegetables as samples."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "Using the point system found on the audit sheet, which was adapted from the NEMS-S, a total score was derived based on each section's individual scores. Data were coded for number of agreements and number of disagreements between paired F-MATs in the same state for each section on the F-MAT (vendor information, vegetables, fruits, meats, cheeses, eggs, breads, and samples). Interrater reliability was assessed by percentage agreement within each market. It was hypothesized that there would be high interrater reliability in the same market. Discriminant validity on the F-MAT was assessed by kappa coefficients between markets within each state, between markets among states, and between rural and urban farmers' markets. Kappa values were calculated for discriminant validity using the audit tool scores, whereas percentage agreements were calculated for interreliability by examining number of agreements among raters. It was hypothesized that there would be low agreement between scores for markets in different states (because of differences in local food availability) and low agreement between scores for urban versus rural markets, indicating discriminant validity. Kappa values were quantified using the following scale: 0.01 to 0.20, slight agreement; 0.21 to 0.40, fair agreement; 0.41 to 0.60, moderate agreement; 0.61 to 0.80, and substantial agreement; 0.81 to 0.99, high agreement (Landis & Koch, 1977) . Negative agreement values were interpreted as the raters agreed less on an item than expected by chance (e.g., there was a systematic disagreement between observers due to diversity of food items available at each farmers' markets). Stata (Version 12.0, StataCorp) was used to calculate all statistics."}, {"section_title": "> > results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Face Validity", "text": "Content experts provided expert input to ensure face validity (n = 8; acknowledged in Authors' Note). From reviewer input, final revisions were made (see Table 1 for audit tool and revisions and Table 2 for final tool). The final F-MAT begins with information gathering about the market, including hours of operation, seasonal openings, address, and number of vendors (to assess size). To be consistent with previous audits and to be able to generalize the overall availability of healthy food items at a given farmers' market, we focused on fruits, vegetables, meats, poultry, eggs, cheeses, and grains. These items represented what is commonly sold at various farmers' markets across the United States. These items also represented some of the , n.d.) . The final tool is composed of 27 unique items. Some items are counted as one but include subcategories, such as ground beef that is lean or standard."}, {"section_title": "Food Availability and Quality at Farmers' Markets", "text": "The mean score for food availability and quality at farmers' markets was 38 (range = 28-50).

Across all sites but one, there was high to substantial agreement among the sites. One site (North Carolina Urban Farmers' Market 3) reflected lower percent agreements.

However, there has not been systematic assessment of farmers' markets in terms of healthfulness or food availability and quality. Thus, the aim of this project was to develop and validate an F-MAT that could be used across various farmers' markets. Face validity was confirmed by a diverse expert panel of reviewers. As our results also signified high interrater reliability, the F-MAT can credibly be used within farmers' market sites by trained raters. The discriminant validity found between markets in different states and in urban and rural areas within states indicates that the F-MAT is correctly capturing food availability and quality, as a higher score indicated more produce available at higher quality.\nWe found low agreement for fruits and vegetables among the various sites. One explanation for these differences is that the fruits and vegetables listed on the F-MAT were not available in very rural areas or in cold climates. Although the F-MAT was conducted in warmer months, there are vast regional differences in what types of fresh fruits and vegetables are available in various locations. The high agreement among the protein-based products suggests that these food items are more stable and not subject to temporal seasonal changes that are true of fruits and vegetables. Pork loin and chicken yielded high percentage and kappa agreement because they were not available at several of the markets.\nPrevious studies have indicated that farmers' markets are used by a broad range of consumers (Blanck, Nebeling, Yaroch, & Thompson, 2011; Byker, Shanks, Misyak, & Serrano, 2012; Jilcott Pitts, Wu, McGuirt, Keyserling, & Ammerman, 2013) . Positive impacts for local economies have also been found (Brown, 2002) . What is still less understood is the impact that farmers' markets provide on food access and nutrient availability in communities (McCormack et al., 2010) . Just as the NEMS-S laid foundation for understanding the food environment within retail stores (Glanz et al., 2007) , this tool provides a means to advance our knowledge about the food environment at farmers' markets.\nThe F-MAT is apt for use by researchers and practitioners for a variety of practical reasons, including measuring various foods available at farmers' markets with diverse locations and populations. For example, the F-MAT could be used to measure disparities in access to foods at farmers' markets between neighborhoods with differing incomes within the same county. Additionally, the F-MAT would be useful for understanding changes in access to food through farmers' markets due to seasonality within the same locations. Depending on findings, both of these uses would provide the researcher or practitioner evidence to promote diversifying or increasing healthy food choices for the consumer.\nThere are several limitations to the development of this tool. Only three states were selected in the mid-Atlantic, central, and western region of the United States. Ideally more states would have been included in the development of this tool. The audits were done in the summer months and not year-round. However, we decided to conduct audits in the summer months because many states do not have farmers' markets yearround."}, {"section_title": "> > conclusIon", "text": "The Farmers Market Coalition (a collaboration with the University of Wisconsin) is working to develop tools that allow more systematic evaluation of the benefits of farmers' markets to communities (Farmers Market Coalition, 2014) .

The measure was sensitive in that it captured differences between markets within states (urban vs. rural) and between states. Future studies should focus on testing the F-MAT in a variety of rural "}]
