[3] [4] [5] [6] By contrast, the Wellness Plan operates as a premium disincentive program, requiring individuals to complete healthy behaviors (specifically, an annual physical examination and a health risk assessment [HRA] ) to avoid monthly premiums, rather than rewarding them for their completion. Moreover, failure to pay premiums may result in disenrollment for some beneficiaries. In this study, we evaluated the implications of a premium disincentive program in Iowa for the state's Medicaid expansion population and the success members had in complying with the healthy behaviors necessary to avoid paying a premium.\nAs outlined in Table 1 , for the first 2 years of the Wellness Plan program, there were 2 different programs for low-income Iowans aged 19 to 64 years. The Wellness Plan provided traditional Medicaid coverage to individuals with incomes at or below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL). 7 The Marketplace Choice program was a premium assistance model program that used Medicaid funds to purchase private insurance on the Affordable Care Act Marketplace for individuals with incomes between 101% and 138% of the FPL. As a component of both programs, the state created the Healthy Behaviors Program to promote responsibility for preventive care, encouraging members of both programs to participate. The Healthy Behaviors Program has been described in more detail elsewhere. 8 In this study, we focused on the completion rate of the 2 requirements of the Healthy Behaviors Program: the wellness examination and HRA. The wellness examination component was an annual preventive examination offered to members at no out-of-pocket cost by any Medicaid-participating provider. The HRA component was a standardized health questionnaire that members completed online or over the phone, with or without the assistance of a health care provider, their health plan, or health system. All Marketplace Choice members, and Wellness Plan members with incomes higher than 51% of the FPL, were subject to monthly premiums of $10 and $5, respectively, if they failed to complete both activities within their first 12 months in the program (plus a 30-day grace period). Moreover, Marketplace Choice membersbut not Wellness Plan members-could be disenrolled for nonpayment of the premiums. However, medically frail individuals and those claiming a financial hardship could request a premium waiver.\nIn the program's first year, we documented that certain elements of the Healthy Behaviors Program were not fully implemented, that the program as implemented initially yielded low completion rates for both wellness examinations and HRAs, and that both program members and providers lacked a sufficient understanding of the program despite a variety of efforts to inform members about the program. 8 The objective of this study was to provide an updated evaluation of wellness examination and HRA activity after 2 full years of the Healthy Behaviors Program (i.e., past the ramp-up period expected with a new program). Given current health policy discussions occurring at both the federal and state levels, our findings from Iowa have implications for Medicaid programs nationwide. 9 "}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "We analyzed 2014 and 2015 data on Medicaid enrollment and the completion of wellness examinations and HRAs, obtained from the Iowa Department of Human Services. Starting with monthly data, we used a rolling cohort method to attribute individuals to a program if they were enrolled exclusively in that program for 12 consecutive months, collapsing the data so that we have 1 observation per person per cohort. There were 84 134 person-cohort observations in the Wellness Plan and 24 606 person-cohort observations in Marketplace Choice. This method ensures that we retain as many members in our sample as possible, while also ensuring that all individuals in our sample are exposed to a full year of the program to which they are assigned, providing them equal opportunity to engage in Healthy Behaviors Program activities, and corresponding to the period of time they have to complete activities before being charged a premium (excluding the additional 30-day grace period).\nNext, we generated descriptive statistics for our Wellness Plan and Marketplace Choice sample. Then, within each cohort and by program, we calculated the completion rate for wellness examinations, HRAs, and both activities. To compare changes in completion rates between 2014 and 2015, we also examined the subsample of members who belonged to cohorts that did not span calendar years. We used the t test to compare the means between programs in a given year, and within a program between years.\nFinally, we used 3 separate logistic regressions to model completion of an HRA, wellness examination, or both as a function of a beneficiary's age, gender, race/ethnicity, area of residence (defined as metropolitan, nonmetropolitan urban, or nonmetropolitan rural by using rural-urban continuum codes), number of moves between counties during the 12-month period (to account for lifestyle disruption), average number of prescription medications taken each month, annual number of emergency department visits, and an indicator for the presence of each of 24 chronic conditions. While we included the full sample of 13 cohorts spanning 2014 and 2015, we also included a set of dummy variables to indicate the cohort to which an individual was assigned. We stratified Wellness Plan and Marketplace Choice members into separate models. Although it may have been useful to speak with state Medicaid officials about implementation of the program and our findings, as the independent evaluators of the Medicaid expansion required by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, it is important for us to maintain the appropriate distance from the state employees running the program."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Descriptive statistics for Wellness Plan and Marketplace Choice members are shown in Table 2 . The 2 groups are quite similar, with the exception that Marketplace Choice has a higher proportion of female members compared with the Wellness Plan. Across our sample of 13 cohorts, representing all Wellness Plan and Marketplace Choice members with continuous coverage for 12 months between January 2014 and December 2015, we found that 40% of Wellness Plan members and 37.4% of Marketplace Choice members received a wellness examination. This difference, while small, was statistically significant (P < .001). In the same sample, we found that 24.6% of Wellness Plan members and 16.6% of Marketplace Choice members completed an HRA (P < .001). The completion rate of both activities was 18.5% among Wellness Plan members and 12.5% among Marketplace Choice members (P < .001). Next, we examined the change in completion rates from 2014 to 2015-excluding the members in our cohort-based sample whose data spanned calendar years. Among this subsample, we found that receipt of a wellness examination increased from 38.1% in 2014 to 47.8% of Wellness Plan members in 2015, and from 32.6% in 2014 to 52.2% of Marketplace Choice members in 2015. Both the differences between programs within years and the differences between years within programs were statistically significant (P < .001). We also found that, from 2014 to 2015, HRA completion rates declined by half among Wellness Plan members from 35.5% to 17.6%, while they increased slightly, from 18.1% to 22.5%, among Marketplace Choice members. Whereas Wellness Plan members were more likely than Marketplace Choice members to complete an HRA in 2014, the opposite was true in 2015. Again, both the differences between programs within years and the differences between years within programs were statistically significant (P < .001). Among Wellness Plan members, 25.8% completed both activities in 2014, but this figure dropped to 14.7% in 2015. By comparison, 13.6% of Marketplace Choice members completed both activities in 2014, and this figure increased to 18.2% in 2015. Table 3 contains the results from our logistic regression models to predict member completion of the requirements (i.e., receipt of a wellness examination and completion of an HRA) as a function of observable member characteristics (model results separately examining the odds of completing a wellness examination or HRA are available in Tables A and B , available as supplements to the online version of this article at http:// www.ajph.org). It is important to note that, although we included a variable to indicate which sample cohort a member was in and adjusted for any unobservable characteristics associated with that specific cohort, these results are not shown in the table.\nOverall, the model results looked similar between the Wellness Plan and Marketplace Choice with minor differences in the magnitude of most coefficients. For instance, in the Wellness Plan, each additional year of age was associated with a 2% increase in the odds of completing both activities, and age was associated with a 3% increase in the odds of completing both activities among Marketplace Choice members. We also found that men were less likely to complete both activities compared with women. Specifically, men in the Wellness Plan had 35% lower odds of completing both activities compared with women, and men in Marketplace Choice had 24% lower odds of completing both activities compared with women.\nIn some cases, however, there were more notable differences between the 2 models. For example, in the Wellness Plan, members of a non-White race had 12% to 17% lower odds of completing both activities compared with Whites, whereas in Marketplace Choice, members of unknown race had 18% greater odds of completing both activities relative to Whites. Similarly, we observed divergent results for a member's area of residence and relocation. Compared with members living in nonmetropolitan urban areas, Wellness Plan members living in metropolitan areas and nonmetropolitan rural areas had 24% and 31% higher odds of completing both activities, respectively. By contrast, area of residence was not a significant factor in the likelihood of completing both activities among Marketplace Choice beneficiaries. Likewise, in the Wellness Plan, each move a member made from one county to another was associated with a 5% reduction in the odds of completing both activities, whereas there was no such association observed among Marketplace Choice beneficiaries.\nOur 3 proxy variables for health status revealed a mixed pattern. While emergency department visits were associated with a reduction in the odds of completing both activities of 9% for Wellness Plan members and 6% for Marketplace Choice members, the 2 other factors were associated with an increase in the odds. Specifically, in the Wellness Plan, each additional prescription drug was associated with a 9% increase in the odds of completing both activities, and each additional chronic condition was associated with a 13% increase in the odds of completing both activities. In Marketplace Choice, both of these factors were associated with a 12% increase in the odds of completing both activities. "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Iowa's nontraditional Medicaid expansion used a Section 1115 waiver to create a program that combined (1) a relatively traditional Medicaid-like program for adults from 0% to 100% of the FPL, (2) a premium assistance model program allowing eligible adults from 101% to 133% of the FPL to purchase private health insurance from qualified health plans, and (3) a Healthy Behaviors Program for both programs that built on the conservative principle of personal responsibility. The premium disincentive structure of the Healthy Behaviors Program was intended to encourage members to take an active part in maintaining their health and to promote accountability among beneficiaries.\nHowever, we found that, even after 2 years of the program, the proportion of Wellness Plan and Marketplace Choice members who completed either their HRA or wellness examination was much lower than expected. Most importantly, from a premium disincentive perspective, we found that approximately 81% of Wellness Plan members and 87% of Marketplace Choice members failed to complete both required Healthy Behaviors in the first 2 years of the program (calendar years 2014 and 2015). These noncompliant individuals should have been subject to paying premiums in 2015 or 2016 depending on when they were enrolled (except for certain low-income Wellness Plan members at < 51% of the FPL). Furthermore, according to program guidelines, members subject to premiums would be disenrolled after 3 months of nonpayment of these premiums. At this time, it is unclear what proportion of these individuals is paying the premiums, claiming a financial hardship exemption, or being disenrolled, and this is an area for future study.\nThe results from our regression models suggest that members who have more frequent interactions with the health care system (as evidenced by having more chronic conditions and more prescriptions) will have more opportunities to be prompted to complete their HRA and wellness examination, whereas those who are more reliant on the emergency department for their care are not getting their HRA or wellness examination because they are more likely to be receiving fragmented care. Similarly, we found evidence that relocation is disruptive among those with lower incomes (i.e., Wellness Plan beneficiaries), making them less likely to complete their HRA and wellness examination. We also found that members who were younger, male, or non-White often face a much greater risk of not completing the required activities, raising concerns that disparities in rates of activity completion may translate into disparities in rates of insurance coverage and health outcomes.\nAs we reported previously, 8 the combination of a general lack of awareness and understanding about the program at both the member and provider level has stunted the program's ability to achieve significant participation to date. Members also reported barriers in completing the activities, ranging from unreliable Internet access and problems with the online HRA tool to difficulty obtaining an appointment with a provider or arranging transportation for a wellness examination. 8 The updated completion rates we present here demonstrate that these challenges are likely to persist, and that more efforts need to be directed at improving the program if it is ever to succeed. Indeed, similar results-including unclear communication and low participation rates-have been reported for other Medicaid incentive programs, suggesting that these challenges are not unique to Iowa. 10 "}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "This study is subject to some limitations. First, there was a change in the activities that could be counted as satisfying completion of an activity during the study period. Beginning in January 2015, members who completed a preventive dental examination were considered to have satisfied the wellness examination requirement. Thus, comparisons across years are not based on equal conditions. A second, related limitation is that individuals were able to call in to the Iowa Department of Human Services and report completion of an activity without further verification. Although this self-reporting obviously raises concerns about the accuracy of the data and whether the beneficiary actually did complete the activity or simply reported doing so, these data are the official source used for making determinations about exemption from monthly premiums and subsequent program disenrollment for nonpayment. As such, they are inherently meaningful, even if potentially inaccurate. Third, we used rolling 12-month "}]
