The following tables show rates for first-time postsecondary students attending institutions that vary by control (i.e., public, private nonprofit, and private for-profit) and level (i.e., less-than-2-year, 2-year, or 4year). Tables 1.2-A through 1.2-D report rates for first-time postsecondary students who began at public 2-year colleges. Tables 1.3-A through 1.3-D and 1.4-A through 1.4-D present estimates for those who began at public and private nonprofit 4-year institutions. Subsequent tables focus on first-time postsecondary students' retention and attainment rates at different levels of private for-profit institutions, specifically, less-than-2year institutions (tables 1.5-A through 1.5-D); 2-year institutions (tables 1.6-A through 1.6-D); and 4-year institutions (tables 1.7-A through 1.7-D). The final two sets of tables focus on 2011-12 first-time postsecondary students who began a bachelor's degree program at public (tables 1.8 -A through 1.8-D) and at private nonprofit 4-year (tables 1.9-A through 1.9-D) institutions and present the percentages who completed a bachelor's degree at the first institution in 4 years or less, 5 years, or 6 years.

First-time students who reported this information on an entrance examination survey may not have completed all courses at the time they took the survey. 3 Any college-level courses includes college courses for credit, Advanced Placement (AP) courses, and International Baccalaureate (IB) courses. 4 Recent high school graduates only include first-time students who graduated from high school with a regular high school diploma in 2011 or 2012. 5 First-time students who did not take the SAT or ACT are included in the total but excluded here. Admissions test scores reflect first-time students' combined SAT verbal and math score. If SAT scores were not available, ACT scores were converted into an estimated combined SAT verbal and math score. NOTE: Estimates include individuals who were first-time postsecondary students in 2011-12 at Title IV eligible postsecondary institutions in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
