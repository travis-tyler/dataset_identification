In the early 1940s, the active ingredient 2,4-D was patented. 1 The post-war commercialization of this selective herbicide transformed domestic weed management practices and ushered in the modern era of chemical weed control.\nThe herbicide glyphosate was patented in 1970. 2 Unlike 2,4-D, glyphosate was non-selective. Therefore, it was primarily used in pre-emergent applications. This changed in 1996 when the first genetically engineered herbicide-resistant (HR) crops were commercialized. These crops simplified the use of non-selective herbicides such as glyphosate in post-emergent applications.\nInitially, demand for herbicide-resistant corn seeds was relatively low. Fewer than 10% of US corn acres were planted with HR seeds in 2000. 3 However, adoption rates increased rapidly in the early twenty-first century. By 2010, almost three out of every four domestic corn acres were planted with herbicide-resistant seeds.\nThe rapid adoption of HR crops dramatically increased farmers' post-emergent glyphosate use. Although glyphosate was applied to only 4% of corn acres in 1996, it was applied to approximately three out of four acres in 2010. 4 Unfortunately, farmers' reliance on glyphosate led to the development of glyphosate-resistant weed populations. 5 As of 2015, over 15 glyphosate-resistant weed species had been identified in the United States. 6 Although it is possible to study the impacts of glyphosate resistance at a local level using field trials, it is difficult to quantify these impacts at a regional or national level because gathering detailed information about weed populations is expensive and logistically complicated. This article exploits the fact that resistance tends to induce changes in farmers' behavior. By assuming that farmers are primarily interested in maximizing profits, we are able to derive expressions for the optimal level of pre-emergent and post-emergent weed control. We estimate the behavioral model by analyzing repeated cross-sections of nationally representative data from the USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey www.soci.org SJ Wechsler, JR McFadden, DJ Smith (ARMS). The results of this analysis allow us to infer how resistance affects weed control, crop damage, and yield losses."}, {"section_title": "Structural models of pest control", "text": "In agricultural economics, a widely held assumption is that crop production (or yield) increases with increased input use, though at a diminishing rate. This assumption makes sense for inputs such as fertilizers, which directly increase yields. However, it makes less sense for inputs such as herbicides, which prevent damages caused by weeds. Lichtenberg and Zilberman 7 developed a structural framework that accounts for the fact that pesticides only impact yields when pests are present. Specifically, they modeled yields such that Y = G(x p ), where represents yields when pests are absent, G \u2208 (0,1) is abatement (the percentage of not damaged by pest infestations), and x p is a measure of pesticide use.\nLichtenberg and Zilberman's damage control framework has a number of advantages. First, it produces intuitive estimates of yield losses, crop damage, and the severity of pest infestations. Second, and arguably more importantly, it predicts that resistance increases pesticide use. Evidence suggests that this is how farmers tend to behave in the field. 8 Empirical tests of damage control models have produced favorable results. Saha et al. 9 and Chambers and Lichtenberg 10 found that damage abatement models outperformed more conventional methods of modelling yields. Chambers and Tzouvelekas 11 demonstrated that damage control models could accurately estimate the dynamics of pest populations."}, {"section_title": "Previous studies of HR crops", "text": "Few studies have used damage control models to analyze the domestic impacts of HR crops. However, the impacts of HR seed use have been studied using a variety of reduced-form approaches. For instance, Fernandez-Cornejo et al. 12 analyzed the impacts of HR soybean adoption using data from USDA's 1997 ARMS. They found that planting HR soybeans had a small, statistically significant impact on yields, but an insignificant impact on profits. Fernandez-Cornejo et al. 13 employed a similar approach using ARMS data collected in 2000. They found that HR soybean adoption increased off-farm income, but not on-farm income. Nolan and Santos 14 estimated a reduced-form model of corn yields using data from US field trials. They found limited evidence that corn with HR traits had higher yields than corn produced from conventional seeds.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first article to use the damage control framework to model the uncertainty induced by the timing of corn farmers' weed control decisions. However, our primary contribution is to quantify the extent to which glyphosate resistance affected US corn yields in 2005 and 2010. Although field tests can indicate whether resistance has developed in field-level populations, our approach can be used to analyze large study regions. It can be implemented wherever data about prices, field characteristics, and farmers' production practices are collected."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A behavioral model of farmers' weed control decisions", "text": "We assume that weeds can be controlled with tillage, cultivation, or herbicide applications. Selective herbicides can be applied by any farmer, before or after crop emergence. Although any non-selective herbicide (such as glyphosate) can be applied prior to crop emergence, glyphosate-resistant seeds can survive post-emergent glyphosate applications.\nIn the first stage of our model (t = 1), farmers choose whether to plant glyphosate-resistant seeds, the amount of pre-emergent herbicide to apply, and how much to till. In this stage there is uncertainty about future growing conditions. In the second stage (t = 2), farmers observe growing conditions, choose the amount of post-emergent herbicide to apply, and how much to cultivate.\nWe assume that farmers' primary goal is to maximize profits ( ), which we model by assuming that\nwhere P is the price of corn, Y represents yields, p GR is the price of glyphosate-resistant seeds, X 1 T reflects the intensity of tillage operations, X 2 T reflects the intensity of cultivation, X 1 H reflects pre-emergent herbicide use, X 2 H reflects post-emergent herbicide use, GR is an indicator for glyphosate-resistant seed use, and p t x is the price of the weed-controlling input X t x . We assume that farmers maximize expected profits by choosing the amount of each weed-controlling input to apply. These weed control decisions do not affect input or output prices. Therefore, the farmer's profit maximization problem is max\nwhere represents weed-free yields, G \u2208 (0,1) is abatement (the percentage of not damaged by weeds), W 1 is the size of the uncontrolled weed population in the pre-emergent stage, W 2 is the size of the uncontrolled weed population in the post-emergent stage, and v is a realization of the random variable (epsilon enters the expected yield function in the pre-emergent stage). Uncertainty enters the maximization problem because farmers do not have information about future growing conditions at planting time. Consequently, farmers must make their pre-emergent weed control decisions based on expectations about yields and post-emergent weed control. In order to derive expressions for the optimal level of pre-emergent and post-emergent weed control, the abatement function must be specified. Building on Fox and Weersink, 15 we assume that the abatement function is multiplicatively separable such that G = G 1 G 2 and model abatement in stage t as\n, where D t represents crop damage (the percentage of damaged by weed infestations) and C t represents weed control (the percentage of the weed population killed by herbicides, tillage and/or cultivation). Weed control is increasing in the amount of herbicide applied, the intensity of tillage operations, and the intensity of cultivation practices. Crop damage is decreasing in the amount of weed control and increasing in the size of the weed population.\nBoth C t and D t are specified using exponential cumulative distribution functions. The weed control functions are\nwileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ps where c t x is a 'weed control' parameter (Fig. 1a) . Conceptually, c reflects the efficacy of an input. If c is large, the input is effective. As will be discussed in the following section, c is affected by a variety of field-level conditions and environmental factors. For instance, HR seed use may increase the efficacy of post-emergent herbicides, but resistance can reduce it.\nThe damage functions are \nEquation 5 closely resembles the Gompertz model, which has been used by weed scientists to estimate the relationship between yields and weed-free days. 16, 17 Notice that yields are increasing in the amount of weed control and decreasing in the size of the weed population (Figs 1d and e) .\nWe are able to derive expressions for the optimal level of pre-emergent herbicide use, post-emergent herbicide use, tillage, and cultivation by solving the farmer's expected profit maximization problem. We could estimate these non-linear functions simultaneously, but doing so would be technically challenging (in part because many farmers do not use all four inputs during the same growing season). Fortunately, the results of the behavioral model can be used to simplify the empirical analysis.\nIf a farmer is maximizing profits, an increase in one pre-emergent input must provide the same increase in profits as an increase in every other pre-emergent input. If it did not, the farmer could benefit by increasing the use of one input while reducing the use of the other. The same logic applies to post-emergent input use. This implies that p t T /c t T = p t H /c t H if both tillage and herbicides are used in stage t.\nWe use this theoretical result to derive expressions for the optimal level of pre-emergent and post-emergent weed control expenditures (see supporting information Appendix A). The optimal level of pre-emergent expenditures is\nThe optimal level of expenditures on post-emergent weed control is\nThese expressions provide valuable insight into how changes in the explanatory variables and model parameters affect farmers' demand for weed control. Equation 6 suggests that expenditures on pre-emergent weed control increase with the size of the pre-emergent weed population, the destructiveness of this population, the price of corn, the price of post-emergent weed control, and expected yields. Decreases in the efficacy of post-emergent control also increase pre-emergent expenditures. Equation 7 suggests that expenditures on post-emergent weed control increase with the size of the post-emergent weed population, the destructiveness of this population, corn prices, and yields. Because we assumed that uncontrolled weeds grow between stage 1 and stage 2 such that\n, where r is the growth rate, the optimal level of post-emergent weed control also depends on the level of pre-emergent expenditures.\nHaving derived equations 6 and 7, it is possible to model corn yields in terms of optimal pre-emergent and post-emergent expenditures on weed control:"}, {"section_title": "Empirical approach", "text": "We recover the model parameters by estimating the following system of non-linear equations:\nwhere j \u2208 {g,ng}, g reflects glyphosate use, ng reflects the use of herbicides other than glyphosate, and e t are appended error terms. Crucially, the form of equation 9 depends on whether glyphosate is used in a post-emergent application. This allows us to estimate the efficacy of post-emergent weed control for: 1) fields where glyphosate is used in post-emergent weed control systems (c 2 g ) and 2) fields where glyphosate is not used in post-emergent weed control systems (c 2 ng ). We assume that (e 1 , e 2 , v) has a joint normal distribution. Therefore, there is a closed-form expression for the log-likelihood function corresponding to equation 9. 18, 19 We estimate the system of equations using non-linear full information maximum likelihood. As discussed in supporting information Appendix B, the form of the likelihood function also depends on whether an observation is censored.\nWe assume that a variety of factors influence the efficacy of weed control. For example, we expect the efficacy of post-emergent glyphosate applications to be lower on fields where glyphosate resistant weeds are present. We expect soil characteristics such as pH and organic matter content to influence the efficacy of pre-emergent weed control (c 1 ) because pre-emergent herbicides tend to be applied to (or incorporated into) the soil. 20 Therefore, we let What do farmers' weed control decisions imply about glyphosate resistance? www.soci.org (10) where pH is the soil pH, OM is the percentage of soil organic matter, I 2010 is the indicator for 2010, HR is an indicator of herbicide-resistant seed use, and R is a state-level variable indicating the number of glyphosate-resistant weed species affecting corn production. We assume that local environmental conditions influence weed-free yields. Therefore, we let = exp( \u2032 z ), where is a vector of parameters and z is a vector of variables that capture variations in soil and climatic characteristics such as: the National Commodity Crop Productivity Index (NCCPI) for corn and soybeans, 20 year averages of cumulative precipitation and growing degree days, an indicator for the year 2010, and indicators for the ERS-designated Farm Resource Regions (Heartlands, Northern Crescent, Northern Great Plains, and Prairie Gateway).\nWe do not have detailed field-level information about the size of weed populations. Therefore, we model weed pressure using the same variables we used to model weed-free yields. Specifically, we let d t W t = exp( \u2032 Wt z Wt ), where Wt is a vector of parameters, and z Wt is a vector of variables. Reparameterizing d t W t and using an exponential functional form ensures that weed-free yields, pre-emergent pest pressure, and post-emergent pest pressure are positive.\nOur proxies for weed pressure are imperfect. Therefore, we consider the possibility that our results are biased by latent or omitted variables. This problem, called endogeneity, occurs if latent (or poorly-modeled) variables are correlated with both the dependent variable and other independent variables. Two of the variables in our model, yield goals and glyphosate-resistant regression is used to analyze yield goals (which serve as a proxy for expected yields). Next, the results from these regressions are used to estimate residuals, or control functions, which serve as proxies for latent variables that could bias our estimates. These control functions are included in z W , the vector of variables we use to model weed pressure.\nTo account for the two-stage nature of the endogeneity correction, and to ensure that our results are nationally representative, we used a bootstrapping procedure that resamples each field (with replacement) according to USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service's (NASS) population expansion factor. 21, 24, 25 Results are reported as means across 300 bootstrap samples.\nNot all of the farmers in our sample controlled weeds both before and after crop emergence. Approximately 13% did not till or spray with pre-emergent herbicides. Roughly 7% did not cultivate or spray with post-emergent herbicides. There were seven fields in our 12-state study region where weeds were not controlled at all. We excluded these seven observations from our sample. The methods described in Yen and Lin 26 were used to account for censoring in the pre-emergent and post-emergent cost functions."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Compilation and construction", "text": "The ARMS is a cross-sectional, multiphase survey with a complex design. 27 Phase II of this survey gathers field-level information about input use and production practices. Commodity-specific versions of the Phase II questionnaire are administered approximately once every five years. This study analyzes data from the 2005 and 2010 ARMS Phase II corn surveys.\nThe Phase II ARMS data contain information about seed choices, tillage decisions, and yield goals. The data also contain information about the timing of herbicide applications and the quantity of herbicide products applied. Although the ARMS survey collects information about a wide range of prices, the response rates for these questions tend to be low and highly-variable. Therefore, state-level estimates underlying the April release of NASS' Agricultural Prices report were used for herbicide active ingredient prices, corn prices, and diesel prices. We used the ratio of HR seed and conventional seed prices (calculated from responses to the ARMS survey) as a proxy for the real price of HR traits. Prices were adjusted to 2010 levels using the Bureau of Labor Statistic's Consumer Price Index.\nAverage quality-adjusted prices for glyphosate and herbicides other than glyphosate (p j ) were estimated for every state and year. First, we converted every product application into a percentage of its label rate. Next, we multiplied these percentages by the label rate of a reference product (in this case, Roundup Original) and converted the pounds of product into pounds of active ingredient (we assumed a label rate of 1.12 kg glyphosate ha \u22121 ). We divided wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ps state-level expenditures by state-level quality-adjusted quantities to get quality-adjusted prices. We estimated machinery costs for herbicide application and tillage operations using detailed information about field operations from the ARMS survey. The cost of each operation was estimated using engineering models and prices obtained from NASS. 28 We assumed that weed control costs were the sum of herbicide expenditures and machinery costs.\nData from Oregon State University's PRISM Climate Group were used to calculate county-level deviations from February precipitation levels, cumulative growing season precipitation, and cumulative growing degree days (GDDs). Ideally, GDDs should be calculated using daily data. Consequently, we aggregated daily County-level averages of the Natural Resources Conservation Service's (NRCS) National Commodity Crop Productivity Index (NCCPI) and soil characteristics from the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) were also used in the analysis. NCCPI values from the Corn and Soybeans submodel were used as a proxy for exogenous growing conditions that influence a soil's inherent capacity to produce corn. 29 The index ranges from 0 to 1 and aggregates a variety of weather attributes (e.g., frost-free days) and soil physical-chemical properties (e.g., soil type, depth to water table, available water capacity, cation exchange capacity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, etc.).\nApart from the NCCPI, we used three variables to capture the impacts of other important dimensions of soil quality that influence corn yields and farmers' weed control decisions. The first is a variable from the ARMS survey that indicates whether the NRCS has categorized any part of the field as 'highly erodible'. We expect highly-eroded fields to have lower corn yields. Farmers on HEL-designated fields may also tend to use mechanical means of weed control. The remaining two variables, soil pH and soil organic matter, are county averages from the SSURGO survey. Both of these variables affect herbicide persistence and efficacy.\nIdeally, the ARMS data would include an exogenous measure of field-evolved weed resistance. Unfortunately, it does not. Therefore, we use state-level data from the International Survey of Herbicide-Resistant Weeds as a proxy for the intensity of weed resistance. 6 Using variation in the number of glyphosate-resistant weed species reported by state and over time, we are able to estimate state-level impacts of glyphosate resistance. Table 1 summarizes the data used in this study. Adoption rates for herbicide-resistant corn seeds more than tripled from 2005 to 2010. There were also large changes in input and output prices over this time period. HR seed and corn prices more than doubled, while glyphosate prices dropped by nearly 50%."}, {"section_title": "Descriptive statistics", "text": "Generally, six glyphosate-resistant weed species were identified in corn fields over the course of our study period: common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), horseweed (Erigeron canadensis), kochia (Bassia scopari), palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri), and tall waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus). Missouri was the only state in our study region that had glyphosate-resistant weeds in 2005 (Fig. 2) . By 2010, glyphosate-resistant weed species had been identified in South Dakota, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas. The most resistant weed species were identified in South Dakota, where four glyphosate-resistant weed species were reported (common ragweed, horseweed, kochia, and tall waterhemp). Table 2 provides descriptive statistics by weed management strategy. There are several notable trends. First, expenditures on herbicides increased over the course of the study period, perhaps because corn prices increased substantively. The most striking change was in expenditures on post-emergent herbicides by farmers that did not use glyphosate. These expenditures increased from $US 5.7 ha a Neither pre-emergent nor other post-emergent herbicides were applied during the \"Post-emergent glyphosate\" field trials reported in this table.\nwileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ps Table 3 presents results for the first stage of our two-stage empirical model. We find that increases in soil organic matter and farm size tend to increase the probability of HR seed use. The NCCPI has a negative impact on HR seed use, perhaps because it is easier for corn to outcompete weeds on fields with highly productive soils. Surprisingly, the average price of an HR trait does not have a statistically significant impact on adoption decisions. It is possible that this is because state-level input and output prices are correlated. This correlation, which is often referred to as multicollinearity, can induce upward bias in estimates of the standard errors and complicate the interpretation of the parameter estimates of the collinear variables. 30 We find that increases in soil productivity, farm size, and soil pH tend to increase yield goals. These results are not surprising given that corn grows best on fertile soils, that large farms tend to be more productive, and that nutrient availability is restricted in acidic soils."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "31 Table 4 depicts how farm and field-level conditions affect pre-emergent weed pressure, post-emergent weed pressure, and weed-free yields. They also suggest how effective pre-emergent applications are relative to post-emergent ones. We find that soil productivity increases pre-emergent weed pressure, post-emergent weed pressure, and weed-free yields. Our estimates of weed-free yields were higher in states such as Iowa and Illinois, where yield goals and abatement levels tended to be higher than average.\nNotably, the generalized residuals for HR seed use and yield goals had a significant impact on both pre-emergent and post-emergent weed pressure. The parameter estimates suggest that latent weed pressure was systematically higher on fields where HR seeds were used and systematically lower on fields where yield goals were high, even after controlling for observable environmental conditions. In other words, failing to account for endogeneity would have biased the results of the analysis.\nOur results are similar to those obtained in field trials (Table 5) . 32 -37 For instance, Gower et al. 38 found that weeds damaged 37% of yields on tilled, untreated fields, but only 7% on fields that were treated with a post-emergent glyphosate application. Our analysis predicts crop damages of 15% and 1.4%, respectively. Tharp and Kells 39 found that weeds damaged 57% By tillage and cultivation 6*** 3*** 11*** 5*** By tillage 4*** 2*** 8*** 5*** By cultivation 1*** 0.5* 1*** 0.1* By pre-emergent and post-emergent herbicides 20*** 19** 10*** 15** By pre-emergent herbicides 3*** 3** 4*** 4*** By post-emergent herbicides 12*** 10** 5*** 8** a Asterisks *, **, and *** denote 10, 5, and 1% levels of significance. of yields on untilled, untreated fields, but only 2% on fields that were treated with a post-emergent glyphosate application. Our analysis predicts 36% and 4%, respectively. Generally, we predict higher levels of control from post-emergent glyphosate applications and lower yield losses than most field trials. This is not surprising given that weed populations on university-affiliated sites tend to be higher than weed populations on commercial fields. 36 Alternatively, it is possible that weed pressure was lower during our study period than in the years that the field trials were conducted.\nAs far as the efficacy of weed control is concerned, we find that post-emergent weed control was more effective for post-emergent glyphosate users than for other farmers (c 2 g > c 2 ng ), especially on fields in HR production systems (Table 4) . Post-emergent weed control was more effective than pre-emergent control (c 2 g > c 1 ) for post-emergent glyphosate users but post-emergent control was less effective than pre-emergent control (c 2 ng < c 1 ) for other farmers. Assuming that farmers did not control weed infestations, we predict that weeds would have caused average yield losses of approximately 4500 kg ha \u22121 (39% of weed-free yields) in 2005 and 3900 kg ha \u22121 (32% of weed-free yields) in 2010 (Table 6 ). Given farmers' pre-emergent and post-emergent expenditures on weed control, we predict average yield losses of approximately 800 kg ha It is unclear what drove this trend. One explanation is that increasing corn prices raised the optimal level of weed control throughout the 2010 growing season. Because these price increases occurred after pre-emergent weed control decisions had been made farmers increased their post-emergent herbicide usage.\nOur results suggest that glyphosate kills approximately 99% of weeds, on average, when applied at the label rate (1.12 kg glyphosate ha \u22121 ) in HR production systems if glyphosate-resistant weeds are not present (Table 9 ). Not surprisingly, the efficacy of glyphosate applications is lower when glyphosate-resistant weeds are present (Fig. 3) . The magnitude of this effect is fairly small when small numbers of glyphosate-resistant weed species are present (the presence of one glyphosate-resistant weed species reduces control by approximately two percentage points at the label rate). However, the presence of three or more glyphosate-resistant weed species reduces control by over 30 percentage points.\nGenerally, these results should be interpreted with caution. While resistance tends to be localized, our measure of resistance is a state-level variable. Even if glyphosate's efficacy is very low on fields where weed resistance has developed, the average state-level impact will be small if resistance is uncommon. This suggests that our results may underestimate the impacts of glyphosate resistance on weed control."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "This article studies glyphosate resistance in US corn production using a behavioral model of corn farmers' weed control decisions. It analyzes cross-sectional data from the USDA's 2005 and 2010 ARMS. Because we use a state-level variable as a proxy for glyphosate resistance, our estimates should be interpreted as state-level averages, not field-level impacts.\nWe found that the presence of one or two glyphosate-resistant weed species had a fairly small impact on control, but that the presence of multiple resistant weed species could decrease control by over 30 percentage points. Our findings also highlight differences in crop production technologies. Farmers who use glyphosate in post-emergent applications tend to get most of their weed control from glyphosate applications. Farmers who do not use glyphosate in post-emergent applications relied heavily on tillage for weed control in 2005 but on post-emergent herbicides in 2010.\nTo our knowledge, reliable field-level data on weed populations do not exist for U.S. crops. Collecting these data would be time-consuming and expensive. However, this task could become increasingly feasible as remote sensing and precision agriculture technologies mature. Future studies should attempt to identify good sources of field-level data. These data could improve the accuracy and representativeness of empirical studies of weed control."}, {"section_title": "SUPPORTING INFORMATION", "text": "Supporting information may be found in the online version of this article."}]
