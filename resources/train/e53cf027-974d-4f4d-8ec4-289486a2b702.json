Fred Short is the Program Manager for UNH and is the primary contact for UNH. Fred Short will be responsible for coordinating all program activities. This work is being done under contract for PREP so the Program Manager will be accountable to the PREP Coastal Scientist (Phil Trowbridge) and the PREP Director (Rachel Rouillard). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency provides funding to the Piscataqua Region Estuaries Partnership. Jean Brochi is the project manager for EPA. Daily operations of the project will be managed by the Program Manager. The Program Manager will manage all field staff, be responsible for \"stop/go\" decisions in the field, coordinate data analysis and will be responsible for all final products. The Seagrass Ecology Lab retains intellectual property rights to the data from the project and may use these The Project QA Officer will be Nicole Sarrette. The QA Officer will be responsible for a memorandum to the Program Manager summarizing any deviations from the procedures in the QA Project Plan, the results of the QA/QC tests, and whether the reported data meets the data quality objectives of the project. This memorandum should clearly state whether any data should be rejected because they did not pass QA tests. The Program Manager will be responsible for resolving any logistical problems. The principal users of the data from this project will be the PREP staff and NHDES. The Program Manager will submit a report to the PREP/NHDES Coastal Scientist and the PREP Director at the end of the project with all the data and the QA Officer's summary report.

Healthy eelgrass both depends on and contributes to good water quality. The UNH Seagrass Ecology Lab, has mapped the distribution of eelgrass every year from 1986 through 2009 in the Great Bay. The entire Great Bay Estuary (Great Bay, Little Bay, tidal tributaries, Piscataqua River, Little Harbor, and Portsmouth Harbor) was mapped by these researchers in 1996 and from 1999 through 2009. In 1989, there was a dramatic crash of the eelgrass beds in the Great Bay itself down to 300 acres (15% of normal levels). The cause of this crash was an infestation of a slime mold, Labryrinthula zosterae, commonly called \"wasting disease\" (Muehlstein et al., 1991). The eelgrass beds recovered following the infestation but have experienced a slow, steady decline since their initial recovery. Between 1990 and 2008, the eelgrass acreage in Great Bay and Little Bay has declined by 37 and 87 percent, respectively. In 2007 and 2008, no eelgrass was found in Little Bay and the Piscataqua River; in Portsmouth Harbor, eelgrass cover has also been declining. All of the eelgrass in the Winnicut River was lost between 1990 and 2008. Eelgrass seedlings and young plants have been occasionally detected at low levels in the other tributaries to Great Bay and Little Bay. However, historical maps indicate that eelgrass formerly existed in these rivers (DES, 2008). The Piscataqua Region Estuaries Partnership (PREP) coordinates environmental monitoring in the Great Bay Estuary and Hampton-Seabrook Harbor. Maps of eelgrass distribution in the Great Bay Estuary provide useful information on water quality and critical habitats within the estuary and the environmental quality of the system. The PREP has developed a series of environmental indicators to track trends and to evaluate progress toward management goals. Eelgrass distribution is part of the PREP Monitoring Plan to gather data on these indicators (PREP, 2008). PREP intends to contract with UNH-JEL to continue this monitoring program in 2010 through 2014 to ensure that the record of annual eelgrass assessments will be unbroken. The methods used in this study do not include georectified imagery due to cost constraints. PREP intends to collect georectified imagery approximately every 10 years. Eelgrass was mapped using georectified imagery in 1996 and 2007. After this QAPP expires, PREP intends to establish a new contract with UNH-JEL to collect georectified imagery in 2015 using the protocols from NOAA C-CAP (NOAA, 1995) or its successor guidance. Maps of eelgrass in the estuary will be used by PREP, the NH Department of Environmental Services, UNH, and other coastal resource managers to evaluate trends in eelgrass populations over time.

No laboratory measurements will be made. Precision: +/-5 m for eelgrass bed boundaries Accuracy: +/-5 m for eelgrass bed boundaries Representativeness: The entire estuarine system will be mapped so the results will be representative of the whole system. Comparability: The method is compatible with scientific practice and has been described in previously published papers (Short and Burdick, 1996). The method will generally follow the standardized NOAA C-CAP protocol for mapping submerged aquatic vegetation (NOAA, 1995) or its successor documents to remain consistent with scientific practice. Sensitivity: Aerial imagery should be collected under conditions that are suitable to clearly delineate submerged eelgrass beds. Completeness: The entire Great Bay Estuary, including tributaries, will be mapped annually."}, {"section_title": "A8 -Special Training/Certification", "text": "The Program Manager will organize and implement a training session for project staff.

Typically 300 images are needed to cover the entire Great Bay Estuary. Ground-truthing requirements are discussed in Sections B2 and B5."}, {"section_title": "B2 -Sampling Methods", "text": "Aerial photographs are taken at 3000 feet at low spring tide with roughly 60% overlap on a calm day without preceding rain events and when the sun is at a low angle to minimize reflection (between 7 am and 10 am). Digital photographs are taken in late summer, usually late August or early September, depending on tides and weather, to reflect the maximum eelgrass annual biomass. The orientation of the photographs is near-vertical. The use of near-vertical images, instead of truly vertical images, is a deviation from the C-CAP protocol (NOAA, 1995), but follows a published method (Short and Burdick, 1996). Ground-truthing observations are made from a small boat within a month of the date of the overflight. The Project Manager navigates to areas in the estuary and checks for the presence of eelgrass and its approximate cover. The presence of macroalgae in these areas is also noted. Observations are recorded in a field notebook. Specific locations are recorded with a hand held GPS unit. The observations are used to identify eelgrass beds from the aerial imagery. In 10 locations in the estuary, the Project Manager delineates the boundary of an eelgrass bed using a hand-held GPS and a small boat. At least 50 meters of boundary are mapped in each of these locations. These boundaries are compared to boundaries mapped from the aerial imagery to determine the accuracy of the photo interpretation methods."}, {"section_title": "B3 -Sample Handling and Custody", "text": "Not applicable.

Aerial photographs will be interpreted using methods from Short and Burdick (1996) and NOAA (1995) to delineate the boundaries of eelgrass beds.

Each polygon is assigned a percent cover value from the following list: \"d\" (90-100% cover), \"sb\" (60-90%), \"h\" (30-60%), or \"p\" (10-30%). Code for percent coverage: d = dense; sb = some bottom; UNH Eelgrass Monitoring Program QAPP Draft No.: FINAL July 13, 2010 Page 9 of 11 h = half; p = patchy (or sparse).

The 10 bed boundaries mapped using a hand-held GPS (see section B2) are mapped on top of the eelgrass polygons using GIS software. For each of the 10 bed boundaries, the distance between each GPS point and the photo interpreted boundary is calculated. The average distance for all the GPS points in each boundary is then compared to the data quality objectives for precision and accuracy of +/-5 m. The ground-truth observations of eelgrass and macroalgae presence in different locations are used to check the photo-interpreted maps for accuracy."}, {"section_title": "B6 -Instrument/Equipment Testing, Inspection, Maintenance", "text": "Not applicable."}, {"section_title": "B7 -Instrument/Equipment Calibration and Frequency", "text": "Not applicable."}, {"section_title": "B8 -Inspection/Acceptance Requirements for Supplies and Consumables", "text": "Not applicable."}, {"section_title": "B9 -Non-direct Measurements", "text": "Not applicable."}, {"section_title": "B10 -Data Management", "text": "GIS files of eelgrass in the estuary will be processed by the PREP Coastal Scientist and then provided with appropriate metadata to NH GRANIT for public distribution.
