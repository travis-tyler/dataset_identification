[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Numerous recent studies have documented declines in populations of neotropical migratory birds inhabiting highly fragmented landscapes , Hagan and Johnston 1992 , Robinson et al. 1995 , Terborgh 1989 ). These studies have typically focused on forest-dwell? ing species in regions where formerly extensive, contiguous tracts of forest habitat have been broken and isolated into increasingly smaller patches. Accelerated rates of fragmentation are thought to have resulted in increased rates of nest predation and brood parasitism, which have Vermont Institute of Natural Science, RR 2 Box 532, Woodstock, VT 05091 294 Northeastern Naturalist Vol. 5, No. 4 contributed to declines in many breeding populations (Paton 1994 , Robinson et al. 1993 , Wilcove 1985 . Recent research has shown that while breeding densities of some neotropical migrants may increase shortly after fragmentation of forest stands, subsequent productivity may be lower in fragments than in nonfragmented forests (Hagan et al. 1996) .\nTo more clearly understand the effects of habitat fragmentation on birds, it is critical to collect long-term population trend data from both impacted areas and from protected, non-fragmented habitats (Arcese and Sinclair 1997, Temple and Wiens 1989) . Data from protected sites serve as controls with which to assess population changes due to local or widespread environmental changes.\nIn 1989 the Vermont Institute of Natural Science (VINS) initiated the Vermont Forest Bird Monitoring Program (FBMP). The program was modeled after the Ontario FBMP, which the Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) launched in 1987 (Welsh 1995) . The Vermont FBMP was designed to detect changes in breeding populations over time for all forest-dwelling songbirds, and to collect habitat-specific baseline data on species composition and relative abundance at undisturbed, interior forest sites in Vermont.\nWe undertook a statistical analysis of data collected from 17 study sites between 1989 and 1996. Our analysis included population trend estimates, a comparison of FBMP trends to those from other long-term data sets, and an evaluation of brown-headed cowbird occurrences on FBMP study sites. We also conducted power analyses using the 8-year data set to determine whether FBMP sampling protocols were adequate to detect meaningful trends. This paper summarizes these analyses and discusses future goals of the FBMP."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Site and Observer Selection", "text": "Several criteria were used to select FBMP study sites. Minimum requirements were that sites: 1) consist of mature, contiguous stands of homogeneous forest type; 2) be 40.5 ha or larger in order to avoid \"edge effects;\" and 3) be permanently protected from silvicultural practices, development, and other large-scale human-induced habitat changes. These criteria ensured that the study sites were located in relatively undisturbed, interior forest habitats that will remain rela?\ntively stable over the long-term, and in which bird populations should be little affected by the problems associated with forest fragmenta? tion.\nAt each site, 5 point counts (stations) were established at least 100 m from the nearest forest edge and 200 m apart. Each station was clearly marked and labeled with survey flagging and an aluminum tree tag.\nVolunteer observers were encouraged to participate in the project if they possessed a high degree of competency in both aural and visual bird identification, and could make a multi-year commitment."}, {"section_title": "Survey Methods", "text": "Survey methods consisted of unlimited distance point counts, based on the approach described by Blondel et al. (1981) and used in Ontario (Welsh 1995) . The count procedure was as follows: 1) Counts began shortly after dawn on days where weather conditions were unlikely to reduce count numbers (i.e., calm winds and very light or no rain). Censusing began shortly (<lmin.) after arriving at a station.\n2) Observers recorded all birds seen and heard during a 10-min sam? pling period, which was divided into 3 time intervals: 3, 2, and 5 mins. Observers noted in which time interval each bird was first encountered and were careful to record individuals only once. To reduce duplicate records, individual birds were mapped on stan? dardized field cards and known or presumed movements noted.\nDifferent symbols were used to record the status of birds encoun? tered (i.e., singing male, pair observed, calling bird, etc.).\n3) Each site was sampled twice during the breeding season; once during early June (ca. 2-12 June) and once during late June (ca. 14-25 June). Observers were encouraged to space their visits 7-10 days apart. For each site visit, all stations were censused in a single morning and in the same sequence. 4) Following each survey, field data were transcribed by the observer from the field cards onto data coding sheets. The level of breed?\ning evidence determined whether a bird was assumed to indicate a pair or a single bird: singing males, observed pairs, occupied nests, and family groups were considered to represent a pair and counted as 2 birds. All other individuals seen or heard were counted as singles.\nIn 1989, 11 sites (55 stations) were established and censused by VINS staff and volunteers. Two additional sites were added in 1990, 3 in 1991, and 1 in 1992, bringing the total number of study sites to 17 (85 stations) (Fig.l) . Six sites were located in northern hardwood forests; 6 were in transition hardwood forests dominated by oak (Quercus sp.), hickory (Carya sp.), maple (Acer sp.), and American beech (Fagus grandifolia); 3 were in lowland spruce (Picea sp). In preparing the data for population trend and power analyses, we used the higher of the 2 values recorded for each species as the station estimate for each year. Due to differences in the ability of observers to census birds, resulting in biased trend estimates (Sauer et al. 1994) , only data from the same observer in consecutive years at the same site were used for trend estimates. To improve the comparability of observations at sites that experienced a change in observer, data were divided into subsets corresponding to different observers. Since trends cannot be calculated from subsets of a single year, data were discarded from trend analyses if an observer surveyed a site for just one year. Kendall et al. (1996) recommend that count data from an observer's first year be removed from trend analyses due to a novice effect which was demon? strated to bias BBS trend results. We chose not to eliminate these data (N = 26) for this analysis in order to avoid further reducing sample sizes. on individual FBMP sites, then a composite trend estimate is derived from a weighted average of the site-specific trends (Geissler and Sauer 1990 ). The route regression program that we used was generously provided by the CWS and used to produce trend analyses for both the Ontario FBMP and the Breeding Bird Survey in Canada (Collins and Wendt 1989) .\nIn addition to calculating trends for individual species, we catego?\nrized species by wintering range as either neotropical migrants (Latin America or Caribbean winter range), short-distance migrants (south? eastern U.S.), or residents (northeastern U.S.). We then examined population trends for these three groups at all 17 study sites and in hardwood forest sites only. We chose not to produce habitat-specific population trends for individual species because it would further reduce sample sizes. As additional study sites have been, and continue to be established in each habitat type, we plan to evaluate population trends on a habitat-specific basis in future analyses.\nThe annual percent population change of FBMP trends were com? pared to those from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), a continent-wide, road-based census conducted once per year since 1966 (Droege 1990 , Robbins et al. 1986 ), and to those from the Ontario FBMP for data collected between 1987 (Anonymous 1998 . We used BBS data from Vermont and northern New England (BBS physi?\nographic strata 27, defined in Robbins et al. 1986 ) collected between 1989 . These comparisons were made using the Spearman rank correlation in SYSTAT 7.0.\nWe conducted power analyses of FBMP data for 4 species over 4 different time periods using Monitor 6.2 software (Gibbs 1995) "}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Trend Analysis", "text": "Population trend analyses were performed on data collected between 1989 and 1996.

Short-distance migrants (N=23 species) showed no distinct trends, while year-round residents (N=13 species) declined significantly (P=0.04) over all study sites but showed no trend in hardwood forests only.\nTo determine if the population changes estimated by the Vermont FBMP were similar to those from other long-term data sets, we corre? bined (R2 = 0.64, P = 0.090) showed a significant correlation between weather and relative abundance (Fig. 3) .\nTo determine the extent to which brown-headed cowbirds penetrated into interior FBMP forest sites, we examined occurrence data for this species by physiographic region ( 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 Year All Residents (P = 0.090, R =0.64) ? 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 Year determine basic sampling criteria needed to achieve a desired result (Gerrodette 1987 , Steidletal. 1997 . For long-term monitoring, statisti?\ncal power can be defined as the probability that a trend will be detected when the trend is occurring, despite any \"noise\" in the data.\nWe conducted a power analysis of FBMP data for 4 species over 4 different time periods (Table 4) . The probability that FBMP data would detect a 0-10% population increase or decrease was calculated for 4 neotropical migrants over 10, 15, 20, and 25 years. Using blackthroated blue warbler as an example, after 10 years of data collection, we would only have a 35% probability of detecting a 2% increase for this species should it occur, but we would have a 99% probability of detecting a 5% increase (Table 4 ). After 15 years of monitoring, our power to detect a 2% increase jumps to 84.8%. In all cases, increasing trends are more readily detected than decreasing trends, and small population changes are more difficult to detect than large changes."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "An examination of 8 years of point count data from a long-term forest bird monitoring program demonstrated that the FBMP is useful to detect population changes in at least some species. However, these trend estimates must be interpreted with caution, as 8 years is a rela?\ntively short period over which to assess meaningful changes in bird populations. At this temporal scale, it is impossible to determine whether increases or decreases in relative abundance are due to \"nor?\nmal\" short-term population fluctuations or whether they reflect longterm trends.\nAn especially noteworthy result is the significant decline detected for Canada warbler.

While the reasons for such a widespread decline may not be immediately apparent, habitat loss on the species' wintering grounds may be a contributing factor. The primary winter habitat of the Canada warbler is mature, submontane broad-leaved forests in the Andean foothills from Venezuela to south?\nern Peru (Curson et al. 1994 , Rappole et al. 1995 . This region has undergone tremendous habitat change over the past 50 years. By the late 1980s little forested habitat remained that had not been signifi?\ncantly altered by humans (Robbins et al. 1992) . In addition to bur?\ngeoning human populations in Columbia, Venezuela, and Peru, the climatic conditions and fertile soils of the Andean foothills make it the principal region for large-scale agricultural development. The cer?\nulean warbler (Dendroica cerulea), which also winters in this region of the Neotropics, although within a narrower ecological zone than the Canada warbler, has also declined significantly across much of its breeding range. These declines have, at least in part, been attributed to loss of wintering habitat (Robbins et al. 1992) . Likewise, breeding populations of Canada warblers may be severely affected by loss of wintering habitat. However, without demographic and reproductive data from the species' breeding grounds, it is impossible to determine what factors are contributing to the noted declines. Identified as a species deserving special conservation attention (James et al. 1996, Rosenberg and Wells 1995) , the Canada warbler warrants intensive study.\nFBMP trends for migratory groups showed that neotropical mi?\ngrants increased significantly in samples from hardwood forests. Sherry and Holmes (1992) demonstrated that the productivity of mi?\ngrants in New England's large contiguous forests is highly correlated with population changes, and is usually driven by factors such as weather or major insect outbreaks (Holmes et al. 1986) . While this suggests that long-distance migrants may have experienced relatively high productivity in the large tracts of mature, unmanaged hardwoods sampled by the FBMP over the 8-years, productivity data are needed to confirm this. In Maine, Hagan et al. (1996) demonstrated that the densities of some neotropical migrants increased shortly after a forest was fragmented, due to displaced individuals moving into available habitat. Along with these higher densities however, the productivity of at least one species, the ovenbird, was lower in the fragments than in nonfragmented forests. We do not believe the increase observed for neotropical migrants during the FBMP was due to recent fragmenta? tion effects. With the exception of one FBMP site, Concord Woods, which became a 40 ha habitat \"island\" during the study period due to logging around its perimeter, no gross habitat changes were noted at or around other FBMP sites.\nAlthough populations of short-distance migrants appeared to be stable during the period, the majority of these species occupy earlysuccessional or second-growth habitats and were not well represented in the FBMP data set. Year-round residents, however, declined signifi?\ncantly, and the relative abundances of brown creeper, downy wood?\npecker, and all residents combined showed positive correlations with severe winter weather (Fig. 3) . With the exception of one year (1994), hairy woodpecker populations also tracked weather data closely. Popu?\nlations of black-capped chickadees did not correlate closely with winter temperatures, perhaps due to supplemental feeding at bird feeders, which has been shown to increase the over-wintering survival rates of chickadees (Brittingham and Temple 1988) . Brown creepers do not frequent seed and suet feeders as consistently as other winter residents and they have been shown to be susceptible to severe winter weather (Graber and Graber 1979 Coker and Capen (1995) , who found that cowbirds in Vermont were most likely to occur in forested habitats if they were near large cleared areas (>9.8 ha) with high concentrations of livestock. Conversely, Coker and Capen (1995) found that small forest openings (< 4 ha) located at least 7 km from livestock areas were unlikely to attract cowbirds. Airola (1986) demonstrated that distance from a cowbird feeding area was an indi?\ncator of the rate of cowbird parasitism; sites that were closer to feed?\ning areas had higher parasitism rates. We suspect that many species breeding at FBMP sites in the Champlain Lowlands may experience relatively high rates of parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds, while those at study sites in the other physiographic regions probably have much lower rates. The fragmented forests of the Champlain Low?\nlands may act as population sinks for many migratory species, with high rates of brood parasitism and nest predation resulting in ex?\ntremely low reproductive rates (e.g., see Brawn and Robinson 1996, Brittingham and Temple 1983) . At the same time, the large interior forests of nearby areas may support source populations which pro?\nduce enough surplus birds to sustain the losses of the sinks. Further research is needed to investigate this.\nPower analyses from the FBMP data set show that this monitoring program can detect fairly small population changes (2% increases and 3% declines), even for species with relatively small sample sizes and high variability, especially after 15 years of monitoring. Considering that 1997 represented the 9th year of FBMP data collection, and that additional study sites have been added over the last few years to increase our sample sizes (with plans to establish more sites in upcoming years), future power to detect changes in forest bird populations should in?\ncrease."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Future Directions", "text": "The Vermont FBMP provides habitat-specific information about breeding bird populations in protected, unmanaged, interior forests. monitoring programs is that they estimate trends, not productivity. Brawn and Robinson (1996) showed that lack of a declining trend does not necessarily signify the viability of local populations, especially in fragmented habitats. This underscores the need for supplementing monitoring programs with long-term data on reproductive success and demographics."}]
