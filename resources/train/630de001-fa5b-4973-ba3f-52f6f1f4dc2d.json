[{"section_title": "", "text": "Reflecting the value placed on postsecondary education, nearly all 1992 high school graduates (97 percent) reported in 12 th grade that they expected to continue their education at some point, and 79 percent planned to enroll immediately after finishing high school (Berkner and Chavez 1997) . Sixty-five percent of this cohort had carried out these plans by October 1992. Over the last decade, the percentage of high school completers who were enrolled in college the October after finishing high school has ranged between 60 and 67 percent, up from 49 percent in 1972 (Indicator 26).\nCollege enrollment rates vary considerably with parents' educational attainment. In 1999, 82 percent of students whose parents held a bachelor's degree or higher enrolled in college immediately after finishing high school. The rates were much lower for those whose parents had completed high school but not college (54 percent) and even lower for those whose parents had less than a high school diploma (36 percent) (Indicator 26) . Because of the difference in enrollment rates, students whose parents did not go to college are one of the most frequently targeted groups (along with minorities and low-income students) for outreach programs designed to raise the level of student preparation and readiness for postsecondary work (Swail and Perna 2000) .\nThis essay summarizes the findings of a series of recent NCES studies about the experiences of high school graduates and postsecondary students whose parents did not attend college. These studies show that such students are at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to postsecondary access-a disadvantage that persists even after controlling for other important factors such as educational expectations, academic preparation, support from parents and schools in planning and preparing for college, and family income. Also according to these studies, among those who overcome the barriers to access and enroll in postsecondary education, students whose parents did not attend college remain at a disadvantage with respect to staying enrolled and attaining a degree (referred to as persistence and attainment throughout this essay), again controlling for other related factors. Rigorous high school coursetaking mitigates, but does not completely close, the gaps in access and persistence.

Among 1992 high school graduates whose parents did not go to college, 59 percent had enrolled in some form of postsecondary education by 1994 (table 1) . The enrollment rate increased to 75 percent among those whose parents had some college experience, and to 93 percent among those whose parents had at least a bachelor's degree.\nParents' education mattered even for graduates who as seniors had planned to enroll in a 4-year institution immediately after high school. Among these college-bound seniors, 65 percent of those whose parents did not attend college had enrolled in a 4-year institution by 1994, compared with 87 percent of those whose parents had bachelor's degrees or higher. In addition, rather than pursuing their plans to attend a 4-year institution, graduates whose parents did not attend college were about twice as likely as their peers whose parents had attained bachelor's or advanced degrees to attend public 2-year institutions instead (20 versus 9 percent).\nParents' education is only one of many factors linked to postsecondary enrollment. In fact, multivariate analyses have shown that family income, educational expectations, academic preparation, parental involvement, and peer influence also independently affected graduates' likelihood of enrolling in a 4-year institution by 1994 (Horn and Nu\u00f1ez 2000) . Nonetheless, parents' education-specifically, having a parent with a bachelor's degree-remained significant even after controlling for these other factors.

High school graduates whose parents had no postsecondary education were less likely than those whose parents had bachelor's degrees or higher to report in 12 th grade that they chose their high school program with their parents' help (34 versus 48 percent), and more likely to report that they chose it by themselves (28 versus 22 percent) (Horn and Nu\u00f1ez 2000) .

Therefore, examining parents' education in relation to students' behaviors and academic experiences as they plan and prepare for college during high school may produce insights into how the influence of parents' education might be reduced.\nAmong students who began their postsecondary education in 1995-96, first-generation students were more likely than others to be 24 years or older (table 4) . If they were younger than 24 and financially dependent on their parents (as most students that age are), they were more likely than others to be in the lowest family income quartile. They were less likely than other students to have taken the SAT or ACT tests (which reflects the fact that they were also less likely to enroll in 4-year institutions; see table 5 ). If they did take one of these tests, they were more likely than those whose parents had bachelor's degrees or higher to have scored in the lowest quartile (table 4) .\nCompared with other students, first-generation students were less likely to enroll in 4-year institutions, and to attend full time over a full year (table 5) . In addition, first-generation students who worked while enrolled (as 70 percent did) were more likely than others to consider themselves to be primarily employees who were enrolled in school (as opposed to being primarily students) (Kojaku and Nu\u00f1ez 1998) ."}, {"section_title": "The path to college", "text": "The path to college enrollment consists of five somewhat sequential steps (Berkner and Chavez 1997) , although students do not always think of the process in these terms (Hossler et al. 1999) . First, students must decide that they want to pursue postsecondary education and what type. Second, they must prepare academically for college-level work. Third, if they want to attend a 4-year institution, they must usually take the SAT or ACT entrance examinations. Fourth, they must choose one or more institutions and file applications. Finally, they must gain acceptance and make the financial and other arrangements necessary to enroll.\nFigure 3 displays the percentage of 1992 high school graduates who completed each step (and all previous steps) toward enrollment in a 4-year institution. Graduates whose parents did not go to college were much less likely than their peers with more educated parents to complete each step. Compared with graduates whose parents had earned bachelor's degrees, they were about half as likely to aspire to a bachelor's degree in 10 th grade (46 versus 86 percent), and, having completed all the other steps in the pipeline, about a third as likely to enroll in a 4-year institution (21 versus 65 percent).\nAs will be described, the findings from the NELS survey indicate that high school graduates whose parents did not go to college tended to report lower educational expectations, be less prepared academically, and receive less support from their families in planning and preparing for college than their peers whose parents attended college. The following discussion addresses each step to college enrollment in more detail. Lower educational expectations figure prominently in the lower postsecondary enrollment rates of students whose parents did not go to college. In the NELS survey, students were asked the following question in both 8 th and 12 th grades: \"As things stand now, how far in school do you think you will get?\" Overall, expectations were high, with all but 7 percent of 1992 high school graduates reporting in 8 th grade that they expected to continue their education beyond high school (table 2) . Seventy-three percent reported that they expected to earn at least a bachelor's degree, and another 20 percent expected to complete some college or vocational training. Students' expectations of earning a bachelor's degree or higher increased sharply as their parents' education rose-from 55 percent for those whose parents had no postsecondary education, to 71 percent for those whose parents had some college experience, to 91 percent for those whose parents had bachelor's degrees or higher.

The percentage of these students who did not expect to continue their education beyond high school decreased."}, {"section_title": "Academic preparation", "text": "Taking appropriate courses in high school is an important step in preparing for college. In discussing academic preparation, this essay emphasizes preparation for 4-year colleges or universities. Lack of academic preparation is not necessarily a barrier to entry into a lessthan-4-year institution, but it may be associated with students' success once there.\nn High school graduates whose parents did not go to college are less likely than those whose parents earned bachelor's or advanced degrees to be academically prepared for admission to a 4-year college.\nLow academic qualifications as well as lower expectations contributed to the lower enrollment rates of 1992 high school graduates whose parents had no postsecondary education. About half (49 percent) of this group were only \"marginally or not qualified\" for admission to a 4-year college (figure 4). 4 Considerably smaller proportions of those with more educated parents lacked qualifications (33 percent of those whose parents had some college experience and 15 percent of those whose parents had at least bachelor's degrees). At the other end of the preparation scale, those whose parents had no postsecondary education were less likely than others to be in the \"highly qualified\" category.\nAcademic qualifications alone do not fully explain the observed variation in enrollment rates. Parents' education made a difference even among the most highly qualified graduates. Of this group, 92 percent of those whose parents had bachelor's degrees or higher had enrolled in a 4-year institution by 1994, but just 76 percent of those whose parents had no postsecondary education had done so (figure 5). The relationship between mathematics coursetaking and enrollment in a 4-year institution is striking. Seventy-six percent of 1992 high school graduates who took advanced academic mathematics 5 in high school had enrolled in a 4-year institution by 1994 (figure 6). The enrollment rate declined to 44 percent for those at the Middle Academic II level (did not go beyond algebra II), to 16 percent for those at the Middle Academic I level (only algebra and geometry), and to 6 percent for those with no mathematics or low-level or nonacademic mathematics.\nMathematics coursetaking is strongly related to parents' education, even when considering only students with comparatively high mathematics skills. Among high school graduates who had achieved the highest level of mathematics proficiency tested in the 8 th grade, 6 those whose parents did not attend college were much less likely than those whose parents had bachelor's degrees or higher to take algebra in 8 th grade (34 versus 55 percent) (figure 7). They were also much less likely to complete any advanced mathematics in high school (63 versus 83 percent). However, if they took algebra in 8 th grade, the percentage taking advanced mathematics in high school rose to 83 percent, narrowing the gap with those students whose parents had bachelor's degrees.\nTaking advanced mathematics in high school, in turn, is associated with a higher rate of enrollment in a 4-year institution. Among graduates whose parents had no postsecondary education, the enrollment rate of those who took advanced mathematics (64 percent) greatly exceeded the enrollment rates of their peers who First-generation status still mattered, however, because even if they took advanced mathematics in high school, graduates whose parents had no postsecondary education were considerably less likely than those whose parents had at least bachelor's degrees to enroll in 4-year institutions (64 versus 85 percent).\nIn sum, students whose parents did not go to college remained at a disadvantage in terms of access to postsecondary education, even when taking into account academic ability and mathematics coursetaking. However, if they took advanced mathematics in high school, and particularly if they started with algebra in 8 th grade, they greatly increased their chances of enrolling in a 4-year institution. These findings are consistent with those of Adelman (1999) , who, using more sophisticated measures and statistical tools than those used for the studies summarized here, found that students' high school curriculum was the most influential determinant of their attainment of a bachelor's degree. He also found that of all precollege curricula, the highest level of mathematics that students took had the strongest continuing influence on their completing a bachelor's degree.\nn Parents' involvement in their children's curricular choices increases with their education.\nConsidering only students with comparatively high mathematics skills in 8 th grade (those who scored at the highest level tested), the frequency with which students reported that their parents had encouraged them to take algebra in 8 th grade increased with parents' education-from 52 percent of those whose parents had no "}, {"section_title": "Taking tests and preparing applications", "text": "The final steps in applying to a 4-year college include taking admissions tests (SAT or ACT) if required, selecting specific colleges, and preparing applications for admission. If financial aid is needed, relevant information must be gathered and the appropriate applications completed. Students sometimes receive help from parents, teachers, counselors, or others as they go through these steps. Among 1992 high school graduates who were \"college qualified,\" the likelihood of receiving assistance in applying to college increased with their parents' education. When the graduates were seniors, those whose parents did not attend college were considerably less likely than their peers whose parents had bachelor's degrees or higher to report that they often discussed SAT or ACT preparation (16 versus 27 percent) or postsecondary plans (42 versus 61 percent) with their parents (table 3) . Furthermore, the percentage of students whose parents reported that they had participated in various planning activities-such as attending programs on educational opportunities, seeking information on financial aid, and accompanying their child on a school visit to decide about application or enrollment-was notably higher if the parents had bachelor's or advanced degrees than when they had no postsecondary education.\nn Students whose parents did not go to college are not more likely to receive help from their schools in applying to colleges.\nSome students receive help with the college application process from their schools. Among collegequalified 1992 high school graduates, 52 percent reported receiving help with completing their college applications, 33 percent with preparing an admissions essay, and 46 percent with arranging days off to visit colleges (Horn and Nu\u00f1ez 2000) . Although one might expect students whose parents had no postsecondary education to receive help more often in these areas, there were no significant differences by parents' education. Students whose parents had no postsecondary education or some college were more likely to report that they received help with a financial aid application (51 and 47 percent, respectively) than were those whose parents had bachelor's degrees (34 percent); however, they were probably also more likely to be applying for aid.\nMultivariate analysis confirms the importance of parental involvement and school support in preparing for college. Parental involvement in curricular decisions and college planning activities was associated with higher enrollment rates even after controlling for parents' income and education and for students' mathematics curriculum and level of college qualification (Horn and Nu\u00f1ez 2000) . Although all students must make decisions about how to finance their postsecondary education and many need financial aid, students and their parents are not well informed about the price of attending. Among students approaching college age (i.e., 11 th -and 12 th -graders) and planning to attend some form of postsecondary education, 37 percent of students and 28 percent of their parents could not estimate what the price of tuition and fees might be (Indicator 25).

This suggests that students who get this far somehow find the necessary financial resources (including financial aid, if necessary) and other support they need to enroll; however, the analysis could not take into account the extent to which students were deterred along the way by the price of college, availability of financial aid, or other factors."}, {"section_title": "PERSISTENCE AND ATTAINMENT", "text": "To reap the full benefits of postsecondary education, students must attain a degree.

About two-thirds of those in BPS, however, were 19 years or younger (Kojaku and Nu\u00f1ez 1998 ) so findings from future analyses of the NELS data may be similar to those from analysis of the BPS data.\nIn 1995-96, 47 percent of all beginning postsecondary students were first generation-that is, neither of their parents had more than a high school education (figure 9).

The availability and awareness of financial aid help remove the barriers to enrolling in college and remaining there. The independent effects of financial aid on the enrollment and persistence of first-generation students have not been explicitly considered in this analysis.\nOver time, increases in educational attainment among young adults (who may eventually become parents themselves) may reduce the proportion of students disadvantaged by low parental education. Between 1971 and 1998, the proportion of 25-to 29-year-olds who earned a bachelor's degree or higher rose (from 22 to 31 percent), as did the proportion who attended some college (from 44 to 66 percent) (Indicator 59, The Condition of Education 1999) . Whether this will result in a net decline in the percentage of children whose parents did not attend college will depend on the balance between the trend toward a more highly educated population and demographic trends related to marriage, childbearing, and immigration.\nIn the meantime, evidence from the studies summarized here suggests that programs and practices that encourage first-generation students to take academically challenging courses in high school and counsel students and their parents about preparing for college may hold promise for broadening the access of these students to postsecondary education and helping them succeed once enrolled.\nvide supplementary data. It was assumed that, if AP records indicated that students had taken an AP test, students had taken a honors/AP course.\nCoursetaking was compared with the New Basics curriculum recommended by the National Commision on Excellence in Education (NCEE) in 1983 that consists of 4 years of English, 3 years each of mathematics, science, and social studies, and one-half year of computer science. The Core New Basics is the most commonly implemented form of this curriculum and excludes the computer science requirement.\nn Core New Basics or below: Student completed no more than 4 years of English and 3 years each of mathematics, science, and social studies."}]
