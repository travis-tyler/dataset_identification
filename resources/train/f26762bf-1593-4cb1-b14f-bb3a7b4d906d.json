With one quarter of the total United States (US) population living in rural communities located across 97 percent of American soil, understanding and evaluating rural well-being is essential in promoting rural economic growth and building a more sustainable future. This dissertation focuses on two measures of rural quality of life in Illinois: housing values and health care access. Home ownership is the largest wealth investment a household can make. Access to health care also affects an individual's quality of life. Individuals sort themselves based on their preferences. (Blomquist, 2008;Tiebout, 1956) In Tiebout's model, people sort themselves in communities based on their preferences. (Tiebout, 1956) The individual will choose to live in a community with a certain amount of public goods that maximizes his or her happiness. Blomquist reiterates Tiebout's logic, stating that \"for everyone to be satisfied and remain living where they are, it must be true that no one has incentive to move.\" (Blomquist, 2008) Rosen determines that \"households will be attracted to areas where there are good buys: better combinations of amenities, wages and housing prices.\" (Blomquist, 2008) Through estimating housing price trends, evaluating policy impacts on rural hospital structures, and valuing rural hospitals as local amenities, rural quality of life in Illinois can be better understood. There are many ways to define rural. No single definition is perfect or able to capture 100 percent of the rural population. In the following chapters, rural is defined by the United States Preserving small rural hospitals, through the CAH certification, is aimed at improving rural quality of life, which is measured here by housing values. Using hedonic estimation, this essay focuses on the impact of a CAH compared to that of a full-service hospital on housing values. The design of this essay is to compare the effect of a CAH, specifically Crawford Memorial Hospital, on the surrounding county (Crawford county) housing values to the effect of a non-CAH, McDonough District Hospital, on the surrounding county (McDonough county) housing values. Crawford is a rural county with a small CAH. McDonough is, according to USDA's UICs, considered a micropolitan county. The results suggest that a CAH has similar effects on housing values as a full-service hospital. Therefore, the results of this paper support the hypothesis that preserving a CAH is as useful as preserving a full-service hospital, in terms of the benefits to the local housing values.  Housing trends have been estimated using the repeat sales method since Bailey et al. (1963) the Bailey Muth Nourse model (BMN) . After Case and Shiller (1987) extended the BMN model to include weights of the BMN residuals and made the analysis a three step process, others extended the model. Case and Quigley, 1991;Goetzmann and Spiegel, 1995;Clapp and Giaccotto, 1999;Wang and Zorn, 1997;Meese and Wallace, 1997;Costello and Watkins, 2002) Using sales transactions data from the Illinois Department of Revenue (DOR), this essay compares median and repeat sales methods for estimating housing price appreciation and depreciation in rural, micro and metro Illinois from 2000 through 2009. The repeat sales method used is the Case-Shiller. The median uses the nonparametrically trimmed DOR data set. A second median index was calculated using the second sales prices in the repeat sales data set to gain insight into the repeat sales sample."}, {"section_title": "List of Citations", "text": "This work contributes to the growing body of literature related to the housing boom and bust by showing that housing values in rural Illinois did appreciate and depreciate. This paper is original in that the method is applied to different levels of spatial aggregation. To the best of my knowledge, repeat sales techniques have not been applied to rural areas in Illinois. The policy implications of publishing inaccurate housing trends are two-fold. Housing values translate into local property tax funds that impact local government provisions of public goods, such as schools. In addition, federal and state government programs providing housing and subsidies to lower income households also depend on accurate reporting of trends in the housing market. Section 2.2 describes the empirical methods used in this paper. Section 2.3 describes the data. Section 2.4 explains the results and section 2.5 concludes this analysis."}, {"section_title": "Specification of the empirical models", "text": "The current trend of housing price indexes is dominated by repeat sales methods or some form of hedonic price method. There are a few other methods worth exploring in order to create the best rural housing price index for Illinois. The easiest methods for constructing housing price indexes are based on computing the mean or median price of properties that were sold during each time period. The distribution of prices in a mean housing index is sharply skewed, meaning that the mean price exceeds the median price. This is caused by fluctuations in sales volume among properties at extreme ends of the spectrum, which have a strong effect on the mean price but a muted effect on median price. In most cases, the median housing price index (HPI) is preferable, because it is not susceptible to being skewed by outliers. The median HPI has its share of shortcomings, however. It fails to control for changes in the quality or mix of properties whose prices were observed in each period. It is assumed that quality improves over time as new properties are constructed, older properties are demolished, and existing properties are renovated. Due to quality adjustments on price, using an average or median price index may or may not overstate the increase in price for a constant-quality property or for any existing property. The repeat sales model improves on the shortcomings of the median index, because it has the ability to control for constant quality. The repeat sales method is a ratio of two transaction prices for the same property in two time periods. If the characteristics of the house did not change between sales transactions, then only the following data is required: the time period in which each house transacted, the price, and the location or unique identifier of the property. The primary disadvantage of the repeat-sales model is that it can be estimated only on properties that sell at least twice during the study period. This results in a loss of 85 to 95 percent of the sales in the data set unless there is a large time interval. As the time interval increases, it becomes more challenging to maintain the constant quality assumption."}, {"section_title": "Median Housing Price Index", "text": "The median index means that 50 percent of the houses are above this price and 50 percent of the houses fall below this price. Any outliers in the data set will not be able to skew the index as much as the mean housing price index. One drawback of using the median index over time is that the mix of houses in the sample may change. If in one year more high priced houses sell, the median will be high. If the next year sees more low priced houses sold, the median will be low. In this case, the median reflects the mix of houses that sold rather than drop in housing values."}, {"section_title": "Repeat Sales Housing Price Index", "text": "The most widely used index for urban areas is the repeat sales index. This index was designed by Bailey et al. (1963) and was derived from the hedonic price model. The idea of a repeat sales index is to create a data set with two observations of the same property. The housing characteristics are assumed to be constant. The model is expressed as a ratio of the two transaction prices for that same property, as given in Equation 2.1.  ln In Equation 2.1, P , X 1 and X 2 represent the values of price, a continuously measured hedonic characteristic, and a discretely measured characteristic at the time of the earlier transaction, respectively. T indicates the time period of the earlier transaction.  If the hedonic characteristics remain unchanged between the transactions, then X = X . Many repeat sales indexes assume constant quality or unchanged characteristics of the housing unit. Therefore, the model simplifies to Equation 2.2. If there are no hedonic characteristic changes between the two transactions of the property, then the data requirements are simple. In this case, the housing prices, dates of sale, and a unique identifier are the only data needed. An improved repeat sales analysis can be done if more housing characteristics are added to the equation. Including housing characteristics in the model becomes complicated, because of the data requirements. Individual housing characteristics are collected by the local, city, or county assessor's offices. In many rural communities, the assessor only has a rough idea of the interior of the house. Furthermore, many rural assessors collect data on property record cards, which can be found in filing cabinets. Thus, it is time consuming and costly to obtain the characteristics of each house that sold and to document if that house has been renovated within the index timeframe. One problem the researcher is faced with when assuming constant quality of housing characteristics is potential omitted variable bias. If the time interval is large, omitted variable bias occurs unless the model accounts for renovations. The main variable in the model is the price change between the two sales of the same home. The data set consists of other important variables such as the unique identifier or ad-dress, the sale date, the sale price, and type of property. (Englund et al., 1999) Assume the logarithm of the price of the i th house at time t, then P it is given by Equation 2.3. where I t is the logarithm of the price level at t, H it is a Gaussian random walk model, meaning that the variance of prices of houses varies linearly with time (as described in Equation 2.4 and Equation 2.5). (Wang and Zorn, 1997) N it is essentially white noise that has a zero mean, equal variance, and no serial correlation. Let V it = P t + Q it + \u03b5 it be the logarithm of the sale price of house i at time t, where Q is the logarithm of the quality of house i at time t and P t is the logarithm of the constant quality price index at time t. For houses sold at time \u03c4 and time t, the index is computed in three steps. The residuals, \u00b5, are saved for use in the second step. First, where D is = 1 if s = t or D is = \u22121 if s = \u03c4 and D is = 0 otherwise and \u03c6 s is the estimate of I s , which is the logarithm of the price level at time s. Then, the squared residuals from Equation 2.6 are regressed on a constant and the elapsed time between sales, (t \u2212 \u03c4), yielding estimates of the variances \u03c3 2 H and \u03c3 2 N . In the third stage and final stage, Equation 2.6 uses the estimates from the second stage regression that form the weights for the generalized least squares regression. (Englund et al., 1999) 2. and at the 99 th percentile. After trimming, there are 785,765 observations in the data set. The minimum sale price is $ 9,960 and the maximum sale price is $ 825,000. Table I provides descriptive statistics of each data set. Since the repeat sales index discards houses that were only sold once, the number of houses in the repeat sales data set is significantly less than the number found in the median index data set. The maps in Figure 30, Appendix B and Figure 31, Appendix B are created using median housing values from the 2010 5-year American Community Survey data to asses the variations in housing values. In Table II, the interquartile ranges of each of the data sets are shown. It is consistent that the repeat sales housing values are higher than that in the median data sets.  Figure 1 shows that there is more appreciation for micro and rural in the repeat sales estimation. There are two possible reasons why this is the case. The first hypothesis is that the repeat sales method controls for quality changes better than the median. The second hypothesis is that the repeat sales may not be a representative sample of the median sales sample. After evaluating median prices in the repeat sales sample, as found in Figure 2 and Table XXI, Appendix B, the repeat sales sample is not that different in terms of trends. The repeat sales method captures the appreciation and depreciation by using a house that sold twice in the time period. This method is better able to control for the mix of houses.

Figure 2 shows a graph of the median housing price index created from the repeat sales sample. It is consistently the case that the repeat sales prices are higher than those in the median data set.

Thus, demographic characteristics and economic characteristics of the market area often determine the number of hospital beds, the number of staff, and the type of hospital ownership are elements of hospital structure. In addition, government intervenes in hospital markets, due to their im-perfectly competitive nature. When a rural hospital closes, the entire community is affected. Longo and Chase (1984) find that due to \"the social, economic and political significance of most hospitals, closure usually has profound implications in terms of employment, access and availability to health care services, and even the overall economic stability of an area.\" The elderly, disabled, uninsured, and individuals needing emergent care are the most affected. While CAHs are somewhat limited in the scope of their services, they do provide necessary basic care for those most in need in rural communities, especially elderly residents. The most important health benefit of having a hospital in a rural community is evident in time-sensitive medical care, such as in the cases of an acute myocardial infarction, major car accident, or farm accident. (Buchmueller et al., 2006) In accidents and heart attacks, the chances of survival or full recovery rely on receiving immediate medical attention. For rural elderly residents, having a hospital in their rural communities reduces the travel time. In most rural communities, a lack of public transportation leaves many residents without cars relying on others to transport them to and from the hospital."}, {"section_title": "Supply and Demand Sides of Hospitals", "text": "Government policy is only one determinant of changes to the structure of the hospital industry. There are other factors that need to be examined to understand the forces affecting the structure of the hospital industry. According to Longo and Chase (1984), hospital structure depends on a number of factors that stem from hospital supply and demand. Figure 3 focuses on the hospital in the center of the diagram. The hospital structure is made up of the number of beds, the number of staff, nurses, and doctors, the extent of services offered, and the ownership. The number of beds in a hospital is a basic indicator of the number of services. As the number of beds increases, so do the number of services. The hospital needs doctors, nurses and staff in order to provide patient services. Doctors and nurses need the hospital for wages and for the use of technologies and facilities housed in the hospital. The supply of hospital services depends on the doctors, nurses, and staff, in addition to the hospital competition in the area. Competition can be a good thing, because it can lower costs to the patient and increase efficiencies by decreasing the number of unused beds and reducing staff. Competition can also promote differentiation, such that one hospital could offer different services than another nearby hospital. Competition can also lead to hospital closings. Competition can be measured in terms of hospital market share (number of hospital beds as percent of total in market area), the number of hospitals in an area, and the distance to another hospital. There are several environmental factors that impact the demand side of hospital services. Patients demand health services from the hospital. In rural areas, patients typically use the hospital for primary care as well as emergent care services. Environmental influences on de-mand include: the total population in the area, the change in the total population, the change in total population above 65, per capita income, percent of the population living in poverty, and the unemployment rate. If the population is low near the hospital, the hospital will struggle. If the population near the hospital decreases over time, the hospital will struggle. Increases in poverty, unemployment, and the number of elderly and disabled in a community have negative financial impacts on the hospital. Government policies impact the hospital both directly and indirectly. Government policies, such as CAH, restrict bed size. Medicare has certain staffing requirements, thus increasing a hospital's overhead. Government policies also impact hospital demand through the use of Medicare and Medicaid. In Table V the types of hospital ownership in Illinois are given by classification in 1998. The types of hospital ownership are: government, non-profit religious affiliated, non-profit other, and private for-profit. Decisions about hospital structure made by the hospital leadership depend on the type of ownership. Decisions to exit the hospital market also depend on the hospital ownership. Capps et al. (2010) find that for-profit hospitals exit the market when their marginal cost exceeds marginal revenue, which is consistent with economic theory. They also find that distressed non-profit hospitals linger even if they are facing financial difficulties. (Capps et al., 2010) Hospital Structure:   Between 1998 and 2007, a shift in hospital ownership occurred in rural areas. The corporate for-profits exited the market in metro, micro and rural areas and some hospitals shifted to government ownership. with an acute-care hospital for patient referral or transfer. If a rural hospital meets these requirements, then it is able to receive cost-based reimbursement from Medicare for inpatient and outpatient services. In addition, the BBA 1997 allowed hospitals to relax their staffing and services requirements. (Dalton et al., 2003) The Balanced Budget Refinement Act (BBRA) in 1999 set the length of stay to an annual average of 4 days or 96 hours. (Li et al., 2009) In addition, these CAH rural hospitals were able to relax their Medicare-required staffing and service requirements in order to free up more capital. (Blanchfield et al., 2000) The cost-based reimbursement acts as a buffer to help increase patient revenue. In addition, the reimbursement helps buffer the losses that CAHs incur when treating their Medicare patients. (Doeksen et al., 2008) The 2003 Medicare Modernization Act changed the allowable beds to 25 for acute care services.

(1983 find evidence that in the future, hospitals could close with greater frequency, due to changes in federal reimbursement and an increase in cost shifting. Longo and Chase (1984) conclude that closure is highly correlated with the following factors: investor-owned status, hospital bed numbers (i.e., those with less than 100 beds), and low occupancy rates.

The dependent variable is called duration, which is a combination variable of the time to an event (hospital closure) and whether the event occurred or was censored (the end of the study). Duration is assumed to follow the density function f (t). The cumulative distribution function, F(t), or probability that the duration time will be less than t, is denoted in Equation 3.1. The survival function is the probability that the duration will be at least t (Equation 3.2). The hazard rate is the probability that the event will happen at time t given that the individual is at risk at time t. The hazard rate is given in Equation 3.3. The hazard rate in the Cox proportional hazard model is defined in Equation 3.4."}, {"section_title": "Description of the data", "text": "The data come from the American Hospital Association Guides (1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007). The years represented in the analysis are 1997, 1998, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007 is unknown. This model didn't start at the beginning of the hospital creation, therefore it is left censored. The data also are right censored, because the period of observation (1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007) ends. There were 802 observations in this study.

Property record cards that the County Accessor creates hold the individual housing characteristics and the sale data and sale price of the house. The houses are identified by the street address of the owner. While there were no indicators for sales to family members, the data were cleaned to try to best represent arms length sales. Sales less than $ 2,500 are dropped. The cleaned data were geocoded and plotted on a map in the Arc Geographical Information System (ArcGIS) using latitude and longitude coordinates. The location of the house was then used to measure the Euclidean distance to the nearest high school, distance to the county seat administrative office, and distance to the hospital. Census tract data (including: percent of vacant homes, percent of the population who are black or African American, and percent of the population who are Hispanic) from the 2010 American Community Survey 5year data set were then matched to each housing observation using ArcGIS. Town and township dummy variables were also added and are shown in the descriptive statistics tables. This helps to understand the distribution of the houses in the county. "}, {"section_title": "Interpretation of the Results", "text": "The Cox regression results are shown in Table X. The CAH coefficient shows that the hospital with this classification will have a higher duration (longer time to closure) and it will be less likely for the hospital to close. As the number of beds increases in the hospital it is less likely to close and will also have a higher duration. Hospitals that are under corporate ownership are more likely to close and have a lower duration. These findings are consistent with the literature.  (1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007) One way to assess the goodness-of-fit for a Cox regression is to compute the Harrell's Cstatistic. In this model, the Harrell's C is 0.9538. The rule-of-thumb for the Harrell's C is if c > 0.7 then the model is a good model. Therefore, this is satisfied."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Access This paper adds to the literature by considering the impact of the proximity to the local hospital in a rural county and small micropolitan county on housing values.

In Equation 4.1, Hedonic prices stem from the works of Rosen (1974) and Roback (1982). In the models presented in this paper, the ln P i is the logarithm of the price of property i. The vector of X i variables include: natural logarithm of building area, natural logarithm of land area, natural logarithm of the age of the structure, Other X i variables are bedrooms, bathrooms, garage, central air conditioning, percent of vacant homes, percent African Americans, and percent Hispanic. The \u03b4 i represents distance variables, such as: natural logarithm of the distance to the high school, natural logarithm of the distance to the county seat, natural logarithm of the distance to the nearest high school. The \u03b5 term is the error term. There are four hedonic models for each county. The first model is a simple semi-logarithmic hedonic model using the natural logarithm of price and the natural logs of the following: the square feet of the housing structure, the land square feet, age of the structure. Included in the simple model (model 1) are also discrete variables: number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, presence of a garage, and central air conditioning. The second model includes the variables from the simple model adding only the natural logarithm of distance from the house to the hospital. The third model builds on the second by adding the natural logarithm of the distance to the county seat and neighborhood characteristics at the census tract level: percent black or African American, percent Hispanic, and percent vacant homes. The fourth model adds the final amenity variable: distance to the nearest high school.
