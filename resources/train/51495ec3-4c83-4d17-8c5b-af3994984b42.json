Amyloid imaging studies have produced findings consistent with observations from autopsy series, confirming significant amyloid deposition among most symptomatic individuals. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] However, also consistent with autopsy studies, 7, 8 up to about 30% of older individuals without symptoms of AD have amyloid levels that are elevated to the same degree as their symptomatic counterparts. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Furthermore, the amount of measurable amyloid deposition is a relatively weak correlate of symptom severity among individuals with AD or individuals at risk for AD. 10, 12, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Together, these findings suggest that \u2424-amyloid is necessary but perhaps not sufficient to cause the syndrome associated with the disease.\nDespite consistent observations linking vascular factors to AD, 19, 20 cerebrovascular disease is considered a distinct process that is not a core feature of the disease. In fact, recently reformulated diagnostic criteria for AD treat evidence of cerebrovascular disease as an explicit exclusionary criterion. 21 Yet, a preponderance of literature suggests that the severity of small-vessel cerebrovascular disease is increased among individuals with AD and those at risk for AD, 22, 23 reliably predicts who will develop AD in the future, 24, 25 and predicts the rate of decline of cognitive symptoms among individuals diagnosed as having AD. 26 Small-vessel cerebrovascular disease is commonly visualized on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as increased signal intensity in white matter or white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). However, it is unclear whether WMHs confer an increased risk for AD above and beyond the risk conferred by \u2424-amyloid. It is also unclear whether or how WMHs interact with \u2424-amyloid.\nThis study represents an early step in addressing these issues. Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we first asked the question of whether the severity of WMHs discriminates between individuals with prevalent AD and control subjects independently of the effects of \u2424-amyloid measured with Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB). From a clinical perspective, it is essential to identify which factors contribute to dementia among older adults with evidence of significant amyloid deposition to inform treatment and preventive strategies and to determine prognosis. Thus, the second purpose of this study was to examine whether, among individuals who were PIB positive, WMH severity discriminated between those who met clinical criteria for AD and those who were classified as normal control subjects. Our final goal was to examine whether the severity of WMHs provides prognostic information regarding individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). To do so, we examined whether baseline information about WMHs, in addition to PIB status, predicted future development of AD. By applying a threshold value to define high and low WMH burden derived from the second analysis to the subjects with MCI, this analysis allowed us to forward apply our cross-sectional analyses to an independent sample to determine its prognostic value."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI", "text": "Data used for this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.ucla.edu).

Scans that were acquired within 6 months of the PIB-PET scans were used for analysis. Total WMH volume was derived for each subject with in-house-developed software that used multimodal fuzzy logic classification for voxel labeling. 33 Briefly, the implementation of our approach was similar to work by Admiraal-Behloul and colleagues 34 but was modified to quantify WMHs without fluid-attenuated inversion recovery T2-weighted images (as is the case for ADNI 1). Ours was a 2-stage automatic segmentation method comprising an adaptive stage and a reasoning stage. White matter hyperintensities appeared as increased signals on T2-weighted and PD images. On T1-weighted images, the intensity values for these voxels fell within the intensity distribution of gray matter tissue, despite their propensity for appearing within the white matter.\nDuring the adaptive stage, first T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and PD images were brain extracted and bias field corrected with the Functional MRI of the Brain Software Library. 35 The T1-weighted image was registered using a 6 degree of freedom transformation into the T2-weighted/PD image space. A WMH template-derived with an intensity thresholding and seed growing algorithm applied to fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images from a community-based study of more than 750 older adults 24, 36 -and Montreal Neurological Institute gray matter templates were registered into the T2-weighted/PD space. T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and PD images were segmented into their linguistic variables (dark, medium, or bright) using a hidden Markov Random Field Model. 37 A fuzzy inference system 38, 39 was used for the reasoning stage. The system evaluated each voxel and labeled it as WMH or non-WMH, depending on the combination of linguistic variables. Finally, thresholding, erosion/dilation, and small cluster removal were applied to remove artifacts. The total WMH vol- ume was the sum of all labeled voxels multiplied by the voxel dimensions. Figure 2 displays an example of WMH segmentation from an ADNI participant. We have previously shown this labeling system to be valid and reliable. 33 Patients diagnosed as having AD had significantly greater WMH volumes than subjects with MCI or control subjects (Table) ."}, {"section_title": "STATISTICAL ANALYSIS", "text": "Total WMH, PIB positivity (0 = PIB negative, 1 = PIB positive), age, and sex were entered into a logistic regression analysis with AD diagnosis (0 = normal, 1 = AD) as the dependent variable.

Next, the analyses were restricted only to individuals who were PIB positive, and a logistic regression analysis was used to determine whether total WMH discriminated between those who met clinical criteria for AD and those who did not; this analysis also allowed us to determine the WMH volumetric cutoff that best separated the 2 groups with the highest specificity and sensitivity.\nThis WMH volume cutoff score was forward applied to the subjects with MCI to derive 4 PIB/WMH groups: PIB negative/ low WMH, PIB negative/high WMH, PIB positive/low WMH, and PIB positive/high WMH. Participants in the ADNI were reevaluated every 6 months. We examined differences in the proportion of subjects with MCI who converted to AD during the follow-up period with 2 analysis.

Among individuals with amyloidosis, WMH volume discriminated between those with clinical AD and normal control subjects with excellent sensitivity and good specificity. We found that both PIB and WMH status were significant predictors of individuals with MCI who will convert to AD in the future. The findings suggest a role of small-vessel cerebrovascular disease in the clinical presentation of AD and point to the importance of incorporating WMH into the formulation of pathogenic models of the disease.\nCurrent models of AD pathogenesis highlight \u2424-amyloid deposition as a precipitating pathologic feature of the disease. 1 Consideration of findings from both in vivo \u2424-amyloid and autopsy studies has produced the consistent observation that not all older adults with evidence of amyloidosis manifest the clinical syndrome associated with the disease. 9, 10, 12, 13 These observations suggest that amyloidosis is necessary but not sufficient to cause dementia due to AD. Our findings suggest that WMHs contribute to AD presentation in addition to \u2424-amyloid and that WMHs may be a factor that provides a second hit necessary for dementia in the context of amyloidosis. Many of the risk factors for the development of WMH in late life have been identified and tend to be vascular in nature (eg, see related studies [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] ). Thus, these findings add to a growing literature that suggests that treatment or prevention of peripheral vascular risk factors could help delay or prevent AD and/or mitigate the impact of AD pathology on its clinical expression.\nWhite matter hyperintensities have been implicated in cognitive aging for some time. 46 In the context of AD, the severity of WMHs has been shown to be related to the risk for incidence and course of disease progression. 24, 26 However, despite consistent observations of their involvement with AD, WMHs are typically thought to reflect rarefaction of white matter secondary to smallvessel occlusive disease, 47 which is thought to be a pathogenic pathway distinct from AD. The association between WMHs and AD has most consistently been reported among community-based studies, 24 which often do not exclude individuals with a notable vascular history. Criteria for inclusion in the ADNI study are conservative, and participants with any significant medical morbidity are excluded. Despite the rarefied sample, WMHs still emerged as a significant factor in the presentation of the disease, adding even more clinical significance to our observations. The association between WMHs and clinical AD among individuals without a significant medical history also suggests that WMHs may reflect pathologic changes that are not restricted to small-vessel cerebrovascular disease. For example, WMHs may to some degree point to underlying inflammatory changes or vascular forms of \u2424-amyloid itself. 48 This latter possibility would suggest a mechanistic link between WMHs and primary AD pathology, but careful clinicopathologic correlates studies are needed.\nOther authors have reported significant associations between WMH severity and amyloid burden measured in cerebrospinal fluid. 49 Here, we did not see a reliable difference between PIB-positive and PIB-negative individuals in overall WMH burden, which may be explained partially by the small sample size. Indeed, when we examined the association between cortical PIB uptake values and WMH volume in all participants, there was a reliable negative relationship between them. Despite the modest relationship between the two, both fac- tors (ie, WMH burden and PIB positivity) were important in the prediction of AD diagnosis. It will be important to determine to what degree the two are truly independent pathologic processes. In the analyses that incorporated longitudinal data, it is clear that PIB status is a primary discriminator between those who ultimately convert to AD ( Figure 4) ; however, it is noteworthy that even among PIB-negative participants with MCI, having a high burden of WMHs was associated with an increased risk for AD at follow-up. Future longitudinal analyses with larger samples will be necessary to examine the progression of amyloid deposition and WMHs, as well as their interaction as they relate to future incidence of AD.\nThe ADNI study was designed to comprise subjects with characteristics that would parallel those in clinical trials. Therefore, it is not necessarily reflective of the overall population. Participants in the ADNI are very carefully and systematically evaluated and excluded if they have significant vascular disease histories, increasing confidence in observation about the involvement of WMHs in AD. Amyloid imaging studies, particularly those that consider other cerebral structural and functional factors, are very limited; to our knowledge, this study is the first examination of the independent associations of \u2424-amyloid and WMHs with AD. Thus, these observations are preliminary and replication in larger samples would be necessary for verification. Future work is needed to determine the pathologic underpinnings of WMHs. Regardless of mechanistic associations between WMHs and AD pathology, it is becoming clear from studies such as this one and others that vascular factors are quite important in the pathogenesis of the AD phenotype, which suggests clinical strategies for disease prevention and treatment."}]
