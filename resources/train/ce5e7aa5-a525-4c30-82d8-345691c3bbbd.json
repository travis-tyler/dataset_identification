[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Marginal systems offshore continents have for a long period of time been documented as depositional systems with limited attention to the unconformities observed on the continental shelf and their erosion-related processes [Blackwelder, 1909;Cotton, 1918;Hay, 2015;Miall, Confidential manuscript submitted to Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems (G-Cubed) -2017GC007036 R1 3 2016; Vail et al., 1980]. Another important aspect is the dynamics of erosion of fine grained sediments that has not yet been fully understood [e.g., McCave, 1984]. The context of strong erosion from on-to offshore has been rarely studied and quantified. As an example, the offshore domain of the rising orogenic island of Taiwan has been well documented, although constraints on submarine erosion and its forcing mechanisms have not been clearly understood [Ramsey et al., 2006]. Along the Pacific margin of North and South America, coastal erosion has been mainly investigated at rocky shores where paleo-shorelines emerge or drowned, as a result of various uplift events [e.g., Shepard and Grant, 1947;Clift and Hartley, 2007;Saillard, et al., 2009;Jara-Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2017]. Various cyclic stresses affect the margin in these places. The two most important are: waves sourced by the strong westerly winds in the Southern Ocean [Beccario, earth.nullschool.net;L\u00f3pez, et al., 2015] and along-margin oceanic currents such as the Peru-Chile (Humboldt) Currents [Chaigneau et al., 2013] (Figure 1). Sediment archives at the seafloor from 3 to 18\u00b0S are characteristic of current-dominated regimes [Reinhardt, et al., 2002] with ongoing phosphorite formation, tide-topography interaction and resultant non-linear internal waves [Erdem et al., 2016]. Mooring experiments documented current speeds of up to 20 cm/s in the upper 200 m of the continental shelf of Peru from 5\u00b0S to 15\u00b030'S [Brockmann, et al., 1980]. Continental shelves offshore South America are an important region for the study of resources and the interactions of atmospheric and oceanographic processes in solid Earth sciences. Peruvian forearc basins (Figure 1) [Dickinson, 1995;Noda, 2016] have been imaged using sub-bottom profilers and multibeam echosounders [Reinhardt, et al., 2002] during research cruises and sampled by dredges, shallow piston cores, the Ocean Drilling Program [e.g., , and by oil and gas exploration wells. Most of the academic geoscientific work on Peruvian forearc basins has been performed offshore in the deep water domain (>200m water depth). This has allowed understanding of the distal part of the margin and its relationship with the subducting plate, in the area of the trench to the upper slope. Structure and infill have been studied using 2D seismic reflection surveys [e.g., Thornburg and Kulm, 1981;Kulm et al., 1982;Moore and Taylor, 1988]. The structural framework of the margin and forearc basins worldwide has been divided into two types, with one related to subduction accretion and the second to basal tectonic erosion [e.g., Clift et al., 2003;Clift and Vannucchi, 2004] (Figure 2). Many subsurface discontinuities have been studied in order to document subsidence and basal erosion of accretionary margins [e.g., Scholl et al., 1980;von Huene and Lallemand, 1990]. The oldest basal unconformity identified in forearc basins is related to the interface between the structurally active or passive basement of the overriding plate within the context of the subduction zone ( Figure 2). The subsequent unconformities within the forearc stratigraphy then depend on the vertical movements and the source of sediments (volcaniclastic, siliciclastics, and in-situ produced carbonates) and record erosional events and hiatuses depending on the rates of sedimentation. Unconformities at the seafloor are one of the least recognized and documented surfaces in the evolution of forearc basins. Seismic technology has advanced in the third dimension [Cartwright and Huuse, 2005], thus allowing sedimentary basins to be assessed with an unprecedented level of detail. Threedimensional seismic data can be used to study sub-seafloor geology in detail, such as that observed by high-resolution bathymetry [Bulat, 2005;Grant and Schreiber, 1990]. Seafloor features offer a window to the deeper subsurface of a given sedimentary basin and so resolve Earth surface processes identified from preserved features [Bourgeois et al., 1988;Sosson et al., 1994;Collier et al., 2006;Gupta et al., 2007;Huuse, 2011;Mitchell et al., 2013]. The seafloor Confidential manuscript submitted to Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems (G-Cubed) -2017GC007036 R1 5 bathymetry, combined with deep penetration seismic reflection surveys, is commonly used to document the mechanical and tectonic behavior of accretionary margins [e.g., Beaudry and Moore, 1981;Gulick, et al., 2010;McNeill and Henstock;Frederik, et al., 2015], but is rarely used to constrain external forces acting on the top of the margin slope. The Peru offshore domain represents an area of 900,000 km\u00b2 of which 82,000 km\u00b2 are associated with the continental shelf. The offshore domain, its water column conditions and seafloor habitat of a major interest to those concerned with fish populations in the Peruvian upwelling ecosystem [Gallardo 1977;Arntz et al., 1991]. The importance of bathymetric information has been shown along the Peru margin not only for Earth sciences, but also for life sciences. Limited knowledge on shallow bathymetric environments south of 10\u00b0S, i.e. the morphology of the continental shelf, is key to models of water column biological processes and prevents an understanding of how sediments (Fe) contribute to the development of phytoplankton [Echevin et al., 2008]. The only seafloor erosion documented on 2D seismic reflection grid offshore Peru and potentially related to bottom currents has been done by Ballestros et al. (1998) for water depth greater than 2000 m in the Yaquina and Lima sedimentary basins [Clift et al., 2003]. Our aim is to document the present-day seafloor bathymetry, acoustic properties and geology in the near subsurface using 3D seismic reflection data from four sedimentary basins off the coast of Peru. From North to South these basins are named: Tumbes, Talara, Salaverry, and Pisco (Figures 1 and 2). Our specific interest is in the identification of constructive and destructive surfaces that record the seafloor of these forearc basins. Confidential manuscript submitted to Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems (G-Cubed) -2017GC007036 R1 6 2 Data and methods Our seismic data set covers most of these forearc basins, covering a bathymetric range of 20 to 2040 m, in the offshore Peru area (Figures 1 and 3). The data used for the current study are 3D multi-channel, post-stack, time-migrated reflection seismic data. They were acquired within exploration areas offshore Peru and are named based on these hydrocarbon exploration license numerations. The seismic data displayed in this study are zero phase and have the Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) normal polarity, i.e. black peak indicating an increase in acoustic impedance. We use seismic attributes to enhance sedimentary to structural features that occur from the seafloor to the subsurface. The seismic attributes are extracted from the two-way time horizon mapped within the 3D seismic reflection data. We use a constant velocity (1500 m/s) for depth conversion of the seafloor from time to depth domain. The details of each seismic data set and seafloor surfaces are summarized in Table 1. The 3D seismic data in this study have been interpreted using standard seismic stratigraphic techniques [Mitchum et al., 1977; and seismic geomorphology principles [Posamentier et al., 2007] based on reflection terminations and seismic facies reflection characteristics. The seafloor reflection can show concordance (no termination) or truncation (erosional or structural). The seafloor reflection and surrounding reflections are interpreted as a sequence boundary [Mitchum et al., 1977]. The vertical resolution of the shallow section of the six seismic cubes range is 8 to 12 m. With this vertical resolution, the near-seafloor 3D seismic provides stratigraphical and geomorphological insights into the architecture that would normally be sub-seismic scale in the deeper subsurface [Steffens et al., 2004]. Oceanographic data (temperature, salinity, wave observations) are sourced from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) world ocean database (WOD13, Station 7538849(C)) [Boyer et al., 2013] and the NOAA National Data Buoy Center (Station 32012 -7 Woods Hole Stratus Wave Station, data from 2007 to 2015) (http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov). We have converted the wave frequency to wavelength using the deep-water gravity equation [Lamb, 1994]: \u03bb= g/(2\u03c0f\u00b2), where g is gravitational acceleration and f is the wave frequency measured in Hz. The depth of penetration of wave action (i.e. capacity to entrain sediment at the mudline interface) is defined as one half of its wavelength [Reading and Collinson, 1996]."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Seafloor bathymetry and morphology", "text": "Observed features at the seafloor from 3\u00b045'S to 12\u00b030'S span two main morphological domains: the shelf and the upper slope ( Figures 1 and 3, Table 1). In the Tumbes Basin (Z1 and Z38; Figures 3a and 3b), the seafloor dips from NE to SW over a depth range from about 20 m to 1380 m within the area surveyed by 3D seismic data. The mean slope is gentle and ranges from 2.6 to 3.6\u00b0. Local increases in slope are related to structural features (see below). Along the margin the Talara Basin ( Figures 1, 3c and 3d) is covered by two 3D seismic surveys. The seafloor dips from E to W, with a depth range from ~190 m to 2040 m, within the area surveyed by 3D seismic data. The mean slope is moderate and ranges from ~6 to 10\u00b0. In the northern area (Z34A; Figure 3c) the upper slope shows a steep margin deepening to a smooth flat seafloor surface. In the southern area (Z34E; Figure 3d) the shelf extends as a low angle surface that marks the shallower part of the upper slope that evolves to an incised deep and steep topographic depression that runs along an east to west axis. These two depressions are related to two deep water canyons named La Bocana and Paita (Figure 3d). These two canyons have not yet been surveyed. They are named from the nearest towns along the coast and are located north of the Chiclayo Canyon (7\u00b0S) described by Sosson et al. [1994]. Further south in the Salaverry Basin (Z35; Figure 3e), the seafloor dips from ENE to WSW over a depth range from ~110 m to ~200 Confidential manuscript submitted to Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems (G-Cubed) -2017GC007036 R1 8 m within the area surveyed by 3D seismic data. The mean slope is low, with a value of 1.75\u00b0. The last surveyed area is within the Pisco Basin (Z33; Figure 3f). The seafloor dips from NE to SW with a depth range from ~100 m to ~320 m within the area surveyed by 3D seismic data. The mean slope is low with a value of 1\u00b0. Features observed at the seafloor are summarized in Table 2. We first describe unconformities at the seafloor of each sedimentary basin/data set from North to South along the Peruvian offshore domain, after which we document other preserved features."}, {"section_title": "Seafloor unconformities", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Tumbes Basin seafloor unconformities", "text": "Observed seafloor unconformities in the Tumbes Basin seismic reflection data ( Figure 4a) are related to five different configurations. The first configuration is associated with toplap termination with a high angle dipping into subsurface sequences structured by faults ( Figure 4b). This is well marked by seismic amplitude changes and abrupt changes over the discontinuity towards the north of the study area. These structures occur in the shallower domains of the study area. The unconformities cover extensive areas from 10 km\u00b2 to over 100 km\u00b2 ( Figure 4c). The second configuration is related to lower angle toplap terminations that are prolonged by continuous reflections that extend seaward ( Figure 4d). The third is also associated with lowangle toplap terminations that in this area are prolonged over short distances and closed loop by other toplap terminations and an undulating high amplitude erosional truncation (Figure 4d). These mark mounded structures over areas of 30 to >40 km\u00b2 located in the SW of the study area ( Figure 4c). The mounded structures have a long axis orientated NNE-SSW, with a length >2 km, an amplitude of 20 m and a wavelength of 0.4-1.0 km. These structures are restricted to water depths >200 m. We interpret them as contourite drifts. These features are observed in area  (Figures 7c and 7d).

The complete surface is associated with toplap terminations of various angles that mark the subsurface geology. The overall basin is truncated at the seafloor and highlights the sedimentary basin infill. Faults are expressed at the seafloor in the western part of the survey (Figure 8b). The eastern seismic reflections and sequences are tilted with an overall synclinal structure (Figures 8c and 8d). Truncated seismic structures outcropping at the seafloor are related to canyons infills or prograding clinoform sets (Figures 8b and 8d).

This is the highest surficial erosion observed along the entire Peru Margin."}, {"section_title": "Pisco Basin seafloor unconformities", "text": "The observed unconformity at the seafloor seismic reflection in the Pisco Basin (Z33; Figure 9a) is related to one configuration of sedimentary structures. The seafloor reflection surface has various amplitude values ( Figure 9b) and associated with concordant, toplap termination reflections with low angle and erosional truncation (Figure 9c). The erosional truncation cuts a progradational sequence (Figures 9b and d) that is incised by linear to convergent seaward channels. This unconformity occurs over a bathymetric range of 125-160 m. The surficial unconformity covers 29% of the surveyed area by 3D seismic (Table 2).

Localized small-scale seafloor depressions in the Tumbes and Talara Basins are pockmarks (Figures 5 and 6), related to fluid escape through underlying vertical gas chimneys. These are spatially located above reversed-polarity reflections (relative to the seafloor) known as bottom-simulating reflections (BSRs) that are commonly associated with free gas trapped beneath a layer of methane hydrate-bearing sediment. They are related to the occurrence of a velocity and impedance contrast related to the hydrate-bearing layers."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Morphological features of unconformities", "text": "With observations of seafloor unconformities from different latitudes and depths along the Peruvian forearc basins, we identify potential processes related to these features. A synthetic diagram illustrates the occurrence of unconformities (Figure 10). Unconformities are observed in the two investigated domains, the shelf and upper slope. In the northern part of the Peruvian margin, these two domains express various types of erosive surfaces. As far south as 5\u00b0S in the Talara Basin (Figure 1) unconformities occur at two different levels/water depths along the upper slope: one shallow (~200-300m) and one deeper (~900-1100 m) ( Figure 10). South of 5\u00b0S the unconformities are observed at the shelf/upper slope transition as well as deeper water ~300 m. Krissek et al. [1980] and Reiners and Suess [1983] Figure 10), as well depicted in the Salaverry Basin (8\u00b0S) where the seafloor is recognized as being a continuous unconformity (Figure 8)."}, {"section_title": "Seafloor and physical oceanography interaction", "text": "The primary surficial water mass movements within the study area are the action of oceanic waves sourced from far field activity in the Southern Ocean as well as waves generated by local southerly winds in the Eastern Pacific Ocean bordered by the Andes (Figure 1). The wave action is expressed by a wave base depth of penetration with two modes, the first peak at 55 m and the second at ~150 m water depth ( Figure 10 The secondary water mass movements are associated with the Humboldt-Peru-Chile Currents (Figure 1) [e.g., Chaigneau et al., 2013;Czeschel et al., 2015]. These currents have the strength to displace and remove significant amounts of sediment and generate unconformities at the seafloor (Figure 10). In some places, deep water currents might induce a strong shearing momentum at the seafloor where they interfere. Such configuration is observed along the Peru margin when the Peru-Chile Undercurrent (PCUC) and Chile-Peru Deep Coastal Current (CPDCC) occur together (Figure 1). The prime example in this study is in the Salaverry area ( Figure 11) where we have observed the most complete unconformity. Where only deep currents erode the seafloor, the magnitude of the unconformity decreases such as that seen in the Pisco Basin. This place has a counter part with an important coastal upwelling and high production rate of sediments [Krissek et al., 1980] that might balance the unconformity expression. In the northern part of the Peruvian margin in the Tumbes and Talara Basins, we identify important erosion surfaces that are expressed in the water depth range of the surfaces currents, such as the Ecuador-Peru Coastal Current (EPCC), and the associated subsurface currents, e.g., the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) (Figures 10 and 11) [Chaigneau et al., 2013]. The complex seafloor geometry of bathymetric highs in the Tumbes Basin might cause the strength of the currents to increase and accelerate at these localities, focusing the erosion ( Figure 5). The presence of moats and contourite drifts in bathymetric domains over 600 m water depth ( Figures   5, 6 and 7) is diagnostic of a potential strong active bottom current associated with the Northward-spreading Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and the Pacific Central Water (PCW) [Tsuchiya and Talley, 1998]. In the Tumbes Basin, Banco Peru (Figure 1) is an isolated structural high that has a flat top platform in water depths of ~100 m ( Figure 5) and is subject to wave action that can be as deep as 300 m offshore Peru (Figure 10). Further east, towards the shore, these same waves can surge and stress the seafloor; this is highlighted by the strong erosional unconformity surface that is observed from 200 m up to 26 m, at the shallowest limit of the surveyed area (Figure 4). The complex interaction between wave action and oceanic currents plays an important role in the near-coastal circulation and upwelling system of Peru [e.g., Pietri et al., 2014]. These unconformities might not be related to a single period of stress but instead are a combination spanning long periods of time, as suggested by sedimentary archives offshore Peru preserved in a bathymetric range of 90 to 1300 m and latitudes from 3 to 18\u00b0S [Erdem et al., 2016]. Along the Chilean margin at 40\u00b0S strong shelf currents sweep all fine-grained material [Hebbeln et al., 2001]. Sediments are channelized directly into the deep sea trench through the numerous canyons [Moberly et al., 1982;Hagen et al., 1994]. Further south in Chile the same observations and processes are shaping the seafloor of the offshore prism [Bernhardt et al., 2015 and. We have direct evidence of this on the slope of Talara Basin, with lobes at the mouth of deep-water canyons ( Figure 6). Deep-water sedimentation in this area is associated with contourite drifts (this study) and suggests possible contributions from oceanic currents as conveyors of particles to the deep-water sediments along the margin [Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2004]. An important goal remains to identify the action and erosive power of deep water currents downslope in the least studied water depth range of the upper slope. This is not investigated or quantified by physical oceanography studies along the upper slope of the Peru margin >1000 m."}, {"section_title": "Seafloor basin dynamics: depositional dynamics", "text": "The identification of unconformities at the edge of significant packages of sediment, such as canyons and/or contourite drifts in the upper slope of the Peru margin show the importance of lateral sedimentation along such margins outside the continental shelf ( Figures 5, 6, 7). The continental shelf has been the focus of numerous studies over the past decades in relation with upwelling [Suess, 1980;Shipboard Scientific Party, 1988] and accretionary/forearc basin genesis [e.g., Thornburg and Kulm, 1981;Ballesteros et al., 1988;Clift et al., 2003]. Careful estimates of deposition and erosion in such sedimentary basins could have an important role in calibrating sediment budgets and flux [Clift and Vannucchi, 2004;Stern, 2011], and/or syntectonic sedimentation history [Simpson, 2010;Vannucchi, et al., 2016] in a subducting geodynamic framework. Regional estimates of recent sedimentation rates underline these limitations in such settings [Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2004]. In the Lima and Pisco Basins (Figure 1), Ocean Drilling Program Sites 679, 680, 681, 686 and 687 documented important discontinuities at the seafloor or in the subsurface, with numerous hiatuses spanning the last 11 m.y. [e.g., Shipboard Scientific Party, 1988;Ballesteros et al., 1988]. Buried unconformities in accretionary prisms are used to infer the evolution of the subduction factory. The occurrence of regional unconformities must be evaluated not only in the context of downslope mass movement or tectonic displacement. The role of external processes such as climate processes (trade winds, wave action and strength) and/or oceanic movements might play an important role in shaping these margins [Koenitz et al., 2008]."}, {"section_title": "Seafloor unconformities and fluid flow indicators,", "text": "Despite the identification of strong unconformity surfaces, the presence of fluid flow features at the seafloor marks the signature of the fluids migrating updip within the forearc structure.

Within the studied area we have identified sediment remobilization features, such as pockmarks [van Rensbergen et al., 2003]. These are spatially related to vertical discontinuities that are at the apex of faults of various types and in some areas with the occurrence of potential gas hydrates as marked by bottom-simulating reflectors (BSR) ( Figures 5 and 6) [Auguy et al., 2017].

Further south, mud lenses located under the stress of the Peru-Chile Undercurrent (PCUC) [Salvatteci et al., 2014] show that laminae preservation at the regional scale is related to oxygen minimum zone intensity changes as well as variations in the strength of bottom currents. Erosion and winnowing of sediments by bottom currents could lead to uncertainties when computing absolute sedimentation rate [Krissek et al., 1980] and thus to budgets of biomass production and paleo-productivity estimates. Flushed sediments from onshore rivers caused by extreme runoff associated with strong El Ni\u00f1o events are dispersed over hundreds of kilometers along the shelf by the Peru Current and countercurrent [Scheidegger and Krissek, 1982;Rein et al., 2005].
