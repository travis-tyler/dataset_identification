[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a potent monoamine-releaser that is widely used as a recreational drug. Preliminary work has supported the potential of MDMA in psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The neurobiological mechanisms underlying its putative efficacy are, however, poorly understood. Psychotherapy for PTSD usually requires that patients revisit traumatic memories, and it has been argued that this is easier to do under MDMA. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the effect of MDMA on recollection of favourite and worst autobiographical memories (AMs). Nineteen participants (five females) with previous experience with MDMA performed a blocked AM recollection (AMR) paradigm after ingestion of 100 mg of MDMA-HCl or ascorbic acid (placebo) in a double-blind, repeatedmeasures design. Memory cues describing participants' AMs were read by them in the scanner. Favourite memories were rated as significantly more vivid, emotionally intense and positive after MDMA than placebo and worst memories were rated as less negative. Functional MRI data from 17 participants showed robust activations to AMs in regions known to be involved in AMR. There was also a significant effect of memory valence: hippocampal regions showed preferential activations to favourite memories and executive regions to worst memories. MDMA augmented activations to favourite memories in the bilateral fusiform gyrus and somatosensory cortex and attenuated activations to worst memories in the left anterior temporal cortex. These findings are consistent with a positive emotional-bias likely mediated by MDMA's pro-monoaminergic pharmacology."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Introduction 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a hybrid stimulant/psychedelic drug with unique subjective and pharmacological properties. MDMA stimulates serotonin (5-HT), dopamine and noradrenaline release in the synapse but its marked pro-serotonergic effects distinguish it from other amphetamines (Rothman et al., 2001 ) and define its unique psychological profile. MDMA has been described as an 'empathogen' and it is known to promote social interaction, positive emotion and openness (Bedi et al., 2010) . Preliminary work indicates that MDMA may be effective for assisting psychotherapy for refractory post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Mithoefer et al., 2011 (Mithoefer et al., , 2013 . In this context, it is hypothesised to reduce the fear-response, allowing patients to revisit traumatic memories in a supportive setting, without feeling overwhelmed (Greer and Tolbert, 1998; Mithoefer et al., 2011) . The neurobiological mechanisms underlying these putative effects are, however, poorly understood. There have been a limited number of small-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on the acute effects of MDMA (Bedi et al., 2009; Ramaekers et al., 2009; Kuypers et al., 2011) and only one that has overt implications for its therapeutic use: reduced amygdala responses to angry faces was observed under MDMA (Bedi et al., 2009) , broadly consistent with reduced fear. The positive mood effects of MDMA appear to be mediated by stimulation of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT 2A R) -likely via increased synaptic 5-HT (Liechti et al., 2000; van Wel et al., 2012) . However, other receptors are also involved (Liechti and Vollenweider, 2001) .\nPrevious fMRI studies of autobiographical memory recollection (AMR) have identified a core autobiographical memory (AM) system incorporating the retrosplenial cortex (RSP), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), medial temporal lobes (MTLs), temporoparietal junction and the lateral temporal cortex (Svoboda et al., 2006) . Some of these have found increased responses in the AM system during recollection of positive relative to negative personal memories (Piefke et al., 2003; St Jacques et al., 2011) , whereas recollecting negative memories engages executive regions, such as the dorsal and lateral PFC . There is a rich literature on neuronal responses to trauma-related memory scripts in patients with PTSD. The most consistent finding is increased amygdala and reduced mPFC responses in patients relative to controls (Lanius et al., 2011) ; however, increased mPFC responses have also been observed in patients with dissociative symptoms (Lanius et al., 2012) .\nWe previously investigated the effects of the proserotonergic hallucinogen, psilocybin, on autobiographical memory recollection, and found increased activations in high-level visual regions under the drug (CarhartHarris et al., 2012) . This study used only positive memory cues however, and no studies have simultaneously investigated the effects of a psychoactive drug on recollection of both emotionally positive and negative personal memories. This knowledge gap is important to bridge, as psychotherapy often involves recall of both positive and negative personal experiences (Brewin, 2006; Rauch et al., 2012) . Previous research found a reduced sensitivity to threat-related stimuli (Bedi et al., 2010; Hysek et al., 2012) and an increased sensitivity to positive stimuli under MDMA (Hysek et al., 2012) , broadly consistent with increased serotoninergic functioning (Harmer, 2008; Murphy et al., 2009; Tranter et al., 2009) . Reduced sensitivity to threat-related stimuli may be useful in exposure therapy -an effective treatment for PTSD that requires patients re-engage with traumatic memories in order to overcome them (Rauch et al., 2012) . The key rationale for using MDMA in conjunction with exposure therapy is that it allows the patient to more easily engage with traumatic material (Mithoefer et al., 2013) .\nThe present study employed an fMRI protocol in which healthy participants were presented with personalised autobiographical memory cues designed to evoke their favourite and worst personal memories. Participants viewed a different set of memories after oral administration of placebo (100 mg ascorbic acid) and MDMA-hydrochloride (HCl) (100 mg) and associated hemodynamic responses were estimated using blood oxygenation level dependent imaging (BOLD) imaging and general linear modelling. We predicted that MDMA would reduce BOLD and subjective responses to negative memories and augment responses to positive memories, consistent with a positive emotional bias mediated by increased serotonergic functioning (Hysek et al., 2012) ."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Design", "text": "Participants were enrolled in a within-subjects, doubleblind, randomised, placebo-controlled study and scanned twice, 7 d apart, once after MDMA and once after placebo.

One additional subject did not complete the memory task because of a technical issue with the presentation software. None of the participants had used MDMA for at least 7 d and other drugs for at least 48 h, and this was confirmed by a urine screen.

They were asked to compile two lists of six memories: one containing six of their very best memories (favourite memories) and another containing six of their very worst. They were instructed that the cues should refer to specific life events rather than prolonged periods of time in their lives. They were advised that the cues should be brief (i.e. no longer than one short sentence) and abridged such that they cannot be understood by others (e.g. 'remember X in TPG'). This proved an effective strategy as it ensured participants chose memories without fear of social judgement, thus avoiding that potential confound. However, not all subjects felt the need to encrypt their cues in this way. Examples of other cues included: 'remember the waterfall' (favourite) and 'remember being told my friend was dead' (worst). Participants were asked to rank each memory in terms of its 'potency', i.e. its capacity to evoke a strong emotional response. The 12 memories were split into two lists of six, each containing three favourite and three worst memories. This was done so that a fresh set of memories were viewed under placebo and MDMA, thus avoiding habituation effects. The two lists were balanced for potency across conditions, using the pre-scanning rankings of potency. Specifically, ranks 1, 4 and 6 were used in one scan and 2, 3 and 5 in the other, and the order of this split was counterbalanced so that 50% of the sample had ranks 1, 4 and 6 in scan 1 and 50% had these in scan 2."}, {"section_title": "Drug and dosing parameters", "text": "Participants began the autobiographical memory task 80-85 min after oral administration of 100 mg encapsulated MDMA-HCl and on a separate occasion, placebo (100 mg encapsulated ascorbic acid/vitamin-C).

The order of MDMA and placebo administration was counterbalanced so that an equal number of participants received placebo first as MDMA. The 100 mg dose compares well with previous acute administration studies. MDMA is well tolerated at doses between 75-100 mg (de la Torre et al., 2004; Bedi et al., 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Functional imaging paradigm", "text": "Eighteen memory cues were presented in a blocked design (three favourite memories and three worst memories, three repetitions of each) interleaved with an auditory attention task and a task-free 'rest' period (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012).

In brief, participants were visually presented with an autobiographical memory cue for 5 s (e.g. 'remember being told my friend was dead') followed by the visual instruction: 'close your eyes' which was presented for 13 s, after which there was a pre-recorded auditory instruction: 'open your eyes'. Participants were then visually presented with the instruction: 'count the tones' for 5 s, followed by the visual instruction: 'close your eyes'. For 13 s, the participants heard 13 auditory tones (1 per second) of one of two pitches, either high or low, after which they heard: 'open your eyes' and were visually presented with the question: 'were there more high or low tones?' Participants gave a response via button press using their index ('more low') or middle ('more high') finger. They were then visually presented with the instruction: 'relax' which appeared for 5 s, followed by: 'close your eyes'. After a rest period of 13 s, participants heard the auditory instruction: 'open your eyes'. The sequence outlined above was repeated 18 times in total.

After correcting for multiple comparisons (Bonferoni), there were no significant correlations between BOLD response in the clusters that showed an augmented response to favourite memories under MDMA and ratings of memory vividness, emotional intensity or positive emotion. However, there was a trend positive correlation between responses in the left middle temporal gyrus and ratings of recollection vividness (p = 0.02, R 2 = 0.24)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study sought to investigate the effect of MDMA on recollecting emotionally potent personal memories in order to inform how the drug may be useful in psychotherapy (Mithoefer et al., 2011 (Mithoefer et al., , 2013 . The primary hypotheses of the study concerned the effect of MDMA on recollecting memories of different emotional valence (i.e. Figs. 1 and 4) . Participants reported experiencing their favourite memories as more vivid, emotionally intense and positive after MDMA than placebo -reflecting a marked intensification of emotionally positive memories (Fig. 1) . For example, one participant reported: 'With the drug, positive memories seemed much more intense and real.' And another: 'On the drug, good memories were more intense and especially made me feel positive emotions'. There was also a significant increase in activations to favourite memories in the ventral visual and somatosensory cortices after MDMA (Fig. 4a) .\nPrevious work has found a relationship between hippocampal responses during AMR and the strength of emotion felt upon recollection (Svoboda et al., 2006; Carhart-Harris et al., 2012) as well as visual cortex responses during AMR and recollection vividness (Daselaar et al., 2008; Carhart-Harris et al., 2012) and preferential responses to positive memories were observed in bilateral hippocampal clusters in the present study. Increased hippocampal responses to positive AMs under MDMA were not observed in the present study; however, there were significantly increased responses in the bilateral fusiform gyri under the drug (Fig. 4a) . The fusiform gyrus is known to be involved in processing high-level visual stimuli such as faces (Weiner and GrillSpector, 2012) . Thus, increased fusiform gyri activations under MDMA may relate to the reports of increased recollection vividness under the drug -particularly since many of the favourite memories contained references to people. Similarly, several of the positive memory cues referred to sensual experiences and these may have been felt with enhanced vividness under MDMA given the increased somatosensory cortical activations. Further work is required to test the reliability of these inferences.\nPerhaps more relevant to the potential application of MDMA in psychotherapy for PTSD, participants reported experiencing their worst memories as significantly less negative under MDMA (Fig. 1) . Together with the subjective intensification of favourite memories, this attenuation of negative affect during the recollection of worst memories reflects a positively-biased shift in emotional processing that is broadly consistent with increased serotonergic functioning (Harmer, 2008) and previous MDMA studies (Bedi et al., 2009 (Bedi et al., , 2010 Hysek et al., 2012) . For example, one participant reported: 'The bad memories were less salient [under MDMA] and I thought about them in a matter of fact way.' And another: 'When I reached back for the bad memories [under MDMA] they did not seem as bad; In fact, I saw them as fatalistic necessities for the occurrence of later good events. ' Significantly reduced activations to worst memories were observed in the left anterior temporal cortex or temporal pole (Fig. 4b) . Moreover, when the BOLD amplitude data for the responses to worst memories were extracted for the MDMA condition, a significant positive correlation was found between lATL activations and ratings of negative emotion (Fig. 5) . Indeed, 65% of the variance in negative affect ratings was explained by the lATL responses, supporting the inference that this specific region is involved in negative memory-evoked negative emotion. The temporal pole has been implicated in processing negative emotions before (Musser et al., 2012; Lenzi et al., 2013; Meyer et al., 2013) ; thus, the present result is consistent with this. With the caveat that this study involved healthy participants and not patients, and that ratings of negative emotion were relatively low, even under placebo (i.e. few subjects reported experiencing extreme negative emotion), we can speculate that MDMA may be useful in psychotherapy for PTSD because it lessens the emotional impact of painful memories -perhaps by attenuating left anterior temporal cortical responses to them. The vividness and emotional intensity of negative memory recall was not significantly affected by MDMA, but the experience of negative affect was (Fig. 1b) . This is broadly consistent with the hypothesis that MDMA enables patients with PTSD to revisit painful memories, but not in a manner that is dominated by negative affect (Mithoefer et al., 2013) . Previous work found reduced amygdala responses to angry and fearful faces after MDMA (Bedi et al., 2009) and citalopram (Harmer et al., 2006; Murphy et al., 2009; Anderson et al., 2011; Godlewska et al., 2012) respectively. Thus, reduced responses to negative emotional stimuli are reliably associated with increased serotonergic functioning. The amygdala is closely involved in affective processing (Gallagher and Chiba, 1996) and the temporal pole is proximal to and densely connected with the amygdala (Bach et al., 2011; Bickart et al., 2012) . The relationship observed here between temporal pole activity and emotion may be related to its connectivity with the amygdala. This putative relationship could be interrogated further using psychophysiological interaction functional connectivity analyses (Friston et al., 1997) or dynamic causal modelling (Friston et al., 2003) . For example, it might be predicted that MDMA increases functional connectivity between the anterior temporal cortex and amygdala during autobiographical memory recollection.\nTogether, the present results support the primary hypothesis that MDMA increases subjective and neuronal responses to favourite memories and reduces responses to worst memories. The results imply that MDMA causes a positive emotional bias, consistent with its known promonoaminergic and mood-promoting effects. Speculatively, the results may also be seen as broadly supportive of the application of MDMA in psychotherapy, e.g. by heightening positive affect in the context of cognitive bias modification (Macleod, 2012) or by softening the impact of painful memories (Mithoefer et al., 2011 (Mithoefer et al., , 2013 .\nDrug-assisted psychotherapy is appealing for several reasons. Pharmacological treatments generally work by tempering symptoms (Cowen, 2008 ) but they do not address a patient's personal history, present environment or cognitive style. Medications are typically taken chronically and chronic-use increases the risk of side-effects and places demands on treatment compliance. Psychotherapy does address environmental causes but it is a relatively expensive procedure that places significant responsibilities on patients. The appeal of drug-assisted psychotherapy relates to its potential to shorten treatment and enhance its efficacy (Sessa, 2009; Mithoefer et al., 2011 Mithoefer et al., , 2013 . MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, like classic psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy (Grob et al., 2011) , typically involves a small number of drug-assisted sessions, with potentially lasting beneficial effects (Griffiths et al., 2008; Grob et al., 2011; Mithoefer et al., 2013) . The pharmacological mechanism by which MDMA (potentially) facilitates the psychotherapeutic processes is deserving of special attention, particularly since questions remain over its neurotoxic potential, at least in higher doses (Erritzoe et al., 2011) . If we knew more about the pharmacological pathways through which MDMA elicits its putative therapeutic effects, then other compounds could be investigated that stimulate the same pathways but with an improved toxicology (Nichols et al., 1990) . It is generally assumed that the moodimproving effects of pro-serotonergic compounds, such as 5-HT reuptake inhibitors, depend on increased synaptic 5-HT stimulating postsynaptic 5-HT 1A receptors; however, it may be that the 5-HT 2A R plays an important role as well. For example, the 5-HT 2A R is up-regulated in 5-HT depletion states (Cahir et al., 2007; Urban et al., 2012) ; cortical 5-HT 2A R expression correlates positively with pessimistic thinking (Meyer et al., 2003a) and neuroticism (Frokjaer et al., 2008) ; the 5-HT 2A R agonist psilocybin increase subjective wellbeing (Griffiths et al., 2006) , positive mood (Kometer et al., 2012) and openness (MacLean et al., 2011) ; and the 5-HT 2A R antagonist ketanserin blocks its positive mood effects (Kometer et al., 2012) and the positive mood effects of MDMA (van Wel et al., 2012) . These factors imply that the 5-HT 2A R may be a viable target for new pharmacotherapeutics. The fact that 5-HT 2A R stimulation can also elicit psychotomimetic effects should not necessarily be a deterrent, since other psychotomimetics (e.g. ketamine) are showing an impressive therapeutic potential (Duman and Aghajanian, 2012) . Given the marked positive shift in emotional valence processing seen here with MDMA, it would also be interesting to look at the relationship between MDMA and optimism bias (Sharot et al., 2011) ; specifically with a view to better understanding the pharmacology of this important and common behaviour. For example, given the association between the 5-HT 2A R and pessimism (Meyer et al., 2003b) , 5-HT 2A R-stimulation and positive mood (Kometer et al., 2012; van Wel et al., 2012) and MDMA and positively-biased emotional valence processing (as seen here) one might predict that MDMA would accentuate the optimism bias and that this would be attenuated by antagonism of the 5-HT 2A R.\nFinally, we should also consider the role of dopamine and oxytocin (Beringer et 2011) in MDMA's putative therapeutic action. It would be interesting for example to test MDMA against amphetamine, or a similar dopamine-preferring stimulant, in psychotherapy for PTSD, or to test oxytocin itself. It might also be interesting to test the efficacy of MDMA against a more widely tested psychotherapeutic adjunct such as d-cycloserine (Ressler et al., 2004; Hofmann et al., 2006) . Aside from the effects of MDMA on AMR, the activation maps generated by the AMR paradigm were robust and consistent with those of previous AMR fMRI studies (Svoboda et al., 2006) . Eyes-closed recollection vs. eyes-closed 'rest' is an effective design as it isolates recollection as the sole variable of interest (however, see below regarding methodological limitations). It is interesting that recollection of participants' favourite memories produced significantly greater activations in the hippocampus and parahippocampus than their worst memories (Fig. 3a) . These regions are closely associated with memory recollection (Svoboda et al., 2006) and participants reported their favourite memories as especially vivid, perhaps implying a greater willingness to engage with these than their worst memories (Piefke et al., 2003) . Similarly, participants may have overintellectualised their worst memories or actively suppressed them, as reflected in the greater activations in executive regions, such as the superior frontal gyrus, and smaller activations in hippocampal regions to worst memories than favourite . The engagement of such defence mechanisms may also explain the generally relatively low ratings of negative emotion during worst memory recollection.\nThere are several limitations to this study. One of the most important is that the study involved healthy volunteers and not patients with PTSD. Further work is required to validate the AMR procedure used in this study as a model of an aspect of psychotherapy relevant to the treatment of PTSD. That we used healthy volunteers and not patients therefore limits our ability to extrapolate between the two. Some of the participants in the present study provided memories that were of an overtly distressing nature (e.g. sudden unexpected bereavements and physical and sexual assaults); however, screening did not reveal any current symptoms of PTSD. Patients with PTSD may encode and retrieve traumatic memories via mechanisms that are unique or specific to their pathology (Protopopescu et al., 2005) . The fMRI results in the present study were somewhat inconsistent with what we had predicted based on previous literature (Protopopescu et al., 2005; St Jacques et al., 2011) . Explicitly, we had predicted amygdala responses to worst memories and their suppression under MDMA, but found neither. However, we did find effects that are somewhat consistent, namely attenuated activations to worst memories in a left anterior temporal cluster.\nIt is worth considering that at least some of the positively-biased emotional processing observed under MDMA in the present study may have been due to the tonic effects of MDMA rather than changes in induced responses. Indeed, to address this we compared ratings of general positive mood under MDMA with favourite memory-evoked positive affect and found a significant positive correlation (p = 0.032, R 2 = 0.19). After this we looked to see whether positive mood under MDMA could explain the reduction in worst memory-evoked negative affect but there was no relationship (R 2 = 0.025).\nThus, the tonic effects of MDMA may offer only a partial explanation of the evoked effects reported here. Resting state fMRI analyses may also be able to inform this matter further and this is something we are currently investigating. Moreover, it is also possible that participants allowed their own positively-biased appraisals of MDMA to influence their subjective judgements; especially given that several were experienced users of MDMA. Contradicting this explanation however, we failed to find any correlations between extent of use and key outcomes such as the subjective responses during AMR.\nThe problem of underpowered designs in neuroscience, and specifically fMRI studies, has been highlighted recently (Button et al., 2013) . The present study was the largest acute administration study of MDMA to date and was well-powered based on the outcomes of previous work (Bedi et al., 2009) . It is especially difficult to conduct studies of this sort with controlled substances (Nutt et al., 2013) , and despite our improved sample size relative to previous work neuroimaging work with MDMA, it remains possible that important effects went undetected. Future studies should note the relatively modest effects of MDMA on induced BOLD-responses observed here and sufficiently power for this.\nThe use of task-free rest as the condition against which emotional AMR was contrasted may be sub-optimal, as experimental control is essentially relinquished during the 'rest' state. An alternative strategy would be to compare activations to emotionally-potent AM cues with emotionally 'neutral' personal memory cues. However, participants may have found it particularly difficult to provide 'neutral' memory cues, since non-salient experiences are typically forgotten, and remembered experiences usually have at least some emotional and personal significance, even if this is implicit.\nThe lack of a behavioural index of task-performance means that we could not monitor whether subjects were performing the task as requested. It is difficult to incorporate a behavioural component into an AMR paradigm however as AMR relies on the evocation of a spontaneous process and is therefore naturally non-directive. Even so, the task could have been improved by including subjective ratings after each recollection rather than after the scanning session was complete. This may have improved the accuracy of the ratings and allowed some monitoring of task performance or compliance.\nThe study design could have been advanced by including varied doses of MDMA to test for dose-dependent effects on the primary outcomes. The inability to maintain the study blind was also a potential methodological weakness. It was important to compare the effects of MDMA against an inert placebo, so as to have a natural baseline; however, most of the volunteers noticed the drug effects and this may have biased outcomes. The incorporation of variable doses of MDMA may have helped to address this matter. Alternatively, future studies may consider comparing MDMA's effects against other psychoactive compounds, such as amphetamine.\nIt is also known that drugs that enter the brain can modulate neurovascular coupling and the hemodynamic response function (Diukova et al., 2012) and it is possible that this could have accounted for the between-condition differences in BOLD responses reported here. However, MDMA's augmenting influence on favourite memories and attenuating effect on worst memories does not support this. Nevertheless, the study design could have been strengthened by incorporating measures specifically designed to address such potential confounds (Iannetti and Wise, 2007) .\nThe inclusion of MDMA-experienced volunteers may also be viewed as a methodological limitation. The reported effects may have been different in MDMA-na\u00efve individuals. Future work in MDMA-na\u00efve individuals in encouraged, as this will improve the generalisability of the inferences that can be made on the study outcomes.\nIt is also advised that future studies look at potential modulatory effects of MDMA on behaviours that are specifically related to its unique profile of subjective effects (such as pro-social behaviours or the optimism bias) rather than more general cognitive processes that have less relevance to the acute MDMA state.\nIn summary, the present study found marked effects of MDMA on subjective responses to emotionally potent personal memories, specifically promoting the vividness, positivity and emotional intensity of favourite memories while attenuating the emotional negativity of worst memories and the drug was found to augment BOLD responses to favourite memories and attenuate responses to negative memories.\nThese results are broadly consistent with some previously demonstrated effects of pro-serotonergic manipulations on emotional processing (Harmer, 2008; Bedi et al., 2009 ). Future research is required to test the reliability of this study's findings, particularly in order to improve our understanding of how MDMA has such marked effects on emotional processing. Well-powered designs, with a focus on specific questions that incorporate more sophisticated pharmacological manipulations, e.g. selective receptor blockade, are advised."}]
