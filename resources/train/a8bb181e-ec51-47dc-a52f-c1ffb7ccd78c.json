This study was conducted at one of the State Madrasah Aliyah in Surakarta academic year 2016/2017. The pre-test and post-test research pattern with treatment and control class groups were used throughout the study. While the treatment group taught by using module based on discovery learning, the control group was taught by a module that commonly used in the school. As the study concluded, using module based on discovery learning in the learning process is effective to increase generic science skills."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The learning of science focuses on learning and concepts through the learning process. Based on the data of Program for International Student Assessment showed that the science ability of Indonesia students are ranked 65 th out of 66 countries (PISA, 2012) . Besides the results of Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study states that the science and mathematics' ability of Indonesia students are ranked 40 th out of 42 countries (TIMSS, 2011) . The low quality of student's science competence in Indonesia showed that the science learning in Indonesia was not run well. The success in increasing students' understanding of science can be measured from the students' basic ability while they are in the learning process. This basic ability is known as generic science skills. The generic science skills are the result of a combination of intellectual abilities or complex interactions between science knowledge and skills. The ten indicators of generic science skills include direct and indirect observations, scale awareness, symbolic language, logical frame, logical consistency, causality, mathematic modelling, concept constructing, and abstraction (Brotosiswoyo, 2000) .\nAs revealed by the National Research Council or NRC (2008) that the skill need of future is a variety of generic science skills. Eaton & Whittle (2012) states generic skill in the learning process can prepare students to face a lot of situations in the future. Since the current round of curriculum reforms around the world, development of generic attributes has become an important indicator of higher education success. Generic attributes refer to some favorable personal qualities in additional to academic scholarship which graduates ought to possess in order to become capable citizens (Chan, 2010) . The results of the analysis of the needs in one of State Madrasah Aliyah in Surakarta, Indonesia indicate low school achievement of competence in biology material with an average score, it was only 78.84%. Based on data from the national exam's result shows that the respiratory system matter gets the low score and having the decline of percentage for three consecutive years from 2013 to 2015, which amounted to 56.84% in 2013; 33.07 % in 2014; and in 2015 only amounted to 27.45%.\nThe result of generic science skills analysis in module and book that commonly used in the school showed the score is still low. Aspect direct observation in book one gets score 12.5% and 0,00% in book two; aspect indirect observation in book one gets score 50.0%; aspect scale awareness in both of book one and book two get score 37.5%; aspect symbolic language in book one gets score 29.2% and 25.0% in book two; aspect logical frame in book one gets score 25.0% and 0,00% in book two; aspect logical consistency in book one gets 59.4% and book two gets 25.0%; aspect casualty in book one gets score 75% and book two gets score 0.00%; aspect mathematic modelling in book one gets score 41.7% and 0,00% in book two; aspect concept constructing in book one gets score 75.0% and 25.0% in book two; and aspect abstraction in book one gets 45.5% and 16.9% in book two.\nThe module is one type of teaching materials that are presented systematically, so that the user can learn with or without a facilitator or teacher. The learning by using module allows students who have a high ability to learn would be faster in completing a basic competence than other students (Ministry of Education, 2004). Septiani, et al. (2014) states that the use of module makes students can learn individually which means that they can adjust the speed of learning according to their ability. In addition, with modules, students can measure the level of their mastery of the material provided. Curriculum 2013 revealed by Ministry of Education and Culture (2014) is demanding the creation of learning process that emphasizes personal experience through the process of observing, asking, reasoning, and trying. Students are expected to have competence attitudes, skills and knowledge that much better through a scientific approach. The learning process like asked by Curriculum 2013 can be applied through a model of discovery learning where learning model uses a scientific approach in the stage of learning syntax. Anders (2012) states that the discovery learning is a learning model in which students can explore, find out, and find themselves in the learning process, so that students take an active role to create, integrate, and generalize knowledge. Jew (2012) adds learning through discovery learning can improve the mastery of materials, retention, and transfer of knowledge and learning are more significant.\nGeneric science skills can be taught through discovery learning models such asked by Curriculum 2013 with learning through scientific approaches. The essence of Curriculum 2013 that was revealed by Kemendikbud (2014) that students are required to be productive, creative, and innovative through the strengthening of attitudes, skills and knowledge which are integrated. The efforts to increase the active participation of students in the learning process as appropriate to Curriculum 2013 inspired the"}, {"section_title": "The Effectiveness of Module Based on Discovery Learning to", "text": "Increase Generic Science Skills researchers to develop a module based on discovery learning at respiratory system subject.

"}, {"section_title": "151", "text": "According Kulldel (2007) states that the use of teaching modules to improve student achievement should be widely used in various grade levels of education. Jew (2012) adds learning through discovery learning can improve the mastery of materials, retention, and transfer of knowledge and learning are more significant. Therefore it is necessary to analysis the learning result in the form of knowledge, attitudes, and skills as supporting data. The results of experimental class learning has increased at each meeting and the results of the average tends to be higher than the results of the control class as presented in Figure 1 . This is supported by Rohim, et al. (2012) which mentions that the model of guided discovery is more effective in learning science, because this model helps students meet two important criteria in active learning that builds knowledge to make sense of new information and integrate new information to find the proper knowledge.\nBased on the results of the activity in the module that presented in Figure 1 , it shows that the activities students did with using syntax of discovery learning can train generic science skills aspects to students. The learning using discovery learning model by Anders (2012) allows the students can explore, find out, and find themselves in the learning process, so that students take an active role to create, integrate, and generalize knowledge. Eaton & Whittle (2012) adds generic skills required for success in a wide range of activities in education and training, work and life in general. Osman, et al. (2009) states the importance to insert 21 st century thinking skills in the learning process and generic science skills can train those 21 st century thinking skills. Zainal, et al. (2012) states the generic skills are the increasingly important skills in life, especially in this era of globalization. These skills will give advantages to individuals especially to the graduates who will be graduating and will be involved in future work.\nModule based on discovery learning that are used in the learning process can increase students' generic science skills because in the module presented the activities are structured in the form of experiments and observations by using the syntax of discovery learning where every aspect of discovery learning is integrating with aspects of generic science skills. Sulistyowati, et al. (2012) concludes that the application of guided discovery learning model is effective against the problem solving skills of students. And then Purwanto, et al. (2012) concludes that the application of guided discovery learning model can improve students' critical thinking skills. Furthermore, Fathur, et al. (2012) concludes that the application of guided discovery learning model can improve students' creative thinking skills. Aspects of problem solving, critical thinking, and creative thinking skills is the aspect of high-level thinking skills which these three aspects are part of the components of generic science skills. Star & Hammer (2008) discusses the critical thinking and problem-solving as an integral part of the generic skills.\nOverall based on the results of the analysis have shown that the use of module based on discovery learning on respiratory system matter is more effective in increasing students' generic science skills. Tricot & Sweller (2014) states that the generic science skills will produce students who are able to understand the concept and it can teach problem-solving strategies to them. It supported by Hockey, et al. (2010) states that the generic skill includes the ability to communicate as well as troubleshooting. Further Badcock, et al. (2010) states that the components of generic skills include critical thinking, problem solving, interpersonal skills, capacity to think logically and independently, communication and information management capabilities, curiosity, creativity, and integrity. McHaney (2012) states that the discovery learning is an instructional model that involves students in the exploration and problem solving to create, integrate, and filter knowledge, and students can learn and advance at their own pace to build a meaningful new knowledge."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Module based on discovery learning is effective to increase generic science skills because a statistical analysis test results showed significant differences between the posttest control class group which using a module that commonly used in the school with treatment class group which using a module based on discovery learning."}]
