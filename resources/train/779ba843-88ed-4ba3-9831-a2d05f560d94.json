[{"section_title": "Chapter 1: Introduction", "text": "The fragmentation of forests into smaller patches affects habitat quality and thus biological diversity, and increases the likelihood of invasion by exotic species. Forest fragmentation is widely considered to be a primary threat to terrestrial biodiversity (Armsworth et al. 2004) and is a pervasive feature of U.S. forests. Riitters et al. (2002) found that approximately 62 percent of forest patches in the lower 48 States are located within 164 yards of the nearest edge. Forest fragmentation can result from land-use intensification, such as housing development, or from natural causes, such as expansion of nonforest plant communities. The overall simplification of biological communities may reduce, and make more costly, the goods and services that humans derive from ecosystems.\nAlthough the ecological effects of forest fragmentation have received substantial attention, an understanding of the economic drivers of fragmentation is less developed. Land-use studies supporting the 2005 Renewable Resources Planning Act (RPA) Assessment update indicated that tens of millions of acres of private forest land in the United States could be converted to urban and developed uses over the next 50 years (e.g., Plantinga 2004, Alig et al. 2004) , resulting in more forested areas being surrounded by nonforest areas, or adjacent to houses, streets, parking lots, and malls. The U.S. population is projected to grow by another 120 million people by 2050, with relatively fast growth rates in the Western United States. These results indicate the importance of understanding economic determinants of forest fragmentation in the context of demands on and supplies of renewable resources from the Nation's forests and rangelands.\nQuestions to answer concerning forest fragmentation include (1) Where, how much, and how is forest fragmentation happening (e.g., natural vs. human causes)?\n(2) What factors are causing forest fragmentation? (3) Are fragmentation trends changing (e.g., accelerating)? (4) What are prospective changes in forest fragmentation? (5) What incentives or associated policies could effectively be used to address fragmentation? Our study addresses a number of the questions posed above in the context of forests in the Western United States. We focus on forest fragmentation resulting from land use, 1 directing our attention to the effect of human land uses on forest fragmentation. 2 Land-use changes can result when supplies of land for different uses change in response to economic incentives, changing laws and regulations, and environmental conditions, interacting with shifts in demands for land in response to changes in socioeconomic factors such as population and personal income. Most public forests are unfragmented, whereas urbanization and increasing intensity of land use may lead to more fragmentation of private lands. We, therefore, focus our analysis on the link between land-use changes on private lands and forest fragmentation.\nOur study of forest fragmentation supports the Sustainable Wood Production Initiative (SWPI) (Deal and White 2005) Conservation and management of U.S. forests is based in part on international protocols (e.g., Montreal Process), which are intended to provide a common understanding of what is meant by sustainable forest management and to provide a common framework for describing, assessing, and evaluating a country's progress toward sustainability at the national level. For example, one criterion is maintenance and enhancement of long-term multiple socioeconomic benefits to meet the needs of societies. Clearly, the provision of these benefits is affected by forest fragmentation. However, the associated indicators, such as one for forest fragmentation (Riitters et al. 2002) , offer little information about population and income and other drivers of change in resource conditions. In our study, we augment efforts such as the Montreal Process by reporting on important drivers of change in resource conditions and how issues such as urbanization crosscut or affect many measures of U.S. renewable resource condition, particularly forest fragmentation.\nThe design of our study is illustrated in figure 1 (the ovals represent components of the study; the boxes are inputs and outputs). The first component is a national-level land-use projection model based on an econometric analysis of land use changes among crop, pasture, forest, urban, Conservation Reserve Program, and range categories. The econometric model is estimated with data on nonfederal land and explains land-use changes in terms of economic returns and site characteristics such as land quality. The projection model is used to generate land-use projections, by county, to 2030. We use forest fragmentation metrics (the share of the landscape in core forest and the percentage of like adjacencies) to characterize the amount of forest fragmentation in the Western United States. A statistical analysis is undertaken to explain the observed variation across counties in these metrics.\nThese results support a linking of the land-use projections and the aggregate fragmentation analysis, allowing us to estimate how the fragmentation metrics may change as the shares of land in different uses differ. Chapter 4 contains a spatially explicit analysis of forest fragmentation in Polk County, Oregon. Projections of fragmentation metrics are generated and compared to those produced by the aggregate data approach used in chapter 3. This comparison sheds light on tradeoffs between precision and costs of data collection, assembly, and processing at different scales of inquiry. We conclude by summarizing key findings and offering suggestions for further research.

As well, the GIS data we used in the simulations do not identify pasture as a separate category. Therefore, we combined these uses with cropland and created a new category for all agricultural land. The transition probabilities indicate the probability that land moves from one 1 The total land area of Polk County is 474,296 acres. We analyzed a portion of the county because our GIS data are available in U.S. Geological Survey quads, and we considered only those quads contained entirely in the county.\n2 We used the model parameters estimated in the national econometric analysis and the independent variables for Polk County to compute the transition probabilities. Separate probabilities are obtained for starting and ending use and land quality class, corresponding to the LQ variable used in the econometric analysis (see page 4). Given the national scope of the econometric analysis, we cannot account for all of the factors that influence land-use decisions in Polk County, including localized land-use regulations. However, our purpose in this section is to compare projections using different methods. In this regard, it is most important that we model a consistent set of land-use determinants. use to another over the period 1997 to 2002. These 5-year probabilities are reported in the top half of table 8. The probability that high-quality (class 1) agricultural land remains in agriculture is 91.7 percent, compared to 94.8 percent for class 2 agricultural land. The probability that agricultural land transitions to forest is 4.3 percent for class 1 land and 2.1 percent for class 2 land. We would expect class 1 agricultural land to have a lower probability of converting to forest than class 2 land. We find that class 1 land is more likely to transition to forest because of the relatively high probability that class 1 pasture, which is included in the agriculture category, transitions to forest. The probabilities that class 1 and 2 agricultural land transitions to urban use are 4.1 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively. The transition probabilities for class 3 and 4 agricultural land are unimportant for our analysis because little agricultural land is found in these categories. The results for land initially in forest reveal very small probabilities for forest-to-agriculture conversions. Forest land has the highest probabilities of remaining in forest (between 94.6 percent and 97.7 percent) and converting to urban use (between 1.8 percent and 5.2 percent).\nFinally, we do not observe land transitioning from urban to other uses. Therefore, the urban-to-urban transition probability is assumed to equal one. Landscape simulations were conducted by using GIS data for Polk County.\nWe obtained spatial data layers from the ORLD that categorize the landscape by agriculture, forest, and urban use and land quality classes 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n3 By overlaying these data, we identified unique parcels that match the transition probabilities. For example, a given parcel may be identified as class 2 land that is initially in agriculture. In this case, we assume the parcel has a 76.6 percent probability of remaining in agriculture over the 25-year horizon and 8.8 percent and 14.6 percent probabilities of converting to forest and urban use, respectively (table 8) "}, {"section_title": "Econometric Land-Use Model", "text": "The National Resources Inventory (NRI) is the primary data set used by Lubowski (2002) to estimate a national econometric land-use model. The NRI is a panel survey of land use and land characteristics on nonfederal lands conducted at 5-year intervals from 1982 to 1997 over the entire United States, excluding Alaska. Data include approximately 844,000 plot-level observations, each representing a land area given by a sampling weight. The NRI provides information on three land-use transitions over the periods 1982-87, 1987-92, and 1992-97 . The Lubowski analysis focuses on the lower 48 States and six major land uses: crops, pasture, forest, urban, range, and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP).\n3 The land base in the study comprises 1.4 billion acres, representing about 74 percent of the total land area and about 91 percent of nonfederal land in the contiguous United States.\nThe dependent variable in the econometric model is the choice of land use in year t+5 (t = 1982, 1987, 1992) at each NRI plot, and the independent variables are the land use in year t, the land quality rating of the plot, and proxies for the expected net returns from the land-use alternatives as of year t. By assembling data 3 Lands in \"rural roads and transportation\" uses are likely to change through a different decisionmaking process than profit maximization by private landowners, and are omitted. Streams and water bodies, marshlands, and barren lands are also excluded, as these uses are unlikely to differ over time. Finally, lands classified under unspecified \"miscellaneous\" uses are omitted.\nfrom a variety of private and public sources, Lubowski (2002) constructed countylevel estimates of annual net returns (per acre) for crops, pasture, forest, range, and urban uses for all 3,014 counties in the 48 contiguous states. 4 The net returns to cropland and timber are weighted averages of net returns to specific crops and forest types, where the weights reflect current cropping patterns and forest type distributions (see the appendix for more details). The land quality measure is the land capability class (LCC) rating of the NRI plot. The LCC rating is a composite index representing 12 factors (e.g., soil type, slope) that determine the suitability of the land for agriculture. It also serves as a proxy measure for forest productivity.\nThe LCC rating ranges from I to VIII, where I indicates the greatest potential for intensive agricultural uses. For the econometric analysis, the eight LCC categories are combined to produce four land quality classes."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "Landowners are assumed to have static expectations of future net financial returns and to allocate their land to the use generating the highest return net of conversion costs. Net financial returns are assumed to have deterministic and random components. The deterministic component includes the county net return, land quality class dummy variables (LQ), and the interaction between the two variables.\nThis specification allows for plot-level deviations from the average county return.\nCertain distributional assumptions (see Train 2003) are imposed on the random components of net returns to yield a nested logit model for estimation. Three nests include land uses with similar land quality requirements: crops, pasture, and CRP; forest and range; and urban. 6 Details on the econometric estimation and results are available in Lubowski (2002) and Lubowski et al. (2006) . The analysis yields probabilities for transitions between each of the six land uses. These probabilities are functions of independent variables and estimated parameters,\nwhere P ijkt denotes the probability that plot i transitions from use j to k during the interval beginning in year t, \u03b2 jk is a vector of estimated parameters for the j to k transition, NR it is a vector of net returns to the six uses in year t and for the county 4 Net returns estimates are, thus, constructed for all of the land-use categories, except for CRP, which is modeled by using a different procedure discussed in Lubowski (2002) . 5 Land quality class 1 includes LCC I and II land, land quality class 2 includes LCC III and IV land, land quality class 3 includes LCC V and VI land, and land quality class 4 includes LCC VII and VIII land. 6 Crops, pasture, and CRP lands tend to have relatively high quality (in terms of the LCC rating), whereas forest and range lands have relatively low quality. There is little correspondence between urban uses and land quality and so urban is placed in a separate nest.\nwhere plot i is located, and LQ i is a vector of land quality class dummy variables for plot i.\nAnother alternative approach, which we leave for future investigation, would be to enter county land rents directly into the regression equation. This might reduce collinearity with some of the other variables in the model.\nThe transition probabilities reflect the influence of market forces on landuse change. Because public forests are typically managed for reasons other than maximizing financial returns (e.g., provision of wildlife habitat and recreation), the forest-to-agriculture and forest-to-urban transition probabilities are not applicable to these lands. In a small number of counties, all forests are publicly owned. We construct a dummy variable for these counties, denoted D Public , and enter it in the model as follows,\nwhere P FA and P FU are the forest to agriculture and forest to urban transition probabilities and \u03b2 1, \u03b2 2, \u03b2 3 are the corresponding coefficients. The influence of having only public forests is measured by \u03b2 1 , which we expect to be positively signed.\nThe effects of the transition probabilities are measured only for counties with some private forest land because (1-D Public )(\u03b2 2 P FA + \u03b2 3 P FU ) = 0 for counties with only public forests. Predictions from a model estimated with ordinary least squares, however, may fall outside the unit interval. We did not encounter this problem in projecting the fragmentation indices and, therefore, did not pursue alternative estimation approaches.\nWhite's (1980) estimate of the covariance matrix was used. This provides consistent estimates of standard errors in the presence of unknown heteroskedasticity."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Land-Use Projection Model", "text": "The key inputs to the land-use projection model are the transition probabilities in\n(1) and plot-level data on land use, net returns, and soil quality from the NRI. The projection model operates at the NRI plot level and begins in the base year 1997.\nTo simplify notation, we denote the years 1997, 2002, and 2007, etc ., as t = 0, 1, 2, etc. Based on the sampling design, each NRI plot is associated with a certain number of acres. We define A ijt as the number of acres associated with plot i in use j in time t. In the initial period, each plot is in one of the six uses as indicated in the 1997 NRI data. Thus, A ij0 equals the acres represented by plot i if the plot is in use j in time 0, and equals 0 otherwise. Given a sequence of transition probabilities, we can compute how this land will be distributed across the six use categories at each time in the future. We can then express the area of land represented by plot i that transitions (transition acres) from use j to k during the interval beginning in t as\nAs well, the acres of land represented by plot i in use j at time t+1\nare given by,\nThis expression reflects the first-order Markov structure of our model.\nThe transition probabilities in the base year are computed with the 1997 values of the net returns (and the time-independent coefficients, \u03b2 jk , and variables, LLC i ).\nWith the initial acres A ij0 , we can estimate the acres in each use in time 1 by using the relationship in (2). The induced change in land use implies a change in the supply of land-based commodities and services and, hence, changes in related prices and the net returns from each use. We model these endogenous price effects for forest and cropland, and assume the net returns to pasture, range, urban, and the CRP remain constant throughout the simulation. Pasture and CRP account for a small share of the total land base. Rangeland is a major component of the land base (about 30 percent initially), but we were unable to find any information on markets (specifically, demand elasticities) for forage, the principal output of rangeland. Finally, the probabilities for transitions into urban uses were found to be insensitive to changes in urban rents, indicating that these transition probabilities would tend to remain the same even with endogenous price effects.\n7 Conversion costs are not measured explicitly, but rather are reflected in constant terms specific to each land-use transition. Consistent with the model of landowner behavior underlying the econometric analysis, cropland and forest commodities are supplied inelastically. Thus, we can use crop and timber yields, measured in output per acre, to translate land-use changes into output changes. After aggregating output changes to the appropriate level, we compute corresponding price changes by using own-price demand elasticities estimated in previous econometric studies. 8 Changes in cropland area result in immediate changes in crop output because crops are assumed to be harvested in the same year that they are planted. In the case of forests, timber harvests will be delayed for a period of years while the forest stand grows to maturity. For afforested lands, we assume that harvests are delayed for the period of one optimal rotation, after which time the forest is \"fully regulated\" and provides a constant annual flow of timber. 9 Likewise, all land originally in forest (i.e., in t = 0) is assumed to have a fully regulated structure. When these lands are converted to nonforest uses, we assume that only a portion of the timber (20 percent) is merchantable.\nThe assumption of a fully regulated forest will clearly overstate the timber supply from private forests. It is well documented that nonindustrial private landowners, who own almost 80 percent of the private forest in the United States, frequently manage their lands for nontimber outputs such as recreation (Butler and Leatherberry 2004) . To account for these alternative management objectives, we assume that a fixed percentage of forest land in each timber production region (see footnote 4) is never harvested, while the remaining forest is harvested in the manner described above. The no-harvest percentages are determined by calibrating the model to regional timber harvest data for 1997. 10 The no-harvest percentages range from 6 percent in the South Central region to 62 percent in the Pacific Southwest region.\nOnce we have computed the price changes resulting from the land-use changes between periods 0 and 1, we can form new measures of net returns in period 1.\nSpecifically, we apply the national or regional percentage price change to the 8 For crop commodities, we use a national-level demand elasticity for raw food inputs by food processors (Goodwin and Brester 1995) . We apply this elasticity (-0.661) separately to each of the 25 crop commodities in our model. For timber, we use demand elasticities for seven timber production regions-Pacific Northwest (-0.300), Pacific Southwest (-0.497), Rocky Mountains (-0.054), North Central (-0.141), Northeast (-0.029), South Central (-0.193) , Southeast (-0.285)-from the Timber Assessment Market Model (Adams and Haynes 1996) . These elasticities apply to a composite timber type representative of the species found within the region. In general, we would expect the mixes of crop and timber types to change in response to price changes. However, we assume for simplicity that the crop and timber type shares remain constant over time. Lubowski (2002) developed two sets of econometric results. One set uses data on transitions from all three periods and the other uses data only on transitions from the final period . We generated projections with both sets of estimates, but present here only the results based on the 1992-1997 parameters as similar results are obtained. Table 1 shows the national-level changes. The NRI data on land use transactions among major land uses analyzed in the current study allow projections of net changes as well as gross land-use changes, e.g., the total amount of forest area projected to be deforested."}, {"section_title": "Projection Results", "text": "Urban area increases by approximately 2 million acres per year throughout the projection period, for a total gain of 68 million acres by 2030.

With the exception of pasture area, which increases initially, the largest declines in these categories occur between now and 2010.

We consider two possible explanations. First, the econometric results that underlie the projections were part of a national analysis.\nIn particular, a single set of parameters was estimated to characterize the observed land-use patterns. The model may be able to accurately represent land-use trends at a national scale because it reflects the central tendency of the data. However, it may be less accurate at a regional level because the model is not specified to capture regional differences in the underlying relationships. This represents a potential limitation of the fragmentation analyses presented in chapters 3 and 4, which draw on regional land-use projections.\nTo a significant degree, the projections are a reflection of the land-use transitions between 1992 and 1997.\n13 Thus, a second possibility is that the regional projections simply mimic the land-use changes that actually occurred during this period. shows the acres of land that moved from pasture to forest, from range to forest, and from forest to nonforest uses (cropland, pasture, urban, etc.) . In the Mountain region, a relatively large amount of rangeland (820,000 acres) converted to forest between 1992 and 1997, while a smaller area of land left forest (462,000 acres).\nA similar pattern is seen in the Cornbelt and South Plains regions, except in these cases there were relatively large amounts of pasture transitioning to forest. In some regions where we project declines in forest, such as the Northeast and Southeast, the flow of land out of forest between 1992 and 1997 exceed the flow of land into forest.

Using county-level data, we estimate models of two fragmentation indices, the share of the county in core forest, and the percentage of neighboring parcels that are also forested (like adjacencies). The explanatory variables describe county landuse shares, forest ownership, land quality, topography, the likelihood of changes in forest area, and the income distribution of a county's residents. The purpose of this analysis is to identify the determinants of forest fragmentation by using aggregate data and to develop a model that can be used to project fragmentation indices. The fragmentation indices used as dependent variables summarize the spatial configuration of land use within the county. In chapter 4, we present an analysis of forest fragmentation for a single county that accounts for land-use decisions on individual parcels. This approach offers more precision than the methods described here, but this precision comes at a higher cost in terms of managing large data sets, using specialized software, and requiring greater computing time. If readily available aggregate data can be used to model forest fragmentation, then reliable projections of forest fragmentation can be made at low cost and over large geographical areas.

The data are delineated in a 100-foot grid. A core forest parcel is defined as a forest parcel at least 100 feet from a nonforest edge.\nThe core forest variable equals the number of core forest parcels in a county divided by the total number of parcels in the county (times 100 to convert the variable to a percentage). It indicates both the amount of forest land in a county and the extent to which these parcels form relatively large blocks of forest. For example, a county would have a low value of this index if it had a large area of forest that is severely fragmented or if it had a small area that formed forest blocks. The core forest share ranges from 0 to 93.5 percent, with a mean of 32.4 percent. Table 4 provides summary statistics for the variables used in this study.\nThe percentage of like adjacencies for forest is defined as, ,\nwhere I = 1,\u2026, N indexes the forested parcels in a county and ADJ ij is an indicator variable that takes the value 1 if the jth parcel adjacent to parcel i is forested and the value 0 if it is not. Adjacency is defined by using an eight-neighbor rule 2 and, thus, the term in parentheses equals the share of parcels adjacent to parcel i that are also forested. These proportions are then averaged over all forested parcels in the county. The percentage of like adjacencies measures the contiguity of forest parcels. It equals 0 if forest parcels are maximally dispersed and tends toward 100 as a county becomes entirely forested. The percentage of like adjacencies ranges from 1 We thank Jennifer Swenson for computing these indices. Because the indices represent forest fragmentation within counties, the metrics may be artificially truncated at the county boundaries. For example, if contiguous forest blocks span county boundaries, the indices will overstate the degree of fragmentation. We do not make adjustments for this problem, but note that the influence of borders is diminished with large counties and small parcel sizes (100-foot grid, in our case). 2 In a 3 by 3 grid, the center parcel is adjacent to eight neighbors."}, {"section_title": "N", "text": "ADJ ij 0 to 99.998 percent. The mean is 98.2 percent, indicating that most forest parcels in the study region are surrounded by other forested parcels. The correlation coefficient for the core forest and like adjacencies measures is 42 percent, indicating that the two measures move together but represent different features of fragmentation.\nVariation in the county forest fragmentation indices is explained by using a set of independent variables. These variables can be grouped to represent four general factors hypothesized to influence the spatial arrangement of forest land. The first group measures the aggregate allocations of land to forest and alternative uses. The second group accounts for effects of public ownership of forests. The third group measures the influence of land quality, which influences the feasibility of forest and other uses. Finally, the last group summarizes the effect of economic factors such as net returns to alternative land uses. The selection of variables reflects an effort to obtain a predictive model while also yielding insights into the important determinants of forest fragmentation. It is important to emphasize that we model To account for the effect of human land uses on forest fragmentation, the county shares of nonfederal land in forest, crops, pasture, urban, CRP, and range were included as explanatory variables. Data on areas of land in these six major land-use categories were extracted from the 1997 NRI survey results, and land-use shares were calculated as a percentage of total county acreage. 3 We expect that, overall, the forest share will have a positive effect on the fragmentation metrics because both indices tend toward 100 as a county becomes entirely forested. However, depending on how forest land is arranged spatially, it is possible for a county with a greater share of land in forest to have more fragmented forests than another county with less forest land. We expect land in other uses to have a negative effect on the fragmentation indices overall, although, as above, the land-use share variables do ranging from the late 1980s to the mid 1990s. We expect public forests, whether in federal or nonfederal ownerships, to be unfragmented relative to private forests because development and other nonforest uses are typically prohibited on these lands.\nThese variables would also control for nonhuman causes of forest fragmentation (e.g., transition zones between forest and nonforest plant communities) to the extent that these effects are systematic across public forests. Overall, we expect the shares of public forest land to be positively related to the fragmentation metrics.\nLand capability class shares were included to capture variation within the county in land quality. The areas of land in each of the eight LCC classes were extracted from the 1997 NRI database and then normalized on the area of nonfederal land in each county. Alig et al. (2005) found that indices summarizing the spatial configuration of land quality are an important determinant of forest fragmentation.\nIt was too costly to construct such measures for this study. However, if our nonspatial LCC variables, which are readily computed from NRI data, are significant predictors of forest fragmentation, models of forest fragmentation can be developed at lower cost. Overall, we expect a negative relationship between high-quality land and the fragmentation metrics because high-quality land tends to be allocated to intensive agricultural uses such as crops and pasture. We include dummy variables for LCC classes II through VIII (class I is the omitted category). Because class I is the highest quality land, we expect positive signs on the remaining categories. That is, increasing the share of land in lower quality classes raises the fragmentation metrics relative to class I lands.\nTo capture the variability of land quality within each county, a variable measuring the range in elevation is included. We conjecture that counties with a 4 We thank Scott Walker for providing these data."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The estimation results for the core forest model are presented in table 5. The adjusted R-squared statistic indicates that the explanatory variables explain approximately 93 percent of the variation in the dependent variable. Among the land-use share variables, only the forest share is significantly related to the percentage of the county in core forest. As expected, the sign of the coefficient is positive.\nWe find also, and as expected, a positive and significant relationship between core forest and shares of land in public uses. Many of the land quality variables are significantly different from zero and, as expected, positive. Higher shares of land in lower LCC classes increase the amount of core forest relative to the highest LCC class. The range in elevation and the share of wealthy households do not have significant effects on the core forest share. Among the transition probabilities, only the agriculture-to-forest transition probability has a significant effect.

Four of the coefficients on the land-use share variables are significantly different from zero at the 10 percent level or lower. As expected, like adjacencies are increasing in the forest share and declining in the agricultural and urban shares. Unexpectedly, we found a positive and significant relationship with the pasture share. None of the coefficients on the public land or the land quality variables are significantly different from zero.\nHowever, the coefficient on the elevation range variable is significantly different from zero. The sign is positive, indicating that greater elevation range is associated with less fragmentation. We expected the opposite relationship. 6 The agricultureto-forest and forest-to-urban transition probabilities had negative and significant effects on like adjacencies. Although the second relationship has the anticipated sign, the first is contrary to our expectations. Finally, the like adjacencies are increasing in the share of wealthy households. Again, the sign of this coefficient is opposite from what we expected.\nComparing the results for the models, we find that the coefficients on only two variables were significantly different from zero in both models. The share of land in forest is positively related to the core forest and like adjacency metrics. The agriculture-to-forest transition probability has a significant effect on both fragmentation measures, but the signs of the effects differ between the two models. It has a positive effect on core forest and a negative effect on like adjacencies.\nSimulation results are presented in table 7 and figures 2 through 4. We project an increase in forest area from 41.5 percent of the land base to 42.6 percent, on average, by 2022. Figure 2 shows that the distribution of the forest share is roughly symmetrical, with values ranging from approximately 40 percent to 44.5 percent.\nThe share of land in urban use is projected to increase substantially, from 2.5 percent to 17.3 percent, while the agricultural land share declines from 55.2 percent 4 The probabilities are from an econometric analysis employing data from a random sample of plots. This prevents us from accounting for factors such as spatial correlation among land-use decisions and parcelization. 5 If there are X parcels and Y uses, then there are Y X possible landscape configurations.\n6 Extensive diagnostics, discussed in Lewis (2005) , were done to determine the appropriate number of simulations. . 5 7 9 0 . 6 6 9 0 . 7 4 9 0 . 8 3 9 0 . 9 2 9 1 . 0 1 9 1 . 0 9 9 1 . 1 8 9 1 . 2 7 9 1 . 3 6 9 1 . 4 4 9 1 . 5 3\nPercentage of the like adjacencies for forest parcels These results show that increases in forest area need not reduce the degree of forest fragmentation. 7 The forest share increases by 1.1 percentage points, but we find that the expected share of the landscape in core forest declines by 2.7 percentage points, suggesting that some of the new forest parcels are relatively small or isolated from existing forest patches. Another possibility is that fragmentation results from the conversion of existing forest land to urban use, which increases by almost 15 percentage points over the projection period. Moreover, the statistics in "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The results of this analysis are mixed. The core forest model has a good fit and the coefficients of many explanatory variables are significant and have the expected signs. In contrast, the variables in the like adjacency model have relatively low explanatory power and many of the coefficients have unexpected signs. These results highlight the challenges inherent in estimating aggregate models of forest fragmentation. Forest fragmentation is the outcome of a spatial process. We have attempted to model fragmentation by using aggregate data that necessarily mask underlying spatial relationships. Moreover, we have used relatively large observational units (counties) in order to consider a large geographical area (11 Western States). Given our study area, it was infeasible to construct explanatory variables that summarize spatial patterns, such as the land-quality metrics used in Alig et al. (2005) . Rather, we relied on aspatial measures of land use, ownership, land quality, and land-use transition probabilities.\nThe share of land in forest was found to have a positive and significant effect on the percentage of the landscape in core forest and the percentage of like adjacencies for forest. This finding is related to a concept in landscape ecology referred to as the percolation threshold (Grimmett 1989 ). In the context of forest land, the idea is that once forests occupy a critical share of a landscape (approximately 60 percent), the number of spatially isolated patches drops at a fast rate with the addition of new forests. Thus, we find that an increase in the forest share, all else equal, increases both the fragmentation indices.\nThe foregoing discussion suggests a nonlinear relationship between the fragmentation indices and the forest share. We estimated models that included the square of the forest share and found negative and significant coefficients on this variable. Otherwise, the results were similar. Adjusted R2 = 0.23, n = 372. * P < 0.05. ** P < 0.10. LCC = land capability class.\nOther variables also have significant effects on forest fragmentation. In the core forest model, these include the public ownership and land-quality variables and the agriculture-to-forest transition probability. In the like adjacencies model, the crop and urban shares and the forest-to-urban transition probability had negative and significant effects. Three variables (pasture share, elevation range, and agriculture-toforest transition probability) had significant effects but coefficients with unexpected signs. There are plausible explanations for the positive effect of elevation range and the negative effect of the agriculture-to-forest transition probability. Counties with large elevation ranges may have high mountains. In this case, agricultural and urban uses may be infeasible owing to steep slopes or prohibited by statute and, thus, forests may be less fragmented. Transitions from agriculture to forest may create isolated forest parcels, which could lower the like adjacencies variables.\nThe pasture share may proxy for county characteristics in a way that is difficult to identify. This illustrates an inherent problem with aggregate data models and with our use of relatively large observational units. With smaller units, the predictive power of aggregate forest fragmentation models increases ).\nOur use of data on Western counties gives rise to other challenges with developing aggregate models of forest fragmentation. According to the data on like adjacencies, forest fragmentation is not a pervasive feature of Western forests. For approximately 69 percent of the counties, the like adjacencies measure exceeds 99 percent. For 88 percent, the measure exceeds 95 percent. This indicates that a large majority of the forest parcels in our study area are surrounded by other forest parcels (i.e., are core forest). The lack of variation in the like adjacencies variable makes it difficult to find significant explanatory variables. The fact that most forest parcels are core forest implies that the percentage of a county in core forest will closely correspond to the total share of the county in forest. Thus, our model is similar to a forest land shares model (e.g., Ahn et al. 2000) and may not provide many insights into the determinants of forest fragmentation."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 4: Spatially Explicit Fragmentation Analysis", "text": "In this chapter, we predict changes in forest fragmentation by using spatially explicit simulations.

Moreover, the aggregate model of forest fragmentation is estimated with observations on western counties, including Polk County, Oregon. Therefore, we can compare the projection results for Polk\nCounty generated with the two approaches. But, first, we must make some adjustments to the fragmentation metrics. Public forest lands are included in the countylevel measures used in chapter 2, but excluded from the measures used in chapter 4.\nIf we assume that all public forests are core forest and have 100 percent like adjacencies, then the initial percentage of all private lands in Polk County in core forest is 42.0 percent and the initial percentage of like adjacencies for these forests is 96.6 percent. 8 These figures differ from those computed for the 304,692-acre section of 8 The core forest share of all land in Polk County is 53.7 percent. We subtract the public forest land share (11.7 percent) to obtain 42 percent. The like adjacency measure for all forest is 97.3 percent. Public forests represent 19.6 percent of all forests and so the like adjacency measure for private lands is given by (97.3 -19.6 )/80.4 = 96.6 percent. 9 There may simply be differences in the fragmentation of forests within and outside the section of the county considered."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 6: Summary and Conclusions", "text": "We use an econometric model of private land-use decisions to project land use to 2030 for each county in the continental United States. We assume that net financial returns to urban, pasture, and range remain constant through time, but allow crop and forest returns to adjust endogenously to the projected changes in land use.\nOn a national scale, forest area is projected to increase between 1997 and 2030, representing a change overall between 0.1 and 0.2 percent per year. Urban area is projected to increase by 68 million acres over this period, with annual increases ranging from 1.6 to 2.7 percent. Cropland, pasture, rangeland, and Conservation We conducted an analysis of forest fragmentation in the Western United States.\nOne of the primary goals was to determine if county-level forest fragmentation metrics can be modeled in terms of aggregate variables constructed from readily available data, in contrast to using spatial data that are more costly to obtain. For the core forest model, many of the proposed explanatory variables were significantly different from zero and have coefficient signs consistent with expectations. We found that the share of the county in core forest increases with the shares of land in private, federal, and other public forest. This finding may reflect the concept from landscape ecology of a percolation threshold. Once the area occupied by forest is sufficiently high, patches become connected and fragmentation is reduced. We also found that the core forest percentage increased with lower quality land and a higher agriculture-to-forest transition probability.\nThe results for the like adjacency model are weaker. As expected, the like adjacency metric was positively related to the forest share and negatively related to the agricultural and urban shares and the forest-to-urban transition probability.\nHowever, we found positive effects from the pasture share, greater elevation range, and the share of wealthy households and a negative effect from the agricultureto-forest transition probability. The last four results are contrary to expectations.\nOne of the challenges with modeling like adjacencies is that this variable exhibits relatively little variation in the Western United States. For approximately 69 percent of the counties, the like adjacencies measure exceeded 99 percent, indicating very little forest fragmentation (at least at the scale considered) in the majority of counties. This is an important empirical finding in its own right and motivates the search for alternative representations of forest fragmentation that may confirm this finding.\nAlso, it may be of interest to compute the like adjacencies measure for other U.S.\nregions (e.g., the Midwest and Northeast) where it is expected to be lower.\nAnother challenge-common to both fragmentation models-is how to appropriately model an inherently spatial phenomenon by using aggregate variables.\nA promising approach is to include explanatory variables that summarize spatial pattern within the unit of observation (counties, in our case). Alig et al. (2005) found that indices summarizing the spatial configuration of land quality were a significant determinant of forest fragmentation. One might also use this approach to represent the spatial configuration of urban land, which is likely to be a factor in determining forest fragmentation but is unlikely to be correlated with traditional measures of land quality. Another strategy is to reduce the geographical scale of the observations (e.g., from counties to census tracts). However, this increases the cost of the analysis.\nWe conducted a spatially detailed analysis of forest fragmentation in Polk County, Oregon. This approach has much greater data requirements, and consider- We linked the land-use projections and the analyses of forest fragmentation.\nCounty land-use shares were included in the aggregate forest fragmentation models, allowing us to determine how projected changes in land use would affect the fragmentation metrics. We found increases in the average county shares of core forest in 8 of the 11 Western States, with the largest percentage changes in New Mexico, Arizona, and Wyoming. The average like adjacency measure increased in six of the states. Declines were found in all of the Pacific Coast States. One of the valuable features of this approach is that we can examine changes in the spatial distribution of the fragmentation metrics by using geographic information system-based maps.\nWe compared the results of the aggregate and spatially detailed fragmentation analyses. In each case, we projected the fragmentation indices to 2022. Both approaches rely on the same land-use transition probabilities and measures of forest fragmentation, and evaluate conditions in Polk County, Oregon. We found considerable differences in the results produced with the two methods, especially in the case of the like adjacency metric. This finding may indicate that the aggregate data method, which does not account explicitly for spatial processes, is invalid. It should be noted, however, that we were unable to design a perfect test. Owing to the nature of the available data, the spatially detailed analysis considered only a portion of Polk County, whereas the aggregate model included the entire county. Additional research could evaluate aggregate fragmentation models estimated at a finer scale, such as census tracts (e.g., Alig et al. 2005 . This would provide a closer correspondence between the geographical areas evaluated under the two approaches. Forest fragmentation is an important cause of biodiversity loss in terrestrial ecosystems. We have developed a framework for modeling forest fragmentation at large scales and projecting changes in fragmentation under different economic and policy scenarios. Our analysis directly supports the Sustainable Wood Production Initiative and the RPA assessments, and expands efforts to define and develop protocols for sustainable forest management. Moreover, our approach offers promise for analyzing emerging policies designed to reduce forest fragmentation. Our econometric model quantifies the relationship between net returns to alternative land uses and land-use transitions. As such, the model can be used to simulate the effects of market-based policies, such as subsidies, encouraging conversion of land to forest or retention of land in forest. The effects on landscape-level indicators of forest fragmentation can then be measured by using the procedure discussed in chapter 4. Lewis and Plantinga (in press ) developed an application of this approach to South Carolina. Using the models developed here, a national-scale policy analysis could be conducted."}, {"section_title": "Metric equivalents", "text": "1 foot = 0.3048 meters 1 yard = 0.9144 meters 1 acre = 0.4047 hectares"}, {"section_title": "Appendix-Variable Measurement and Data Sources", "text": "Land Use\nThe land-use data used to estimate the econometric model are from the USDA National Resources Inventory (NRI). \"Croplands\" include row and close-grown crops, fallow, pasture and haylands in rotation with crops, permanent haylands, vineyards, orchards, and nurseries. \"Pasture\" includes land managed for introduced forage for livestock grazing. \"Range\" includes land under native or introduced forage suitable for grazing which, unlike pasture, receives only limited management. \"Forests\" are areas at least 1 acre in size and 100 feet in width that are at least 10 percent stocked with trees with the potential to reach 13 feet at maturity.
