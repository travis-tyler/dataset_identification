[{"section_title": "", "text": "are reinforced by an educational system that prefers these styles, leaving most members of the lower classes with little hope of achieving social mobility.\nOf all Bourdieu's concepts, cultural capital has become the most popular and thoroughly examined by sociologists of education. Most studies have attempted to determine whether Bourdieu's notion of social reproduction, based on the intergenerational transmission of cultural capital, is valid, and, if so, the role that the educational system plays. However, by focusing on cultural capital, these studies have ignored another crucial component of Bourdieu's theoretical model of practice: habitus. Habitus, or one's view of the world and one's place in it, is an important consideration in trying to understand how students navigate their way through the educational system. Studying cultural capital while ignoring habitus leaves Bourdieu's theoretical framework incomplete in its practical application. It is necessary to consider both one's resources (capital) and the orientation one has toward using those resources (habitus) to implement the model of practice in the educational field in the way that Bourdieu intended.\nIt is particularly important to consider the functions of both cultural capital and habitus when studying gender differences in schooling. Jacobs (1996) noted that much of the mainstream research in the sociology of education tends to ignore women, even though gender is one of the main stratifying factors in society. Bourdieu has been criticized for giving short shrift to factors other than class that distinguish people from one another (Hall 1992 ).1 Indeed, many of Bourdieu's works imply that gender is a secondary characteristic to social class.2 Recent research has considered other stratifying factors by addressing the role of race, in addition to class, in relation to cultural capital (Farkas 1996; Farkas et al. 1990 ; Kalmijn and Kraaykamp 1996; Lareau and Horvat 1999). Gender, however, has been a neglected area, even though boys and girls have different experiences in the schooling system that may lead to their different positions in society. Although one may argue that boys and girls receive the same cultural training if they are in the same social class, their habitus may be quite different, on the basis of their socialization and the views they form of the opportunity structure available to them. For example, while both male and female students choose business over any other college major, women are less likely than men to get degrees in engineering, the physical sciences, and computer science, all of which have been traditionally seen as male disciplines (Yupin et al. 2000) .3 Jacobs (1995) noted that 30 percent of women would have to change their college majors for women to be distributed in the same manner as men. Moreover, Jacobs (1996) showed that at every level of education, women earn less than men; for example, when both women and men have four years of college, women earn .71 of what men earn. Thus, despite advances for women over the past few decades, there are many structural constraints to women's progress, and gender socialization continues to shape girls' lives.\nEven with these obstacles, female students excel in school; they repeat grades less often do than male students, have higher graduation rates from high school, and are more likely to attain bachelor's degrees (Jacobs 1996) . This puzzle was addressed by Mickelson (1989) , who noted that female students' achievement in school seems anomalous because the rewards associated with schooling are still lower than those for male students. Determining the effects of both habitus and cultural capital on students' grades will help sociologists understand this problem.\nThe goals of this article are to join cultural capital and habitus in a model of educational success, as Bourdieu intended; to determine whether cultural capital and habitus play significant roles in educational success; and, more specifically, to determine whether one's gender, in addition to one's socioeconomic status (SES), leads to different benefits from cultural capital and habitus in terms of educational outcomes. The following two sections set up the theoretical framework for the article. First, Bourdieu's broader theoretical framework, including his notions of habitus, field, and practice, is discussed, and gender is placed within this theoretical framework. 46 "}, {"section_title": "Duma~~~~~~~is", "text": "Next, a review of research on cultural capital and school success is presented, with a focus on research on gender differences."}, {"section_title": "CULTURAL CAPITAL AND GENDER", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Bourdieu's General Theoretical Framework", "text": "Although cultural capital is an important part of Bourdieu's theory of social reproduction, it is only one component of his theoretical framework. In Distinction, Bourdieu (1984) noted that capital, habitus, and field all work together to generate practice, or social action.\nThe field, the setting in which practices take place, is \"a network, or a configuration, of objective relations between positions\" (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992:97). Fields are spaces in which dominant and subordinate groups struggle for control over resources; each field is related to one or more types of capital. Indeed, Bourdieu and Wacquant argued that capital does not exist or function except in relation to a field.\nCultural capital is one of several forms of capital that Bourdieu (1997) described. Along with economic, social, and symbolic capital, cultural capital serves as a power resource, or a way for groups to remain dominant or gain status. Bourdieu distinguished among three forms of cultural capital: objectified cultural capital, which refers to objects that require special cultural abilities to appreciate, such as works of art; institutionalized cultural capital, which refers to educational credentials and the credentialing system; and embodied cultural capital, which is the disposition to appreciate and understand cultural goods. It is this third form that most researchers have tried to operationalize in their studies by showing students' interest in music or art. Institutionalized cultural capital develops as a result of one's having embodied cultural capital and successfully converting it via the educational system. To appropriate and use objectified cultural capital, one needs embodied cultural capital (Bourdieu 1997) .4\nIn addition to capital and field, another important concept for Bourdieu is habitus.\nHabitus is one's disposition, which influences the actions that one takes; it can even be manifested in one's physical demeanor, such as the way one carries oneself or walks. It is generated by one's place in the social structure; by internalizing the social structure and one's place in it, one comes to determine what is possible and what is not possible for one's life and develops aspirations and practices accordingly. This internalization takes place during early childhood and is a primarily unconscious process.5\nThe consequences of the development of habitus are large: Bourdieu argued that the reproduction of the social structure results from the habitus of individuals. On the basis of the class position they were born into, people develop ideas about their individual potential; for example, those in the working class tend to believe that they will remain in the working class. These beliefs are then externalized into actions that lead to the reproduction of the class structure.\nOverall, then, one's practices or actions are the result of one's habitus and capital within a given field. In terms of schooling, Bourdieu and Wacquant (1992) described the school system as a field. Doing one's schoolwork and attempting to get good grades are kinds of practices in this field. Within the educational field, the most valuable form of capital is cultural capital: \"academic success is directly dependent upon cultural capital and on the inclination to invest in the academic market\" (Bourdieu 1973:96) . Both Bourdieu (1984) and DiMaggio and Useem (1978) found that within the dominant classes, teachers have the most cultural capital, value it, and tend to reward students who possess it. Children who have more cultural capital (having been exposed to it from birth in their upper middle-and upper-class families) feel more comfortable in school, communicate easily with teachers, and are therefore more likely to do well in school (De Graaf, De Graaf, and Kraaykamp 2000). Lower-class students, on the other hand, find the school environment different from their home environment and lack the capital necessary to fit in as well as the higher-SES students.6\nHabitus also plays a large role in students' success in school, but with few exceptions 46 Dumais C (McClelland 1990; Reay 1995) , it has been largely ignored by past research in the sociology of education.7 Students' decisions to invest in their education, study hard, and go to college depend on students' place in the class system and their expectations of whether people from that class tend to be successful academically (Swartz 1997 ). Bourdieu (1973) argued that one's habitus develops in relation to how much cultural capital one has; a person from the lower class is aware that people from that class tend to have little cultural capital and that without cultural capital, they are unlikely to succeed educationally. Therefore, lower-class students tend to self-select themselves out of the college-going track on the basis of their views of what is possible and what is not. On the other hand, exceptional students from the lower class may see the accumulation of cultural capital as a way to overcome the obstacles that are typical for those in their class position.\nThe foregoing description addressed class differences in cultural capital, habitus, and schooling. Gender differences, however, are also relevant. Bourdieu (1984:107) stated that \"sexual properties are as inseparable from class properties as the yellowness of a lemon is from its acidity.\" As one moves up the social hierarchy, he noted, there are fewer differences between men and women, and the division of labor is not as strong. Part of the traditional division of labor is that women are the ones who are knowledgeable about art and literature; in the upper classes, however, both men and women are educated in these matters.\nAccording to Bourdieu (1984) , cultural capital is important for women for two reasons: Women make use of the capital for acquiring husbands, and women play the key role of transmitting the cultural capital to their children. Men are more inclined to use cultural capital for educational qualifications and for getting jobs. These different uses of cultural capital imply that social actions take place in different fields for men and women, with different forms of capital serving as currency. Bourdieu (1984:105) hinted at this possibility:\nIn every relationship between educational capital and a given practice, one sees the effects of the dispositions associated with gender which help to determine the logic of the reconversion of inherited capital into educational capital, that is, the \"choice\" of the type of educational capital which will be obtained from the same initial capital, more often literary for girls, more often scientific for boys.\nIn other words, one's habitus, determined by the available opportunity structure or field, shapes the type of class-based capital that men and women have, resulting in gendered forms of cultural capital (Laberge 1995 Finally, some studies have used measures that seem more obviously reflective of SES, such as whether the parents provide a specific place to study (Teachman 1987) , or noncognitive traits, such as the way one carries himself or herself and communicates with others (Farkas et al. 1990 ). These measures support the argument that higher-SES students do better in school, but do not really address the process of social exclusion described in the first definition of cultural capital presented earlier.\nThere have also been conflicting conclusions regarding the effects of cultural capital on educational outcomes, in whatever form it has been operationalized. DiMaggio (1982) found that male students have low levels of interest in cultural activities, while female students have moderately higher levels. DiMaggio also found that female students from high-status families have the greatest return from having cultural capital, a phenomenon he labeled the \"cultural reproduction\" model, but that male students tend to follow the \"cultural mobility\" model, benefiting more from cultural capital if they are from lower-status groups. DiMaggio's explanation of the gender difference is that high-status females are culturally prescribed into the activities that would give them cultural capital, while highstatus males tend to rebel against their parents' cultural values; he further argued that women may use cultural capital as a way to attract high-status men. Using the same data set, Mohr and DiMaggio (1995) analyzed the intergenerational transmission of cultural capital and found that gender has a greater effect on the possession of cultural capital than do any family background variables (including father's occupation, parental education, income, and household cultural climate).\nAschaffenburg and Maas (1997) used data from the Survey of Public Participation in the Arts from 1982, 1985, and 1992, focusing on training in high cultural activities. Although they noted that females are more likely than males to participate in cultural classes, they found, unlike DiMaggio (1982) , that with regard to making educational transitions, cultural capital benefits male and female students equally. They suggested that the greater number of educational opportunities that exist for girls today may be one reason why cultural capital is no longer more important for them than it is for boys, as it was in the early 1960s. However, since they used a different dependent variable than did DiMaggio, it is difficult to say whether the gender differences in cultural capital have disappeared.\nThus, we are left with inconsistent conclusions in the broader study of cultural capital, particularly when considering gender. A more complete empirical consideration of Bourdieu's theoretical framework may help sociologists understand more fully the roles of cultural capital and habitus in educational outcomes and how these roles may vary by gender."}, {"section_title": "ANALYSIS", "text": "Research on cultural capital and school success has been inconclusive. It is not clear whether cultural capital actually affects educational outcomes and whether and why the process of converting cultural capital into educational success may differ for male and female students. Furthermore, Bourdieu's concept of habitus has not been included in research on cultural capital and school success, leading to an incomplete picture of how Bourdieu's model functions.\nIn my study, I attempted to improve on the previous research in three ways. First, most previous studies have created a cultural capital index, rather than considered individual activities separately, so it is not clear whether one activity is more relevant than Dumais others. In my study, I analyzed participation rates in several cultural activities by gender and SES before I created a cultural capital variable, to determine if any specific activity is preferred by higher-SES students or by boys or girls.\nSecond, most research on cultural capital and schooling has not addressed differences that may exist between schools. Schools in rural regions or poor districts may not have the same access to cultural resources as do schools in other areas. Through the use of pooled within-school regression estimates, I separated individual effects from school-level resource-deprivation effects.\nMost important, by including a variable for students' occupational expectations, I operationalized the concept of habitus to develop a more complete model of Bourdieu's theory than has been evident in previous research. Habitus should have a strong and positive effect on the grades of both boys and girls. The effect of habitus may be stronger for male students because (according to gendersocialization theory) success and achievement should be part of their worldview, and achieving good grades can be seen as a step in that direction. For female students, the connection is not as simple; as Mickelson (1989) outlined, habitus may have a strong effect for a number of reasons, ranging from a desire to attract men to a belief that inequality for women no longer exists.\nIf cultural capital is as important as Bourdieu (1973) argued it is for educational outcomes, then a cultural capital effect should be present even after habitus is added to the model, and it should be present for both boys and girls. If the effect is bigger for one group or the other, it will be important to explain how and why this difference occurs and whether new indicators should be developed that take gender differences into account."}, {"section_title": "Data and Variables", "text": "The data I used were from the first panel of the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS), a survey based on a nationally representative sample of 24,599 eighth-grade respondents in 1988.8 Because gender was my main interest, I restricted the sample to white eighth graders; thus, further research on the interaction of race and gender is necessary. A sample weight was used throughout the analyses to compensate for unequal probabilities of selection into the sample and for nonresponse.9\nThe data collected for Project Talent and used by DiMaggio (1982) contain one of the most comprehensive sets of measures for cultural capital. While the cultural variables in NELS were clearly collected with the intention of measuring cultural capital, they are not as comprehensive as those of Project Talent. An ideal set of measures for cultural capital may include such things as the student's eloquence and his or her comfort in the school environment. However, the NELS data set, like many other data sets that have been used in studies of cultural capital, does not include such a wide set of variables for cultural capital. It is true, however, that the measures mentioned could also be seen as components of one's SES, which the NELS data set has a measure of. Therefore, by using a limited definition of cultural capital-participation in the arts-I make a stronger test for whether there is actually an effect.\nI constructed cultural capital variables from questions in the NELS parents' questionnaire. One set of questions asked: \"Do you or your eighth grader take part in any of the following activities?\" with the activities listed as \"borrowing books from the public library,\" \"attending concerts or other musical events,\" and \"going to art museums.\" Another set of questions was related to whether students took lessons in high cultural activities: \"Has your eighth grader ever taken classes outside of school in one of the following activities?\" with the activities listed as \"art classes outside of school,\" \"music classes outside of school,\" and \"dance classes outside of school.\"10\nThe total number of students' cultural activities asked about in NELS, then, is six. In some cases, these activities are studied separately in the following analyses. Cultural capital in this study is simply the sum of the number of activities in which the student participates. For each student, the cultural capital variable can range from zero (participating in no activities) to six (participating in all the activities listed). I It is extremely difficult to represent one's habitus, or worldview, in a single variable, or even a large set of variables. However, one component of habitus is one's beliefs about the future. McClelland (1990) operationalized habitus as students' occupational aspirations, particularly whether or not they aspired to upper-white-collar jobs. I do the same here, with the dummy variable students' expectations representing whether or not the student said that he or she expected to have one of the following occupations at age 30: professional, managerial, or business; business owner; or science or engineering.l1\nThe variable SES is a composite measure developed by NELS, using data from the parent's questionnaire (or, if missing, from the student's questionnaire), incorporating mother's and father's educational levels, mother's and father's occupations, and family income. For ability, the standardized scores from the cognitive tests in mathematics, reading, science, and history that were given to the baseyear students were averaged. The variable GPA (grade point average) is an average of the self-reported grades for each student in English, mathematics, science, and social studies on a scale from .5 (mostly below D) to 4 (mostly A's), thus approximating the standard 0-4.0 GPA system that many schools use. Students were asked to report their grades from the sixth grade until the time of the survey. Table 2 shows the cultural participation levels of the boys and girls in general and by SES. Overall, the girls outnumbered the boys in every activity, with differences as great as 30 percentage points (dance lessons) and as small as 1 percentage point (art lessons). For both the boys and girls, the most popular activity was going to the library for nonschool-related reading: 80 percent of the boys and 85 percent of the girls did this activity. Going to concerts and art museums were the next most popular activities for both the boys and the girls. It appears, then, that onetime activities were more popular than lessons, which involve more of a time commitment. Nevertheless, more than a third of the girls took music or dance lessons, and 47 percent of them took at least one kind of lesson. The male students were much less likely to participate in these activities, with only 25 percent taking any kind of lesson. Cultural Capital, Gender, and School Success 51 The patterns are slightly different when SES is taken into consideration. In this case, low-SES students were defined as those in the bottom quartile, and high-SES students were those in the top quartile. (As a point of reference, in the lowest SES quartile, the median years of father's education were 12, and the median family income was $17,500; in the highest SES quartile, the median years of father's education were 18, and the median family income was $62,500).13 In the low-SES group, the male-female differences were not as large as they were for eighth graders overall. Indeed, for two activities (art lessons and visiting art museums), the level of male and female participation was nearly equal. The largest gap between male and female participation occurred for two activities-dance lessons and attending concerts-both of which had a 12 percentage point difference."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cultural Participation and Occupational Expectations", "text": "As was true for all eighth graders, the low-SES students participated in onetime activities more frequently than in lessons, with 11 percent of the boys and 22 percent of the girls participating in any type of lesson.\nIn the highest SES quartile, there was a striking gap in the number of boys versus girls who took dance lessons: 55 percent of the girls but only 7 percent of the boys. There was also a sizable gap between boys and girls who took music lessons. Seventy-five percent of the girls, compared to 45 percent of the boys, took any type of lesson.\nThere was also a gender difference for overall, aggregate levels of cultural participation. For the eighth graders as a whole, the male students were more likely to participate in 0, 1, or 2 activities, while the female students were more likely to participate in 3 or more activities. The average number of activities for the boys and girls were 1.94 and 2.52, respectively. In the low-SES group, the girls were still more likely than the boys to participate in more activities, but the difference was not as strong; the average number of activities for the boys and girls were 1.36 and 1.72, respectively. In the high-SES group, the gap was bigger, with the girls, on average, participating in 3.45 activities, and the boys participating in 2.63. The high-SES girls (8 percent) were also more likely than the high-SES boys (2 percent) to participate in all six activities.\nIn comparing the high-SES and low-SES groups, it is clear that the SES gap was greater than the gender gap for cultural participation. For example, high-SES boys and girls were more than twice as likely to visit art museums than were their low-SES counterparts. Within the SES groups, however, the difference between boys' and girls' art museum attendance was 0 percentage points for low-SES students and 8 percentage points for high-SES students. Even going to the public library, the most popular activity for all students, was far less likely to occur for low-SES students than for high-SES students.\nFrom Table 2 , one can conclude that rates of cultural participation vary by gender as well as by SES.14 Girls and high-SES children were both more likely to participate in each of the activities taken singly and had higher aggregate rates of participation. In asking why SES is so important, one must consider the role that parents play in a child's cultural participation.15 In many cases, it is the parents who hold the key to children's cultural participation by paying for lessons; providing transportation to and from classes; or, as Bourdieu (1984) argued, by demonstrating an interest in culture to the children at home. This is particularly the case for the children in this study, who were only in the eighth grade and unable to drive to classes or cultural places. Since these activities all take place outside the structured school system, parents need to take the initiative. That is, they need to be aware of the potential activities available, be willing and able to pay for these activities, and make the time commitment necessary to maintain such long-standing cultural training. All these circumstances are more likely to occur in high-SES families.\nCompared to finding reasons for SES differences in cultural participation, however, it is harder to explain why males and females with the same amount of economic resources would participate at such different levels. It may be that parents, who have been socialized to believe that certain activities are more appropriate for one gender than the other, encourage their daughters to participate in cultural activities but do not put the same pressure on their sons; this argument is similar to the one made by DiMaggio (1982) on the basis of his findings with the Project Talent data. As Mohr and DiMaggio (1995) contended, it is most often the mother who passes down cultural education to her children; if the mother has been socialized to believe that cultural activities are in the female sphere, she may be more inclined to teach her daughter, not her son. Furthermore, a number of researchers (see, e.g., Sadker and Sadker 1994; Thorne 1993) have found that despite the women's movement, strong gender stereotypes still exist among children and pervade the school environment. Particularly during puberty and early young adulthood, males may have a heightened sensitivity to maintaining gender boundaries and a fear of getting involved in anything that would be considered feminine. The extremely low proportion of male students in this study who took dance lessons provides some evidence for this speculation.\nOn the other hand, participation in sports, a more traditionally masculine activity, is held in high regard by male students; Sadker and Sadker (1994) found that middle school boys' sports were the most prestigious school-sponsored activity. In the present sample of eighth graders, 53 percent of the boys participated in school varsity sports (defined as sports played against teams from other schools), 46 percent of the boys participated in intramural sports (defined as sports played against a team in the same school), and 46 percent of the boys participated in non-school team sports, indicating that sports activities are 54 Dumais more popular than all cultural activities except going to the library and to concerts. Conversely, 44 percent of the girls participated in varsity sports, 39 percent of the girls participated in intramural sports, and 33 percent of the girls participated in non-school team sports, indicating that the girls were just as likely to play sports as they were to take music or dance lessons and more likely to play sports than to take art lessons. As others have documented (Lorber 1994; Thorne 1993), the stigma of being called a \"tomboy\" is not as strong as that of being called a \"sissy.\"\nAre these SES and gender differences as strong when a component of students' habitus-aspirations for a white-collar job-is considered? Table 3 shows that a larger percentage of the girls (47 percent) than the boys (35 percent) overall aspired to whitecollar jobs and that the difference was particularly striking within the lowest SES quartile, where only 20 percent of the boys and 36 percent of the girls had upper-white-collar occupational aspirations. The gender gap was not as large within the highest SES quartile, where 56 percent of the boys and 59 percent of girls had such aspirations. As was true for the rates of cultural participation, it appears that differences in SES have a stronger impact than do differences between boys and girls, but that gender differences are still present. "}, {"section_title": "Although the finding regarding SES differences in aspirations is", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cultural Participation, Gender, and Grades", "text": "In the previous section, I reported that cultural participation and habitus vary by gender and SES in interpretable ways. In this section, I test whether arts participation is a form of capital that gives students educational advantages and whether these advantages vary by gender. In addition, I test whether one component of habitus-students' beliefs about their ability to obtain prestigious jobs-has an effect on their grades. Bourdieu (1973) contended that the school system rewards students who have cultural capital; the ultimate reward is in the form of educational credentials (institutionalized cultural capital), but along the way, students with higher cultural capital receive better grades and more attention and feedback. Following DiMaggio's (1982) argument that teachers favor students with more cultural capital and thus give them higher grades, the dependent variable in the following analyses was the students' GPAs.16 It is true that girls in every SES group have higher GPAs than do boys and that students in the higher SES group have higher GPAs than those in the lower group. The question is, How much of this difference is due to cultural capital and of four tests in reading, math,  history, and science) , and the number of cultural activities were used. Robust standard errors were used to adjust for the clustering of students within schools (Huber 1967) , and, as mentioned earlier, a sample weight was used. Table 4 shows the results of the ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions on GPA for boys and girls.18 In the first model, control variables that have been used in previous studies of cultural capital (DiMaggio 1982; Katsillis and Rubinson 1990)-SES and ability-were run alone. One sees that ability is an important factor for the grades of both boys and girls; it is three times larger than SES for boys and more than five times larger than SES for girls. Clearly, ability has a strong association with students' grades. In Model 2, the cultural capital variable was included along with SES and ability. While cultural capital is significant for boys, it is only about one-fifth the size of the SES coefficient. Ability remains the strongest of the independent variables, at more than 10 times the size of the cultural capital variable. These results are different from those of DiMaggio (1982), who found that the cultural capital variable had an effect of the same order of magnitude as ability. The result for girls in Model 2 differs from the regression that was run for boys. Although the cultural capital coefficient is small in comparison to ability (only about one-ninth the size), it is relatively similar in size to SES, and it is still statistically significant.19\nIn Model 3, the habitus variable, reflecting whether a student had high occupational aspirations, was added. For boys, the cultural capital variable is reduced even further and rendered insignificant. For girls, the result is quite different from the one for boys: While ability is certainly the largest of the variables (nearly 13 times as large as cultural capital), cultural capital continues to have a separate association with students' grades and one that is almost the same size as SES.20 The variable that represents a component of the students' habitus-the desire for an upperwhite-collar profession-also has a positive and significant effect, second only to ability.\nModel 3 is presented in the next column with metric coefficients. As can be seen, if a male student has high occupational aspirations, his GPA increases by .196 points. Having a habitus that foresees success in a career in one's future is clearly influential on one's grades. In contrast, if a male student participates in a cultural activity, his GPA increases by only .013 points, an insignificant amount. Overall, then, for boys, no isolated cultural capital effect on grades was found after controlling for SES, ability, and the desire for an upper-white-collar profession.\nFor girls, the metric coefficient for cultural capital is .028. This means that for each additional cultural activity a student participates in, her GPA will increase by .03. Despite the statistical significance of the result, this is actually not a particularly large increase. For a student's grade to change from a B to a B+, for example, a change in GPA of .3, or 10 times that of the effect of cultural capital, would be needed. In other words, despite the appearance of a cultural capital effect for female students, the actual change in grades is minimal, and to make the claim that cultural capital is critical for academic success would certainly be an overstatement. As is mentioned in note 17, although the models in Table 4 indicate that cultural capital has an effect on female students'-but not on male students'-grades, I cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the effects of cultural capital on grades for male and female students.\nClearly, the more significant relationship for both boys and girls is between habitus (in the form of occupational expectations) and grades; regardless of gender, high expectations lead to higher grades. A student's expectations are developed from what he or she has experienced in the past and believes is likely to happen for people from his or her particular background. For girls, a student's disposition or attitude about whether she will have a professional job outweighs whether she participates in cultural activities. For boys, although participating in cultural activities does not appear to have an effect on grades, "}, {"section_title": "Fixed-Effects Models", "text": "The results of the OLS regressions should be interpreted with caution. For example, the regressions did not control for the availability of cultural resources by urban or rural area, nor did they account for other differences between schools. Some schools may grade more easily than others, and mean SES varies by school. Many studies on the effect of cultural capital on schooling have failed to take account of these differences (DiMaggio 1982) or have controlled for only a few of the variables that may be different across schools (Roscigno and Ainsworth-Darnell 1999). It is important to control for school-level variables. For example, although an SES variable is included in the OLS regression, this variable controls only for the SES of the student, not that of the school. Schools from higher SES regions may be more competitive than schools from lower SES regions and may thus have higher grading standards; this difference is ignored in the standard OLS regression because a school-level SES variable is omitted. Because within-school SES is heterogeneous, an individual's SES may not adequately measure schoollevel SES. To account for these variations across schools, then, a fixed-effects model is used to rule out school-level differences (for an explanation of fixed-effect equations, see Aaronson 1998; Greene 2000). The results of these models control for differences between schools, such as region, SES, and the percentage of minority students. Table 5 presents the results  for boys and girls.21 In Model 1, the patterns are the same for both boys and girls as in the OLS models, although the coefficients are slightly larger than the coefficients from the OLS models. In Model 2, when cultural capital is introduced, it is about one-seventeenth of the size of ability for boys and one-seventh the size of ability for girls. For both boys and girls, cultural capital, ability, and SES all have a positive impact on students' grades. In Model 3 for boys, cultural capital has a significant effect even when SES, ability, and students' expectations are controlled for. This finding contrasts with that for the OLS model, in which the cultural capital variable was not significant. Therefore, after controlling for schoollevel differences, cultural capital does have an impact on male students' grades. Still, it should be noted that the level of significance for cultural capital is not as high as it is for the other variables and that the cultural capital coefficient is actually not that much larger than it was in the OLS models, where it was not significant. For girls, the cultural capital variable is larger than it was in the OLS model and much larger than the coefficient in the male regressions. SES is larger relative to cultural capital than it was in the OLS model, and the coefficient for students' occupational expectations is slightly smaller than it was in the OLS model. Interpreting the metric coefficients for Model 3, one sees that even participating in all the cultural activities would not raise a male student's GPA by a full grade. According to the metric coefficients for girls, the actual effect of cultural capital is also not that large; a female student's grade would not benefit enormously from participating in an additional cultural activity. A combination of high expectations (habitus) and high cultural participation, however, would have an impact on students' grades.\nThere are two additional items that should be noted. First, the variable for habitus-students' occupational expectations-remains at about the same strength as it did in the OLS regression, indicating that one's habitus continues to be an important factor in determining one's GPA. Second, the SES variable is larger in fixed-effects Model 3 than it was in OLS Model 3. In other words, after controlling for school-level SES, one's personal SES is extremely important for influencing one's grades, with lower-SES students being at a disadvantage. When between-school differences are controlled, then, the result for cultural participation is significant for boys, but not to the degree to which it is significant for girls; furthermore, the difference in the effect that cultural capital has on boys and girls is statistically significant. Looking both between and across all schools, however, one sees that the benefit of cultural capital for boys does not exist, as shown in the OLS models. Habitus matters for both genders, and the effect is in the same direction for both boys and girls: Having high occupational expectations contributes to a student's receiving higher grades.\nWhile cultural participation may not be all that beneficial to male students' grades, there may be other activities that have a positive effect. As was mentioned earlier, many male students participate in sports, which are seen as more socially acceptable than cultural activities. Researchers have argued that sports are associated with boys' academic success (Coleman 1961; Rehberg and Schaefer 1968) . Indeed, one could argue that many of the skills that one acquires from taking cultural lessons (being disciplined, managing both schoolwork and outside activities) could also be obtained from participating in sports. Therefore, a set of analyses was run to see if within boys' and girls' educational fields, participation in sports serves as a form of capital that helps students achieve higher grades. Table 6 shows the results for both the OLS and fixed-effects models, with a dummy variable for whether the student participates in any sports activities (including intramural, school varsity, and team sports outside school).\nThe results show that participation in sports has a positive and significant effect on the grades of both male and female students, both with and without controlling for between-school effects. For girls, cultural capital continues to have a strong impact, but participation in sports is also significant. For boys, participation in sports is clearly more important than is cultural participation, but cultural capital still has a weak effect. For both boys and girls, aspiring to an upper-whitecollar job-the measure for habitus used here-remains significant."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Cultural capital does affect educational outcomes, but in a limited way. Other variablesincluding habitus-are more important to grades than is cultural capital, which even at its strongest will not raise a student's grade noticeably. Inherent ability is the dominant factor in influencing a student's grades, followed by a student's habitus and socioeconomic background. Cultural capital plays a lesser role overall and, at times, plays no role for boys.\nAn examination of cultural participation rates showed that while SES affects participation more than gender, the gender differences are still sizable. Girls receive better returns to their cultural participation than do boys, but it is far from obvious why this dif- Following this gender-socialization reasoning, it may be that male students who do have cultural capital downplay it or disguise it, for fear of being seen as \"sissies.\" In other words, within their field, their cultural capital may actually be a liability in the eyes of their peers or teachers, discouraging boys from translating their cultural knowledge skills into success in the classroom. Another explanation for the difference could lie in the female students, rather than the male students. A number of studies (see Sadker and Sadker 1994 for a review of the literature) have found that teachers tend to pay more attention to male students than to female students and that male students are more vocal Bourdieu (1984) and DiMaggio (1982) argued that the main benefit of cultural capital for females is the greater ability to attract successful husbands, the roles of women in American society have changed greatly since the 1960s, when both researchers' data sets were collected. Since women are in the labor market for longer periods and in better occupational positions than they were 40 years ago, they may need to invest more at the beginning to reach a level of success that is comparable to that of men. Thus, men may not need cultural capital to succeed (and it may even be seen in a negative light because of its \"effeminate\" nature) in the educational and occupational markets, but for women, it may be a factor that gives them an edge over the competition, making them more confident and noticeable to teachers. This argument is in line with the findings of DiMaggio's study (1982) , in which cultural capital within the higher SES group had more of a positive impact on grades for female students than for male students. That is, high-SES males, who, by their position in the class structure, are the most likely to be educationally and occupationally successful, do not need cultural capital as much as do females in the same class position. Persell, Catsambis, and Cookson (1992) also contended that it is necessary for women to have both more of the same assets that men have and additional assets that men lack to reach the same level of attainment as men.\nThese perceptions about the opportunity structure and what is necessary to succeed are all part of one's habitus. With regard to opportunities for different gender and racial groups, Baker and Perkins Jones (1993:92) stated:\"One type of performance will add more to some individuals' life chances and less to others.\" In other words, women may have a habitus that has been structured by society in such a way that they believe that educational and occupational success are possible, but it is also true that they will encounter obstacles as they proceed. Parents of female students may realize that their daughters will have to put in more effort than males to secure the same positions. Acquiring and using cultural capital may be seen as a necessary step along the way to help overcome some of the obstacles that being female poses.22\nFinally, it may well be that the typical cultural capital variable that has been used in the sociology of education needs to be reevaluated. Perhaps participation in cultural activities is not an adequate or appropriate measure of cultural capital in modern American society. The gender differences found here would imply that, at the least, researchers need to consider some different and more complex components of cultural capital than simple exposure to high culture. The work of Lareau (1987 Lareau ( , 1989 ) is a good starting point for other ways of conceptualizing cultural capital.\nBecause neither DiMaggio (1982) nor Aschaffenberg and Maas (1997) included a variable for habitus in their analyses, the results found here may not be directly comparable to the results of their studies. In addition, while DiMaggio's (1982) dependent variable, like the dependent variable here, was grades, Aschaffenberg and Maas (1997) used educational transitions as their dependent variable, making a comparison with their study more difficult. It is also somewhat difficult to compare studies when, as was mentioned previously, each study seems to have used a different set of variables that were labeled cultural capital. Furthermore, in restricting the sample to white students to focus on gender differences, I did not address racial differences.\nIt should be noted that the role of habitus may not be as clear-cut as was presented here; it is difficult to determine whether students develop a belief that they can obtain a prestigious occupation because they are already doing well in school, or if the belief is what motivates them to strive for good grades. This study is really a first attempt to operationalize the concept of habitus alongside the concept of cultural capital.23 There are certainly many other factors that constitute a student's habitus than occupational expectations, and judging from the significance that this one small part of habitus has on grades, it will be important to develop measures for these other factors in future research.\nThere are several other directions for future research. It would be helpful to have data for siblings, so that cultural activity levels could be compared for boys and girls in the same family. Also, as was stated earlier, the interaction of gender and race has not yet been studied in relation to cultural capital and schooling. Furthermore, data need to be collected that will allow researchers to distinguish between Bourdieu's concept of habitus as disposition and expectations for the future and the more conventional status attainment (Sewell, Haller, and Portes 1969) and rationalchoice concepts of expectations.\nIt is clear that we researchers must be more careful in using and operationalizing the term cultural capital and more willing to consider the inclusion of habitus in our models. In the United States, cultural activities do not seem to affect all students the same way, leading to the reproduction of society. As much as there is a class dynamic at work in social reproduction, there is also a gender dynamic, in which boys are expected to behave one way and girls another. By their very presence, such complex effects render simplistic cultural capital explanations less powerful. Future research must take account of the other components of Bourdieu's framework-habitus and field-to test more accurately the presence and effect of cultural capital for different groups in the American school system. than such courses as science or math) as the dependent variable. The results were extremely similar to those in which GPA is the dependent variable; cultural capital had a significant effect for girls in the final model, but not for boys.\n19. DiMaggio (1982) included a variable for ability (the score on a vocabulary achievement test) in his models. Katsillis and Rubinson (1990) included a measure for previous achievement in their model of cultural capital's effects on GPA and found that even when previous achievement is dropped from the model, cultural capital does not have a significant effect. However, one could argue that the ability variable is, in part, cultural capital that has been accumulated in the past and converted into cognitive ability. When the ability variable is left out of the final model here, the variables for SES, cultural capital, and habitus are all significant at the .001 level for both boys and girls; however, the R-squared for the model drops to .167 for boys and .158 for girls.\n20. This finding is quite striking, considering that the measurement error for the cultural capital variable would be expected to be larger than that for SES (and thus it would be less likely for cultural capital to appear as a significant variable).\n21. Again, a pooled regression was also run for both sexes together, with a dummy variable for female and variables for the interaction of female and SES, cultural capital, and so forth. In this case, all the variables in the model, including female*cultural capital and female*occupational expectations, were significant, indicating that after school effects are controlled, there are real gender differences in the effects of cultural capital and habitus on grades.\n22. On the other hand, it may be that parents find it easier to convince their daughters to participate in cultural activities and take long-term lessons than to convince their sons. Further research is necessary to determine the roles of gender socialization versus opportunities in the social structure in relation to gender and cultural activities.\n23. Although McClelland (1990) operationalized habitus, she did not do so in the context of Bourdieu's broader framework, with the notions of cultural capital and field."}]
