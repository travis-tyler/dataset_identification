[{"section_title": "", "text": "A s the goals of agriculture are to feed, clothe, and shelter us, agriculture encom passes a wide array of disciplines and inter ests. Academic disciplines include agronomy (crops), animal science, economics, engineer ing, entomology (insects), environmental sci ence, food science, forestry, horticulture, me teorology, plant pathology, and veterinary science. Interests may range from the econom ics or biology of farming to concerns about soil conservation, food safety, and the weather. Those interested in agricultural topics may be farmers, consumers, home gardeners, research scientists, or economists. Although this review of agricultural resources must be cursory, many \"virtual library\" indexes to agricultural resources have been created which focus on agricultural topics. In addition, searching the Internet for information has become much easier with the advent o f search engines such as AltaVista (http://altavista.digital.com/). (For a listing of other Internet search engines see: http:// th o rp lu s.lib .p u rd u e.e d u / in et_ reso u rce s/ index.html#search.) But a word to the wise: when searching for agricultural information, look for information from government or uni versity-maintained resources, as these will be more reputable. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and its affiliates, and the many schools of agriculture around the world have made available a wealth o f agricultural information on the Internet."}, {"section_title": "G overnm ent sites", "text": "\u2022 USDA.
