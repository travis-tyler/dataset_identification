Following the 1973 oil crisis, Brazil responded by promoting ethanol production through their Pro\u00e1lcool program, which was focused on phasing out fossil fuel use in support of ethanol from sugarcane. The success of this program led many other developed countries to undertake similar policy in the twenty first century. Policies implemented around the world have led to substantial biofuel production and have been warranted by beliefs that such policies will provide energy independence, a reduction in greenhouse gases, and provide income for farmers (Langeveld, et al., 2014). Examples of these policies are those in the European Union, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Focus on agricultural development has always been a top priority in the European Union and its ethanol policy goes hand and hand with this. The EU put policy into effect in 2005 that would change the use of fossil fuels in the transportation industry to the use of biofuels and was focused on a desire to cut emissions while also finding use for their surplus of agricultural land. EU policy puts the focus of production across the EU on wheat and rapeseed biofuels with the future looking at sugar beets, both for the production of biogas and cellulosic biofuels (Langeveld, et al., 2014). Similar focus follows biofuel production in Indonesia and Malaysia. Agricultural development has become a top priority in both countries as a way to combat high poverty rates and issues with malnutrition. In the past few years, Malaysia has seen more significant development in this area and an increase in education than Indonesia, but both 2 are taking steps in this direction by supporting farmers through biofuel policy. Malaysia and Indonesia are both large producers of palm oil and use it in their modest production of biodiesel. Indonesia's policy was established in 2006, but this policy was altered as palm oil replaced soybean oil as the highest consumed vegetable oil and palm oil prices became too volatile. Malaysia enacted biodiesel policy in 2006 and increased requirements for blending in 2008, but these mandates were also delayed because of the increasing demand for palm oil. (Langeveld, Dixon, and van Keulen, 2014). Until the end of the year 2012, corn-ethanol production in the United States was subsidized at 45 cents per gallon produced under the idea that, as a gasoline additive, ethanol would aid in the reduction of greenhouse gases through a reduction in carbon emissions while supporting energy independence to the United States. There was a desire to find a new source of fuel that did not depend on foreign producers and to usher in a new wave of biofuels to move America's energy needs into the 21st century. Ethanol has been promoted in the United States as a cleaner and locally produced alternative to petroleum. This was driven by a belief that an acceptance of corn-ethanol would promote the development of other biofuels that would be more practical and cleaner in the long run. It is believed that corn-ethanol has become of extreme importance to the U.S. as it is seen as an instrument to achieve energy independence. The U.S. was subject to the pressures of energy security for the first time in 1973, when Arab countries that supplied oil to the United States protested the U.S. military support of Israel, causing an oil crisis. Since then, energy independence and security has been sought to alleviate the American energy market from outside influence while promoting price stability for consumers."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "With peak oil behind the United States and possibly behind, if not fast approaching, the rest of the world and oil prices expected to rise, oil becomes an increasingly important, but scarce transportation resource 1 . This issue is exacerbated as the United States increases its oil consumption at the same time emergent countries, like China, also rapidly increase consumption of petroleum. BP Statistical Review of World Energy (2014) reported that from 2012 to 2013 oil usage increased in the United States by 400 thousand barrels a day and in China by an additional 390 thousand barrels. This increasing demand for transportation fuels, for many reasons, creates an increased demand for biofuels like ethanol. With the increased acceptance of climate change as an established fact, governments and consumers looked for ways to decrease the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Ethanol was promoted as the desired replacement as transportation fuel source. Ethanol is also supported as a cleaner alternative to traditional fuels. The EPA argues that corn-ethanol is 21 percent more efficient than gasoline, and the American Coalition for Ethanol points to the reduction in greenhouse gases as a result of ethanol use of 38 million tonnes in 2013. The American Coalition for Ethanol (2014) also points out that this corn is being produced now in more efficient and sustainable ways. They state that farmers used less tilling and fertilizer in 2013 while producing 14 billion bushels of corn on 87.5 million acres. Corn-ethanol appears to be the alternative desired to wean consumers off of petroleum, and it is only believed to be a stepping stone to cleaner biofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol, which is touted as using plant waste material and not taking crops away from food supply. Ethanol looks like the panacea to all of the fossil fuel ails until the data is analyzed. Claims about sustainable farming in corn production do not match up with data. Although in 2010 Horowitz, Ebel, and Ueda showed that no-till farming was on the rise from 2002 into 2006, the USDA pointed out that same year that no-till farming was never as prevalent in corn production in the bulk of the Mississippi River Basin (Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) as the rest of the United States. This includes three of the four largest corn producers in the US, Iowa, Illinois, and Minnesota, with Nebraska being excluded. Since 2006, the use of conventional tillage has increased in some states, according to USDA crop production data. According to the Cappiello and Apuzzo 2013, fertilizer use was also on the rise during this time, with an additional 1 billion pounds of fertilizer being used by American farmers between 2005 and 2010 and conservative estimates putting the increase since then at an additional one billion pounds. 14 billion bushels of corn on 87.5 million acres of land is touted by the American Coalition of Ethanol as the highest average yield ever recorded, but, at 160 bushels per acre, falls short of EPA minimum estimates of 180 bushels per acre required to reach the 21 percent increase in efficiency over traditional gasoline. Part of the issue with the efficiency of ethanol is the increased use of marginal land. Since 2008, 5 million acres of conservation land was converted to farmland. Additionally, grazing pastures were also converted and virgin land, something that consists of natural prairies and something that the government did not anticipate happening, has been converted to farmland. The United States Department of 5 Agriculture estimated that in 2012 that only 38,000 acres of virgin land had been converted to fields for crops, but this does not match data that shows that since 2006 around 1.2 million acres of virgin land had been converted in Nebraska and South Dakota alone (Cappiello and Apuzzo, 2013). In 2013, Cappiello and Apuzzo pointed out that these marginal lands require higher fertilizer use to increase yields, but the conversion of virgin land into farmland also comes with the release of carbon from the ground into the atmosphere. Claims of the decrease in greenhouse gases associated with ethanol also do not seem to match reports. In 2008, Searchinger et al. showed that in 30 years use of traditional corn-ethanol would produce twice as many greenhouse gases as traditional gasoline and, that same year, Fargione, Hill, Tilman, Polasky, and Hawthorne showed that an increase in clearing of forests and grasslands in Latin America and South Pacific Asia for biofuels would actually lead to a net increase in greenhouse gases. Mandates and subsidies create additional demands for crops, which raises prices (Headey, Malaiyandi, and Fan, 2009). As a result, Kim, Sohngen, Golub, Hertel, and Rose showed in 2010 that the increase in demand would encourage land conversion, and European and U.S. biofuel mandates would be responsible for the loss of 23 -26 million hectares of forestland globally in the next 30 years, which would cause the release of an additional 1.2 -1.6 billion tons of CO2 when compared to 2010 levels. The increased use of fertilizer also contributes to the release of greenhouse gases, as nitrogen used as fertilizer has been linked to the release of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas. Corn-ethanol is 6 believed to be ushering in an era of new and cleaner biofuels, but the biofuel it is transitioning toward, cellulosic ethanol, is not sustainable. Ikerd (2010) pointed out that creating biofuels from biomass and agricultural waste deprives decomposers in the soil of potential food they use to provide nutrients to crops, and that replacing 10% of the United States' fossil fuels with biofuels would deprive these microorganisms of 75% of waste energy available. Perennial grasses are better for wildlife than corn, but these grasses are not as suitable as land use prior to biofuel introduction (National Research Council, 2010). Even the goal of energy independence may mean less than it is proposed to mean. In a 2015 interview with Big Think, Summers stated that while Japan and Europe are dependent on the Middle East for oil it is unlikely that a drastic price difference between oil in Japan and Europe and the United States would ever arise 2 . This means that even if the United States were no longer a net importer of oil, they would still be vulnerable to global oil prices and could not be described as energy independent. The fact that ethanol is proving to not live up to promises of being cleaner and more efficient than traditional gasoline creates a desire to find an alternative that can make those promises while also displacing consumption of fossil fuels. When looking for an alternative to ethanol the desire is to find a way to promote sustainable farming, while still displacing fossil fuels and reducing emissions. The focus on sustainable farming practices is based on a desire to reduce the amount of fertilizer, pesticide, and herbicide used. Decreasing the demand for farm chemicals directly reduces greenhouse gas emissions and pollution by decreasing fuel use in shipment and production of the chemicals, diesel use in application, and runoff in waterways linked to the Dead Zone in the Gulf of Mexico and local pollution of water resources. The objective of sustainable farming is to maintain high productivity with fewer chemical inputs. The issue becomes whether or not these farming practices exist and, if they exist, why they are not widely accepted. The objective of this thesis is to assess how much ethanol was used in 2013 after the implementation of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and its expansion of the corn ethanol subsidy and how this energy replacement compares to the energy savings that could be made by combining a number of alternative farming practices before the implementation of the policy. It is important to look at a number of alternative farming practices in major corn ethanol producing states to get an idea of how large the potential energy savings could be. It is also important to compare the implementation of sustainable farming practices to the subsidization of corn ethanol, which was implemented to promote clean air and energy independence, to show how alternative practices can be used to solve these problems. By looking at farming practices in the four largest corn producing states -Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska and Minnesota -from 2003 to 2007, this research shows that the implementation of sustainable farming practices displaces more energy in these states than currently being replaced by ethanol. This is a particularly significant result, because, according to the US Energy Information Administration (2014), Illinois is the sixth largest consumer of ethanol in the United States, Iowa is the fifth largest consumer of energy per capita, and Nebraska is the seventh largest consumer of energy per capita. Through the elimination, rather than the displacement, of these nonrenewable energy sources reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will be evident. The methods the empirical section of this thesis will focus on will be the implementation of a three crop rotation, no-till farming, and fertilizer banding, as looked at by Johanns, Chase, and Liebman (2012). These methods will be compared to the crop rotation, tilling practices, and average fertilizer use in these four states to show the change in consumption that can occur through an alteration in practices. Chapter 2 discusses the background of the expansion of the subsidization of cornethanol through the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and includes a review of existing studies that measure the impact of this subsidization. This chapter considers the stipulations surrounding the efficiencies of ethanol as an alternative fuel source and outlines how ethanol fails to meet these efficiencies. Chapter 3 presents empirical analysis showing the benefits of sustainable farming practices compared to current farming practices used in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska and Minnesota. These energy savings will be compared to the energy replacement by ethanol while also looking at the additional environmental benefits of sustainable farming. Chapter 4 will outline the issues surrounding policy and what needs to be looked into to usher in an area of sustainable farming in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska and Minnesota. This chapter makes a comparison between these policies and current policies in the United States that extend outside these four states and that either explicitly promote sustainable farming or similar ecological benefits as these sustainable farming practices. Chapter 5 concludes by summarizing the information from the previous chapters to explain why sustainable 9 farming is a better option to both conserve more energy than, and achieve the environmental goals of, corn-ethanol subsidization the EPA understood that a law that would mean billions of gallons of ethanol being blended with gasoline would also mean that the demand for corn would increase and cause the number of acres plowed to also increase, and there was also the fact that congress had ruled that there would be an exemption granted to the already existing ethanol plants that used coal and natural gas in their production processes, so these were taken into account when they calculated how efficient corn-ethanol could be. It turned out that it was only 16 percent more efficient than gasoline, but law required it to be at least 20 percent more efficient. With ethanol producers being exempted by congress, there needed to be other changes in the assumptions about what the future of corn production would hold to make ethanol much greener than gasoline (Cappiello and Apuzzo, 2013). Plowing new farm land releases carbon dioxide trapped underground into the atmosphere, so the more land that is plowed to meet growing demand the worse the environmental impact of ethanol. Cappiello and Apuzzo (2013) report that when the EPA originally looked at their estimates for corn production they were estimating that yields would be around 180 bushels per acre by the year 2022, but many agricultural producers thought that these predictions were too low for where genetically modified corn would lead yields. These organizations worked with the EPA to display how modified seeds would increase the yields per acre and the EPA increased their final estimate to include average yields of 230 bushels per acre in 2022 at a price of $3.22 per bushel, pushing the benefit of corn-ethanol as being 21 percent more efficient than gasoline (Cappiello and Apuzzo, 2013). Now, over five years after these numbers were calculated, with yields holding steady around the previous average yield of 150 bushels per acre and corn prices rising to $7 per bushel in 2013, it is completely apparent that these numbers are not supported by the current situation of corn production, but what makes the numbers so far off from the estimate? The underperformance of yields can be attributed to two factors, an underestimation of how many acres of conservation land would be converted to farmland and an underestimation of how many farmers would see a yield penalty by continuously planting corn. With both of these factors increasing the need for fertilizers and pesticides, which use of has increased dramatically in the last two year, for farmers to see higher yields, Cappiello and Apuzzo (2013) found that farmers in the United States have increased their fertilizer use from 2005 to 2010 by 1 billion pounds with conservative estimates putting the increase since then at another 1 billion pounds; an increase in the use of fertilizers which has large environmental costs."}, {"section_title": "Negative Environmental Externalities", "text": "When fertilizers are sprayed onto crops not all of it is used by plants as nitrogen rich food as some of it gets washed away into local water ways, and as farmers plant more acres of corn, using every inch of land they can to plant, corn is being planted closer to creeks and rivers with huge environmental consequences from fertilizer run off. This is also true for pesticides, which have seen an increase in use as rootworm becomes more of a concern for farmers' crops. Nitrogen fertilizer in a drinking supply can be poisonous, and the same goes with pesticides. Scientist Deepanjan Majumdar (2003) at India's National Environmental Engineering Research Institute showed a link between nitrate and pesticide contamination of drinkable water sources and the occurrence of a type of methaemoglobinaemia in babies that decreases their bloods' ability to carry oxygen and is often fatal. In 2013, the Des Moines Water Works saw an increase in nitrate levels in both rivers supplying drinking water to the city of Des Moines, Iowa, as the drought caused fertilizer to sit at ground level and be washed away into waterways when rains finally came. The increase of nitrate levels in both the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were both so large that the Water Works had to run machines to clean water supplies 24 hours a day. In Minnesota, the state government found that a decrease in the nitrate levels in the water would cost the state around $1 billion (Cappiello and Apuzzo, 2013). In the EPA's 2004 National Water Quality Inventory, agricultural activity was cited as one of the main contributors to waterway pollution and 44% of rivers and streams, 64% of lakes, and 30% of estuaries surveyed received their lowest grade of \"impaired.\" Some of the filtration of the nitrates in waterways is done by bacteria natural occurring in the rivers and streams themselves, but this clearly is not enough. Hall et al. (2009) looked into how much nitrate was taken up by waterways in 2008, and they found at that time that the ability of waterways to filter out nitrates from fertilizers was decreasing, with only 16% of the nitrate being filtered out natural by bacteria. Donner and Kucharik (2008), at the University of British Columbia and the University of Wisconsin, respectively, predict that with this decrease in the effectiveness of filtration of our nations waterways could lead to a 34 percent increase in the level of nitrogen pollution in the Mississippi River by 2022, and this will have a devastating ecological impact on an area of the Gulf of Mexico known as the \"dead zone.\" The dead zone is an area in the Gulf that is inhabitable to many aquatic animals as nitrogen rich fertilizers provide the necessary nutrients for cyanobacteria to grow at a faster than normal rate. These cyanobacteria are not a food source for many forms of aquatic animals and instead decompose in the water. These dead zones, created by the overgrowth of cyanobacteria and their decomposition, form a habitat low in oxygen and unsuitable for fish, crustaceans, and zooplankton. As a result, these animals die from a lack of oxygen in the water or are less likely to be able to reproduce. The Gulf of Mexico's dead zone, on average, has doubled every year of the past two decades. Some of the issues with agrichemicals are not as obvious or easy to measure. While agrichemicals and emissions remain a main source of fresh water pollution, the fact that many of these sources are not included in the Clean Water Act makes regulation impossible. The measurement of these nonpoint sources is difficult because damages can differ by the areas where pollution occurs. Although these sources are listed as nonpoint, they still limit the ability to achieve the goals stated by the Clean Water Act (Kling, 2011). Agricultural nutrients runoff is not the only way fresh water sources are being impacted. Increased ethanol production has led to the over pumping of aquifers, clear cutting of forests, and edge tillage 2 (Conca, 2014). While the over pumping of aquifers impacts fresh water sources directly, clear cutting and edge tillage can impact waterways through soil erosion. Edge tillage goes against research that has shown the benefits of prairie buffer zones. The conversion of 10% of fields to prairie can conserve 95% of the sediment that ends up in water ways as a result of soil erosion (as cited in Eller, 2014a). Prairie strips would take less than an acre away from farmland from crop production in 71% of the 11% of Iowa farms it is recommended on (as cited in C. Doering, 2015). The sediment from soil erosion reduces the depth of waterways, which directly impacts aquatic life. Soil erosion also increases the cost of water treatment while damaging bridges, roads, railways, and other buildings. In 1995 the estimated cost of these damages was $8 billion (Pimentel et al., 1995). Water quality is also impacted through ethanol production. Ethanol production requires large quantities of water for biochemical and thermochemical conversions. This becomes an issue in water strained regions as ethanol production is expected to remain regional into the future (National Research Council, 2010). These impacts on water are not the only negative externalities of an increase in the production of ethanol; air quality is also being impacted. Kristie Boering, a chemistry professor at UC Berkeley, with the aid of researchers around the world, showed, without a doubt, that the increasing use of fertilizers since the 1940s has caused an increase in nitrous oxide in the atmosphere, a gas that is considered to be part of the group of greenhouse gases causing global warming and destroying the ozone layer. Boering and her colleagues analyzed data to find a common link between a nitrogen isotope in fertilizer and nitrous oxide in the air. Nitrous oxide is a byproduct of fertilizer use as the microbes in soil convert nitrogen into nitrous oxide (as cited in Sanders, 2012). The nitrous oxide released from the production of crops that rely extensively on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers negates any benefits of replacing fossil fuels (Crutzen, Mosier, Smith, and Winiwarter, 2008). The greenhouse gas emissions are not just linked to the use of them on fields, though. The production of nitrogen fertilizers actually uses natural gas and contributes to the emissions of greenhouse gases. According to the Soil Conservation Council of Canada (2001), the production and shipment of 1 lb. of nitrogen fertilizer releases around 1.68 lbs. of CO2 into the atmosphere. Nitrogen is not the only fertilizer that leads to greenhouse gas emissions, and, looking at all fertilizers, A. Lapp\u00e9 (2010) estimates that the production and distribution of fertilizers makes up 1.5% to 2% of the total global warming effect of emissions. The application of fertilizer on crops is a large consumer of energy as well. Johanns, Chase, and Liebman's 2012 research into crop rotation mentioned earlier also delved into energy use for different crop rotations. They showed that the energy use for corn in a two crop cycle was 5.83 million BTU with 61% of the energy use coming from fertilizer use, whereas, in 3 and 4 crop rotations, the energy use for corn was 2.45 million BTU with 17% from fertilizers and 2.63 million BTU with 25% from fertilizers, respectively. This means that, for these crops, the average consumption of fuel also increases. The two crop cycle was found to have used the energy equivalent of 25.43 gallons of diesel fuel per acre, while a three crop rotation only used 10.15 gallons per acre and a four crop rotation used 10.80 gallons per acre. Through the moving away from typical crop rotations, farmers increase their consumption of energy and the consumption of diesel fuel, the burning of which is believed to lead to an increase in greenhouse gases (Johanns, Chase, and Liebman, 2012). Data based on energy consumption associated with corn production and ethanol production has led many to question whether or not the predictions about the energy benefits of ethanol could be misreported. Patzek, at UC Berkeley, questioned the findings by others who put the energy return to ethanol between .9 and 1.5 the energy consumed in its production. Patzek noticed that in many of the calculations conducted by other researchers that there were energy costs that were not being attributed to the production of corn and ethanol. Patzek went to work trying to account for energy costs that he believed others missed, including the fuel used in the production of corn seed and fertilizers, fuel consumption from transportation, and water and waste water costs. With all of these new costs being attributed to the production of corn-ethanol, the net energy lost is 65% by the time ethanol is used as energy, making it seem like not a very green alternative to gasoline (Patzek, 2004). By comparison, the energy return on investment for oil and gas in the United States was 11:1 for domestic and 12:1 for imports in 2007 (Hall, Lambert, & Balogh, 2014). Pimentel et al. (2008) does not believe that ethanol could make an actually impact on fossil fuel consumption in the United States since the conversion of all the corn produce would only replace 7% of total oil consumption in the US. Pimentel also estimates that if all the solar energy collected by plants could be converted to fossil energy that it would only replace half of the energy used each year. If only farms and commercial forests are considered this number only is one sixth (as cited in Ikerd, 2010). In comparison, sugarcane is a better source of energy. Twice as much energy can be obtained per acre than corn, but sugarcane is not the answer either (de Gorter & Taylor, 2010). Bioenergy is an inefficient use of land, as sugarcane only turns .5% of solar radiation into sugar and only .2% of solar radiation is converted to ethanol. In Iowa, corn only turns .3% of radiation into biomass, and only .15% to ethanol. The higher energy conversion efficiencies of photovoltaic systems make them better for land use efficiency (Searchinger & Heimlich, 2015). Also, unlike gasoline, corn-ethanol can currently only be transported by trucks, trains, or barges, which also leads to the higher consumption of fuel associated with cornethanol. Corn-ethanol's highly corrosive nature means that it cannot be moved by pipelines and makes it dependent on these forms of transportation that require high consumption of fossil fuels. Ethanol's properties limit it as a large scale fuel source because of its damaging effects on steel and rubber (Jarrell, 2013). The transportation of feedstocks to, and ethanol from, processing facilities is expected to continue to stay expensive even with future technological innovations because processing facilities are expected to stay small and numerous. Increased consumption of ethanol will lead to an 20 increase in the number of processing facilities, which will each have their own externalities (National Research Council, 2010). The myriad of uses of fossil fuel in the production process, from the corn seed to the final step of putting ethanol into an automobile, has an environmental effect in this country, and the inputs into production are also damaging water and air quality at home, but what impact is corn-ethanol production having overseas? Lapp\u00e9, an earth scientist at Stanford, looked into the overseas impact of cornethanol production in the United States. Lapp\u00e9 found that with increase demand for corn, and a larger portion of corn being used for ethanol than food and cattle feedwhich two thirds of the corn grown in the United States used to go tois the cause for the increased deforestation of the rainforest in Brazil (G. Lapp\u00e9, 2011). Corn is a private good which is both rival and excludable. This means that when corn is used in the production of ethanol it can no longer be used to meet the demands for the food supply. In the year 2000, 90% of corn produced in the United States went to directly food or to feed animals and only 5% went to ethanol. In the year 2013, 40% of the United States' corn went to ethanol and 45% went to feed (Conca, 2014). This is an issue since the United States produces forty percent of the world's corn supply and, with a larger demand coming from fuel, the world's food supply must be made up elsewhere (G. Lapp\u00e9, 2011). According to Laurance et al. (2001)  percent, meaning that production needed to be made up elsewhere. The decrease in supply of soy, with the increase in price of corn, caused the price of soy, and soy fed livestock, to increase. With a decrease in supply which did not meet demand, and an increase in the price of soybeans, Brazil took up larger soybean production, but at the cost of rainforest that was chopped down, or burnt, to provide more farmland, and the destruction may be worse than originally believed. According to the Berenguer et al. 2014, much of the devastation to the rainforest associated with the removal of trees through logging and burning is larger than previously thought. Much of the destruction of the rainforest could not be captured through satellite imagery, which gave the impression that much more of the rainforest was intact. A recent team of researchers working on the issue went to Brazil and found that the issue with the impact farming is having on the rainforest is not just about deforestation, but also about degradation of the rainforest, which was not accurately measured using satellite imagery. The researchers also acknowledge that it is hard to measure degradation from the ground, and, although they believe the loss of carbon associated with degradation makes up 40% of the carbon loss associated with the destruction of the rainforest in Brazil, they currently cannot say for sure how severe the losses are (Berenguer et al., 2014 These inadequate farming practices can lead to increased erosion, with an increased loss of nutrient-rich topsoil. This increased erosion does not only make farmland less productive, but also leads to an increased amount of sediment in waterways, which makes it difficult for wildlife to flourish in the streams and rivers it is washed into. The loss of nutrients also contributes to the previously described higher demand in fertilizers and pesticides, and the increased erosion pushes more of these chemicals into waterways and allows them to soak into groundwater sources, polluting them with phosphorous, nitrogen, and pesticides (USDA National Resources Conservation Services, 2007). The increase in prices of both soybeans and corn are not only causing deforestation and degradation in the rainforest and land and water degradation in the United States, but are having other negative consequences, since, as mentioned earlier, corn is also a major contributor to the food supply."}, {"section_title": "Non-Environmental Negative Externalities", "text": "The increase in demand for corn has brought the price per bushel of corn higher than the EPA could predict. With corn hovering around $7 per bushel in 2013, the price changes have a large impact on food production in the United States and around the world, as an increase in the supply of ethanol means a decrease in the supply of corn for food. The decrease in supply of corn to the world market from the United States from an increase in demand for ethanol can be attributed to famines around the world in 2010 and 2011, in countries that saw poor crop yields of their own, and also as the cause of the 2008 commodity price spike. These factors are also attributed to the riots that were sparked in many parts of the world during this same time (G. Lapp\u00e9, 2011). This is because biofuels disproportionately impact developing areas. Meeting current or future biofuels mandates would significantly increase prices of fuel crops by 2020, which would decrease global GDP and cause a significant reduction in the food supply in developing countries (Timilsina, Beghin, van der Mensbrugghe, and Mevel, 2010). Even ushering in a second wave of ethanol from corn stover would lead to increased prices as a result of increased demand (National Research Council, 2010). Higher corn prices also have an effect on the food supply in the United States, since corn is used in many of the foods consumed in the United States and since such a large portion of the corn produced in this country goes to livestock feed. Senators Toomey and Feinstein introduced a bill in February 2015 to repeal the ethanol mandate because they believe the continuation of the mandate would lead to an increase in the price of corn and, subsequently, food (Barron-Lopez, 2015). The future of food may be in trouble without the price increase associated with ethanol production. Currently, the United States and Canada are the only major grain exporters, but this may be coming to an end. The United States is expected to cease exportation in 2025 to meet growing domestic demand. In 2006 there were 1.8 acres of land per person to grow food, with a requirement of 1.2 acres for current nutritional standards, but, with current growth rates, there will only be .6 acres per person by 2050. This situation may be exasperated by the decline in production of oil and natural gas and by ethanol mandates (Pfeiffer, 2006). The price and growing population is not the only way food is being compromised. In 2011, the Department of Agriculture approved the use of a type of corn that would produce an enzyme that would make it easier to convert the corn to ethanol. This enzyme was normally added by the ethanol plants, but there is a belief that the corn producing the enzyme itself will cut down on the energy and water consumption of ethanol plants. This sounds like a good proposal when looking at the possible energy return of ethanol described early, but this one strain of maize, according to its producer, Syngenta, could completely compromise food production. Cross pollination with corn designated for food crops can compromise the food produced with that corn. Cross pollination is not the only way food could be compromised by this new corn hybrid. Syngenta's own research showed that one kernel of this new corn amongst 10,000 kernels destined for food would compromise the food processed. This would have large economic impacts for food producers, from recalls to disruption of exports."}, {"section_title": "Corn-Ethanol as Fuel", "text": "Corn-ethanol was subsidized as fuel to help aid the U.S. in its movement toward energy independence and reduction in greenhouse gases. The American Coalition for Ethanol (2014) believes that U.S. corn-ethanol production could reduce oil imports by one third and that corn-ethanol use could reduce greenhouse gases by 35%-46%, but this data misses issues what make corn-ethanol different from petroleum as a fuel. Part of the reason corn-ethanol differs from petroleum as a fuel is because of the fact that when used to fuel motor vehicles it creates a reduction in fuel efficiency. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (2009), this drop in fuel economy for using a 10% mixture of corn-ethanol may be anywhere from three to five percent when compared with pure gasoline, and the loss in fuel efficiency associated with corn-ethanol only gets worse as the percentage of the fuel mixture that is corn-ethanol increases . The higher consumption of fuel associated with corn-ethanol is not just tied to its lower efficiency, but is also tied to corn-ethanol's corrosive nature that requires it to be transported by trucks, trains, or barges and to be more dependent on fossil fuels (Jarrell, 2013). The corrosive nature of corn-ethanol does not just change the way it is shipped, but also damages engines it is used in (Van Hoesen, 2015). Using ethanol as fuel also appears to not reduce greenhouse gas emissions when compared to fossil fuels. Wallace (2009) reports that the EPA's attorneys admitted in 1995 that ethanol would increase smog. Taylor (2009) gives evidence that while ethanol reduces carbon monoxide, it actually increases the emission of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, ethylene, and methanol, all of which have been associated 26 with increased smog in urban areas and the detrimental health effects associated with that smog. Corn-ethanol not only increases the use of fossil fuels in its production and through non-sustainable farming techniques associated with its subsidization, but it also increases the use of fossil fuels and increases greenhouse gas emissions through its main role as an alternative source of energy."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Corn-ethanol is unable to live up to the standards that allowed it to initially be subsidized. The number of environmental and non-environmental externalities associated with ethanol and its inefficiencies as a fuel source mean that it will never create energy independence for the United States and it will meet the EPA standards for efficiency as a fuel or in reducing emissions when compared to petroleum. Other methods for achieving these goals need to be considered and this leads to looking at the energy conservation possibilities of sustainable farming practices. research they found a drop in energy consumption from a 2 year to 3 and 4 year crop rotations. When considering energy consumption, the researchers did not consider storage, handling, and hauling past the original removal of the crop. The three and four year rotations also saw a change in application of fertilizers, insecticides, and herbicides through banding, which lead to a decrease in overall usage of these agrichemicals. Also, during the 3 and 4 year rotations, manure from an available livestock operation was used as a fertilizer source instead of commercial fertilizers. Even though manure was used, the manure was assessed for nutrient content to compare it to the cost of using commercially available fertilizers. Energy use was separated into five categories to assess which consumed the most energy. The five categories are the following: seed, grain drying, field operations, pesticides, and fertilizers. The researchers point out that seed looks at seed production and grain drying was separated to show how energy intensive the process can be. Field operations were fuel requirements for field operations excluding fertilizer and pesticide application, which were given their own categories. Fertilizer use was averaged over the time period to give a perspective into long term energy requirements, and the energy use in pesticides were based on active ingredient in application. Assessing these methods of farming, and the decreased agrichemical and energy use associated with them, will allow for the calculation of energy savings at a multi-state level and the comparison of these energy savings to the amount of ethanol used throughout these states in 2013. Figure 1 shows the energy usage Johanns, Chase, and Liebman (2012) observed for each rotation. It can be seen that there is a drop in energy usage from the 2 year rotation to the 3 and 4 year rotations. Figure 1 also illustrates how the energy usage was partitioned into different areas of farm practices. By looking at Figure 3.1, it becomes apparent that fertilizer application drops significantly from the 2 year rotation to the 3 and 29 4 year rotations. In the 2 year rotation, fertilizer application uses more energy than the total energy use in either the 3 year rotation or the 4 year rotation. Table 1 looks at energy use by category, taking the information in Figure 1 and showing what percentage of energy use in each rotation a category consumes. It can be seen that fertilizer use drops drastically from taking up 61% of all energy use in the 2 year rotation to only taking up 17% and 25% of energy use in the 3 year and 4 year rotations, respectively. It can also be seen that after the implementation of 3 year and 4 year rotations that field operations becomes the chief consumer of energy. equivalents in terms of gallons per acre will be used from here forward 1 . Energy usage by rotation in terms of diesel fuel equivalents can be found in Table 2. It can be seen that differences in energy use were the largest between 2 year and 3 year rotations, with energy savings equivalent to 15.27 gallons of diesel fuel per acre. Using the energy savings in 3 year rotations, an evaluation of crop rotations is the next step to find possible energy savings where corn production is the highest.   Boryan, Craig, and Willis (2008)  These numbers do not paint a clear picture of crop production in these states.\nLamberton 2012, writing in response to Davis et al. (2012), stated that actual increases in yields were 4% for corn and 9% for soybeans and the herbicide toxicity of freshwater 200 times lower in diverse cropping systems. Also, changing from conventional to more diverse cropping patterns, unlike using herbicide tolerant or Bt crops, will not stimulate resistant weeds and will continue to stifle pest levels while producing high yields 6 (Mellon, 2012). In response to questions surrounding the 2012 research by Davis et al., the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture (2012), which funded their research, highlighted that these diverse cropping systems work with both GMO and non-GMO crops without penalizing yields and that the diverse cropping systems actually grant farmers more flexibility in their choice of seeds. Along with this, the Leopold Center (2012) pointed out that these cropping systems would be able to address apprehensions surrounding herbicide tolerant plants, pesticide tolerant insects, climate change, and quality of rural life while being able to work across regions with different sets of diverse plants. 3 year and 4 year rotations have been recognized as answers to weed resistance while reducing the need for herbicide by 88% (Davis et al., 2012). Using herbicides and pesticides could control the pest and weed problem, but there is the increased risk of decreased yields through the phytotoxic effect (Hennessy, 2006). Herbicides no longer have any impact for some plants. There are nearly twenty weeds in Iowa that have been identified as herbicide resistant. Palmer amaranth, one of the herbicide resistant crops identified, has the ability to cut corn and soybean yields by 67%. These potential losses have led to increased use of herbicides, even though crop rotations have been proven effective at decreasing Palmer amaranth's ability to spread (Eller, 2014b). Integrating livestock operations into cropping systems through the use of manure as fertilizer, along with decreasing the amount of herbicides and pesticides used, not only lowers input costs for farmers, but also benefits the environment. Herbicides, pesticides, and synthetic fertilizer can impact wildlife, fish, pollinators, and humans through water pollution, toxicity and cancer causing chemicals. An issue with herbicides and pesticides is that they impact non-targets and result in resistance in their targets (Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture, 2012). Using cattle manure and nitrogen fixing through intercropping red clover and alfalfa resulted in decreased use of synthetic nitrogen by 80 -87% (Lamberton, 2012). The highest suggested synthetic nitrogen fertilizer rates for corn come after planting corn the year prior, and these high fertilizer rates still are unable to reproduce the yields of planting corn after soybeans or alfalfa. Even the occasional planting of soybeans cannot produce the results of diverse cropping systems, as continuous corn and second and third year corn after soybeans have similar yield and require the same amount of nitrogen (Mallarino, 2006). A 30 year study, starting in 1962, of nitrogen applications found that average nitrogen recovery in crops in the United States was 49 -51% and that the residual nitrogen left in the soil led to a high potential for soil acidity (Barak, 1997). While a decrease in the use of herbicides, pesticides, and synthetic fertilizers can benefit soil and water quality, so can diverse crop rotations themselves. Pimentel et. al (1995) ranked soil erosion as one of the most serious risks facing global cropland, but crop rotations can benefit. Diverse cropping patterns can help combat soil erosion and degradation while preserving soil moisture (Campbell et. al, 1990). Reduced tillage also has the ability to help preserve soil moisture and soil quality, which all aids soil tilth (Peterson, 2012). In research by the Environmental Working Group (EWG), they found that in April, May, and June 2014 Iowa farms lost 15 million tons of topsoil, and in an interview, senior vice president for agriculture and natural resources at EWG, Craig Cox stated that using reduced tillage or no tillage, and by changing fertilizer application, has been proven to prevent topsoil losses, but has not been used by enough farmers (as cited in C. Doering, 2014). A diverse set of crops in 3 year and 4 year rotations can also decrease topsoil loss during severe weather (Lamberton, 2012). Results would not be immediate, as the amount of sediment and agrichemicals in waterways is dependent on the cropping history of the land, making more immediate adoption even more important (National Research Council, 2010). Windblown particles can cause problems through siltation, which can decrease the value of amenities and pollute rivers and reservoirs that are used for drinking water, which can require government action and funds to clean. The more varied landscapes associated with diverse cropping systems can reduce the risk of flooding, which also can require government funds (Pimentel et al., 1995). Although the results seen by Davis et al. (2012) were based in Iowa, they are not unique to the area and imply similar benefits elsewhere. A 16 year study in Minnesota, starting in 1989, researched how yields were impacted by different input systems on 2 year corn and soybean rotations and 4 year corn, soybean, alfalfa, and oats rotations. The input systems were zero external input (ZEI), low external input (LEI), high external input (HEI), and organic input (OI). Oat yields stabilized and were highest with LEI, HEI, and OI. Alfalfa had highest yields with LEI, HEI, and OI during the first 8 years, but yields were highest with OI during the second 8 years. Corn had maximum yields with HEI in the 2 year rotation and LEI, HEI, and OI in the 4 year rotation. Corn yields from the 2 year to 4 year rotation showed no difference when both in HEI systems. Soybean yields were 7% higher with 4 year rotations and highest with LEI and HEI. Corn and Soybean yields were 7% and 16% higher in the 2 year HEI system than in the 4 year OI system, but both systems had the same net return. This research confirms that diverse cropping systems can see similar, if not greater, yields from using diverse cropping patterns while reducing inputs and achieving similar returns (Coulter et al., 2011). Research outside the United States also points to similar results. Introducing forage crops, which include alfalfa, into crop rotations in the Northern Great Plains in Canada has been shown to provide higher grain yields, suppress weed populations, increase the quality of soil, provide better habitats for wildlife, and reduce energy requirements. Reduced tillage was introduced with these cropping systems and shown to benefit yields in semi-arid regions by helping maintain soil moisture while preserving soil quality (Entz et al., 2002). Farmers on the Canadian prairie also notice the benefits of introducing forage crops into their rotations. 67% of farmers in semi-arid regions reported increased yields, with higher increases in wetter areas. 83% noticed a decrease in weeds after forages, and this was while many were using fewer herbicides (Entz, Bullied, and Katep-Mupondwa, 1995). Benefits of diverse crop rotations are also identified in Asia and Europe. Diverse crop rotations have been identified as ways to increase farm labor employment opportunities and exports in South Asia (Joshi, Gulati, Birthal, and Tewari, 2004 "}, {"section_title": "Methodology & Data", "text": "Although this data shows particular crop rotations, it leaves out millions of acres of corn and soybeans produced during this period. This data also does not clearly express crop production in these states since the percentages come from total cropland, which includes land for grazing animals and orchards, vineyards, and other crops that are not part of rotations and are continuously produced. Annual crop production data from the USDA portrays actually production in these states more accurately. Annual crop production data in Iowa shows corn and soybeans making up over 92% of the principal crops planted during this time while constituting over 22.8 million acres of land. In Illinois an average of around 21.5 million acres were planted, which constituted over 92% of all principal crops in the state over these years. In Nebraska, just fewer than 70% of the principal crops planted were corn and soybeans at an average of over 13 million acres during this period. Illinois makes it the clearest why these numbers may not be helpful in describes all crop rotations in these states (USDA, 2014). With Illinois having 26.7 million acres of cropland, the 49.5% that fall into these rotations would only account for just over 13.2 million acres, which is around 8 million less acres than the actual acres planted in the state. The production on those other 8 million acres needs to be described to understand production and cropping patterns 2 . In figuring out how crop rotations were implemented in these states, the fact that the states in question consistently planted around the same percentage of acres to corn and soybeans can be interpreted as a sign that few farmers were including a third crop into their rotations. Using this idea, the next step is to look at how acres in these states were planted in prior years during this period to estimate what percentage of farmers were using 2 crop rotations or continuous planting. 2 crop rotations are not considered to be solely rotations 1) or 2) as described by Boryan, Craig, and Willis (2008). These descriptions are made to highlight that this land was not in a 3 year or 4 year crop rotation during this period. This estimate was calculated by using data on total acres of individual crops in two years, corn in 2005 and soybeans in 2006, and how many acres of these crops were either soybeans or corn the prior year and what percentage of the total acres in the given year this constituted. Table 3 shows how many total acres were planted to corn and what was planted on the same acres the year prior in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, and Minnesota during 2005. Table 4 shows soybean how many total acres were planted to soybeans and what was planted on the same acres the year prior in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, and Minnesota during 2006. The column titled, \"Percentages of Acres,\" in both tables represents the percentage of acres that were corn and soybeans the prior year. Based on this analysis, Table 5 shows the percentage and number of acres planted that were not in 3 year or 4 year rotations in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, and Minnesota. This gives a yearly average of 62.406 million acres in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, and Minnesota not planted to 3 year or 4 year rotations from 2003 to 2007. Given that it was previously shown that the switch from a 2 year rotation to a 3 year rotation could save the energy equivalent of 15.27 gallons of diesel fuel per acre, the switch to 3 year rotations in these 4 states would save the energy equivalent of nearly 953 million gallons of diesel fuel per year. This is not the only area that energy could be saved using the methods described by Johanns, Chase, and Liebman (2012). In their research, Johanns, Craig, and Liebman (2012) saw a decrease in energy used to apply fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides through use of a 3 year crop rotation and the practice of banding 5 . These decreases in energy use in application were tied to a decrease in overall usage of fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. In evaluating energy conservation, only nitrogen use in corn will be considered. Nitrogen is used most in corn production to produce optimum yields and is the most energy intensive among fertilizers since it uses natural gas both as an energy source in production and to create ammonia, a necessary ingredient in its production (Sawyer, Hanna, & Petersen, 2010). Johanns, Chase, and Liebman (2012) saw the use of banding in the 3 year rotation decrease the average nitrogen fertilizer use to 2.39% of the 2 year rotation's average for corn, from 140.9 lbs/acre in the 2 year rotation to 3.32 lbs/acre in the 3 year rotation. Sawyer, Hanna, and Petersen (2010) showed that, for a 2 year rotation of corn and soybeans, an application of 125 lbs/acre of nitrogen used the diesel fuel energy equivalent of 13.3 gallons in production with an additional 1.9 gallons used in transport and application. Only energy use for production is considered since energy use in application was previously accounted for when calculating the energy savings of 3 year rotations. This value should be considered a conservative estimate as continuous corn needs more nitrogen to reach desired yields, which comes with increased energy use in production, transportation, and application. Table 6 provides the average number of pounds of fertilizer that were applied per acre of corn in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska and Minnesota in 2005 while also illustrating the number of acres these averages were applied to in each state. This data can be used to evaluate how much energy can be saved through the implementation of banding practices.  Table 6 shows that the implementation of banding in fertilizer application would need only an average of 3.32 lbs/acre of nitrogen and would decrease average fertilizer use in all four states by more than 125 lbs/acre. This would mean that there would be more than a 13.3 gallons/acre diesel fuel energy equivalent savings through the implementation of this technique. By converting to banding in nitrogen fertilizer application these four states would save over 520 million gallons of diesel fuel energy equivalent. Implementation of banding and 3 year rotations can lead to large energy savings. An additional technique could also help increase energy savings. In 2010, the USDA's Economic Research Service released a report stating that no till farming with corn was considerably less prevalent in Iowa, Illinois, and Minnesota were in conventional tillage (Horowitz, Ebel, & Ueda, 2010). With nearly 13.8 million acres of land in these four states using conventional tillage conservative fuel savings of at least 3.5 gallons per acre would save over 48 million gallons of fuel in these states."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "In Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, and Minnesota, through the implementation of 3 year rotations, fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide banding, and no tillage farming, a conservative estimate of energy savings equivalent to over 1.5 billion gallons of diesel fuel per year could be achieved. In 2013, Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, and Minnesota consumed less than 965 million gallons of ethanol (EIA, 2014a). Not only is more energy conserved through sustainable farming practices, but this energy would be removed from consumption; ethanol simply replaces another energy source without decreasing energy consumption. The 1.5 billion gallons of diesel fuel equivalent per year is a conservative calculation for a number of reasons. The reason this number is conservative is because continuous corn is more energy intensive and not all farmers planting two crops are using 2 year rotations. The decrease in use of phosphorus, potash, herbicides, and pesticides would lead to additional energy savings through the decreased production and transportation of these materials. Farmers that do not use conventional tillage are not necessarily using zero tillage, and no tillage for these farms could save more energy. Diesel fuel continues to be the greatest expense on Iowa farms and even switching from conventional tillage to reduced tillage can reduce fuel expenses and equipment depreciation (Peterson, 2012). Lastly, other practices can aid these procedures and decrease the need in fertilizers and pesticides. An example is the intercropping winter wheat and red clover, which 2006 research from Gibson, Singer, Barnhart, and Blaser states could provide subsequent corn with the replacement of nitrogen equivalent to 80 lbs/acre, further decreasing the need for nitrogen production and conserving more energy. Davis et al. (2012) showed that when compared to conventional systems using 3 year and 4 year crop rotations would result in farmers seeing similar, if not greater, grain yields, mass of harvested products, and profits. While they suppressed weeds effectively in all cropping systems, the freshwater quality in diverse, multi-year rotations experienced toxicity two orders of magnitude lower than conventional systems."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Diverse cropping systems present, for many farmers, a new way of running on farm operations, and the fact that they are able to see similar, if not greater, profits through these systems as conventional systems may not be compensation enough to convince farmers to change. Just as Kurkalova, Kling, & Zhao (2006) saw when looking at getting farmers to adopt conservation tillage, there are uncertainties surrounding changing practices and farmers risk aversion and irreversible sunk investments may deter adoption of sustainable practices . Farmers will need to be compensated for the uncertainties, and subsidies will need to play a role in overcoming adoption premiums. Reasons for non-adoption would need to be taken into account to design subsidies that compensated correctly for the adoption premium. This applies both to changes in crop rotations and changes to tillage practices. Kurkalova, Kling, and Zhao's 2006 research on subsidization for adoption of conservational tillage would need to be reevaluated for current markets and to include no tillage, which can provide additional environmental gains with additional fuel savings. There would not be an issue switching away from solely producing corn and soybeans since all of the crops in diverse 3 year and 4 year crop rotations have food market values. Farmers will react to profit signals, so the only way diverse cropping systems would cause a negative economic reaction would be if the government does not place value on the environmental and energy independence 45 goals that it used to promote the subsidization of corn ethanol. The subsidies put into place to promote diverse cropping patterns and achieve societal goals would be similar to those currently in place for the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and the Conservation Security Program (CSP). While alfalfa and small grains perform the task of being price savers and profit stabilizers, more than money makers, markets for these goods currently consist of them being sold or used as feed, sold for human consumption, or used as green fertilizer, but additional markets would also need to be established to engines, bioelectricity appears to be the better choice. Campbell, Lobell, and Field (2009), while focusing on how bioenergy could maximize land-use efficiency, found that bioelectricity, when compared to cellulosic ethanol, produced an average of 81% more transportation kilometers. This would mean that a small sports utility vehicle powered by bioelectricity would be able to go 14,000 miles while an internal combustion engine would only be able to go 9000 miles on the energy produced by an acre of switchgrass (Carnegie Institution, 2009). This increase in range is achieved while offsetting 108% more emissions per unit of cropland than cellulosic ethanol, preventing the release of 10 tons of CO2 per acre more than internal combustion engines. (Campbell, Lobell, and Field, 2009;Carnegie Institution, 2009). A contributing factor is the inefficiencies in use of energy by internal combustion engines, with average efficiencies for gasoline engines only being 15%, diesel engines being 20%, and electric vehicles being around 80% (Sandalow, 2009). Shifting to fully electric vehicles may not be immediately necessary either, and it is not the only advancement that can decrease fuel consumption."}, {"section_title": "Additional Policy Areas", "text": "A shift to plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) has the potential to decrease oil imports by 52%. These decreases in oil imports come without a major change in the United States' electrical infrastructure, as there is currently available capacity for 84% of cars and light trucks to go 33 miles per day (National Research Council, 2010). Autonomous cars may be just as important. In a 2014 interview, Brad Templeton, a consultant on Google's self-driving car, stated that the energy efficiency of driverless cars would be so high that they would not just replace cars currently on the market, but would also replace trains and busses in major metropolitan areas 1 (Big Think, 2014 (2002) showed that CAF\u00c9 standards resulted in a 7% decrease in emissions. There may be another issue with the categories for vehicles within the CAF\u00c9 standards that has only started to develop in recent times. In the United States farmers are compensated by federal funds to leave lands fallow through CRP. The goal of CRP, as stated by the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition (2014), is to promote the reduction of soil erosion, improvement of water quality, and reduction of damages by floods. These environmental goals are also achieved through the promotion of 3 year crop rotations and no till practices. Another part of the United States' platform is CSP, which promotes 5 year funding for conservation practices with the possibility of re-enrollment. CSP increases the amount paid when conservation is increased and it directly promotes crop rotations. Farmers and ranchers enrolling in CSP must establish that they currently meet or exceed the threshold of standards set to improve long term sustainability for 2 or more resource concerns, or they must demonstrate that they will at the end of the contract. 3. Data on previous years' soybean production was not statistically significant because of small sample sizes and was not considered."}, {"section_title": "4.", "text": "The estimate of the percentages of corn and soybean operations in 2 crop or continuous crop production in these four states is based on previous crops harvested as reported by the Agricultural Resource Management Survey conducted by the USDA (2014).

In Iowa, Illinois, and Nebraska the number of acres of corn in 2005 and 2010 planted to small grains the year prior was too small to be statistically unreliable. The number of acres planted to other crops prior to corn in both 2005 and 2010 in Iowa, Illinois, and Nebraska were also statistically unreliable.
