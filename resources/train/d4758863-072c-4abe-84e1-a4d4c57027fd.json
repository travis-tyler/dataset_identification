The overall first-year persistence rates barely changed in recent years, from 2015 to 2018. An average of 9.2 percent of freshmen, in any fall term between 2009 and 2018, transferred to a different institution by the following fall.

Asians and whites had significantly higher persistence rates than Hispanics or African Americans ( Figure 2). Compared to white students' persistence rate, there was an 8.8 percent point difference for Hispanic students, and a 14.3 percent point difference for African American students. Generally, students who persisted were likely to return to their starting institution: 67 percent continued enrollment at the starting institution, while 8.9 percent moved to a different institution. These patterns differed by race and ethnicity. Asians, who had the highest persistent rate, were least likely to continue enrollment at a different institution than their starting institution (8.1%), while African Americans with the lowest persistence rate were the most likely to move to a different institution during their first year (10.9%). Students aged 20 or younger at entry also showed a higher likelihood to continue enrollment at their starting institution in the second year (70.6%, as shown in Figure  3b).

Eight percent of students who entered public two-year institutions moved to an institution other than their starting institution in fall 2019.

While degree-seeking students make up the vast majority of the first-time beginning postsecondary student cohort, the beginning cohort for our analysis also includes a small number of first-time college students enrolled in non-credential programs, or students for whom program level information was unknown but had valid enrollment records for the applicable entering cohort year. Starting with the 2015 beginning cohort, we show persistence and retention trends for students enrolled in non-credential programs such as preparatory coursework, teacher certification, or other non-credit career and technical education (CTE) programs that may lead to an industry certification if the student takes the certification exam. Non-credential enrollments made up approximately two percent of the fall 2018 beginning cohort. Also starting with the 2015 beginning cohort, we show program level unknown, which consists of students whose credential program level was unreported (certificate, associate, or bachelor's degrees). The circumstances behind the lack of program information are institution-specific and can range from first-time students who are required to be undeclared until they declare a specific major, to non-degree students. Program level unknown enrollments made up approximately three percent of the fall 2018 cohort population. Past editions included a subset of students who were enrolled in graduate programs (approximately 3.7% of each beginning cohort). To ensure the beginning cohort consisted solely of undergraduate students, we removed graduate enrollments from the cohorts and the data from 2014 onwards were restated to reflect the change."}, {"section_title": "Retention", "text": "Defined in this report as continued enrollment (or degree completion) within the same higher education institution in the fall terms of a student's first and second year."}, {"section_title": "Persistence", "text": "Defined in this report as continued enrollment (or degree completion) at any higher education institution -including one different from the institution of initial enrollment -in the fall terms of a student's first and second year."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment Intensity", "text": "A student is classified as having started college in a full-time status or part-time status based on their earliest reported enrollment intensity within the entering fall term.
