We propose to define a latent normally-distributed tolerance-variable underlying the observed dichotomous imperfect reference-test results. Subsequently, we construct a Bayesian latent-class model based on the joint multivariate normal distribution of the latent tolerance and biomarker values, conditional on latent true disease status, which allows accounting for conditional dependence. The accuracy of the continuous biomarker-index is quantified by the AUC of the optimal linear biomarker-combination. Model performance is evaluated by using a simulation study and two sets of data of Alzheimer's disease patients (one from the memory-clinic-based Amsterdam Dementia Cohort and one from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database). Simulation results indicate adequate model performance and bias in estimates of the diagnostic-accuracy measures when the assumption of conditional independence is used when, in fact, it is incorrect. In the considered case studies, conditional dependence between some of the biomarkers and the imperfect reference-test is detected. However, making the conditional independence assumption does not lead to any marked differences in the estimates of diagnostic accuracy."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "An important issue in the development of diagnostic tests is the availability of the correct case and control labels. However, sometimes such labels based on a gold standard (GS) reference test may not be available or useful. For example, in the context of dementia or Alzheimer's disease (AD), only post-mortem pathological confirmation on brain tissue can be regarded as a GS reference-test (Scheltens and Rockwood, 2011) ; obviously, the confirmation is useless from a diagnostic perspective.\nHence, case and control labels for diagnostic-test development may be based on the result of an imperfect reference-test, which may misclassify cases and controls. If the misclassification is ignored in the development of a diagnostic test, the estimates of the parameters describing its accuracy may be severely biased (Lu et al., 2010) .\nTo take into account the absence of a gold standard when assessing the accuracy of diagnostic tests, latent-class models with two latent classes have been proposed (Rindskopf and Rindskopf, 1986) . The models allow inclusion of the imperfect reference-test information in the form of covariate information, but require certain strict identifiability restrictions.\nPreferably, one would like to weigh the information present in the results of an imperfect reference-test according to the prior knowledge about the accuracy of the test. For example, in AD-biomarker research, clinical diagnosis of AD can be regarded as an imperfect referencetest. Reports about the accuracy of the diagnosis are available in the literature (Wollman and Prohovnik, 2004; Beach et al., 2012) . Using this information might be instrumental in obtaining more reliable estimates of biomarker accuracy and in mitigating issues of identifiability. This is possible within the Bayesian framework.\nIn case a GS reference-test is available, a fully-parametric Bayesian method to estimate the accuracy of univariate continuous diagnostic tests was introduced by O'Malley et al. (2001) . For the case of an imperfect reference-test, several Bayesian models were proposed, including Bayesian latent-class mixture models. In particular, Wang et al. (2006) developed a Bayesian latent-class mixture model for a single continuous test, which considers use of a dichotomous imperfect reference-test.\nOften, diagnostic tests are developed based on biomarkers. A biomarker is \"a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biologic processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to therapeutic interventions\" (Biomarkers Definition Working Group, 2001 ). An often-used method to summarize properties of a continuous biomarker-based diagnostic test is the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (Zou et al., 2012) .\nCombining continuous biomarkers has been shown to increase the diagnostic accuracy over considering biomarkers alone. In particular, such a combination can be constructed when maximizing the AUC by using a model-free approach (Huang, Qin, and Fang, 2011) , a discriminant-function approach (O'Malley and Zou, 2006) , or a fully-parametric approach (Su and Liu, 1993) . Yu, Zhou, and Bandinelli (2011) developed a Bayesian latent-class mixture model to estimate the optimal linear-combination of multiple continuous tests.\nAll of the aforementioned Bayesian methods of estimation of the diagnostic-test accuracy of continuous biomarkers in the presence of an imperfect reference-test are based on the 'conditional independence' assumption, i.e., they assume that, conditionally on the true disease status, the misclassification error of the reference-test is independent of the error of the candidate diagnostic test. As the methods do not allow formal testing of this assumption, they have to rely on heuristic arguments to enforce its plausibility.\nIn the present paper, we propose a Bayesian latent-class mixture model to develop a diagnostic test based on a linear combination of multiple continuous biomarkers when an imperfect reference-test is available. Moreover, we allow for conditional dependence between the continuous biomarkers and the imperfect reference-test. On one hand, our model is an extension of the approaches developed by O'Malley and Zou (2006) for the case of a GS reference-test and by Yu, Zhou, and Bandinelli (2011) for the case when no reference test is available. On the other hand, we extend the model proposed by Wang et al. (2006) by developing an optimal linear-combination of continuous tests/biomarkers maximizing the AUC of the combination. Finally, we show that the proposed model could prove an important tool in AD-biomarker research, where admitting the imperfect nature of clinical diagnosis could be essential in obtaining reliable estimates of biomarkers' diagnostic accuracy."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Model", "text": "In the remainder of the paper, the following assumptions and notation will be used.

We propose prior distributions which include appropriate restrictions that mitigate non-identifiability while allowing introduction of available prior information. Whenever feasible, flat priors are proposed. For the prevalence parameter \u03b8, a uniform distribution restricted between 1/N and 1\u22121/N is proposed. The restriction assumes that the data contain at least one control and one case.\nIt helps to resolve convergence issues when MCMC algorithms get stuck in a one-component solution instead of a mixture, a possible result of model non-identifiability (Robert and Soubiran, 1993).\nTo allow a more controlled way of introducing prior biomarker-accuracy information, a prior distribution is proposed for \u03b4, which is defined as follows:\nBy considering a flat normal prior for \u00b5 Y 0 and a multivariate normal prior for \u03b4, it is possible to control the resulting prior for the AUC of the linear combination of the biomarkers. In particular, under the assumption that \u03b4 \u223c N K (\u03ba, \u03a8) and \u03ba=0, different choices for the standard deviations and correlations defining \u03a8 will lead to AUC a -priors expressing different amounts of prior information. Examples of so-constructed AUC a -priors are presented in choice of priors for \u00b5 Y 0 , \u03a3 0 , \u03a3 1 , and \u03b4.\nWe follow the proposal of Wei and Higgins (2013) to construct flat prior-distributions for the variance-covariance matrices.

Subsequently, wide uniform-distributions are put directly on the biomarker standard deviations Table 1 of Supplementary Materials).\nThe prior distributions for \u00b5T 0 and \u00b5T 1 are derived from the prior distributions for Sp T and Se T . This way, restrictions can be enforced on \u00b5T 0 and \u00b5T 1 leading to a sensible interpretation of Sp T and Se T . In the case of case-control data, a sensible choice for Sp T and Se T is to use independent Beta-distributions restricted to the (0.5, 1] interval. Based on the relationship defined in Equation 3, this leads to following prior distributions (\u03c6(\u00b7) denotes the standardnormal density function):\nOther restrictions on the prior distributions of Sp T and Se T could be considered as well. Jones et al. (2010) propose to assume that Sp T + Se T > 1 to overcome non-identifiability. This restriction allows Sp T or Se T to be smaller than 0.5, but implies a dependence between Sp T and Se T which is not trivial to implement. For this reason, we limit ourselves to assuming that Sp T and Se T are both strictly larger than 0.5. This restriction resolves the label-switching problem observed for mixture models (McLachlen and Peel, 2004) and mitigates the overparameterization with multiple imperfect reference-tests (Dendukuri and Joseph, 2001) , two consequences of model non-identifiability."}, {"section_title": "Application", "text": "To investigate the performance of the model, we carried out a simulation study and ap- In the simulation study, to compensate for the lack of prior information for Sp T and Se T , only the 'optimistic' AUC a prior was used together with a more restrictive U(0.1, 0.9) prior for the prevalence parameter \u03b8.\nFor both the simulation study and the real-data analyses, 10,000 MCMC samples were retained after a burn-in of 10,000 samples. In both cases, five independent MCMC chains were used. After fitting the models, general diagnostic tools were applied to the results of all 400 data sets as part of the results-analyzing R-script. Convergence over chains was investigated by the Gelman-Rubin convergence index, for which a cut-off value of 1.1 was applied (Gelman and Rubin, 1992) . To ensure that at least 3 out of 5 chains converged, chainby-chain convergence was monitored by using the Geweke convergence criterion (Geweke, 1992 ).

Despite the correlation between the latent tolerance and Total-tau, no important difference in the posterior medians of AUC a is found for the conditional-dependence and conditional-independence models.\n[ Table 2 about here.] Table 3 presents the results for the ADNI data. In this case, the resulting MCMC-samples for the conditional-dependence model defined by using the 'conservative' AUC a -prior require some attention. Even after 200,000 iterations, the OpenBUGS MCMC-algorithms do not seem to have converged (Appendix F of Supplementary Materials). This may be taken as implying that the use of the 'conservative' prior for AUC a does not provide enough information to overcome potential non-identifiability of the model given the limited size of the data set. For this reason, the data were also analyzed with a model using an 'intermediate' [ Table 3 about here.]\nTo further investigate applicability of the model to the case of data structures similar to the ADNI data, an additional simulation setting was considered (Appendix G of Supplementary Materials). In particular, the underlying true parameter values were chosen so that a bi-modal distribution would be observed, as is the case for the ADNI data ( Figure 2) . Results from this additional simulation study show that also for bi-modal observed data, the conditionaldependence model provides correct estimates of the true parameter values."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We have proposed a Bayesian latent-class model for construction of a diagnostic biomarkerindex in the presence of a dichotomous imperfect reference-test. Importantly, the model does not require the conditional-independence assumption because it explicitly allows for a correlation between the results of the reference test and biomarkers. (Baker et al., 2014) . Another explanation could be that the importance of Total-tau in the linear combination comprising the diagnostic index is only limited (McKhann et al., 2011) . In fact, the posterior median for coefficient a T otal\u2212tau was equal to 9.43 and was smaller as compared to the medians for the two other biomarkers (\u00e2 A\u03b21\u221242 = 15.04;\u00e2 P \u2212tau181p = 21.92). It is also possible that the lack of difference for the conditional-dependence analyses is due to a misspecification of the correlation structure in the former. In fact, Albert and Dodd (2004) showed that estimates of the diagnostic-performance measures may be biased if the conditional-dependence structure is misspecified and it may be difficult to distinguish between different dependence structures based on the observed data. However, these conclusions were formulated for the case of multiple dichotomous tests and a frequentist analysis. Bayesian approaches based on good prior information may be less sensitive to this issue, as also indicated by Albert and Dodd (2004) .\nFor the ADNI data, convergence issues due to non-identifiability were noted for the 'conservative' AUC a -prior distribution. They were resolved when the 'intermediate' or 'optimistic'\nAUC a -priors were used. This indicates that the use of the model may require a substantial sample size or, otherwise, a substantial amount of prior information to provide reliable results.\nAlthough this was not anticipated, the underlying settings of the simulations seem to mimic the results from the real-data applications. Nevertheless, the results of the simulation study and real-data applications are different. The most important difference is the overall accuracy of the combination which is much better for the real-data applications. Moreover, the substantial conditional dependence included in the simulation study is affecting the estimates of AUC a , while this is not the case in the real-data applications.\nThe proposed model explicitly assumes that biomarkers are normally distributed in order to get a biomarker combination which maximizes the AUC of the combination. The real-data application shows that applying suitable transformation (e.g., a logarithmic one) can help in obtaining data that are compliant with the assumption. Another solution would be to include a Box-Cox transformation directly into the likelihood, as proposed by, e.g., O'Malley and Zou (2006) . Extending the model along these lines remains a topic for further research.\nTo check whether valid inference could be obtained even with a minimum of prior information, in the presented analyses we used as uninformative prior distributions as possible.\nOf course, as demonstrated in the real-data application, if scientifically accepted prior information is available, it can be used. While we have restricted ourselves to include information on Sp T , Se T , and \u03b8, informative priors for other parameters could be added as well if the application at hand allows it. For example, in case of the particular application in Alzheimers considered biomarkers.\nAnother extension of the model could be to allow inclusion of continuous imperfect referencetest information. If such information is available, one could think of summarizing its accuracy information in terms of AUC and including this information as a prior, using similar parameterization as expressed in the Methods section."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Materials", "text": "Web Appendices, Tables, and Figures -credible intervals] for VUmc data.
