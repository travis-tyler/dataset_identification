The percentage of such degree graduates who become employed as teachers is referred to as \"yield.\" Other than a preliminary report based on a pilot study by Boe, Bobbitt, Cook, and Weber (1998), no national data have been reported to date on the \"yield of degree graduates in education who majored in a teaching field offered by teacher preparation programs\" for the national employed teaching force.' Subsequently in this report, the yield concept will often be abbreviated to \"yield of degree graduates\" and sometimes simply to \"yield.\" Though no other national data have yet been reported on yield, six state studies have found that the first-year yield of bachelor's degree graduates with majors in education for employment as teachers in public schools in their home states ranged from 35% to 50% percent, with a median of 43%.3 In contrast with state data, this report provides information about (a) the national yield of degree graduates regardless of the state in which teacher preparation was completed, (b) national yield of degree graduates at both the bachelor's and master's degree levels within five broad fields of teacher preparation for both public and private schools, (c) the certification status of degree graduates who become employed teachers, (d) out-of-field teachers in terms of the match between a teacher's field of teacher 'See Appendix B (Glossary) for definitions used in this report. 2Though no other national data have been reported specifically on the yield of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs, data from the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B) of the U.S. National Center for Education Statistics have been reported by Henke et al. (1997, Table 8.1) from which yield percentages can be computed for individuals at the bachelor's degree level who were defined as having been prepared to teach. However, the definition used for \"prepared to teach\" by Henke et al. was based on completion of a student teaching course or whether a graduate had qualified for teacher certification within one year following graduation. By contrast, the definition of \"prepared to teach\" used in the research reported here is the completion of an education bachelor's degree with a major in a teaching field offered by teacher preparation programs. As described in detail in Appendix B, the definitions and methods used in this research reported here are so different as not to be comparable with those used with the B&B data by Henke et al. preparation and subsequent teaching assignment, and (e) the surplus or shortage of degree graduates from five broad fields of teacher preparation. The data used in this research were derived from three large national probability samples of teachers taken over a seven-year period for school years 1987-88, 1990-91, and 1993-94. Thus, the trend data reported are based on the number of nationally estimated teachers in public and private schools. The main sources of data were the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and the Public and Private School Teacher Questionnaires of the Schools and Staffing Surveys (SASSs). All these data were collected by, and are available from, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), U.S. Department of Education. Data sources, the teacher sample, and data analysis procedures are described in Appendix A (Data Analysis Methods). In brief, IPEDS provides national level data about all degree graduates from teacher preparation programs each year as stratified by field of study, degree level (bachelor's vs. master's), sex, and race. These data quantify the teacher supply source represented by such degree graduates, most of whom eventually become employed as teachers, while many do not. By contrast, SASS data were collected from the national employed teaching force in both public and private schools. With SASS, it is possible to quantify the number of teachers employed in a particular survey year and to determine (a) how many of them became employed teachers after recently completing a teacher preparation degree, (b) how many of them became employed teachers after having earned a teacher preparation degree over one year earlier, and (c) how many of them had recently earned a teacher preparation degree while serving as employed teachers. By using data from both IPEDS and SASS, a wealth of information about the yield of degree graduates was quantified as reported here in a series of 22 tables: 1. The data reported in Tables 1 through 7 reveal major trends (i.e.. changes over time) in total yield (and three components thereof) of degree graduates. The three components of yield are represented by the percentage of total degree graduates in one year who: entered the ranks of employed teachers within one year after graduation, delayed their entry to the ranks of employed teachers by more than a year following graduation, and were already employed as teachers at the time of graduation. Trends over time in these three components of yield, and their total, are reported as a function of five broad fields of teacher preparation, degree level (bachelor's and master's degree graduates), sex of degree graduates, and race of degree graduates. Tables 8 through 11 focus more specifically on the yield of decree graduates who enter the ranks of employed teachers during a Particular year (both recent graduates and delayed entrants) in comparison with continuing teachers, all as a function of sector (public vs. private schools), teaching assignment level (elementary vs. secondary), community type (rural, suburban, and urban), and school size (small, medium, and large). Tables 12 through 16 provide information about the certification status (fully certified vs. partly certified) in the main teaching assignment given to degree graduates who become employed as teachers, all as a function of the three components of yield (as defined above), out-of-field teaching in terms of the match (or mismatch) between a degree graduate's field of teacher preparation and teaching assignment, sector, teaching assignment field of employment, degree level, sex, and race. Tables 17 through 19 provide information about the degree of outof-field teaching in terms of the mismatch between a degree graduate's broad field of teacher preparation and teaching assignment field of employment, all as a function of sector, teaching assignment field, degree level, sex, and race. Tables 20 through 22 provide information about trends over time in the surplus or shortage of degree graduates as a function of sector and broad field of teacher preparation."}, {"section_title": "The data reported in", "text": "\n\n\nThe focus of this report is on one source of supply of teachers, viz., degree graduates from teacher preparation programs. There are, of course, other sources of supply of teachers as well. A related \"Data Analysis Report\" issued by the Center for Research and Evaluation in Social Policy, Graduate School of Education, University of Pennsylvania (Boe, E. E., Bobbitt, S. A., Cook, L. H., Barkanic, G., & Maislin, G., 1998), provides trend and predictive data on all sources of supply of teachers for public schools, including degree graduates from teacher preparation programs, as well as degree graduates with other majors and reentering experienced teachers."}, {"section_title": "Degree versus Non-Degree Graduates from Teacher Preparation Programs", "text": "As stated in the title and elsewhere in this report, this research is based specifically on degree graduates (as distinguished from non-degree graduates) from teacher preparation programs. For example, some graduates may earn a bachelor's or master's degree with a major in English education as a field of study within education that is recognized by IPEDS. Students such as this are defined as degree graduates from teacher preparation programs. However, other students may earn a bachelor's or master's degree with a major in English while simultaneously enrolled in a teacher preparation program leading to certification as a teacher of English. Students such as this are regarded as non-degree graduates from teacher preparation programs. Unfortunately, individuals completing the latter type of teacher preparation are excluded from this research because no national data are available from IPEDS (or any other national source) about them.4 Since this research is based specifically on degree graduates (but not all graduates) of teacher preparation programs, a question arises as to how representative the yield data reported here are of non-degree graduates, and, more generally, all graduates. In our judgment, the answer is \"sufficiently representative to be informative and useful.\" In support of this judgment, we note that data from several sources indicate that degree graduates from teacher preparation programs represent a substantial majority of all graduates at the bachelor's degree level. Using national data from NCES's Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B) (Henke, Geis, Giambattista, & Knepper, 1996) it is possible to define a teacher preparation graduate as one who completed at least one course in student teaching prior to graduating with a baccalaureate degree. By this criterion according to 1992-93 B&B data, 62% of teacher preparation graduates had earned an education degree, while 38% had earned degrees in all other fields combined.' In addition, data on the degree graduates and non-degree graduates from teacher preparation programs is available from two states. In Kentucky, degree graduates with education majors represented 78% of all graduates who completed teacher preparation in 1991 (SREB, 1995a) and 79% in 199579% in (SREB, 1996b. Similarly in South Carolina, degree graduates with education majors represented 78% of all graduates who completed teacher preparation in 1993 (SREB, 1995c). The national and state data reviewed above all indicate that a substantial majority of graduates from teacher preparation programs have earned degrees in education instead of in arts and sciences disciplines or in other fields. Furthermore, we know of no evidence, or compelling reason to assume, that the yield of degree graduates with majors in teacher preparation would be substantially more, or less, than for graduates with degrees in other fields. At the very least, the yield information reported here is nationally representative of a substantial majority of graduates who have completed teacher preparation. In addition, the yield information reported is probably representative of the minority of graduates with degrees in fields other than education who have also completed teacher preparation. 4As will be discussed, there is a national data base for bachelor's degree graduates from which some estimates can be made about non-degree graduates of teacher preparation programs. 6Data obtained from a computer run by NCES's National Data Resource Center, January 4, 1999."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY RESULTS", "text": "The data analysis methods used for this research are described in Appendix A, while definitions of terms are given in the Glossary of Appendix B. All group differences and trends over time discussed and interpreted in the results described below are statistically significant at the .05 level or less. The probability level of many comparisons and trends are reported in the tables of results presented in this report."}, {"section_title": "Trends in The Yield of Degree Graduates", "text": "This section contains information about trends over years (1987, 1990, and 1993) in the yield of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs as a function of attributes of the graduates such as the broad teaching field of preparation and their degree level, sex, and race. As seen in Table 1, the following three components of yield have been computed: 1. The yield percentage for degree graduates from teacher preparation programs in one school year who entered teaching employment during the following school year (i.e, recent graduates who entered teaching employment), 2. The yield percentage for degree graduates from teacher preparation programs in one school year who simultaneously were employed as teachers and who continued as employed teachers during the following school year (i.e., recent graduates who continued teaching employment), and 3. The yield percentage for degree graduates from teacher preparation programs who had delayed their first entry into the employed teaching force by more than one year following graduation (delayed entrants to teaching employment). The computation of yield as a percentage of total degree graduates was accomplished by the following steps: First the number of degree graduates from a teacher preparation program in one year (e.g., 1993) is obtained from IPEDS. This represents the supply of such degree graduates. Next, for a given school year (e.g., 1993-94), the number of (a) entering teachers who earned a degree from a teacher preparation program within the past year, (b) continuing teachers who did likewise, and (c) entering teachers who earned such a degree in prior years, was obtained from SASS. Finally, the number of teachers of each of three types (as obtained from SASS) was computed as a percentage of the total number of degree graduates (as obtained from IPEDS). This percentage is the yield percentage for each component--the sum of which is the total yield percentage. 1. Trends in the Supply of Degree Graduates: The gross national supply of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs in the United States is shown in Figure 1 for general education and special education as a function of degree level (bachelor's and master's). Following a decline in the production of degree graduates from 1977 through the mid-1980s, production began to rise again and leveled off at a little over 150,000 per year during the first half of the 1990s (numbers for special and general education, and bachelor's and master's degrees, combined). The research reported here focuses on the yield of these graduates for the national employed teaching force for the years 1987 (124,032 graduates), 1990 (146,624 graduates), and 1993 (153,917 graduates). These numbers of total graduates by year are carried over to the first row of Table 1. 2. Main Trends in Yield Components by Year: The total yield of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs in 1987, 1990, and 1993, for public and private schools combined, is shown in the lowest section of Table 1. To compute the yield percentage by year, the nationally estimated number of degree graduates who became, or were, employed as teachers is converted to a percentage of the total degree graduates in the same year (carried over from Figure 1 to the top row of Table 1). The total yield results were virtually the same for the two most recent time periods (71 % in 1990 and 72% in 1993), while it was slightly (but not significantly) higher in 1987 (75%). Furthermore (as discussed below), Table 1 shows three components of yield, also computed as a percentage of total degree graduates during each of the three one-year time periods studied. a. Yield of recent graduates who entered teaching: Contrary to what might be expected, only a moderate percentage of recent degree graduates from teacher preparation programs actually entered employment as teachers within a year of graduation (28% of about 147,000 degree graduates in 1990; 25% of about 154,000 degree graduates in 1993). Quite clearly, being hired as a teacher soon after completing degree study in a teacher preparation program was not the conventional route for entering the national employed teaching force during the years studied. (See Table 1.) b. Yield of recent graduates who were already employed as teachers: Also contrary to what might be expected, a considerable percentage of recent degree graduates from teacher preparation programs were already employed as teachers at the time of graduation (21 % of about 147,000 degree graduates in 1990; 21 % of about 154,000 degree graduates in 1993). From the perspective of the annual production of degree graduates by teacher preparation programs, it is clear that upgrading the degree credentials of practicing teachers, as well as producing a cohort of entering teachers, are both important immediate contributions to staffing our nation's schools. (See Table 1.) c. Yield of delayed entrants to teaching: In addition to the annual yield of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs, there is also the longer-term yield of first-time teachers who delay their entry to teaching employment by at least one year following graduation (22% of about 147,000 degree graduates in 1990; 27% of about 154,000 degree graduates in 1993). Delayed yield has obviously been a major component of the productivity of teacher preparation programs for the employed teaching force--a component that often pays off many years after degree completion. (See Table 1.) 3. Trends in Yield Components by Year and Teacher Preparation Field: The three yield components, and their total, of degree graduates from all fields of teacher preparation for public and private schools (as shown in Table 1) were disaggregated into five broad fields of teacher preparation (general elementary, general secondary, physical and health education, vocational and business education, and special education). The results can be seen in Tables 2, 3, and 4 separately for the three years studied (1987, 1990, and 1993 Questionnaire (Chaney, 1994) demonstrated that secondary teachers over reported the number of degrees earned with majors in education and correspondingly under reported majors earned in the associated discipline (e.g., to report a major in mathemat-ics education instead of mathematics, or in English education instead of English). According to the study of this phenomenon, the number of degrees reported as earned in secondary education may have been inflated by about 8%. If so, an adjusted total yield of 85% for general secondary education (e.g., the total yield of 93% as reported in  Table 1) was analyzed separately for two degree levels (bachelor's and master's). The results are shown in Table 5 for the three years studied (1987, 1990, and 1993). The yield percentages were very similar from year to year. However, the results demonstrate that yield percentages depended to a great extent on degree level with considerably higher total yield for master's graduates (e.g., 82% in 1993) than for bachelor's graduates (e.g., 68% in 1993). Even more striking is the fact that very few bachelor's degrees in a teacher preparation field were earned by continuing teachers (only 2% in 1993), while a substantial majority of master's degrees in a teacher preparation field were earned by continuing teachers (63% in 1993). In fact, the high yield observed for master's graduates is attributable solely to the continuing teachers who earn degrees. In contrast with most master's graduates, most bachelor's graduates became entering teachers (31 % were recent graduates in 1993, while 36% were delayed entrants), while few master's graduates became entering teachers (only 12% were recent graduates in 1993, and a modest 7% were delayed entrants). Overall, the results shown in Table 5 indicate that the total yield, and the components of yield, of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs depended to a great extent on the degree level of teacher preparation. The general similarity of these results from over the three years studied demonstrates a consistency over time and replicability with large independent national samples of teachers."}, {"section_title": "Trends in Yield", "text": "Components by Year and Sex of Degree Graduates: The yield of degree graduates (as shown in Table 1) was analyzed separately for male and female graduates. The results, as shown in Table 6 for the three years studied (1987, 1990, and 1993), indicate that the yield of degree graduates depended on the sex of graduates. First, the total yield percentage for male graduates grew steadily from 1987-88 through 1993-94, while the total yield for females declined somewhat during the seven-year period studied. Most striking are (a) the growth in the yield percentages of delayed entrants, especially for male graduates which accounted for most of the growth in total yield for male graduates, and (b) the decline in the yield percentages of female graduates who were continuing teachers, which accounted for the decline in total yield for female graduates. By 1993, the total yield of male graduates became comparable to that for female graduates. 6. Trends in Yield Components by Year and Race of Degree Graduates: The yield of degree graduates (as shown in Table 1) was analyzed separately for White and Non-White graduates. The results, as shown in Table 7 for the three years studied (1987, 1990, and 1993), indicate that the yield of degree graduates depended on the race of graduates. Over 25% of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs do not become employed as teachers in either public or private schools--a striking number when considered in light of the current and projected shortage of highly qualified entering teachers (National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, 1996). Close to two-thirds of master's degree graduates from teacher preparation programs were already employed as teachers. While they were therefore not available to fill open teaching positions, they became more qualified as teachers through completing teacher education and thereby upgraded the quality of the teaching force. There was a trend toward increased yield of first-time teachers who delayed their entry to the employed teaching force, an alarming finding because national evidence indicates that delayed entrants are much less likely to be fully certified in their main teaching assignment . It is likely that delayed entrants will have forgotten much of what they learned about their subject matter and teaching practice, and that much of what they do remember will become obsolete due subsequent advances in knowledge and practice. The particularly low yield percentage for physical education/health suggests overproduction of graduates in this broad teaching field. Since teaching has traditionally been predominantly a female profession, the increased yield of male degree graduates (even though much of the gain occurred in the delayed entrants component) was particularly fortunate because male teachers accounted for only 12% of all teachers at the elementary level and 44% at the secondary level in public and private schools in 1993-94 (data from a subsidiary analysis for this report). The trend toward increased yield of minority degree graduates is also promising because the teaching profession has made the recruitment of such graduates a priority (Kennedy, 1992). This was particularly fortunate because Non-White teachers accounted for only 13% of public school teachers in 1990-91 (Choy, Henke, Alt, Medrich, & Bobbitt, 1993), a percentage that was much below the percentage of Non-White students."}, {"section_title": "Yield of Entering Teachers Produced by Degree Graduates", "text": "The previous section contains information about the total yield of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs, whereas the focus of this section is on the yield of entering teachers (i.e., excluding the continuing teacher component of yield). In addition, the previous section provided information on the attributes of degree graduates who became teachers, such as the broad teaching field in which they concentrated and their degree level, sex, and race. In this section, the yield of degree graduates is considered as a function of differences in the schools in which they became employed such as sector (public vs. private schools), level (elementary vs. secondary), school size (small, medium, large), and community type (rural, suburban, urban). As seen in Table 1, a distinction is made between entering teachers (those who assume employment as a teacher in any one year) and continuing teachers (those who continue employment as a teacher from one year to the next). Among entering teachers, a distinction is made between those who were recent graduates upon entering teaching employment, and delay entrants who waited more than a year following graduation before becoming employed as teachers. As described in more detail in Appendix A (Data Analysis Methods), the analyses reported in the tables for this section (Tables 8 through 11) pertain to the following indicators of the productivity of teacher preparation programs: The yield of entering teachers from among degree graduates from teacher preparation programs ne of degree graduates who were already employed as teachers at the time of graduation. Net degree graduates represent the supply of degree graduates who were potential entering teachers. The analyses reported in this section were all based on yield data from independent national probability samples for three years combined (1987,1990,1993). Preliminary analyses demonstrated that aggregating data was justified because the trends over this sevenyear time period were negligible, and the aggregated data entailed sample sizes sufficient to make possible the level of detailed tabulations reported below. 8. Yield of Entering Teachers by Sector: As seen in Table 8, the yield of entering teachers for public schools (70%) was much higher than for private schools (46%). The higher yield percentage for public schools was particularly noticeable for recent graduates. All this is evidence for the prevalent perception that public schools, in general, recruit graduates from teacher preparation programs more aggressively than do private schools.6 Further evidence of this is seen in Figure 2 in which are depicted all sources of entering teacher supply for public and private schools for school years 1990-91 and 1993-94 combined. Of all entering teacher hires, degree graduates from teacher preparation programs (recent graduates and delayed entrants combined) accounted for 41.5% in public schools, whereas they only accounted for 27.4% in private schools. In addition, percentage of degree graduates entering private schools who were only partly certified in their main teaching assignment was much higher in private schools (about 40%) than it was in public schools (about 22%). With respect to the continuing teacher data of Table 8, it was somewhat surprising to find very similar percentages of public and private continuing teachers (1.3% and 1.1%, respectively) who completed degrees from a teacher preparation program during a one year period. 9. Yield of Entering Teachers by Sector and Teaching Assignment Level: For both public and private schools, the yield of entering teachers from among degree graduates was much higher at the elementary level than the secondary level (see Table 9). In particular, the yield of degree graduates at the secondary level for private schools was especially low. All this is not surprising because specialized teaching by subject matter (e.g., mathematics, English, etc.) is common at the secondary level. This makes discipline majors from Arts and Sciences majors more competitive with degree majors in education for specialized teaching positions at the secondary level, and may lead to the lower yields seen in Table 9 for degree majors from teacher preparation programs . As to continuing teachers, however, the percentages who completed teacher preparation degrees in one year did not differ appreciably between the elementary and secondary levels. 10. Yield of Entering Teachers by Sector and School Size: As seen in the top row of Table   10, the allocated \"fair share\" of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs increases with the size of public schools, but decreases with the size of private schools. This reflects differences in the school size distributions by sector, with large schools tending to be found in the public sector and proportionately more small schools in the private sector. The yield of entering teachers from among degree graduates was higher in small public schools (72%) than in large public schools (58%). More generally, neither eAs observed by Henke et al. (1997), new teachers without undergoing formal teacher preparation often work in private schools. yield percentages nor the percentage of continuing teachers who recently earned teacher prep degrees were strongly associated with school size. 11. Yield of Entering Teachers by Sector and Community Type: For public schools, the yield of entering teachers from among degree graduates was highest for schools located in rural areas (77%) as contrasted with suburban (60%) and urban (65%) areas (see Table   11). A similar trend (but not statistically significant) can be seen for private schools. The reasons for higher yield of degree graduates for rural public schools are not clear. It might be that suburban schools, with better pay and working conditions than rural and urban schools, are more competitive for recruiting experienced (and therefore proven) teachers, while rural and urban areas must take the lesser-qualified recent or delayed firsttime teachers. 12. Summary of Yield of Entering Teachers: In this section, the focus is the yield of entering teachers from among degree graduates from teacher preparation programs as a function of differences among schools that employ such graduates. The yield of such degree graduates for entering teacher positions was particularly high for public schools (vs. private schools), at the elementary level (vs. secondary level), and for rural areas (vs. suburban and urban areas). Given that about one in four degree graduates never become employed as teachers, these findings suggest aspects of the educational system (e.g., private schools, the secondary level, and urban areas) where there might be room for improvement in the recruitment of degree graduates."}, {"section_title": "Yield of Degree Graduates as a Function of Certification Status", "text": "The focus of this section is on the certification status of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs who became employed as teachers. The certification status of teachers (either fully certified or partly certified in their main teaching assignment) is the most fundamental of qualifications because all states require by law or regulation that public schools hire teachers who are fully certified in their main teaching assignment. The certification status of degree graduates was analyzed as a function of the match between the broad field of teacher preparation and teaching assignment, sector, teaching field of assignment, degree level, teacher sex, and teacher race. Thus, this analysis was not of yield percentages per se, but of the certification status of degree graduates who compose the yield (i.e., who became employed as teachers). The analyses reported in this section were all based on certification data from independent national probability samples for three years combined (1987,1990,1993). Preliminary analyses demonstrated that aggregating data was justified because the trends over this seven-year time period were negligible, and the aggregated data entailed sample sizes sufficient to make possible the level of detailed tabulations reported below. 13. Yield as a Joint Function of Certification Status and Out-of-Field Teaching: Data on the nationally-estimated number of teachers by certification status and yield component are shown in Table 12, as further classified by the match or mismatch between a teachers broad field of teacher preparation and teaching assignment (i.e, general elementary, general secondary, physical/health education, vocational/business education, and special education). The data show that roughly 60,000 of 308,000 teachers over the three year period were only partly certified in their main teaching assignment, and another roughly 60,000 were teaching out-of-field (i.e., there was a mismatch between broad teaching field of preparation and assignment). The number of teachers within each crosstabulation of Table 12 were subdivided into those that were fully certified and those that were partly certified in their main teaching assignment. The percentages of those who were only partly certified are shown in Table 13. Several xx2 tests demonstrated that, for each yield component, the nationally estimated number of teachers were a joint function of certification status and teaching out-of-field status. For example, the lowest level of part certification (9.8%) was found in continuing teachers who had recently earned a degree and whose preparation and assignment fields matched. By contrast, the highest level of part certification (38.2%) was found in delayed entrants whose preparation and assignment fields mismatched. All delayed entrants and all mismatched teachers were the least qualified (28.1 % and 28.0% partly certified, respectively). Most importantly and disappointingly, the overall results demonstrated that 20.3% of all degree graduates yielded in one year from teacher preparation programs were not fully certified in their main teaching assignments. 14. Yield of Partly Certified Graduates by Sector: As seen in Table 14, a much higher percentage of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs who became employed in private schools (38.6%) were only partly certified in their main teaching assignment in comparison with those in who became employed in public schools (17.2%). Substantial differences in teacher certification status between public and private schools were found for all three components of yield. This suggests either that private schools hired degree graduates who were much less qualified than those hired by public schools or did not place them in teaching assignments for which they were certified, or some combination of both. Even for public schools, about one in five entering degree graduates (of both the recent graduates and delayed entrants types) was only partly certified in their main teaching assignment. 15. Yield of Partly Certified Graduates by Teaching Assignment Field: The certification status of recent degree graduates from teacher preparation programs (i.e., the annual yield) who became employed as teachers did not vary with the broad teaching field of their employment. However, the percentage of delayed entrants who were only partly certified in their main teaching assignment was a function of the broad teaching field of assignment with a particularly high percentage of partly certified delayed entrants in special education (41.2%) and much lower partly certified percentages in general elementary education (17.7%) and physical/health education (23.5%). It seems as though the teacher shortage in special education  necessitates the hiring of a remarkably high percentage of delayed entrants who have not been prepared to teach in this field."}, {"section_title": "Yield of Partly Certified Graduates by Degree Level: Of degree graduates from teacher", "text": "preparation programs who became employed as teachers, a much higher percentage of bachelor's graduates (24.9%) than master's graduates (12.7%%) was only partly certified in their main teaching assignment (see Table 16). This certification difference between degrees was entirely due to the yield component for continuing teachers. It is not surprising that, among continuing teachers, recent master's graduates demonstrate a higher level of certification than recent bachelor's graduates, since master's graduates have more education and probably more teaching experience than bachelor's graduates.

The percentage of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs who were only partly certified was even worse for delayed entrants (28.1 %), individuals whose field of teacher preparation and teaching assignment were mismatched (28.0%), private school teachers (38.6%), bachelor's degree graduates (24.9%), male degree graduates (24.0%), and Non-White degree graduates (25.3%). No doubt more than a trivial portion of these partly certified percentages was due to misplacement of degree graduates in assignments for which they are underqualified as distinguished from the graduates not qualifying for full certification for any teaching assignment. Nonetheless, the result was the same for students who were taught by recent degree graduates--many of their teachers many not fully certified to teach them. Of course, as  and others have shown, there is a certain percentage of experienced continuing teachers who are also partly certified in their main teaching assignment (about 6% nationally in public schools in 1993-94). Unfortunately, the partly certified percentage of entering teachers from teacher preparation programs was over three times higher."}, {"section_title": "Yield of Degree Graduates as a Function of Out-of-Field Teaching", "text": "The focus of this section is on out-of-field teaching in terms of the match between the broad teaching field of preparation and teaching assignment of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs who became employed as teachers. The correspondence between five broad teacher preparation and teaching assignment fields (i.e, general elementary, general secondary, physical/health education, vocational/business education, and special education) was classified as either a match or a mismatch. The mismatch status of recent degree graduates was analyzed as a function of sector, teaching field of assignment, degree level, teacher sex, and teacher race. Thus, the analysis was not of yield percentages per se, but of the out-of-field teaching status of degree graduates who composed the yield (i.e., who became employed as teachers)! 'Though the analysis of out-of-field teaching presented here is similar in some respects to that reported by Ingersoll and Gruber (1996), there are many differences. For example, Ingersoll and Gruber's analysis pertained to all employed secondary school teachers in public schools with main teaching assignments in specific academic disciplines (English, mathematics, history, etc.). By contrast, the data on out-of-field teaching reported here pertain to all degree graduates of teacher preparation programs in a particular year who become employed as teachers in both public and private schools in five broad teaching fields at either the elementary or secondary levels. Therefore, the specific results reported here are not comparable to those reported by Ingersoll and Gruber. 16 es, - ., a The analyses reported in this section were all based on match/mismatch data from independent national probability samples for three years combined (1987,1990,1993). Preliminary analyses demonstrated that aggregating data was justified because the trends over this seven-year time period were negligible, and the aggregated data entailed sample sizes sufficient to make possible the level of detailed tabulations reported below. 20. Yield of Mismatched Graduates by Sector: As seen in Table 17, the main finding is that a high percentage (19.8%) of degree graduates in any one year from teacher preparation programs who became employed as teachers were placed in teaching assignments that did not match their broad field of teacher preparation. This high mismatch percentage was found even though only five broad teaching fields were examined, as contrasted with much more specific teaching assignments (e.g., physics, German, music, etc.). If a much finer grain of classification had been possible, it is certain that a much higher degree of out-of-field teaching would have been found. As it is, the overall mismatch of 19.8% is virtually the same as the overall level of partly certified teachers (20.3%) shown in Table   13. Table 12 shows that only 201,905 (65%) of 308,435 degree graduates were both fully certified and placed in a teaching assignment matching their field of preparation. Finally, Table 17 shows that the mismatch percentage did not differ between public and private schools.  Table 18). Graduates assigned to general elementary and physical/health eduction had low mismatch percentages (9.3% and 11.2% respectively), while the mismatch percentages for general secondary, vocational/business education, and special education were much higher (31.5%, 23.6%, and 27.6% respectively). Insofar as the three components of yield are concerned, there is sufficient sample size to observe that similar differences pertain to all three yield components for general elementary, general secondary, and special education. As with certification status by teaching field (see Table 15), the highest level of mismatched degree graduates were found among the delayed entrants to special education (51.8%)--a further indication of the severe shortage of teachers in this field ."}, {"section_title": "Yield of Mismatched Graduates by Degree Level: Out-of-Field Teaching by degree", "text": "graduates from teacher preparation programs did not vary as a function of the degree level of graduates (see Table 19). 23. Yield of Mismatched Graduates by Sex of Degree Graduates: As seen in that matched their field of preparation. Therefore, on this indicator of teacher quality, both degree graduates and the students they instruct were poorly served by the educational system. Out-of-field teaching by degree graduates was even higher than the overall mismatch percentage (19.8%) in the teaching fields of general secondary, vocational/business education, and special education (mismatch percentages of 31.5%, 23.6%, and 27.6% respectively)."}, {"section_title": "Trends in the Surplus or Shortage of Degree Graduates", "text": "The focus of this section is on trends over a seven year period (1987,1990,1993) in the relationship between the national supply of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs and the national demand for entering teachers. It is possible that the supply is in excess of demand (the definition of a surplus of degree graduates) or that the supply is lower than the demand (the definition of a shortage of degree graduates). Furthermore, it is possible that a surplus or shortage of degree graduates varies with the broad teaching field in which graduates have been prepared. Since this analysis focused on the demand for entering teachers, it did not address the need to upgrade or replace continuing teachers who were not fully certified in their main teaching assignment or were otherwise underqualified. However, to the extent that the employment of such teachers was discontinued at their home schools and did not find teaching employment at a different school, an increase in the demand for entering teachers to replace them ordinarily occurred (i.e., unless the teaching position was discontinued or filled by a teacher from a different position that had been discontinued). The surplus or shortage of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs was computed separately for each of five broad teaching fields (i.e, general elementary, general secondary, physical/health education, vocational/business education, and special education) by the following method: In order to quantify the SUDAN of degree graduates who were potentially available to fill open positions for entering teachers, the number of employed continuing teachers who earned teacher preparation degrees were subtracted from the total number of degree graduates, the difference being referred to as net degree graduates.  Tables 20, 21, and 22, it can be seen that the S/D ratio was 1.13, 1.17, and 1. 08 in 1987, 1990, 1993, respectively, even though the production of degree graduates increased from 89,000 to 112,000 during this seven year period. These ratios indicate a remarkable stability in the production of degree graduates in relation to demand. Similarly, there was considerable stability in the S/D ratios over the seven year period for all five degree fields. More specifically, general elementary education and vocational/business education were in a considerable surplus, physical/heath education were in great surplus (but a sharply declining surplus from 1987 to 1993), special education experienced a considerable shortage, and general secondary education apparently experienced an enormous and increasing shortage (as considered further below). Although these S/D ratios for public education represent the major considerations in understanding the surplus and shortage of the production of degree graduates by teacher preparation programs nationally, there are two other important considerations to take into account. The first is the demand for degree graduates by private schools (as considered further below); the second is the production of non-degree graduates by teacher preparation programs (i.e., degree majors in academic disciplines who complete preparation for teacher certification as provided by teacher preparation programs). As reviewed on page 3 and 4 above for total bachelor's degree graduates from teacher preparation programs, available evidence suggests that another 30% to 60% of non-degree graduates have been prepared annually for certification as teachers. If we roughly estimate the national percentage to be 45%, the number of net graduates prepared as teachers (excluding continuing teachers) in 1993 increases from about 121,000 (see Table 22) to about 167,000.8 Given these estimates, there seems to have been a great surplus in the production of total graduates nationally (i.e., degree plus non-degree)--at least so far as public schools are concerned. If such a surplus of graduates from teacher preparation programs (degree plus non-degree) was being produced annually, it may seem surprising that so many underqualified teachers have been employed routinely and that there is ongoing concern in the field of education over actual and projected teacher shortages. It therefore seems that a very substantial number of graduates of teacher preparation programs do not seek employment as teachers, or, if they do seek to become so employed, do not find teaching positions that they are willing to accept. After all, the yield data for degree graduates for 1993 (see Table 1) indicate that of 121,000 degree graduates (who were not already employed as teachers), only an estimated 78,000 (or 64%) would ever secure employment as teachers in public or private schools. It is common to attribute the difficulty experienced in recruiting entering teachers to noncompetitive salaries, difficult working conditions, and unappealing geographic locations. Whatever the problems might be, it does seem as though the production of graduates is more than sufficient in gross numbers. 8The 46,000 increment to the 121,000 degree graduates from Table 22 was computed by multiplying the estimated 45% of degree graduates at the bachelor's level, who were non-degree graduates from teacher preparation programs, times the number of bachelor's degree graduates from teacher preparation programs (105,000 bachelor's graduates for 1993 from Table 5, minus the 1,600 continuing teachers who graduated with a bachelor's degree, times 45% equals approximately 46,000 non degree graduates). It was observed above that the S/D ratio for general secondary education in public schools in 1993 was very low (0.48, meaning a large shortage). This apparent shortage of graduates in the broad field of secondary education might be due, in considerable part, to a limitation of the IPEDS (the only comprehensive source of national level data about majors completed by all degree graduates) in that it does ngt record the number of non-degree graduates of teacher preparation programs who prepare for teacher certification (but do not earn education degrees with one of many teacher preparation majors) while simultaneously majoring in an academic discipline (e.g., English, Spanish, mathematics, biology, etc. Nonetheless, the circumstances relevant to teacher supply-demand in private schools differ a great deal from those in public schools. First, as seen in the yield percentages of Table 8, the hiring of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs in private schools is much less than that in public schools (proportionate to the number of positions for entering teachers). This may be due partly to the fact that average base salaries of private school teachers are only 67% of those in public schools (Henke, Choy, Geis, & Broughman, 1996). Consequently, many private schools with low salaries may simply not be able to attract professionally prepared teachers. In addition, it is well known that many private schools prefer lay teachers, and, therefore, do not seek to hire professionally prepared teachers. In addition, private schools are not usually subject to the same teacher certification regulations that require public schools to hire, insofar as possible, fully certified teachers. For these reasons, the extent of the authentic private school demand for graduates from teacher preparation programs, or even alternative certification programs, is not clear. No doubt it is less than the 36,000 net open teaching positions recorded in Table 22 for  In summary, it seems that, overall, the production of graduates from teacher preparation programs has been more than sufficient numerically to meet demand. However, there probably have been some continuing shortages in general secondary education, and certainly substantial shortages in special education (as also shown by . Even though the overall supply of degree graduates for public school entering teacher demand appears to have been sufficient, that does not mean that there have been enough qualified graduates available to fill open positions in all fields, at all times, and in all locations. The solution to these more specific teacher shortage problems will probably require greater production of teacher graduates in many specific fields (which might be offset with lower production in some other fields), improved teacher recruitment procedures, and improvements in the teaching profession (e.g., salaries, working conditions, etc.) that will generate a much higher yield of teacher preparation graduates for the employed teaching force.  1987-88, 1990-91 and 1993-94 Schools and Staffing Survey and the 1986-87, 1989-90, and 1992 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, National Center for Education Statistics, USDE."}, {"section_title": "22", "text": "aNationally weighted estimates (National Estimate) of the total number of full-time and part-time teachers combined at the K-   1987-88, 1990-91, and 1993-94 Schools and Staffing Survey and the 1986-87, 1989-90, and 1992 1987-88, 1990-91, and 1993-94 Schools and Staffing Survey and the 1986-87, 1989-90, and 1992 "}, {"section_title": "54% 82%", "text": "Note.

From these samples, weighted national estimates of the numbers of teachers were computed by special procedures developed by NCES for complex sample survey data (Kaufman & Huang, 1993). Because SASS data are subject to design effects due to stratification and clustering of the sample, standard errors for the national estimates were computed using replicate weights generated by the method of balanced repeated replications with the statistical software \"WesVarPC\". Computation of Total Yield and Its Three Components (Tables 1 -7, 12 -19) The computation of the yield of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs for the employed teaching force in public and private schools, as a percentage of total degree graduates, was accomplished by the following steps: 1. First the number of degree graduates from a teacher preparation program in one school year (e.g., 1992-93) was obtained from IPEDS. This represents the supply of degree graduates. 2. Next, the nationally estimated number of the following three types of teachers were computed from SASS data for the following school year (e.g., 1993-94): a. The number of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs in one school year who entered teaching employment during the following school year (i.e, recent graduates who entered teaching employment), b. The number of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs in one school year who simultaneously were employed as teachers and who continued as employed teachers during the following school year (i.e., recent graduates who continued teaching employment), and c. The number of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs who had delayed their first entry into the employed teaching force by more than one year following graduation (delayed entrants to teaching employment). 3. Then, the nationally estimated number of teachers for each of these three types (as obtained from SASS) was computed as a percentage of the total number of degree graduates (as obtained from IPEDS). These percentages quantify each of three yield components. 4. Finally, the total yield percentage was computed as the sum of the three component yield percentages. A difference between IPEDS and SASS in their definitions of graduation year required an assumption in using IPEDS as the source of data on degree graduates and SASS as the source of data on employed teachers. A graduation year for IPEDS was defined from July of one year through June of the next (e.g., July 1992 through June 1993). As is common, most graduations no doubt occurred during the Spring (May and June 1993). In the Teacher Questionnaires of SASS, employed teachers were asked to report the \"calendar year degree received.\" For example, teacher responses were collected during the Spring Semester of a survey year (e.g., mostly February through April 1994 for the 1993-94 school year). Employed teachers who reported earning a bachelor's or master's degree from a teacher preparation program during the prior calendar year (e.g., 1993) were classified as recent graduates, while entering first-time teachers with such degrees who reported degree completions in any year before the prior year (e.g., 1992 or earlier) were classified as delayed entrants. Using this procedure required the assumption that the number of graduates earning degrees during the period July through December of 1993 were equivalent to the number earning degrees during July through December 1992 (the period actually included in the 1992-93 IPEDS graduation year). Since the substantial majority of graduates complete degrees for the Spring graduation period, the majority of entering teachers begin employment during the start of a school year in August or September, and since the Teacher Questionnaire of SASS has been administered early in the following year, it was assumed that the use of a calendar year to designate the period of graduation was reasonable for the purposes of this research, and more reasonable than any other possible treatment of the data. The estimation of delayed yield required a special assumption because SASS and IPEDS are cross-sectional surveys instead of longitudinal surveys. Ideally, the number of IPEDS degree graduates in any one year who delayed their entry to teaching employment by more than one year would be based on follow-up data over a considerable number of subsequent 55 P?7 years (i.e., 10 years, or more). Since no such data exist, the following procedures were used to estimate delayed yield: 1. Using SASS data, it was possible to determine which teachers in a particular year under study (e.g., 1993-94) entered teaching employment for the first time with a degree from a teacher preparation program. This group of entering teachers was classified into those whose teacher preparation degrees had been earned within the past year (e.g., the recent graduates from school year 1992-93) and those whose degrees had been earned in all years prior to the past year (i.e., the delayed entrants). 2. The number of delayed entrants thus estimated was then computed as a percentage of degree graduates of teacher preparation programs during the past year to estimate the yield of graduates who had delayed their entry to the employed teaching force. In the absence of longitudinal data, it is assumed that the delayed yield percentage thus computed in retrospect is a reasonable approximation of the future delayed yield of degree graduates during a particular year (e.g., 1992-93). In fact, it is the only projection available. As described below, yield and its three components were also computed separately for four attributes of degree graduates: their teacher preparation field, degree level, sex, and race. Five Teacher Preparation Fields: Definitions (Tables 2-4, 20 -22) Because one of the objectives of this research was to study the yield of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs as a function of the major field of preparation, it was necessary that (a) the codes for major fields of teacher preparation classified by IPEDS (the source of data on the supply of degree graduates) correspond with (b) the codes for major fields of study classified by SASS (the source of data on degree graduates who became employed as teachers). For example, as to recent degree graduates who majored in elementary education during one year, it was essential to determine how many such recent graduates with elementary education majors were identified by SASS as entering or continuing teachers during the following year. Thus, the coding for the majors of degree graduates from IPEDS had to correspond with the coding for degree majors of employed teachers from SASS. Another objective was to study the relationship between the major fields of teacher preparation of degree graduates and the subsequent teaching assignment fields of those who became employed as teachers (i.e., match or mismatch). Therefore, it was necessary that the codes for major fields of teacher preparation classified by IPEDS correspond with the codes for teaching assignment fields classified by SASS. Overall, three sets of fields had to be defined, all of which closely corresponded with each other: (a) major field of teacher preparation as coded in IPEDs, (b) major field of teacher preparation as coded in SASS, and (c) main teaching assignment field also as coded in SASS. An examination of the coding of major fields of study by IPEDS and the coding of major fields of study and of teaching assignment by SASS revealed a number of differences. For example, a major field code in IPEDS is junior high/middle school, whereas SASS does not use this major field code. Similarly, a major field code in IPEDS is secondary education, whereas SASS does not use this as a teaching assignment code (but codes specific subject matters instead). The lack of close correspondence between major field codes in IPEDS and SASS (and the frequent use of \"other\" codes) restricted the number of teacher preparation fields that could be analyzed with both IPEDS and SASS data. Consequently, it became necessary to define five broad fields of teacher preparation for which all IPEDS and SASS codes could be classified unambiguously. The resulting five broad fields of teacher preparation are shown in the first and second columns of Table A-1, along with classification of the specific major fields of study codes used by both IPEDS and SASS into these five teacher preparation fields. Degree Level, Sex, and Race of Degree Graduates: Definitions (Tables 5 -7 , 16, 19) The degree level (bachelor's vs. master's), sex (male vs. female), and race (White vs. Non-White) variables for degree graduates are available year-by-year from IPEDS since before 1987, the earliest period included in this study. However, the race variable was first available for 1994-95, at which time White degree graduates represented 85% of the total with Non-White graduates representing the remaining 15%. In the absence of earlier IPEDS data on the racial composition of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs, the same 85%/15% White/Non-White difference was used to estimate of the racial distribution of the supply of such graduates for the three years used in this research (1987, 1990, and 1993). (Tables 8 11)   Table 1 shows that a distinction is made between entering teachers (those who assume employment as a teacher in any one year) and continuing teachers (those who continue employment as a teacher from one year to the next). Among entering teachers, there is a further distinction between those who were recent graduates upon entering teaching employment, and delayed entrants who waited more than a year following graduation before becoming employed as teachers. A subsidiary analysis was performed on the yield of entering teachers from among degree graduates from teacher preparation programs as a function of four school variables. This analysis provided information about the following two indicators of the productivity of teacher preparation programs:"}, {"section_title": "Computation of Entering Teacher Yield", "text": "The yield of entering teachers from among degree graduates from teacher preparation programs net of degree graduates who were already employed as teachers at the time of graduation. Net degree gr duates represent the supply of degree graduates who were potential entering teachers. The percentage of continuing teachers who recently earned a degree from a teacher preparation program. This percentage is a quantitative index of one major contribution of teacher preparation programs to upgrading the qualifications of the continuing employed teaching force). To compute yield percentages for entering teachers as a function of school variables such as sector and level, it was necessary to allocate the number of net degree graduates to the different levels of a school variable. For example, consider the allocation of net degree graduates by sector (public vs. private schools). The allocation process entailed the following steps: First compute the percentage of openings for total entering teachers by level (i.e., 77% of openings for entering teachers were in public schools, while 23% of the openings were in private schools). Next use these percentages to allocate the number of net degree graduates to public and private schools as the \"fair share\" of potential entering teachers for each. Finally, compute the yield of entering teachers for public schools from among their fair share of the supply of degree graduates and the yield of entering teachers for private schools from among their fair share of the supply degree graduates. This method of computing yield of net degree graduates as a function of school variables provides yield information in relation to, and controlled for, the number of openings for entering teachers. As described below, entering teacher yield was computed separately for four dimensions of schools: sector, teaching assignment level, school size, and community type.  Henke, Choy, et al., 1996 for description of these two variables). Data from the Public School Questionnaires and the Private School Questionnaires of SASS were used to define three levels of the school size variable, as follows: 1. Small schools: Enrollment less than 400 students 2. Medium schools: Enrollment between 400 and 700 students 3. Large schools: Enrollment greater than 700 students The community type variable in the SASS data base was scaled by seven tiers (large city, mid-size city, urban fringe of large city, urban fringe of mid-size city, large town, small town, and rural). For the 1987-88 SASS, a community type code for each public school teacher was based upon the postal ZIP code of school in which the teacher was employed, and matched to the U.S. Census community size for that ZIP code. For the 1990-91 and 1993-94 SASSs, each public school teacher was given a community type code by matching the postal ZIP code of the school in which the teacher was employed to the LOCALE code on the NCES's Common Core of Data School File. The resulting seven tiers of the community type variable were: Rural: A place with fewer than 2,500 people or a place designated as rural by Census. Small town: A town not within a metropolitan area and with a population less than 25,000 but greater than 2,500. Large town: A town not inside a metropolitan area, with a population greater than or equal to 25,000. Urban fringe of a mid-size city: Place with a metropolitan area of mid-size city and defined as urban. Urban fringe of a large city: Place within a metropolitan area of a large city and defined as urban by Census (i.e., within same county). Mid-size city: Central city of a standardized metropolitan area having a population less than 400,000 and a population density less than 6,000 people per square mile. Lame city: Central city of a standardized metropolitan area having a population greater than or equal to 400,000 or a population density greater than or equal to 6,000 people per square mile. For this research, these seven tiers of the community type variable were reduced to the following three levels: 1. Rural: rural and small town 2. Suburban: large towns, urban fringe of mid-size city, and urban fringe of large city 3. Urban: mid-size city and large city Computation of Yield by Teacher Qualifications (Tables 12 19) The yield of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs for the employed teaching force in public and private schools combined were computed by the standard methods (as described above) as a function of the following two dimensions of the qualifications of the graduates for the teaching positions to which they were assigned: 1. The percentages of employed degree graduates who were fully certified, and not fully certified, in their main teaching assignment, and 2. The percentage of employed degree graduates who were placed in a teaching assignment field that matched, and did not match, their teacher preparation field. These definitions of these two dimensions of teacher qualifications were: Certification Status. Teachers who hold a regular or standard certificate, an advanced professional certificate, or a probationary certificate (a certificate for teachers who have satisfied all requirements for a regular certificate except for completing a probationary period) in their main teaching assignment are considered to be fully certified. All teachers lacking in this basic qualification for teaching are classified as partly certified in their main teaching assignments. The certification status of employed teachers is computed from SASS data. Out-of-Field Teaching. The match or mismatch of teacher preparation and teaching assignment field defines whether a teacher is teaching in-field or out-of-field. The classification of teachers into these two categories requires the definition of teaching assignment fields, as described below. Five Teaching Assignment Fields: Definitions (Tables 15 and 18) One of the objectives of this research was to study the match or mismatch between the fields of preparation of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs and their subsequent fields of teaching assignment. Matches between fields of preparation and teaching assignment represent \"in-field\" teaching, while mismatches represent \"out-of-field\" teaching. Given that five broad fields of teacher preparation were defined (as shown in the first two columns of Table A-1), it was therefore necessary to define five parallel broad teaching assignment fields. This was accomplished by classifying all of the 49 main teaching assignment field codes used by SASS into one of five broad teaching assignment fields that 60"}, {"section_title": "S2", "text": "corresponded with the five broad teacher preparation fields. The classification of the 49 specific teaching assignment codes from SASS into the five broad teaching assignment codes is shown in the third column of Table A-1.\nOut-of-Field Teaching A teacher whose broad field of teacher preparation is different than her field of teaching assignment. See also Matched vs. Mismatched Degree Graduates."}, {"section_title": "Surplus or Shortage of Degree Graduates: Definitions", "text": "This analysis of the surplus or shortage of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs focuses on the demand for entering teachers. Therefore, it does not address the need to upgrade or replace continuing teachers who are not fully certified in their main teaching assignment or are otherwise underqualified. However, to the extent that the employment of such teachers is discontinued at their home schools and they do not find teaching employment at a different school, an increase in the demand for entering teachers to replace them ordinarily occurs (i.e., unless the teaching position is discontinued or filled by a teacher from a different position that has been discontinued). The surplus or shortage of degree graduates from teacher preparation programs was computed separately for each of five broad teaching field (general elementary, general secondary, physical/health education, vocational/business education, and special education) by the following method: To quantify the supply of degree graduates who were potentially available to fill open positions for entering teachers, the number of employed continuing teachers who earned teacher preparation degrees were subtracted from the total number of degree graduates, the difference being referred to as net degree graduates. For simplicity in description, the two methods for estimating yield will be referred to as: Method A: Based on IPEDS and SASS data, as described above in Appendix A Method B: Based on B&B data, as reported by Henke et al. (1997, pp. 96-97) Data Sources Method A: Uses national data from the IPEDS survey of the population of annual degree graduates (e.g., for 1992-93), by major field of study, including a large number of teacher preparation majors, at the bachelor's and other degree levels. No data are available on course taking, such as completion of a student teaching course. Entering teachers, who completed a bachelor's degree with a major in a field of teacher preparation during the prior year, are identified by SASS, a cross-sectional survey based on a national probability sample of teachers during an academic year (e.g., for 1993-94). Method B: Uses data from a national probability sample collected as a longitudinal survey that contains information about degree graduates, by major field of study, including a large number of teacher preparation majors, at the bachelor's degree level during academic year 1992-93. An associated transcript study made it possible to determine which degree graduates had completed a course in student teaching. A one-year longitudinal component of B&B followed these bachelor's degree graduates and determined which of them entered teaching employment within one year of graduation."}, {"section_title": "Definitions of a Prepared Teacher", "text": "Method A: A prepared teacher was defined as a bachelor's or master's (separately) degree graduate in education who majored in a teaching field offered by a teacher preparation program. Method B: A prepared teacher was defined as either (a) a bachelor's degree graduate in education who completed a course in student teaching, or (b) a bachelor's degree graduate in education who qualified for teacher certification within one year of graduation.' No data were reported on the relative proportions of the two subtypes of prepared teachers, nor was the level of certification specified. Apparently included were individuals who qualified for emergency, temporary, or provisional certification, as well as those who qualified for regular or standard certification. Therefore, some of these certified teachers may not have been prepared as teachers during their bachelor's degree study. No standard errors of the nationally estimated number of prepared teachers were provided by Henke et al. (1997) "}, {"section_title": "Yield Computation", "text": "Method A: Yield percentage was computed in this research as follows: The numerator was the number of entering teachers in 1993-94 with education bachelor's degrees with a major in a field of teacher preparation during the prior year (1992-93) as estimated from SASS data, while the denominator was the number of degree graduates in 1992-93 with bachelors degrees in education with majors in a field of teacher preparation as reported from IPEDS data. Therefore, the yield percentage computed was of \"bachelor's degree graduates from teacher preparation programs.\"\u00b0A prepared teacher, as defined here, earned a bachelor's degree with a major in the field of education. This makes it comparable to the definition used in Method A. However, the same definition of a prepared teacher is applicable to bachelor's degree graduates in all disciplines and fields other than education, and such distinctions are reported by Henke et al. (1998) Method B: Yield percentage can be computed as follows: The numerator is the number of first-time entering teachers in 1993-94 who earned bachelor's degrees in education during the prior year (1992-93) and who completed a course in student teaching or who qualified for some level of teacher certification during the year following graduation as estimated from the B&B First Followup Survey and the B&B transcript study, while the denominator is the number of degree graduates in 1992-93 who earned a bachelor's degrees in education and who completed a course in student teaching or who qualified for some level of teacher certification during the year following graduation as estimated from the B&B First Followup survey and the B&B transcript study. Therefore, the yield percentage computed was of \"bachelor's degree graduates in education who completed a student teaching course or who qualified for some level of teacher certification during the year following graduation.\""}, {"section_title": "Conclusion Regarding Different Yield Percentage Estimates", "text": "In view of the difference in databases, definitions of a \"prepared teacher,\" and subsequent yield computations, it is not surprising that Methods A and B produce quite different yield estimates. Nonetheless, it is possible that the two sources of data, the IPEDS/SASS pair and the B&B longitudinal survey, could produce similar yield results. However, they would need to be analyzed in parallel with the same definitions of variables and time lines. To do so would entail another research project focused on this objective. As it now stands, two different yield estimates can be produced because the definitions of variables and analytic procedures have been quite different.
