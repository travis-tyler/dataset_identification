"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Kindergarten is a critical period in children's early school careers. It sets them on a path that influences their subsequent learning and school achievement. For most children, kindergarten represents the first step in a journey through the world of formal schooling. However, children entering kindergarten in the United States in the 1990s are different from those who entered kindergarten in prior decades. They come from increasingly diverse racial, ethnic, cultural, social, economic, and language backgrounds. Many kindergartners now come from single-parent families and from stepparent families. They also differ in the level and types of early care and educational experiences that they have had prior to kindergarten (Zill et al. 1995). Our nation's schools face new opportunities and new challenges. Schools are expected to meet the educational needs of all children regardless of their background and experience. Services, such as meals and before-and afterschool child care, that were provided by other institutions in the past are now being provided by schools. Teachers are faced with classrooms of children with increasingly diverse needs. In addition, growing pressure to raise academic standards and to assess all students' progress toward meeting those standards places even more burden on schools and teachers. Whether or not children succeed in school is in part related to events and experiences that occur prior to their entering kindergarten for the first time. Children's preparedness for school and their later school success are related to multiple aspects of their development. Children's physical wellbeing, social development, cognitive skills and knowledge, and how they approach learning are all factors that contribute to their chances for success in school (Kagan, Moore, and Bredekamp 1995). Additionally, the differences we see in children's knowledge and skills as they enter kindergarten can be attributed to variations in family characteristics (e.g., maternal education, family type) and home experiences (e.g., home educational activities, nonparental care).\nThis report presents data on postsecondary degrees conferred during the 1996-97 academic year (July 1, 1996, to June 30, 1997) that were collected through the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).' IPEDS collects, among other data, the number of degrees and awards conferred in each field of study by award level (ranging from postsecondary certificates requiring less than 1 year of study to doctor's and first-professional degrees and certificates) and by race/ethnicity and gender of recipient. Discipline divisions and their specialties (fields of study) are specified in the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP), which was developed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and is the federally accepted standard for collecting, reporting, and interpreting education program data. This report uses the 1990 version of CIP (Morgan, Hunt, and Carpenter 1991) for classifying degree fields. Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (amended) establishes federal financial aid programs (e.g., Pell Grants, Stafford Loans) for students attending postsecondary institutions. This report focuses on those institutions that (1) have been certified eligible to participate in these Title IV programs, (2) grant associate's or higher degrees, and (3) are within the 50 states and the District of Columbia.'\nParticipation in adult education has grown steadily over the past 3 decades, increasing to 46 percent in 1999 (Hill 1987;Kim et al. 1995;Korb, Chandler, and West 1991). The participants engaged in some form of instruction or educational activity to acquire the knowledge, information, and skills necessary to succeed in the workforce, learn basic skills, earn credentials, or otherwise enrich their lives. To put this phenomenon in context, it is useful to compare the numbers of adult education participants in 1991 and 1999 with persons enrolled in institutions of higher education at the same points in time. In 1991, an estimated 58 million adults in the United States had participated in adult education activities, including part-time credential programs, in the preceding 12 months; by 1999, this number had grown to an estimated 90 million adults. By comparison, there were an estimated 14 million persons enrolled in U.S. institutions of higher education in 1991, and projections indicate that this enrollment will increase to 15 million persons in 1999 (Gerald and Hussar 1998) (figure 1). Thus, participation in adult education was approximately four times the enrollment in higher education in 1991, and six times the higher education enrollment in 1999. Further, the increase in the number of adult education participants over this time period is about twice the number of all persons enrolled in higher education at either time point. Findings from the National Household Education Survey (NHES:1991, NHES:1995, and NHES:1999 show that adult education is prevalent and increasing in contemporary American society. The 46 percent participation rate for the 12-month period prior to the 1999 interview (table 1) is higher than the reported participation rates in 1991 and 1995 (32 percent and 40 percent, respectively) (Kim et al. 1995). On the other hand, enrollment in higher education has remained relatively constant at 7.6 percent to 7.9 percent of the adult population (Gerald and Hussar 1998).\nInternational Education Indicators: A Time Series Perspective: 1985-1995 compares educational trends in economically developed countries over time. The countries examined in this report are members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an organization of 29 countries dedicated to promoting economic growth and development around the world. This report extends the earlier National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) publication International Education Indicators: A Time Series Perspective (Perie et al. 1997) from a 7-to an 11-year time series to provide a more comprehensive picture of continuity and change in countries' education systems. The 11 years included in this report were a period of rapid social, political, and economic changes for many OECD countries. These years also saw renewed interest in the issues of educational standards and finance reform. This report presents 18 indicators that each give a broad picture of an education issue, allowing for comparisons to be made both among countries and over time. Preceding the indicators is an essay that provides a broad comparison of 1985-1995 educational trends across OECD countries, with specific emphasis on how the United States compares with other countries, especially other \"Group of Seven\" (G-7) countries. (The G-7 countries are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.) The period 1985-1995 witnessed increases in the rates of enrollment in secondary and higher education in virtually every OECD country. Among G-7 countries in 1995, the United States had the fourth highest enrollment rate of 14to 17-year-olds at the lower and upper secondary level, and the second highest enrollment rate of 18-to 29-year-olds in higher education. An increasing percentage of students in many countries received their primary and secondary education from private schools between 1985 and 1995, although this was not the case in the United States. There was also a slight decrease in the percentage of students enrolled in private higher education during this period. First university degree graduation ratios' increased in most OECD countries between 1985 and 1995. In 1995, the United States had the lowest high school graduation ratio2 of any G-7 country, but the highest first university degree graduation ratio. Furthermore, the gender gap in first university degree graduation ratios reversed between 1985 and 1995, so that by the middle of the 1990s, graduation ratios for women surpassed those of men in most OECD countries. The percentage of first university degrees awarded in science increased or remained stable in the majority of OECD countries reporting data between 1985 and 1995. The most notable exception to this trend was the United States, where the percentage of science degrees dropped by 5 percentage points, placing it last among G-7 nations, but only slightly lower than Canada. 'The first university degree graduation ratio is the number of students receiving a first university degree in a given year per 100 persons in the population who are at the typical graduation age.The typical graduation age for first university degrees is 22 in the United States and ranges from 21 to 26 across OECD countries. 2This ratio is the number of students graduating from upper secondary school in a given year per 100 persons in the population who are at the typical age for completion of upper secondary education.The typical upper secondary completion age is 17 in the United States and ranges from 17 to 20 across the OECD countries. 138 Reflecting the overall trends in enrollments and graduation ratios, the educational attainment of adults ages 25-64 increased in most OECD countries. In 1995, the United States continued to have a greater percentage of adults with at least a university education than any other G-7 country. In 1995, university graduates in the United States had a 74 percent earnings advantage over high school graduates, one of the highest earnings advantages reported by OECD countries.\nWith the advent of the 21st century, vocational education in the United States is in transition. Historically, the purpose of vocational education has been to prepare students for entry-level jobs in occupations requiring less than a baccalaureate degree. Over the last 15 years, however, this purpose has shifted toward broader preparation that develops the academic, vocational, and technical skills of students in vocational education programs. This preparation involves integrating academic and vocational education, emphasizing all aspects of an industry, and implementing academic performance measures, among other reform efforts. Vocational education policy now also encourages high school students to continue their studies at the postsecondary level, and 2-year postsecondary students to pursue 4-year credentials, through various arrangements for secondary-postsecondary articulation or \"tech prep.\"' The traditional focus of vocational education is giving way to a broader purposeone that includes greater emphasis on 'A tech-prep program typically combines (orarticulates\") the last 2 years of high school and the first 2 years of postsecondary vocational education into a 4-year program that incorporates core academic standards and leads to an associate's degree or certificate in a specific career field.\nThis report presents part of the data collected from two National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) surveys conducted in spring 1999: \"Survey on Vocational Programs in Secondary Schools\" and \"Survey on Occupational Programs in Postsecondary Education Institutions.\" Requested by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Vocational and Adult Education (OVAE), these surveys provide national estimates on occupational program activities at public secondary schools and less-than-4-year postsecondary institutions.\nThis report attempts to provide a comprehensive picture of total federal financial support for education since fiscal year (FY) 1980.' In addition to Department of Education programs, the many other federal programs that support education are included. The report also includes other types of federal support that are sometimes overlooked.\nThis study grew out of concerns about the underrepresentation of students with special needs in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) assessments. The term \"special needs students\" is sometimes used to include both students with disabilities and students who are limited English proficient (LEP). In the 1996 NAEP assessment samples, 10 percent of 4th-graders, 9 percent of 8th-graders, and 5 percent of 12th-graders were identified by their schools as students with disabilities. In the same assessment year, 4 percent of 4th-graders and 2 percent of 8th-and 12th-graders were identified by their schools as students with limited English proficiency (Reese et al. 1997, 67). Schools participating in NAEP have been permitted to exclude individuals they identify as special needs students from the assessment, in accordance with criteria provided by the program at that time. In fact, at least half of all starmasemmaigsagnsimma.,m11211====l1=11=E7 special needs students in the NAEP samples were excluded from NAEP assessments in 1992 and 1994. This exclusion has raised concerns that some special needs students who could be meaningfully assessed are being excluded from NAEP. Moreover, there is an additional concern that variations across locales in exclusion practices may introduce biases in NAEP results. In recent years, a number of policy, legislative, civil rights, and technical considerations have caused the NAEP program to look more closely at its administration and assessment procedures and to consider changes that can increase participation among students with disabilities and LEP students. Based on previous studies (National Academy of Education 1993) as well as recommendations from various offices in the U.S. Department of Education, program procedures have been modified with the aim of increasing participation among special needs students. Modifications were made in two areas (Olson and Goldstein 1996). First, inclusion criteria for the NAEP 1996 assessment were revised with the intention of making them clearer, more inclusive, and more likely to be applied consistently across jurisdictions participating in the state assessment program. Second, for the first time in NAEP, a variety of assessment accommodations were offered to (1) students with disabilities whose Individualized Education Plan (IEP) specified such accommodations for testing; and (2) LEP students who, in the opinion of their instructors, required an accommodation in order to take the assessment in English.\nThe Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), offers the most comprehensive picture available of the education system in the United States. Initiated in 1987-88 and repeated in 1990-91 and 1993-94, SASS consists of surveys of districts, schools, principals, and teachers associated with a national sample of schools. It offers information on such issues as policies, programs, services, staffing, and enrollment at both the district and school levels, as well as principals' and teachers' backgrounds, training, experience, perceptions, and attitudes. Given the broad reach of SASS, it can speak to a variety of important educational research and policy questions. The value of SASS would be even greater, however, if the relationship between these measures and the level of achievement in schools were known. As noted by others (Boruch and Terhanian 1996;Kaufman 1996), by combining this survey information with data from other sources, SASS could more meaningfully inform debates over which factors relate to school effectiveness and could contribute to a broad-based evaluation of school improvement strategies. The aim of this report is to show the potential value of a linkage between SASS and data on student academic achievement. To achieve this aim, our approach is twostaged. First, we match the 1993-94 SASS data with state reading and mathematics assessment scores for public schools in 20 states, adjusting for between-state differences in achievement scales by using State NAEP (the state-bystate component of the National Assessment of Educational Progress). Second, by combining these data sources, we identify school-level correlates of student achievement in a broad sample of American public schools. We model the relationship between a variety of SASS school-level responses and average student assessment scores at the school level. In our model, average student achievement in a school is related to student background factors, school organizational features, teachers' professional characteristics, and school climate. Of particular interest in this study are the relationships among student achievement, average class size, and the school's behavioral climate. Overall, we investigate relationships among these measures in three types of schools-1,123 public elementary schools, 496 public middle schools, and 595 public high schoolsin 20 states. The data are analyzed using correlational, multiple regression, and structural equation model analyses.\nThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has been collecting counts of public school dropouts through its Common Core of Data (CCD) survey since the 1991-92 school year. However, not all states report dropout data in strict agreement with the CCD definition (table A), with the result that data from these nonconforming states have been withheld from publication. This situation has led NCES to explore the feasibility of adjusting nonstandard dropout reports to make them comparable with those from states using the standard CCD definition. The desire for comparable dropout statistics has been accompanied by considerable interest in developing a standard high school completion statistic based upon data available from the CCD. Between 1997 and 1999, staff from NCES and state education agencies worked with analysts from Westat (a private research firm) to develop a methodology for adjusting nonconforming dropout data and to test a proposed high school completion rate.\nThe Common Core of Data (CCD) is an organized set of information used throughout the United States to examine school, student, and teacher data. The CCD is also used to predict trends to assist policymakers. These uses of the CCD are almost certainly known to most readers of the Education Statistics Quarterly. Throughout the federal and state departments of education, the CCD is recognized as an important tool for educators and community stakeholders. However, when representatives of school districts are asked about the CCD, the answers are less certain. Many have not even heard of the CCD. Does this mean that the data are not used by personnel at the district level? Not necessarily. CCD data are used; personnel just may not know the source of the information. Even if school and district personnel have not heard of the CCD, they do know that they are required to collect information and send it on up \"to the next level\" of the education hierarchy. It seems as though, contrary to the law of gravity, the data flow up. On the other hand, people who are using the CCD may not be aware of the processes involved in getting the data to the state departments of education before they go to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) for the creation of the CCD. One of the major purposes of this article is to discuss some of the processes involved in the data flow from America's schools through America's school districts and to examine what is involved in making the data as accurate as possible. Another purpose is to discuss how these data, now in the form of information, can flow back down to districts and schools and how that flow can be increased.\nBetween academic years 1989-90 and 1995-96, the total dollar volume in federal student loans doubled, increasing from about $13 billion to about $28 billion (The College Board 1998).' Nearly 90 percent of these funds were received by students as federal Stafford loans or Supplemental Loans to Students (SLS).2 SLS loans were replaced by unsubsidized Stafford loans in 1993-94. Stafford and SLS were closely related programs and :are treated together in this report. The total amount borrowed by undergraduates through the Stafford/SLS programs increased by about $2 billion between 1989-90 and 1992-93, from approximately $8 billion to $10 billion. Three years later, in 1995-96, the total undergraduate Stafford loan volume had increased by $7 billion, to approximately $17 billion.' The larger increases in loan volume during the second period came after the 1992 Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, in which Congress made substantial changes in the federal financial aid need analysis and the structure of the federal student loan programs. There are two broad categories of federal student loans, subsidized and unsubsidized. For subsidized loans, students are not charged interest while they are enrolled. In order to qualify for an interest-free subsidized loan, students must demonstrate financial need. For unsubsidized loans, the federal government does not pay any of the interest for the students, who may obtain them to pay for educational expenses without demonstrating need. Depending on the circumstances, students may obtain either subsidized or unsubsidized loans, or a combination of both. In determining the need for financial aid, students are considered either dependent on their parents for support or independent and self-supporting. The federal student loans have limits on the 'These totals include all federal loan programs and both graduate and undergraduate borrowers. 'Calculated from data in Trends in Student Aid 1998 (The College Board 1998).The other smaller federal student loan programs are PLUS loans for parents, Perkins loans, and loans to students in the health professions. 'These estimates for undergraduates are based on unpublished data from the Department of Education's National Student Loan Data System. Approximately onefourth of the Stafford/SLS loan amounts were received by graduate and firstprofessional students. 88 maximum amounts that students may borrow. These limits vary by dependency, class level, and the type of loan. In general, independent students may borrow larger amounts than dependent students by combining subsidized and unsubsidized loans. Some of the major changes in the 1992 Reauthorization that affected the eligibility of undergraduates for federal loans, and the amounts that they could borrow, were the following: The loan limits on subsidized Stafford loans were increased (except for first-year students). Changes were made in federal need analysis (such as eliminating the consideration of home equity) that generally made it easier for dependent students to qualify for subsidized Stafford loans. For some independent students, changes in need analysis reduced eligibility for federal Pell grants,4 but increased their eligibility for subsidized loans. Unsubsidized loans were made generally available to dependent students for the first time. The separate SLS program of unsubsidized loans for independent students was phased out and replaced by unsubsidized loans for all students through the Stafford program. Dependent and independent students could borrow either subsidized, unsubsidized, or a combination of both types of Stafford loans. The maximum amounts of the combined loans for independent students were about double the amounts available to dependent students, however. Most of these changes, directly or indirectly, allowed more undergraduates to borrow, and to borrow larger amounts, beginning in 1993-94. In economic terms, there was a substantial increase in the supply of federal loan funds. This report analyzes the effect of the 1992 Reauthorization by comparing undergraduate borrowing patterns in two 3-year periods: from 1989-90 to 1992-93, before the changes; and between 1992-93 and 1995-96, when the changes to the programs were implemented. rgra ua e orrowing: e era tudent Loans in 1989Loans in -90,1992Loans in -93, and 1995 Changes in Borrowing: Key Findings In 1989-90, about one-fifth (19 percent) of all undergraduates received Stafford/SLS loans, and this percentage had not changed in 1992-93 (figure A). However, during the same time period, the average loan amount increased (in current dollars) by $500, from $2,600 to $3,100 (figure B). Three years later, when the new loan program rules were in effect, both the percentage of students borrowing (25 percent) and the average loan amounts had increased.\nResults from the 1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:1993) reveal that there were approximately 275,000 instructional faculty and staff members at the nation's public 2-year colleges during the fall of 1992. This group represents 30 percent of the total instructional faculty and staff employed by colleges and universities nationwide. Teaching was the primary responsibility of most instructional faculty and staff in public 2-year colleges. Of the 255,000 instructional faculty and staff in public 2-year colleges whose primary responsibility was teaching for credit during the fall of 1992, 38 percent were employed full time and 62 percent were employed part time (figure A). Previous NSOPF analyses have compared faculty and staff in the public 2-year sector with faculty and staff in other sectors. This report, however, uses selected findings from NSOPF:1993 to examine differences between subgroups of faculty and staff within the public 2-year sector. It compares the backgrounds, teaching methods, and career lives of instructional faculty and staff who vary in terms of age, years of experience in their current jobs, and primary teaching discipline. These comparisons show how those who are relatively new entrants to the teaching ranks at public 2-year colleges may differ from their older and more experienced colleagues. They also describe the instructional faculty and staff at public 2-year colleges as members of disciplinary subcultures. Primary teaching discipline was included as a key point of comparison, because prior studies have occasionally revealed differences across disciplines in the academic work of community college faculty members. The decision to examine differences by age reflects contemporary concern about the impending turnover of a gradually aging faculty. As for institutional impact on faculty work, few published studies have examined differences between community college faculty members with varying years of experience on the job. Yet the question of institutional influence on instructional faculty and staff is a contentious one. Many community college leaders have long asserted that strong faculty ties to the discipline must be discouraged in deference to the institution's student-focused mission. This report provides a first national look at diversity within the public 2-year sector, offering baseline data that may be used as points of comparison with data from future cycles of NSOPF. In recognition of the different professional ties that full-and part-time faculty may have with the community college enterprise, separate profiles are developed for full-and parttime instructional faculty and staff for whom teaching in  Statistics, 1993National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:1993.\nCongress, under the Women's Educational Equity Act provisions (Title V, Part B) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (as amended in 1994), requested the Secretary of Education to prepare a report on the status of educational equity for girls and women in the United States. This report responds to that request by assembling indicators that examine the extent to which males and females have access to the same educational opportunities, avail themselves equally of these opportunities, perform at the same level, succeed at the same rate, and obtain the same benefits.' The data are drawn primarily from surveys conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), although several other sources of national and international The complete report contains 44 indicators that examine various aspects of educational equity, from preparation for school, elementary and secondary education, and postsecondary education to outcomes. data are used as well. While the indicators in this report provide valuable information on many aspects of educational equity, some important issues cannot be addressed with available nationally representative data. Examples include the extent to which sexual harassment undermines the ability of schools to provide a safe learning environment and whether girls and young women are encouraged to challenge themselves in their educational pursuits, especially in mathematics and science. The data show that in school and in college, females are now doing as well as or better than males in many of the indicators of educational attainment. and that the large gaps in educational attainment that once existed between men and women have significantly decreased or been eliminated altogether. Nevertheless, there are other areas in both elementary/secondary and postsecondary education in which differences persist."}, {"section_title": "IN ,", "text": "A complex and continuous collaboration exists between the child and the family; and the family can provide the resources and support that children require to increase their chances of succeeding in school (Maccoby 1992). For some children, the absence of resources and support places them at increased risk for school failure. Much of the literature on the status of children in our nation's schools is focused on elementary school children (e.g., 4th-graders in the National Assessment of Educational Progress) and secondary school children (e.g., 12th-graders in the National Assessment of Educational Progress and 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-graders in the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 Eighth-Graders). Little information is available on kindergarten programs in the United States and on the nation's children as they enter kindergarten and move through the primary grades. Information about the entry status of the nation's kindergartners can inform educational policy and practice, especially those policies and practices that are targeted to meeting the needs of a diverse population of children entering kindergarten for the first time. This report presents the first findings from a new national study of kindergartners and their schools, classrooms, teachers, and families. The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), began following a nationally representative sample of some 22,000 kindergartners in the fall of 1998. ECLS-K will follow the same cohort of children from their entry into kindergarten through their fifth-grade year. Data will be collected not only in the fall of kindergarten but also in the spring of kindergarten, fall of first grade, spring of first grade, spring of third grade, and spring of fifth grade. In the fall of kindergarten, data were collected from children, their parents, and their teachers. Information from children was gathered during an individualized in-person assessment with the child in the child's school, parents were interviewed over the phone, and teachers were given selfadministered questionnaires. In the fall of 1998, about 4 million children were attending kindergarten in the United States, approximately 95 percent of them for the first time. Of the children attending kindergarten, 85 percent were in public school, and 15 percent were in private school; 55 percent were in full-day programs, and 45 percent were in part-day programs. This report is based on the 95 percent of children entering kindergarten for the first time in the fall of 1998. Future t'T NASA les315,/j, reports will provide information on those children who repeated kindergarten in the fall of 1998."}, {"section_title": "Cognitive Skills and Knowledge", "text": "Children's cognitive skills and knowledge are frequently thought of as core ingredients in the recipe for success in school. Researchers have conceived cognitive development as an extended set of multidimensional skills and proficiencies that include language/literacy, reasoning, and general knowledge (Kagan, Moore, and Bredekamp 1995). Children's language/literacy refers to both their oral communication (language) and understanding of the written word (literacy). Children's reasoning refers to their mathematical skills. The concept of general knowledge refers to children's conceptions and understandings of the world around them. As children enter kindergarten for the first time, they differ in their cognitive skills and knowledge. The ECLS-K assessments of first-time kindergartners indicate that children's reading, mathematics, and general knowledge are related to their age as they enter kindergarten, the level of their mother's education (figure A), their family type, the primary language spoken in the home, and their race/ ethnicity. In reading, mathematics, and general knowledge, older kindergartners (born in 1992about to turn 6 or already 6) outperform the youngest kindergartners (born in September through December 1993just turning 5). The older kindergartners are more likely to score in the highest quartile of the distribution of scores than the youngest kindergartners. However, some of the youngest children also score in the highest quartile (16 percent in reading, 12 percent in mathematics, and 12 percent in general knowledge). Additionally, some of the older kindergartners are scoring in the lowest quartile (15-19 percent in reading, 13-17 percent in mathematics, and 11-16 percent in general knowledge). Children's performance in reading, mathematics, and general knowledge increases with the level of their mothers' education. Kindergartners whose mothers have more education are more likely to score in the highest quartile in reading, mathematics, and general knowledge than all other kindergartners. However, some children whose mothers have less than a high school education also score in the highest quartile (6 percent in reading, 7 percent in mathematics, and 5 percent in general knowledge). Additionally, some  children whose mothers have a bachelor's degree or higher are scoring in the lowest quartile (8 percent in reading, 18 percent in mathematics, and 10 percent in general knowledge). Children's performance in reading, mathematics, and general knowledge differs by their family type: kindergartners from two-parent families are more likely to score in the highest quartile in reading, mathematics, and general knowledge than children from single-mother families. However, some children with single mothers also score in the highest quartile (14 percent in reading, 14 percent in mathematics, and 12 percent in general knowledge). Additionally, some children from two-parent families are scoring in the lowest quartile (22 percent in reading, 21 percent in mathematics, and 20 percent in general knowledge). In terms of their specific skills in reading and math, 66 percent of first-time kindergartners are proficient in recognizing their letters, 29 percent are proficient in understanding the beginning sounds (letter-sound relationship at the beginning of words), and about 17 percent are proficient in understanding the ending sounds (letter-sound relationship at the end of words). In math, nearly all first-time kindergartners (94 percent) are proficient in number and shape (recognizing numbers and shapes and counting to 10), 58 percent are proficient in understanding relative size (sequencing patterns and using nonstandard units of length to compare objects), and 20 percent are proficient in understanding ordinal sequence (identification of the ordinal position of an object in a sequencee.g., fifth in line)."}, {"section_title": "Social Skills", "text": "Children's social skills relate both to the quality and success of their school experiences (Meisels, Atkins-Burnett, and Nicholson 1996). Young children construct knowledge by interacting with others and their environment (Bandura 1986). In order to interact successfully in a variety of circumstances and with a variety of people, children need to possess interpersonal skills. They need to feel secure enough to join, question, and listen to their peers and adults. This report explores indicators of children's social development by looking at children's interpersonal skills and behavioral patterns as rated by their parents and teachers. For the most part, parents and teachers report a high incidence of prosocial behaviors and a low incidence of problem behaviors. Parents report that about 82 to 89 percent of first-time kindergartners often to very often join others in play, make friends, and comfort others. Teachers report that about 75 percent of first-time kindergartners often to very often accept peer ideas and form friendships.

Teacher ratings are lower, with about percent of first-time kindergartners arguing with others, fighting with others, and easily getting angry often to very often. Teacher ratings of children's prosocial and problem behaviors differ by children's family type and minority status. Kindergarten teachers rate children with some characteristics of risk for school difficulty (those whose mothers have less than a high school education, whose mothers are single, or whose families have received or are receiving public assistance) as less likely than children whose mothers have at least a high school diploma, who come from two-parent families, and whose families have never utilized public assistance to accept peer ideas and form friendships. Reports of children's problem behaviors vary by race/ ethnicity. The pattern of these differences and their magnitude depends on who is rating the children's behavior. When teachers rate the children in their classrooms, black children are more likely than white and Asian children to be seen as exhibiting higher levels of problem behaviors (arguing with others, fighting with others, getting angry easily). When 10 parents rate their children, we see fewer differences between black and white children. -Instead, we see more differences between Asian children and white, black, and Hispanic children.

The concept of physical health and well-being is broad; it not only includes a disease-free state but also having gross and fine motor skills appropriate to the child's age. On average, first-time kindergartners are about 45 inches tall and weigh about 46 pounds. About 12 percent of boys and 11 percent of girls have a body mass index that classifies them as at risk for being overweight. According to parent reports, kindergartners are generally healthy, though their general health differs by their family type, the level of their mothers' education, and whether or not they utilized public assistance (i.e., Aid to Families with Dependent Children) (figure B).

These characteristics tend to manifest themselves at a relatively early age, and children demonstrate diversity in their approaches and behaviors toward learning. As children enter kindergarten for the first time, parents report that about 73 percent persist at tasks often to very often (figure C), about 92 percent seem eager to learn (figure C), and 85 percent demonstrate creativity in their work. Teachers are slightly more conservative in their ratings (figure C), reporting that about two-thirds to threequarters of beginning kindergartners often to very often persist at tasks, seem eager to learn, and are able to pay attention. Teacher ratings of kindergartners' approaches to learning differ by child characteristics, such as gender, age at entry, level of mother's education, and minority status. Both parents and teachers report that girls persist at tasks more often than boys, older kindergartners (born in 1992) persist at tasks more often than the youngest kindergartners (born in September through December 1993), and children not at risk persist at tasks more often than children with certain risk factors (mother's education is less than high school, mother is single, or family has received public assistance)."}, {"section_title": "The Child and the Family", "text": "The nature and frequency of family interactions relate not only to children's development but also to children's preparedness for school.

In the 1990s, a large majority of children have been cared for on a regular basis by someone other than their parents prior to entering first grade (West, Wright, and Germino-Hausken 1995). Today, many kindergarten and primary school children receive before-and after-school care regularly from persons other than their parents (Brimhall, Reaney, and West 1999).

The report adds to our understanding of the diversity of young children's skills and knowledge. Even as they are just beginning their formalized educational experience, children are different. They demonstrate differences in their cognitive skills and knowledge, social skills, health, and approaches to learning, and bring with them differences in their home educational experiences and environments. This report is highly descriptive in nature, presenting a broad array of information on children's status as they begin their journey through school. Future reports based on ECLS-K will take a more analytical approach and examine specific issues in more depth. This report and future data from ECLS-K will help to inform researchers, practitioners, educators, parents, and\nStudent reports of school practices indicate that a higher percentage of students were in schools that required and arranged community service in 1999 than in 1996. These reports indicate that students in grades 9 and 10, and 11 and 12 are more likely to attend schools that require and arrange community service than students in grades 6 through 8. Also, private school students are more likely to report that their schools require and arrange community service than are public school students. Public school students did, however, show an increase across years with respect to attending schools that require and arrange community service.

Insufficiently trained special education teachers was the most frequently cited moderate or major barrier (47 percent) to the use of advanced telecommunications by students with disabilities. But this factor was less of a barrier in schools where training in advanced telecommunications was available for all teachers and where incentives were provided to all teachers to participate in such training. About one-third of public schools reported the following factors were moderate or major barriers to the use of advanced telecommunications by students with disabilities: too few computers available to students with disabilities, too few computers with alternative input/output devices for students with disabilities, and insufficient evaluation and support services to meet the special technology needs of students with disabilities. Generally, barriers to such use by disabled students were more frequently cited in schools 56 with higher proportions of poor students and in larger schools. Internet Access in U.S. Public Schools and Classrooms: 1994-99\nThe results of this survey show that nutrition education is going on in elementary school classrooms and that many of the instructional materials and techniques used are those that research indicates may be effective. However, the classroom time currently devoted to this topic may not be sufficient to change eating behaviors in students. Previous research (Journal of Nutrition Education 1995;Lytle 1995;Olson 1995) suggests that nutrition instruction might be improved through inservice training focusing on how to use active learning strategies, integrate nutrition lessons into other subjects, and involve families in nutrition education. Teachers reported that they were interested in receiving inservice training about these topics. Those who received high support or had some types of training were more likely to do some of these things than teachers with low support or with no training, respectively. In addition, teachers with To investigate the services provided by MEP summer-term projects and to document the record maintenance and transmittal procedures used by these projects, a nationally representative survey of 1998 MEP summer-term projects was conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) through its Fast Response Survey System (FRSS). Specifically, information was collected on (1) project characteristics, including enrollment size, type of population served, and technical assistance received from the project's state; (2) types of instructional and social support services offered, such as reading and math instruction, health services, transportation, and food; and (3) projects' student records systems, including the types of student information available and the ways in which records are transmitted, received, and used by MEP summer-term projects.\nFour main conclusions arise from this study: First, disparity in instructional expenditures among school districts seems to have decreased within many, but not all, of the states between 1980 and 1994. Second, in a small number of states, disparity seems to have increased during the same period of time. Third, in a significant number of states, the disparity measures lead to inconsistent results. And fourth, disparity among school districts seems to have increased for the nation as a whole due, in part, to differences in the growth path for instructional expenditures per pupil in different parts of the country. For each of the states for which the measures fell, the decline in disparity does not necessarily mean the state has a more equitable distribution of education expenditures, as the percentage and distribution of special needs students may have changed over that period. The other conclusions concern the database itself. Substantial problems with this database make financial analyses very challenging, particularly for the earlier years in the study. At a basic level, many districts were assigned erroneous codes that placed them in the wrong state, and there were other districts that had no state code at all. While a significant amount of editing was done, many problems remained. Another category of problems was the existence of outliersdistricts with either extremely large or small expenditures per pupil. These outliers, even small ones, can have a substantial effect on the results.\nAlthough 13 percent of 1992-93 college graduates had taught by 1997, 8 percent expected to teach full time in 3 years and 7 percent expected to teach in the longer term. Thus, it appears that many graduates who teach soon after college do not expect to spend much time teaching, let alone make it a career. Whether this is also true in other white-collar professions has not yet been studied empirically, however, and remains an important question for future research. If, indeed, new college graduates often change careers regardless of the occupations in which they begin their postbaccalaureate working lives, educators and policymakers who want to improve teacher retention rates may need to address undergraduate career development more generally in addition to teachers' professional preparation, working conditions, and support. White, non-Hispanic graduates continue to be more inclined than minority graduates to teach. Asian/Pacific Islander graduates were generally less inclined than graduates of other racial/ethnic backgrounds to teach. Black, non-Hispanic graduates were less inclined than Hispanic or white, non-Hispanic graduates to expect to teach in the longer term. Thus, this cohort's plans for the future do not suggest that the proportion of minority teachers will more closely resemble the proportion of minority students in the future. Graduates' commitment to teach, whether measured in terms of pedagogical training and certification or expectations for teaching in the future, was associated with their CEE scores and with their undergraduate GPAs, although in opposite directions. Graduates with higher scores were less inclined to teach, while graduates with higher GPAs were more inclined to teach. As has traditionally been true, however, men were less inclined than women to teach, and although men were more likely than women to score in the top quartile of college entrance examination scores, they were less likely to have cumulative GPAs of 3.5 or higher (McCormick, Horn, and Knepper 1996). Therefore, gender differences in teaching may at least partly explain the divergent CEE and GPA findings. Consistent with such a hypothesis, secondary-level teachers, who are more likely than elementary-level teachers to be men, were also more likely than elementary-level teachers to have scored in the top quartile of the CEE score distribution and were as likely as all graduates to have scored in the top quartile. Secondary teachers were less likely than elementary teachers to have top GPAs, overall and in their majors. Thus, patterns in teaching behavior among 1992-93 college graduates have continued from their first year out of college through their fourth. Whether these patterns will continue as states and localities both meet the needs of a growing school-age population and attempt to improve the quality of their teaching forces is a question for future research as the B&B:1993 study continues into the next century. This is the second year that NCES has used Title IV eligibility and degree-granting status to operationally define a higher education institution. Prior to 1996, higher education institutions were defined as postsecondary institutions that were accredited at the college level by an agency recognized by the Secretary, U.S. Department of Education. This change from reporting on higher education institutions as defined by accreditation status to reporting on them as defined by Title IV eligibility and degree-granting status was necessary because the Department of Education no longer distinguishes among institutions based upon accreditation status. Thus, it is no longer possible for NCES to obtain updated lists of \"higher education\" institutions as defined in previous reports. In lieu of this designation, NCES has identified subsets of postsecondary institutions on the basis of whether or not they are eligible to participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs because Title IV eligibility has implications for reporting and is of particular policy interest.' Institutions are further subdivided by whether or not they grant degrees, information that is available directly from IPEDS data.'\nAbout 90 million adults (46 percent of adults) were engaged in one or more types of adult education in the 12-month period prior to the NHES:1999 interview. This represents a significant increase in participation compared to the rates observed in NHES:1991 and NHES:1995. Adults were most likely to participate in work-related courses and personal development courses. Participation rates overall and for these two most frequent types of educational activities were positively associated with adults' educational attainment. About 2 in 10 adults without a high school diploma participated in any educational activities, compared to more than 6 in 10 adults with a bachelor's degree or higher. However, the apparent direct relationship between participation in adult education and educational attainment, on closer examination, may result from a divide between those with less than a high school diploma and others, and from participation of more highly educated adults in workrelated educational activities.  September 30, 1996, that corresponds to the institution's fiscal year. This report is based on information from the 1996 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System \"Academic Libraries Survey\" (IPEDS-L:1996). The \"Academic Libraries Survey\" has been carried out by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) since 1966. Although there have been changes in the survey questionnaire over the years, the series is generally considered to be continuous. Beginning with the 1988 survey, the \"Academic Libraries Survey\" has been conducted on a 2-year cycle as a component of IPEDS. IPEDS is the U.S. Department of Education's vehicle for collecting data from all postsecondary institutions in the United States. Other surveys included within IPEDS are the \"Institutional Characteristics Survey,\" \"Fall Enrollment Survey,\" \"Completions Survey,\" \"Finance Survey,\" \"Salaries, Tenure, and Fringe Benefits of Full-Time Instructional Faculty Survey,\" and \"Fall Staff Survey.\" The data in this report come from the higher education institutions in IPEDS and include all colleges and universities with accreditation at the higher education level as recognized by the Secretary of Education. At the national level, 94.2 percent of the libraries responded, and data were imputed for nonresponse. Caution should be exercised when comparing estimates by state because different states had different levels of nonresponse. For state-level data, as well as details on nonresponse and imputation, see the complete report. This article presents highlights for the nation.\nThe changes in the loan programs and federal need analysis resulting ,from the 1992 Reauthorization allowed for increased participation of middle-and higher income dependent students in the Stafford loan program and for borrowing larger amounts. Undergraduates who were independent students took out larger loans, primarily because of a large increase in the proportion of borrowers who obtained unsubsidized loans in addition to their subsidized ones. The increase in unsubsidized loans to independent students was facilitated when the separate SLS program was replaced by unsubsidized loans available through the Stafford program in the same loan application process. The level of student borrowing at the different types of institutions was directly related to the average level of tuition (with the exception of the private for-profit institutions). However, the relationship between tuition levels and borrowing within types of institutions was not as direct as these general patterns suggest. Within both public and private not-for-profit 4-year institutions, the borrowing rates of full-time, full-year undergraduates did not vary directly with tuition levels. In fact, over the 6-year period, with a few exceptions, borrowing rates increased to similar levels over time at nearly all tuition levels. This report examines differences among postsecondary faculty members by gender and by race/ethnicity. Comparisons were made on several human capital (e.g., education and experience) and structural (e.g., academic discipline and institution type) variables as well as faculty outcomes (salary, tenure, and rank). A multivariate analysis of factors associated with salary was also conducted. Male faculty in this group were compared to female faculty, and comparisons were also made among four, racial/ethnic groups: black, non-Hispanic; white, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; and Asian/ Pacific Islander. Generated from the 1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:1993), the analyses presented in this report are based on U.S. citizens with faculty status at 2-and 4-year (and above) institutions who indicated that their primary activity in the fall of 1992 was teaching. Most analyses were also restricted to full-time faculty members. NSOPF:1993 is the second in a series of surveys on faculty conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).\nThe statistical highlights presented here provide a quantitative description of the current American education scene. Clearly, from the large number of participants, the number of years that people spend in school, and the large sums expended by educational institutions, it is evident that the American people have a high regard for education. Assessment data indicate that there have been improvements in mathematics and science performance between 1986 and 1996. A high proportion of high school graduates are going on to college. Yet, wide variations in student proficiency from state to state and mediocre mathematics scores of American students in international assessments pose challenges. response rate, a nonrespondent subsample of 300 was selected for more intensive data collection efforts from among nonfinalized CATI nonrespondents."}, {"section_title": "16", "text": "NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS policymakers on issues concerning young children's education during the elementary grades."}, {"section_title": "Future Directions", "text": "The findings in this report bring to light some areas for further investigation, and some interesting patterns emerge across domains. For instance, differences exist in parent and teacher perceptions of children's prosocial skills, problem behaviors, and approaches to learning. Primarily, we presented the data by looking at parent perceptions in relation to child and family characteristics and teacher perceptions in relation to child and family characteristics. However, future analyses can compare the similarities and the differences in parent and teacher perceptions of the same child. For example, in terms of approaches to learning, specifically children's eagerness to learn, the racial/ ethnic differences seem much greater in the teacher ratings than in the parent ratings in the aggregate. Furthermore, in this report, we look at the constructs by a specific set of child and family characteristics (including child's sex, age at entry into kindergarten, race/ethnicity, and maternal education). Future reports can take a different perspective, and analyze the constructs in terms of additional family characteristics and school characteristics. For example, the data can be analyzed in terms of preschool attendance, kindergarten program type (e.g., full day/part day), and school type (e.g., public/nonpublic). These types of analysis may have policy implications. America's Kindergartners, the first report of findings from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), is a most welcome and much-needed addition to the nation's knowledge base. Since the National Education Goals were first set in 1989, one of the biggest dilemmas faced by professionals and policymakers was the lack of valid data to address the nation's progress toward achieving the first national goal: \"By the year 2000, all children will start school ready to learn.\" It is now the year 2000, and although we can neither say that the goal has been achieved nor make accurate comments on how far we've come in the past decade, with this report we now at least have baseline data giving us a picture of the varying competencies of children upon entry into America's kindergartens. The greatest benefit of this study is that it provides the firstever look at a nationally representative sample of kindergarten children upon entry into school. As it evolves over time, this study will give us answers to questions about which there has been anecdotal evidence at best and speculation at worst. For instance, until now the data most often quoted on the subject of school readiness were from a highly informal and unscientific survey of kindergarten teachers by Ernest Boyer in which more than one-third of children were said to be \"unready\" (Boyer 1991). Even this first report of findings indicates that such a statement is not just a vast oversimplification but is actually inaccurate. ECLS-K will fill the vital need for information to guide decisionmakers on this important topic. A second strength and benefit of the study is its use of a comprehensive definition of \"school readiness\" drawing on the multidimensional construct as understood by professionals in child development and early education and as used by the Goals Panel and many states in their readiness initiatives. In keeping with its comprehensive definition, the study used multiple measures and sources of information, which not only make the findings more reliable and robust (since 4-and 5-year-old children are notoriously challenging research subjects), but also permit additional levels of analysis that will be essential if the study is to 14 make a real contribution to improving the lives of children. For example, differences in parents' and teachers' perceptions of their children's behaviorwhich in this report are only describedcan be further analyzed and used to inform both teachers and parents. The findings confirm much of what we previously thought but also challenge some of our frequent assumptions. Clearly, the findings support the perception of many kindergarten teachers that the children in their classes are increasingly diverse. The full extent of individual diversity cannot be gleaned from these aggregated data. However, the rich database will permit complex analyses, providing perhaps the best opportunity ever to examine relationships among variables of children's experience and their competencies. Taken at face value, the study again finds the oft-reported differences in achievement among children with various risk factors (such as a single-parent family, low income, and low level of mother's education) or from different racial and ethnic groups. Given that minimal analysis has been done on the relationships among these variables, the findings should be taken with extreme caution. Family risk factors tend to correlate with one another. For example, having a single parent is often correlated with lower family income or lower levels of maternal education. The presence of multiple risk factors has more impact than any particular factor alone. Similarly, African-American and Hispanic families are more likely to experience poverty or to have lower levels of maternal education in this country. Nevertheless, the study demonstrates that many differences among groups are already present upon entry into school (although they tend to increase during the school years). This finding substantiates the fact that kindergarten is too late to intervene in the educational trajectory for many children at risk. Additional support is required not only for preschool and Head Start, but also for intervention programs that target younger children and their parents, such as Early Head Start and high-quality child care for infants and toddlers."}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS -Atlaszazammoummaing ',1111211Milirv4c,iimer One finding that is not surprising at all is that, in general, younger children perform less well than older children. This is not surprising given that the age difference at kindergarten entry may equal a year of experience, experience is essential for learning, and much of what is measured in the study is developmental in nature. In the past, the reality of age effects has led some policymakers to raise entrance ages and many parents to keep their children out of kindergarten. Advice to policymakers: It would be unfortunate and regressive if this study reignited the entrance age arguments. The study substantiates that diversity among kindergartners is the norm and that age is only one dimension of it. The study found that some of the youngest children were in the higher quartiles of performance, proving that age alone is an inadequate criterion for judging school readiness. Now to the relatively surprising findings. For the first time, on a large scale, the study gives us a picture of \"what children know and can do\" at kindergarten entry. These data strongly suggest that most children are better prepared to succeed in school than many have thought. But clearly more needs to be done for children who have multiple risk factors in their experience. These are clearly the children who most need to be in school. Therefore, the results of this study should not be used to set standards for kindergarten entry, but rather to improve early intervention, inform 'f curriculum development, and enhance the professional development of teachers. Despite the differences in achievement identified between groups, the study finds that there are some children who at this early age \"are beating the odds\"; they are in the top quartile on various measures despite the presence of risk factors in their backgrounds. Further analysis of this subgroup should prove fruitful in identifying the mediating factors in their environments, especially those that have implications for policy or practice in early childhood settings. The study has the great potential of following these children over the course of their elementary schooling to see what critical factors do or do not continue to help them beat society's expectations. Such an initial report, which by its nature is descriptive rather than analytic, runs the risk of leading to overly simplistic conclusions. Such conclusions would do an injustice to the study as well as to its subjects, since both are far more complex that this initial report reveals.

The profile of school readiness these data provide is particularly important in two respectsfor understanding the levels of children's early development and learning at entry into kindergarten and for advancing how we conceptualize the construct of \"readiness.\" The data tell a fascinating story about the breadth and diversity of children's abilities upon entering school.

In this first report, NCES has focused its analyses on descriptions of the diversity of the entering students in relative terms. We learn, for example, that children score higher on many dimensions if they are older, have mothers with higher levels of education, live in two-parent families, and are part of families that have not received and are not receiving public assistance. These same demographic variables frequently are found to be important predictors of school 20 achievement in the higher grades; it is now clear, if anyone had doubts, that these differences are present at the very beginning of formal schooling. It remains for future analyses to tell us how schools will cope with this diversity and whether they will be able to alter the expected trajectories that demographic characteristics so often foretell: What will happen to at-risk students in the class of 2011? Will those in future classes meet the same fate? What will happen will depend, in part, on how we act on the messages within America's Kindergartners. The report makes clear that there is considerable diversity even in terms of the extent to which demographics relate to what children know and can do when they begin kindergarten. Even though, on average, kindergartners whose mothers have more education do better in math, 7 percent of children whose mothers have less than a high school education score in the highest quartile in mathematics. Even though, on average, kindergartners from one-parent families score lower in reading, 14 percent of children with single mothers score in the highest quartile on the reading assessments. Even though the average kindergartner who is older when entering kindergarten scores higher in general knowledge, 12 percent of the youngest entering kindergartners score in the highest quartile on those measures. Can we learn how those children beat the odds? Can we learn what in the lives or circumstances of those children led them to perform so much better than expected? Attempting to answer these questions may make it possible for the story of \"America's kindergartners in 2000,\" or in 2002 or 2004, to play out differently from the story of those who entered in 1998."}, {"section_title": "Conceptualizing Readiness", "text": "Five years ago, the Technical Planning Group for the first national education goal published a landmark analysis of the dimensions of children's development and learning (Kagan, Moore, and Bredekamp 1995). Up until then, local educators, state and federal policymakers, and parents conceptualized readiness in narrow termsas, in many quarters, they still dowith so-called academic skills being the first ones brought to mind by the term \"readiness.\" However, it is now increasingly recognized that children will be successful in school only if they begin with a broad array of knowledge, skills, behaviors, and attitudes (Love, Aber, and Brooks-Gunn 1994). America's Kindergartners is the first substantial data collection and analysis that takes a comprehensive view of school readiness that is largely aligned with the vision of the first national education goal. ..In breaking new ground in this way, NCES suggests that readiness has four dimensions: cognitive skills and knowledge, social skills, physical health and well-being, and approaches to learning. Language and literacy, which constituted a fifth dimension for the Goal One Technical Planning Group, is encompassed by cognitive skills and knowledge in the NCES framework.. The Goal One Technical Planning Group also stressed the importance of three conditions that support readiness: access to quality preschool programs, parents as their child's first teacher, and receipt of appropriate nutrition and health care. America's Kindergartners addresses these supporting conditions by presenting data on the child care or preschool experiences children have had before kindergarten and on child and family interactions (including parents reading to their children). So, do we now know how \"ready\" America's children are when they begin kindergarten? Not exactly. We do know, for example, that first-time kindergartners are generally healthy, that only about 10 percent are seen by their teachers as often to very often exhibiting such problem behaviors as easily getting angry, that 66 percent are proficient in recognizing their letters, that 29 percent understand beginning sounds of words, that almost all (94 percent) are proficient in numbers and shapes, and that 71 percent are seen by their teachers as often to very often persisting at tasks. We do not know, however, what the schools expect of these children; nor do we know how their new teachers respond to these levels of behavior and performance. Those who expected this report to tell us whether, \"by the year 2000, all children in American will start school ready to learn,\" may be disappointed. But for many of us who have been struggling with conceptualizing \"readiness,\" the report strikes the appropriate balance by focusing on the dimensions of children's learning and development without entering into the fray of the readiness debate."}, {"section_title": "Measurement Issues", "text": "America's Kindergartners also demonstrates that a full conceptualization of readiness requires multiple measure-Fx &A& n. ):471141113,11rAP41.Tif;:'. ment approaches and the incorporation of multiple perspectives in order to obtain a complete picture of the extent to which children may be prepared to succeed in school. Data come from three sources: direct performance assessments of children (as in the assessments of reading, general knowledge, and mathematical concepts), ratings by teachers (on such dimensions as prosocial behaviors and task persistence), and ratings by parents (also on such dimensions as prosocial behaviors and task persistence). One of these methods alone could not provide the comprehensive picture of children's development and learning that this report displays. At the same time, however, we must realize that all measurement approaches do not provide the same type of information. Direct assessments can give an absolute measure of a construct (for example, whether or not a child can identify the ordinal position of an object in a sequence). Teacher and parent ratings, on the other hand, provide assessments based on the adults' judgments. For example, children are rated as \"often\" or \"very often\" eager to learn, or teachers and parents rate children as \"often\" or \"very often\" persisting at taskswith these ratings made in relation to other children the teachers and parents know. Our understanding of the social skills and approaches to learning of America's kindergartners is largely limited to such ratings. The existence of these data in a national data set is a huge step forward, yet we will be able to know and understand even more about children's social skills and approaches to learning when direct assessments tell us, for example, that when children are presented with standard tasks, 75 percent demonstrate task persistence. Only then will our profile of children's performance in their approaches to learning or social skills parallel our profile of their achievements in cognitive development, language, and general knowledge."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Recommendations", "text": "Throughout this commentary, I have invoked the notion of school readiness even though NCES did not claim that its assessments provide such a measure.

Finally, the research accomplishments demonstrated in America's Kindergartners must not lead to complacency in our approaches to measuring children's early learning and development. In a number of key areasmost notably, social skills and approaches to learningwe still depend far more than we should on the judgment of teachers and parents. As valuable as these perceptions are for understanding children's development, we must continue to seek progress in direct assessment methods that will provide the same measurement rigor we have when assessing cognitive and language skills. Children begin the process of learning to read long before they enter formal schooling (Sonnenschein, Brody, and Munsterman 1996;Teale and Sulzby 1989). Families, and parents in particular, play an important part in this process. For decades, research has shown that children whose parents read to them become better readers and do better in school (Snow, Burns, and Griffin 1998;Saracho 1997;Moss and Fawcett 1995). But reading to children is not the only activity that helps children become readers and to do better in school. Activities such as telling stories and singing songs may also encourage the acquisition of literacy skills (National Education Goals Panel 1997;Sonnenschein, Brody, and Munsterman 1996;Moss and Fawcett 1995;Glazer 1989). Why is it that home activities such as reading to children, telling them stories, and singing with them help them learn? Research suggests that reading and storytelling stimulate the imagination, help to increase children's vocabularies, introduce them to components of stories (such as character, plot, action, and sequence), and provide them with information about the world around them (National Education Goals Panel 1997;Moss and Fawcett 1995). Singing songs probably also encourages a love of language and the rhythms of language (Glazer 1989). It also encourages phonological awareness (that is, awareness of 4, the sounds and parts of language), which can be an important predictor of later literacy learning (Bryant et al. 1990;Maclean, Bryant, and Bradley 1987). Moreover, activities such as these are usually very child-centered, are conducted in a relaxed atmosphere, and allow for a warm, positive interaction between children and their parents (Sonnenschein, Brody, and Munsterman 1996;Strickland and Taylor 1989). Research suggests that the quality of parent-child interactions is important for children's development of literacy (Saracho 1997). Goal One of the National Education Goals recognizes the importance of family-child engagement in literacy activities to children's learning and readiness for school. The goal suggests that for all children in America to start school ready to learn, parents need to devote time each day to teaching them. This brief report presents information on the extent to which families are engaged in literacy activities with their 3-to 5-year-olds who are not yet enrolled in kindergarten. It also presents information on signs of emerging literacy, such as whether children recognize letters, can write their own names, or read or pretend to read. This information is shown for selected child, parent, and family characteristics. Some of these characteristics, such as low parent education, LIMIESEMMIBib._ are often used to identify children as being at risk for school failure. The report examines changes in both home literacy activities that families engage in and signs of children's emerging literacy between 1993 and 1999. During this period, substantial research, policy, and media attention has been devoted to the importance of family involvement in children's learning.' The report then examines the association between home literacy activities and signs of emerging literacy in 1999. The data used in this report are from the National Household Education Surveys (NHES:1993and NHES:1999. These data are based on reports of the parent most knowledgeable about the child, usually the child's mother. It is important to acknowledge that parents may overestimate both their involvement in home literacy activities and their children's skills because they recognize that such activities and skills are socially desirable. The tendency for respondents to give socially desirable responses is one source of nonsampling error in surveys."}, {"section_title": "Home Literacy Activities", "text": "Families' engagement in literacy activities, 1999 Families have gotten the message about the importance of reading to their young children. Eighty-one percent of children ages 3 to 5 years in 1999 who were not yet enrolled in kindergarten were read to three or more times in the last week by a family member (table 1). Many families are also engaging in other literacy activities with their 3-to 5-yearold children. Fifty percent of children ages 3 to 5 years not yet in kindergarten were told a story three or more times in the last week by a family member. Sixty-four percent were taught letters, words, or numbers frequently by their families. Nearly half (49 percent) were taught songs or music three or more times in the last week, and more than a third (39 percent) did arts and crafts with their families three or more times in the last week. More than a third (36 percent) of preschool 3-to 5-year-olds visited the library in the last month with a family member. These percentages show that many families are actively involved in helping their young children learn.

For example, 3-year-olds were more likely than 4-year-olds or 5-year-olds to have been taught songs or music three or more times in the last week by their families (57 percent of 3-year-olds compared to 43 percent of 4-year-olds and 38 percent of 5-year-olds) (table 1). However, they were less likely than 4-and 5-yearolds to have visited the library with their families in the last month (33 percent, vs. 39 and 41 percent, respectively). There are also differences in families' engagement in literacy activities with their children by the children's race and ethnicity. Hispanic children and black, non-Hispanic children were less likely than white, non-Hispanic children to have been read to by (61 percent and 71 percent vs. 89 percent), told stories by (40 percent and 45 percent vs. 53 percent), or done arts and crafts with (32 percent and 28 percent vs. 44 percent) their families three or more times in the last week. There are no statistically significant differences, however, between black, non-Hispanic children and white, non-Hispanic children in the proportion who were taught letters, words, or numbers three or more times in the last week or who visited the library in the last month with their families. Hispanic children, though, are significantly less likely than either white, non-Hispanic or black, non-Hispanic children to have done these activities that frequently with their families. For example, 25 percent of Hispanic children visited the library in the past month with their families compared to 39 percent of white non-Hispanic children and 35 percent of black, non-Hispanic children. A number of risk factors believed to have an impact on the development of literacy skills are shown in table 1. These include having a mother whose home language is other than English, having a mother with less than a high school education, living with fewer than two parents, living in a family with an income below the poverty threshold, and having a race/ethnicity other than white, non-Hispanic. Having a minority race/ethnicity is not a risk factor in the same sense as poverty or the other risk factors that can have a direct impact on children's development and learning. However, it remains the case that, on average, minorities in the United States have fewer opportunities and are faced with greater obstacles than are nonminorities. These realities of American life place minorities at educational risk. Generally, the findings in this report show that children with one or more of these risk factors are less likely than I): A NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS other children to have frequently engaged in literacy activities with their families. This is especially true for reading to children, telling them stories, doing arts and crafts with them, and visiting the library with them. The differences between those at risk and those not at risk are smaller for teaching children letters, words, or numbers and teaching them songs or music. For example, 69 percent of children living in families with incomes below the poverty threshold were read to three or more times in the last week compared to 85 percent of children living above poverty. But children living in families with incomes below the poverty threshold were just as likely as children not living in poverty to have been taught songs or music three or more times in the last week (49 percent each). Likewise, 61 percent of children whose mothers had less than a high school education were read to three or more times in the last week compared to over 90 percent of children whose mothers' highest education was college graduate or graduate or professional school. With the exception of being taught songs or music, children with multiple risk factors are less likely than those with none or only one risk factor to engage in literacy activities frequently with their families. Twenty-seven percent of children with two or more risk factors had visited a library in the past month compared to 44 percent of children with Table 1.-Percentage of 3-to 5-year-old children not yet enrolled in kindergarten who have participated in home literacy activities with a family member three or more times in the past week, by selected child and family characteristics:1993 and 1999 The vast majority of statistically significant changes observed between 1993 and 1999 are for those children who would generally be considered less at risk for school failure. That is, most of the increases in literacy activities are for white, non-Hispanic children from two-parent households, with family incomes above the poverty threshold, and with mothers who speak English at home. For example, the percentage of white, non-Hispanic children who were read to three or more times in the last week increased from 85 percent in 1993 to 89 percent in 1999. Similarly, the percentage who were taught letters, words, or numbers three or more times in the last week increased from 58 percent in 1993 to 65 percent in 1999. Among black, non-Hispanic children, the percentage who were read to frequently appears to have risen from 66 percent in 1993 to 71 percent in 1999. This difference, however, is not statistically significant. Similarly, the percentage who were taught letters, words, or numbers three or more times in the last week appears to have risen from 63 percent in 1993 to 68 percent in 1999.

In 1999, 26 percent of children who were read to three or more times in the last week by a family member recognized all the letters of the alphabet compared to 14 percent of children read to less frequently (table 3). Children who were read to frequently are also more likely than those who were not to count to 20 or higher (60 percent vs. 44 percent), to write their own names (54 percent vs. 40 percent), and to read or pretend to read (77 percent vs. 57 percent). Children who were read to frequently are nearly twice as likely as other children to show three or more skills associated with emerging literacy (42 percent vs. 24 percent). As other researchers have found, however, it is not only being read to that helps children learn. Children who were told stories three or more times in the last week are also more likely than those who were not to recognize all the letters of the alphabet (28 percent vs. 20 percent), to count to 20 or higher (60 percent vs. 54 percent), and to read or pretend to read (79 percent vs. 68 percent).

The results in table 3 suggest that teaching children songs or music is generally not associated with showing signs of emerging literacy. Only two associations are statistically significant. The first is the association between teaching songs or music and the children being able to write their names.` However, the association is opposite of what might be expected. The data suggest that children whose parents taught them songs or music three or more times in the last week are less likely to be able to write their own names than children who were taught songs or music less frequently (47 percent vs. 55 percent). The second is the association between teaching children songs or music and the children reading or pretending to read. Here the association is significant and in the expected direction.

Recall that table 1 showed that younger children are more likely than older children to be taught songs or music. Similarly, table 2 showed that younger children are less likely than older children to show each of the signs of emerging literacy, though the difference was smallest for reading and pretending to read. Thus, the generally weak association between teaching songs or music and signs of emerging literacy may be due to the overrepresentation of younger children among those who are taught songs or music three or more times in the last week. That is, whereas younger children are more likely than older children to be taught songs or music frequently, they are less likely to show signs of emerging literacy. It is possible that teaching songs and music fosters emerging literacy skills, but at a gradual pace. Alternatively, such activities may foster skills that are not measured in this report, but that are, nevertheless, important to children's healthy development. Doing arts and crafts with children frequently, like reading to them and telling them stories, is associated with acquiring literacy skills. For example, 28 percent of children whose families did arts and crafts with them three or more times in the last week recognize all the letters of the alphabet compared to 21 percent of children whose families did arts and crafts with them less frequently or not at all. Similarly, 42 percent of children whose families did arts and crafts with them three or more times in the last week show at least three signs of emerging literacy compared to 37 percent of children whose families did arts and crafts less frequently with them in the last week. Doing arts and crafts with children may stimulate literacy through the extended conversations that often occur during such activities (Snow 1991;Hall and Robinson 1995). Children whose families engage in several different types of literacy activities with them may be more likely than other children to show multiple signs of emerging literacy. This hypothesis is, in fact, borne out. Forty-three percent of children whose families engaged in three or more types of literacy activities with them in the last week show three or more signs of emerging literacy compared to 30 percent of children whose families shared fewer activities with them. Taken together, the results in table 3 are strong evidence that children whose families are engaged in literacy activities with them are more likely than other children to show each of the signs of emerging literacy and to show three or more such signs. The one exception is children whose families taught them songs or music frequently. As noted earlier, the generally weak association does not mean that teaching songs and music is unimportant to children. The weak association may be due to the fact that younger children are more likely than older children to be taught songs and music and are also less likely to show signs of emerging literacy.

At grade 8, unlike grade 4, many students did not attempt to answer the more complex questions that required them to write explanations or apply concepts in problem settings. The response rate to the Theme questions at grade 12 was somewhere between the rates observed for Ar.14fflaVrergelk grades 4 and 8, with most questions being attempted by at least 90 percent of the students. At all grade levels, students appeared to have difficulty with complex multistep problems, even those that required only simple computational skills at each step of the problem. At all grade levels, many students seemed to lack the mathematical knowledge needed to solve problems. Other students, however, appeared to understand the underlying mathematics but provided incorrect or incomplete responses as a result of carelessness, inexperience in writing out solutions to problems, or confusion over the wording of the question.

BEST COPY AVAILABLE introduction Involving America's students in community service activities is one of the objectives established under the third National Education Goal for the year 2000, which seeks to prepare students for responsible citizenship. Over the past 10 years, legislative initiatives have responded to and galvanized a growing national emphasis on increasing students' involvement with their -local communities and linking this service to academic study through servicelearning. Examples of initiatives that have mandated support for service-learning activities in elementary and secondary schools include the National and Community Service Act of 1990, the Serve America program and the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993, and the Learn and Serve America program (Corporation for National Service 1999). Although definitions of service-learning vary, for the purposes of this report, it is defined as \"an educational activity, program, or curriculum that seeks to promote students' learning through experiences associated with volunteerism or community service\" (Sheckley and Keeton 1997, 32). Proponents argue that involvement in servicelearning enhances education, revitalizes communities, and teaches the importance of community participation and democratic values. The National Service-Learning Cooperative states that \"service-learning is a teaching and learning method that connects meaningful community service experience with academic learning, personal growth, and civic responsibility\" (Mintz and Liu 1994, 12). Trends suggest that the percentage of American high school seniors who participated in \"community affairs or voluntary work\" in any given year was relatively stable from the mid-1970s through the early 1990s (Youniss and Yates 1997), and the percentage of 12-through 17-year-olds who volunteered in 1995 was similar to the percentage who volunteered in 1991 (Hodgkinson and Weitzman 1997). However, schools appear to have become more interested in promoting community service. In 1984, 27 percent of high schools offered community service opportunities to their 34 3 7 students, and by 1999, over 80 percent of public high schools were doing so (Newmann and Rutter 1985;Skinner and Chapman 1999). Although there are few studies of trends in service-learning based on student reports, some findings from school-level data do suggest that it has become more prevalent since the mid-1980s. In 1984, approximately 9 percent of all high schools had some form of service-learning, and in 1999, roughly 46 percent of public high schools were using at least some service-learning activities (Newmann and Rutter 1985;Skinner and Chapman 1999). Also, in 1999, 32 percent of all public schools (i.e., public schools at all levels) had service-learning. Among youth in 1996, 27 percent of students in grades 6 through 12 reported that at least part of their community service experience was incorporated into their curriculum in some way (Nolin, Chaney, and Chapman 1997). Together, these findings indicate that although America's youth are about as likely to participate in community service now as in the 1970s, schools have increasingly attempted to promote community service and to use service experiences to improve student education. The National Household Education Surveys of 1999(NHES:1999(NHES:1996 included nationally representative data on student reports of school practices, community service, and service-learning experiences at school, as well as data on student and school characteristics. Both NHES:1999 and NHES:1996 were conducted for the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Telephone interviews were conducted with 7,913 students in grades 6 through 12 (107 of whom were homeschoolers who were not included in this analysis) in 1999, and 8,043 students in grades 6 through 12 (103 of whom were homeschoolers who were not included in this analysis) in 1996. Information was also collected from parents of these student respondents. Data in this report regarding student and school characteristics are taken from these parent interviews."}, {"section_title": "NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS", "text": "alamammemwwwwztab-milDSMMMMET OIMPFPP7260.117 In this report, data from the NHES:1996 \"Youth Civic Involvement Interview\" were compared to data from the NHES:1999 \"Youth Interview\" to estimate changes across years in student reports of school practices to promote community service, student participation in community service activities, and service-learning experiences.

Although studies have suggested that advanced telecommunications and computers may be especially beneficial for students with disabilities (e.g., Johnson 1986), providing access to computers and advanced telecommunications for students with disabilities may be considerably more costly than providing access for students without disabilities, since students with disabilities may require alternative input/output devices or other costly adaptations. This issue brief focuses on school reports of access to advanced telecommunications for students who receive special education and related services. Such students are referred to as \"students with disabilities\" in the remainder of this issue brief. In 1996, a nationally representative survey conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) queried approximately 1,000 school administrators about the use of advanced telecommunications in their school. For this survey, advanced telecommunications were defined as modes of communication used to transmit information from one place to another, including broadcast and interactive television, networked computers, etc. This survey also included two questions about students with disabilities and their use of advanced telecommunications. The first question asked schools to report the percentage of students that received special education and related services. The survey found that in the fall of 1996, approximately 11 percent of students attending regular public elementary and secondary schools received special education and related services. The second question asked administrators to report the extent to which five barriers hindered the use of advanced telecommunications by students with disabilities. These data provide insights about the access of students with disabilities to advanced telecommunications.\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) fulfills a congressional mandate to collect and report \"statistics and information showing the condition and progress of education in the United States and other nations in order to promote and accelerate the improvement of American education.\"\nIntroduction:The Common Core of Data Surveys number of dropouts from grades 12, 11, 10, and 9 in the current and 3 preceding years, respectively. Because of the importance of the environment in which CCD data are first produced, NCES supports technical assistance activities that are peripheral to the CCD. These include comprehensive handbooks for elementary/secondary student and staff data. The Student Data Handbook was revised within the last year and will be updated annually.4 The Staff Data Handbook (Malitz 1995) will be revised by January 2001, with the same provision for annual review and revision. Financial Accounting for Local and State School Systems: 1990 (Fowler 1990) is undergoing substantial review in response to developments in program interests (e.g., better ability to reflect expenditures for technology or school safety) and new reporting recommendations from the Government Accounting Standards Board. In the area of information technology, NCES participates actively in the development of national data standards. The X-12 subcommittee of the American National Standards Institute approves standards for the electronic exchange of information about people. The X-12 subcommittee has approved the format for electronic student record exchange developed by NCES and the members of the Center's elementary and secondary education and postsecondary education data cooperatives. At present, NCES participates in X-12, continues a project to develop electronic data interchange (EDI) standards for the CCD, and has joined an education and vendor group that is creating extensible markup language (XML) standards for the information typically collected and used by schools and school districts. In the near future, NCES will be studying ways to better exploit the use of electronic data exchange in collecting and reporting administrative records data. The challenge will be to increase the timeliness of CCD data without threatening quality or adding to response burden. This effort can potentially challenge several of the CCD's basic operating principlesfor example, one suggestion has been to improve timeliness by publishing directory information before the statistical information is availablebut it will result in a better and more responsive survey system.\n\nBEST COPY AVAILABLE u en , a , an ra uate ounts y State: School Year 1998-99-    This article was originally published as a Statistics in Brief report. The universe data are from the \"National Public Education Financial Survey\" (NPEFS), part of the NCES Common Core of Data (CCD). Technical notes and definitions from the original report have been omitted. About $326 billion of revenues were raised by local, state, and federal governments to fund public education for grades prekindergarten through 12 in school year 1997-98. Current expenditures (those excluding construction. equipment, and debt financing) came to $285 billion. Three out of every five current expenditure dollars were spent on teachers, textbooks, and other instructional services and supplies. An average of $6,189 was spent on each studentan increase of 4.5 percent from $5,923 in school year 1996-97 (in unadjusted dollars). These and other financial data on public elementary and secondary education are collected and reported each year by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), U.S.\nTeachers' use of computers or the Internet at school varied for some types of uses by school poverty level (the percentage of students in the school eligible for free or reducedprice lunches). Teachers in schools with a school poverty level of less than 11 percent were more likely to use computers or the Internet a lot for creating instructional materials (52 percent) than teachers in schools with a school poverty level of 71 percent or more (32 percent). This pattern also held for teachers who used computers for administrative recordkeeping (43 vs. 24 percent for the same groups). How Do Teachers Direct Their Students to Use Computers and the Internet? Sixty-six percent of public school teachers reported using computers or the Internet for instruction during class time (table 2). Forty-one percent of teachers reported assigning students work that involved computer applications such as word processing and spreadsheets to a moderate or large extent; 31 percent of teachers reported assigning practice drills and 30 percent reported assigning research using the Internet to a moderate or large extent (table 2). The ways teachers direct students to use computers or the Internet varied by instructional level, school poverty level, and hours of professional development. Elementary school teachers were more likely than secondary school teachers to assign students practice drills using computers (39 vs. 12 percent) and to have their students use computers or the Internet to solve problems (31 vs. 20 percent). Secondary school teachers, however, were more likely to assign research using the Internet (41 vs. 25 percent). Teachers in the lowest poverty schools were more likely to report assigning students work involving computer applications, research using CD-ROMs, and research using the Internet to a moderate or large extent than teachers in the highest poverty schools (table 2). Teachers with more professional development in the use of computers and the Internet over the last 3 years were more 'Use computer applications such as word processing, spreadsheets, etc. 'Correspond with experts, authors, students from other schools, etc., via e-mail or Internet. 3Professional development in the use of computers or the Internet within the last 3 years. NOTE: Less than 1 percent of all public school teachers reported no computers or Internet were available to them anywhere in their school.These teachers were not included in the estimates presented in this likely to assign students various types of work involving computers or the Internet. For example, teachers with more than 32 hours of professional development were more likely to assign problem solving (41 percent) than were teachers with 0 hours (14 percent) or those with 1 to 8 hours (24 percent), graphical presentations (31 compared with 10 and 16 percent for the same groups), and demonstrations or simulations (29 compared with 8 and 13 percent for the same groups).\nFor the purposes of this report, low-income students were defined as those whose family income was below 125 percent of the federally established poverty level for their family size. Because the prices students pay and the financing strategies they adopt vary substantially with institutional level and control, students at public 4-year, private not-for-profit 4-year, and public 2-year institutions are examined separately. Within institution type, dependents, independents without dependents, and independents with dependents are also considered separately because their financial obligations are quite different, and they are treated differently by the financial aid system. The analysis relies primarily on the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) 1995-96 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:1996, but also uses selected data from NPSAS:1993 for comparison and data from the 1996 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:1996(BPS: /1998 to examine persistence.\nTrends in Undergraduate Borrowing:Federal Student Loans in 1989-90, 1992-93, and 1995 \ndifferences between part-time and full-time faculty and between male and female faculty were no longer found when other factors were taken into consideration,\" academic rank and highest degree earned remained significant factors in determining who teaches undergraduates exclusively (table B). Regardless of the type of 4-year institution, the faculty members' gender, race/ethnicity, age, teaching field, or employment status, those faculty or staff who were instructors, lecturers, and assistant professors were more likely than full professors to teach only undergraduate classes. Faculty who had a highest degree below a doctoral or professional degree were also more likely to teach undergraduates only than those with a doctoral or professional degree. While senior faculty (i.e., full or associate professors, or tenured faculty) were less likely to provide classroom instruction to undergraduates than were junior faculty (i.e., instructors, lecturers, assistant professors, or faculty working in a nontenure-track position), a majority of senior 'Tenure status was excluded from the multivariate regression model because of its high correlation with academic rank. faculty were, in fact, involved in undergraduate teaching. For example, at 4-year doctoral institutions, 64 percent of full-time associate professors reported teaching at least one class for credit to undergraduates, as did 61 percent of fulltime full professors and 65 percent of full-time tenured faculty (figure B). Moreover, between 38 and 41 percent of these faculty members said that all of the classes they taught were targeted at the undergraduate level. These results seem inconsistent with the perception that at research and doctoral universities, few senior faculty members are involved in undergraduate teaching.\n"}, {"section_title": "Student Reports of School Practices to Promote Community Service", "text": "In NHES:1996 and NHES:1999, students were asked whether their schools require and/or arrange community service activities (data were collected from January through early April for both administrations). Results were organized into four categories, depending on whether students attended schools that both required and arranged community service, required but did not arrange, arranged but did not require, or neither required nor arranged community service. Generally, there has been a slight but significant increase in the percentage of students in schools both requiring and arranging community service across years (table 1 and figure 1). Nineteen percent of students in 1999, compared to 16 percent of students in 1996, reported that their schools both required and arranged community service.

In 1996, Hispanic students (22 percent) were more likely than white students (15 percent) to attend schools that both require and arrange community service. By 1999, both black (22 percent) and Hispanic (28 percent) students were more likely to be in such schools than were white students (16 percent).

Still, there was a statistically significant increase across years in reports by public school students that their schools both required and arranged community service (14 percent in 1996 and 17 percent in 1999).\nFor both 1996 and 1999, students in public schools (47 percent in 1996 and 50 percent in 1999) were less likely to report participation in community service than students in church-related private schools (69 percent in 1996 and 72 percent in 1999) (table 2).

For the purposes of this report, participation in service-learning is defined operationally as a positive response to at least one of these three indicators.

Overall student participation in community service was 52 percent in 1999, up from 49 percent in 1996 (table 2). Roughly 3 in 10 students engaged in service-learning in 1999, which was not a statistically significant change from the 27 percent who engaged in service-learning in 1996 (estimates not shown in tables).

Of the three indicators of service-learning shown in table 3, in both 1999 and 1996, service-learning participants were more likely to say they talked about their service experience in class than to say they were required to keep a journal or write an essay for class, or to say that the service activity contributed to a class grade. A comparison of overall participation in community service activities with school practices (for both 1996 and 1999) supports findings reported in a previous NCES report that looked only at the 1996 NHES data (No lin, Chaney, and Chapman 1997). The 1996 and 1999 comparisons reveal that, in both years, students whose schools require and arrange or only arrange community service were more likely to participate in a community service activity than students whose schools only require or neither require nor arrange community service (table 2). It is probable that the low participation rates in community service among students whose schools only require it are due to the fact that not all students will have participated in community service within the last year, even though they might have fulfilled the requirement earlier or else planned to satisfy it later. These findings suggest that facilitation by schools is a factor in whether or not youth perform community service and also confirm the findings of Verba, Schlozman, and Brady (1995), which indicate that announcements of opportunities for participation often serve as a catalyst for volunteerism. In both years, a comparison of servicelearning participation with school practices (table 3) reveals that students who attend schools that both require and arrange community service (67 percent in 1996 and 70 percent in 1999) were more likely to engage in servicelearning than students who attend schools that only arrange (56 percent in 1996 and 1999) or neither require nor arrange community service (27 percent in 1996 and 34 percent in 1999). The same holds true generally for the three indicators of service-learning taken individually."}, {"section_title": "Differences by student characteristics", "text": "Students in grades 11 and 12 were more likely to participate in community service activities than students in grades 6 through 8 and students in grades 9 and 10, for both 1996 and 1999 (table 2).

Furthermore, parents' level of education appears to be inversely associated with servicelearning in that students whose parents have less education were significantly more likely to report service-learning experiences than students whose parents have higher levels of education. Results by parents' highest level of education were similar for each of the three indicators of servicelearning."}, {"section_title": "42", "text": "EDUCATION STATISTICS QUARTERLY -VOLUME 2, ISSUE 1, SPRING 2000 tweakiwommffla wommilimmoMW community service and over half of these participants were engaged in service-learning in both 1999 and 1996. Parents' highest level of education is positively associated with community service participation, whereas it is inversely associated with service-learning. With respect to race/ethnicity, white students were more likely to participate in community service, but of those students who did community service, white students were less likely than black and Hispanic students to participate in servicelearning at their schools. In addition, in 1999, white students were less likely than black and Hispanic students to report that their schools both require and arrange community service. Thus, it appears that black and Hispanic students, and students whose parents have less education, are more likely to be enrolled in schools that place greater emphasis on service-learning. Future research might examine the nature of these findings. Finally, as in 1996, the 1999 results indicate that school practices are significantly associated with community service participation rates and service-learning experiences among students. Students are more likely to have servicelearning experiences if their schools both require and arrange community service. Further, students are more likely to perform community service activities when their schools require and arrange or else only arrange community service. The low participation rates in community service among students whose schools only require it may be due to the fact that not all students will have participated in community service within the last year, even though they might have fulfilled the requirement earlier or else planned to satisfy it later. Changes in the racial/ethnic composition of students may alter the degree of heterogeneity of language and culture in the nation's schools. Although variety in student backgrounds and interests can enhance the learning environment, it can also create new or increased challenges for the schools. Knowledge of the shifting racial/ethnic distribution of public elementary and secondary students can give schools the foresight to plan for these challenges. Thirty-six percent of students enrolled in public elementary and secondary schools were considered part of a minority group in 1996, an increase of 12 percentage points from 1976 (not shown). This increase was largely due to the growth in the percentage of Hispanic students. Since 1970, black students have accounted for approximately one out of every three students who lived in central cities and attended public schools. In 1996, 10 percent of the students who lived in a metropolitan area outside of a central city and who attended public schools were black, up from 6 percent in 1970 (table 1).

About 5 out of every 100 young adults enrolled in high school in 1997 left school before October 1998 without successfully completing a high school program. This estimate of 4.8 percent (tables A and B) was similar to the estimates reported over the last 10 years, but lower than those reported in the early 1970s (figure A).

The event dropout rates of white students were not significantly different from those of black students. In 1998, young adults living in families with incomes in the lowest 20 percent of all family incomes were four times as likely as their peers from families in the top 20 percent of the income distribution to drop out of high school (table B). Although dropout rates were highest among students age 19 or older, about two-thirds (69 percent) of the current-year dropouts were ages 15 through 18; moreover, about one-third (34 percent) of the 1998 dropouts were ages 15 through 17 (table B)."}, {"section_title": "Status Dropout Rates", "text": "Over the last decade, between-350,000 and 550,000 10ththrough 12th-grade students left school each year without successfully completing a high school program.

In addition, Hispanic young adults in the United States continue to have higher status dropout rates than do either their white or black counterparts (tables A and C). In 1998, 4.1 percent of Asian/Pacific Islander young adults were status dropouts, compared with 29.5 percent of Hispanics, 13.8 percent of blacks, and 7.7 percent of whites (tables A and C).

The sample survey data are from the March Current Population Survey (CPS), conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The family environment in which a child lives affects many aspects of that child's life, including school performance. For example, research has shown that family characteristics, such as parents' educational attainment, number of children in the family, family income, and mother's employment status, are related to student achievement. Data on such family characteristics may help policymakers and educators to apply resources efficiently and to develop programs designed to increase learning. The educational attainment of parents of 6-to 12year-olds increased substantially between 1972 and 1997. For example, the percentage of 6-to 12-yearolds whose mothers completed at least high school increased from 66 to 84 percent (table 1 and figure  la), while the percentage whose fathers completed at least high school rose from 65 to 85 percent (not shown). The employment rate of mothers of 6-to 12-year-olds increased between 1972 and 1997, rising from 39 48 percent in 1972 to 66 percent in 1997. The employment rate of fathers decreased slightly, from 93 percent in 1972 to 91 percent in 1997 (table 1 and  figure lb). Despite the increase in mothers' employment, median family income (in constant 1997 dollars) remained relatively stable between 1972 and 1997 (not shown). The percentage of 6-to 12-year-olds who lived with only their mother doubled between 1972 and 1997, increasing from 12 to 24 percent. Conversely, the percentage who lived with two parents decreased from 87 to 71 percent during the same period (table 1  and figure 1c). In 1997, 6-to 12-year-olds had fewer other children in their household than their peers in 1972.

Reform initiatives. new technologies, and changing student populations have required teachers to learn new ways of presenting material and managing their classrooms. Teachers' initial professional training may not have prepared them adequately to meet current expectations, so continuing professional development is important. Teachers' selfassessments provide one indication of the extent to which preservice and on-the-job learning prepare them to meet the new demands. In 1998, the majority of public school teachers (71 percent) felt that they were very well prepared to maintain order and discipline in their classrooms (table 1). Fewer teachers felt that they were very well prepared to meet certain instructional requirements, including implementing new teaching methods (41 percent), implementing state or district curriculum and performance standards (36 percent), or using student performance assessment techniques (28 percent). Teachers were least likely to report that they felt very well prepared to integrate educational technology into their teaching methods (20 percent), or to address the needs of students with disabilities (21 percent) or of students with limited English proficiency or from diverse cultural backgrounds (20 percent).

Through the Internet, students are gaining access to many of the world's largest and best-equipped libraries and communicating with authors and experts around the worldall without leaving their school buildings. Brought about by the presence and application of telecommunications and technologies in classrooms, labs, and libraries, these opportunities are spreading at a rapid rate. Between 1994 and 1998, the proportion of regular public schools with Internet access increased from 35 to 89 percent . In fall 1996, 65 percent of public schools had Internet access , and 73 percent of these schools indicated that students had access to the Internet, either through e-mail, newsgroups, or the World Wide Web. The proportion of students with disabilities attending regular public schools with Internet access was similar to that for students without disabilities. In fall 1996, 51 percent of students with disabilities and 51 percent of students without disabilities attended regular public schools where students had access to the Internet (table 1). Are There Barriers to the Use of Advanced Telecommunications by Students With Disabilities? Public schools were asked about five possible barriers to the use of their advanced telecommunications resources by students with disabilities. The factor schools were most likely to cite as a moderate or major barrier (47 percent) was special education teachers not being sufficiently trained in using advanced telecommunications' (table 2). Fewer public schools cited not having enough computers available to students with disabilities (34 percent), not having enough computers with alternative input/output devices for students with disabilities (38 percent), and inadequate evaluation and support services to meet the special technology needs of students with disabilities (39 percent). I A survey in 1995 found that 61 percent of schools reported lack of or inadequately trained staff as a major or moderate barrier to using advanced telecommunications in all schools , and a 1998 survey found that 20 percent of regular classroom teachers in public schools reported feeling \"very well prepared\u00b0t o integrate technology into classroom instruction (Lewis et al.1999). .

For example, the proportion of regular public schools reporting insufficient training of special education teachers in the use of advanced telecommunications as a moderate or major barrier was 37 percent for schools with the fewest poor students compared to 58 percent for schools with the highest proportion of poor students.' School size, but not the percentage of students with disabilities (table 2), was related to the likelihood of reporting some of the five factors as moderate or major barriers. Large schools (those with enrollments of 1,000 or more students) were more likely than small schools (enrollments under 300 students) to report lack of alternative input/output devices and insufficient training in advanced telecommunications among special education teachers as moderate or major barriers to the use of the school's advanced telecommunications resources by students with disabilities. 'This pattern was evident for four of the five barriers by the poverty measure.The exception was whether administrators saw advanced telecommunications as relevant for the instruction of disabled students. As discussed above, the barrier to providing access to advanced telecommunications for students with disabilities most frequently cited by schools was lack of sufficiently trained special education teachers. One item on the questionnaire asked school administrators to report on the type of advanced telecommunications training available to all teachers at their school. Responses to the two items (types of training available to all teachers, and administrators' perceptions of lack of training of special education teachers) were examined to see if they were related. Public schools in which participation in advanced telecommunications training for all teachers was encouraged by incentives were less likely to report that lack of training for special education teachers was a moderate or major barrier than other schools. Thirty-seven percent of schools with incentives for all teachers to participate in telecommunications training reported special education teacher training as a moderate or major barrier, compared to 50 percent of schools where training for all teachers was mandated and 52 percent of schools in which training for all teachers was left up to the initiative of the individual teacher (table 3).

Sixty-three percent of the nation's public schools were connected to the Internet by dedicated lines, 14 percent used dial-up connections, and 23 percent of schools used other connection types, which included ISDN, wireless connections, and 58 cable modems (table 2). Secondary schools (77 percent) and schools with the lowest concentration of poverty (72 percent) were more likely to connect to the Internet using dedicated lines than elementary schools (60 percent) and schools with the highest concentration of poverty (50 percent)."}, {"section_title": "How Are Public Schools Funding Advanced Telecommunications?", "text": "Measuring funding is difficult as schools receive support for advanced telecommunications programs from a myriad of sources.

NCES has also collected information on teacher training in advanced telecommunications; a report on this topic is scheduled to be released in summer 2000.  Itirecent years, interest in increasing the use of technology in elementary and secondary education has grown. Numerous initiativesboth public and privatehave provided discounted or free computers and Internet access to schools and have encouraged the provision of technology-focused teacher professional development and training (Trotter 1999). These initiatives were predicated on the expectation that the use of technology in education can lead to a number of beneficial outcomes. In Getting America's Students Ready for the 21st Century, for example, the U.S. Department of Education (1996) asserts that technology has the potential to enhance the achievement of all students, increase families' involvement in their children's schooling, improve teachers' skills and knowledge, and improve school administration and management. To track changes in the availability of and access to technology, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) since 1994 has conducted a series of surveys of public and private elementary and secondary schools.

However, while frequent discussions with mothers varied little with parents' education, discussions with fathers increased as parents' highest education rose. About 34 percent of first-generation students, 41 percent of students whose parents had some college, and 50 percent of students whose parents were college graduates reported having frequent discussions with their fathers about their high school programs. Perhaps because they were more likely to come from singleparent homes, first-generation students reported frequently discussing their high school programs more often with their friends (49 percent) than with their fathers (34 percent). The same was not observed for students whose parents were college graduates; among these students, roughly half reported frequently discussing their high school programs with either their friends or fathers."}, {"section_title": "In high school", "text": "Confirming the results found in the eighth grade, when 1992 high school graduates were asked in the 12th grade how they chose their high school programs, first-generation students were less likely than students whose parents were college graduates to report choosing their programs with their parents (34 vs. 48 percent). At the same time, firstgeneration students were no more likely to report choosing their high school programs with a teacher or counselor, or with friends."}, {"section_title": "Planning for college", "text": "In understanding what is required for college admission and navigating the application process, first-generation students may receive little assistance from their parents, who have had no direct experience in the process.

Yet, with two exceptionsgetting school assistance in applying for financial aid and obtaining counselors' assistance in choosing a 12th-grade mathematics classthere was little evidence that first-generation students received help from the school more often than did students whose parents were college graduates. Moreover, the two instances in which first-generation students were more likely to receive school help came very late in their high school programs."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The findings from this analysis indicate that first-generation students consistently trailed their counterparts whose parents were college graduatesand, to some degree, those whose parents had some college but less than a bachelor's degreein participating in curricular activities linked to college enrollment. This remained true when controlling for academic preparation and other family background characteristics. That is, even high-achieving first-generation students were less likely to take algebra in the eighth grade and less likely to complete advanced high school mathematics courses. Correspondingly, college-qualified firstgeneration students with academic credentials similar to those whose parents graduated from college enrolled in 4-year colleges and other types of postsecondary education at lower rates than their counterparts. However, when controlling for mathematics proficiency and parents' education, first-generation students increased their likelihood of completing advanced high school mathematics courses by taking algebra in the eighth grade (figure B). Taking advanced mathematics courses in high school, in 86 89 ,Ltr..2-11,t211,11%rrfaUSWAMT:ZMIZEiii turn, more than doubled their chances of enrolling in a 4-year college. The data also indicated that parent involvement was strongly associated with students' taking algebra in eighth grade, taking advanced-level mathematics courses in high school, and subsequent enrollment in postsecondary education. This remained true after controlling for parents' education, mathematics proficiency, and family background characteristics. Therefore, it is possible that providing firstgeneration students and their parents with more information about choosing courses to better prepare students for college might help these students better navigate the path to higher education. The 1992 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965 contained provisions that mandated institutions participating in Title IV student assistance programs to meet significantly more rigorous eligibility conditions than were previously required. These provisions were added in an attempt to reduce fraud and abuse in the student aid programs. Since then, additional legislative and regulatory oversight mechanisms have been implemented. For-profit institutionsoften called proprietary or private career schoolswere an intended focus of these changes. For-profit institutions have been influenced by these changes more than any other segment of the postsecondary education community. This sector's share of federal Stafford subsidized loan dollars awarded has declined from a peak of 28 percent in 1988-89 to 8 percent in 1995-96 (The College Board 1998). Between fiscal year (FY) 1992 and FY 94, the number of for-profit institutions participating in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program decreased by 14 percent. Furthermore, the share of federal Pell Grants awarded to students attending for-profit institutions fell from 19 percent in 1992-93 to 13 percent in 1995-96 (The College Board 1998). In light of these changes, it is important to explore how students at private for-profit institutions may have been affected. Except as noted, all findings reported below apply to students at less-than-4-year institutions. Other less-than -4year institutions are defined as public and private, not-forprofit institutions. Comparisons are made between the years 1992-93 and 1995-96.\nThis PEQIS report presents findings for the 12-month 1997-98 academic year about the status of distance education in all postsecondary education institutions. It also 3The first PEQIS study, conducted in fall 1995, sometimes asked for information about the current time frame (i.e., fall 1995) and sometimes asked for information about academic year 1994-95.Thus, both dates appear in the discussion of the results. 41n the 1997-98 survey, the wording used to describe the computer-based technologies was changed to more accurately reflect how these technologies are used.

In the most general terms, it finds that distance education appears to have become a common feature of many postsecondary education institutions and that, by their own accounts, it will become only more common in the future. While findings from this report will help to inform stakeholdersincluding individuals considering a postsecondary education, faculty and administrators at postsecondary institutions, providers of technologies used for distance education, and policymakers at federal, state, and local levelsthey do not address many of the questions about distance education. These questions include issues related It is a dynamic time for postsecondary education institutions facing the opportunities and challenges brought by technological innovation. As Gladieux and Swail (1999) assert, given the fact that computer and related technologies are evolving so quicklyand new providers and brokers of higher education proliferating so rapidlyno one knows how traditional higher education will change.\nMany of the differences in the enrollment experiences of beginning students at private for-profit and at public lessthan-4-year institutions reflect the differences in the type of program in which they were enrolled. Eighty percent of the students in the private for-profit institutions began in vocational certificate programs, while about 80 percent of the students in the public institutions began in associate's degree programs, which take longer to complete. Nevertheless, the attainment rates for both vocational certificates and associate's degrees were much higher for students who began in private for-profit institutions."}, {"section_title": "Profile of Students", "text": "Students attending less-than-4-year, for-profit institutions in 1995-96 primarily were white (58 percent), age 23 or younger (46 percent), and female (67 percent).

(1999). Students at Private, For-Profit Institutions (NCES 2000-175). For additional details on survey methodology, see As the school-age population in the United States grows and teachers from the baby-boom generation begin to retire, school administrators and policymakers anticipate an increasing shortage of elementary and secondary school teachers. Although some reports indicate that in the late 1990s relatively more college students have been interested in teaching than were in the early 1980s (Feistritzer 1999;Tabor 1999), increasing anecdotal evidence also suggests that schools and districts are finding it difficult to locate teachers to staff their classrooms (Colvin 1998;Mundy 1999;Schultze and Zahn 1998). In times of teacher shortage, administrators may not feel that they can wait to find well-qualified graduates. First-time teachers are a large source of newly hired teachers for both public and private schools, accounting for 53 percent of new hires in public schools and 42 percent in private schools in 1990-91. In particular, one-third of new hires in public schools and one-fifth of new hires in private schools entered teaching straight out of college. Another 20 percent of both public and private school new hires were college graduates who had been doing other work between graduating from college and becoming teachers (Rollefson and Broughman 1995). Thus, new graduates are an important source of the teacher supply, and the rate at which they become teachers is important to those who staff U.S. classrooms. Which new college graduates become teachers, however? Persistent discrepancies between the demographics of the teacher and student populationswith teachers considerably less likely than students to be of racial/ethnic minority backgroundsconcern some parents, educators, and policymakers. Currently, there is limited empirical evidence regarding the question of whether student achievement would improve if teacher demographics more closely resembled student demographics. However, some researchers have identified teachers who have been particularly effective with African-American children and have found that they tend \" . . . to contextualize teaching, helping students build bridges linking their everyday experiences to new knowledge\" (Darling-Hammond, Dilworth, and Bullmaster 1997). Another noted characteristic of these teachers is their tendency to use teaching practices that are consistent with African-American cultural norms (Ladson-Billings 1994). Such researchers argue that increasing the proportion of teachers who have direct knowledge of minority group cultural norms will enhance the achievement of minority children both through their teaching and by informing nonminority teachers' practice. In addition to the issue of teacher race/ethnicity, policymakers and school administrators at all levels are concerned about the quality of teachers' subject matter knowledge and preparation in pedagogical techniques.  and Brewer 1995;Ferguson 1998;Ferguson and Ladd 1996) and that teachers' mathematics expertise is associated with their students' mathematics achievement (Monk 1994;Rowan et al. 1997). However, research conducted in the 1980s and 1990s indicated that college graduates with higher standardized test scores were less likely than lower scoring graduates to teach and that higher scoring graduates who did teach were more likely than their lower scoring counterparts to leave teaching (Murnane et al. 1991;Schlecty and Vance 1983). Research into this issue has continued, with somewhat mixed results (Bruschi and Coley 1999;Gitomer, Latham, and Ziomek 1999). This report describes teachers' preparation in terms of their undergraduate grade-point averages overall and in their major field of study, whether they completed pedagogical training required for teacher certification, the degree to which they studied the academic fields they teach, and their college entrance examination test scores. This report is the second in a series of reports that follows 1992-93 college graduates' progress through the teacher pipeline using data from the 1993 Baccalaureate and Beyond *}..ongitudinal Study (B&B:1993/1997 Teaching (Henke, Geis, and Giambattista 1996), focused on graduates' forays into teaching as of 1 year after college graduation. Like Out of the Lecture Hall, this second report focuses on the academic characteristics and preparation for teaching of those who took various steps toward teaching and is organized by a conceptual \"teacher pipeline\" that represents a teacher's career. The pipeline includes preparatory activitiesconsidering teaching, student teaching as an undergraduate, becoming certified to teach, applying for teaching jobsas well as teaching experiences and plans for teaching in the future. The report first examines the rate at which graduates with varying demographic and academic characteristics entered the teacher pipeline and continues by describing the steps that pipeline entrants took toward teaching and the experiences of those who taught. The final section discusses both the rate at which those who had taught since completing the 1992-93 degree had stopped teaching and all pipeline members' expectations for teaching in the future. Future reports will continue to follow this cohort into and out of teaching, studying how many graduates enter the pipeline after 1997, how long those who teach remain in the profession, and whether those who 92 ,egt 4'7'4 :41 teach and leave return to the classroom later in their working lives.\n'In the remainder of the report, institutions that are eligible for Title IV federal financial aid will be designated simply as'eligible.' Title IV eligibility is based on lists of eligible institutions maintained by the Department of Education's Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE). 3In 1995, the Title IV eligible, degree-granting universe included approximately 5 percent more institutions than were included in the universe of institutions that were accredited at the college level. Most of the institutions that were added to the new reporting universe were private for-profit institutions with relatively small student enrollments.Therefore, it is estimated that the total enrollment of the Title IV eligible, degree-granting universe is approximately 0.1 percent larger that that of the former 'accredited\" universe. More information on how this change in universe definition has affected fall enrollment counts may be found in Barbett 11998)."}, {"section_title": "Entering the Teacher Pipeline", "text": "For some 1992-93 college graduates, the 1992-93 degree was a second bachelor's degree. Among such graduates were those who had prepared to teach or had taught without preparing prior to receiving the 1992-93 degree. For the purposes of this analysis, the 3 percent of graduates who had taught before receiving the degree or had become certified 1 year or more before receiving the degree were excluded from the population of graduates under study. The remaining 97 percent of 1992-93 college graduates, who were eligible to enter the teacher pipeline, are referred to as \"graduates\" or \"bachelor's degree recipients.\" Graduates were identified as having entered the teacher pipeline when they reported that they had taught in an elementary or secondary school, had become certified to teach, had applied for a teaching position, or were considering teaching at the time of either the 1994 or the 1997 interview. In 1994,1 year after completing the 1992-93 degree, one-quarter of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients had entered the teacher pipeline (figure A). By 1997,4 years after completing the degree, more than one-third (36 percent) had done so. The proportion of graduates who had taught also increased between 1994 and 1997: by 1994, 8 percent of graduates had taught, and by 1997, 13 percent had done so. As has been true historically (Murnane et al. 1991), men were less inclined than women to enter the pipeline. In addition, Asian/Pacific Islander graduates were less inclined to do so than were graduates of other racial/ethnic backgrounds. Graduates who had majored in education were highly likely to enter the pipeline, and the majority had taught: 84 percent of education majors had entered the pipeline, and 58 percent of education majors had taught by 1997. About one-fifth to nearly one-half of graduates who had majored in other fields as undergraduates had entered the pipeline. Graduates whose college entrance examination (CEE) scores fell in the top quartile among 1992-93 college graduates were less likely than those in the bottom quartile to enter the teacher pipeline (32 percent versus 41 percent). In particular, whereas 3 percent of graduates in the top quartile had prepared to teach but not taught, 6 percent of graduates in the bottom quartile had done so. Similarly, 6 percent of graduates in the top quartile had prepared and taught, compared with 12 percent in the bottom quartile.' Graduates in the top quartile were about twice as likely as those in the bottom quartile to teach without having prepared, however. In contrast to the relationships between CEE scores and teaching in this cohort, the pipeline entry rate was positively related to graduates' grade-point averages (GPAs), both cumulative and in their undergraduate majors. Whereas 40 percent of graduates with GPAs of 3.75 or higher, both cumulative and in their majors, entered the pipeline, 32 percent of graduates with GPAs lower than 2.75 did so. Furthermore, graduates with top GPAs were more likely than graduates with GPAs of less than 2.75 to have prepared to teach (whether or not they had taught). This is at least partly a function of differences in GPAs among graduates who had majored in different fields. Education majors, who were more inclined to prepare to teach and actually teach, also had higher undergraduate GPAs, both overall and in their majors, than those who had majored in business/management; mathematics, computer science, or the natural sciences; and the social sciences (Henke, Geis, and Giambattista 1996)."}, {"section_title": "Working in Schools and Classrooms", "text": "By 1997, 1992-93 college graduates who first taught within 4 years of receiving their bachelor's degree could have taught in several schools, and they were asked about as many as six different schools. Between receiving their bachelor's degrees and the 1997 interview, most (83 percent) had worked only in public schools, far fewer (13 percent) only in private schools, and a small percentage (4 percent) in both public and private schools. Graduates with CEE scores in the top quartile were more likely than those with scores in the bottom quartile to have taught only in private schools (26 percent vs. 10 percent). Previous research indicates that graduates with higher CEE scores were more likely to have taught only at the secondary level (Gitomer, Latham, and Ziomek 1999), and B&B:1993/ 1997 data are consistent with those findings. Graduates in the top quartile of scores were more likely than their peers in the bottom quartile to have taught only at the secondary level and less likely to have taught only at the elementary level (figure B). However, grades in college, both overall and within graduates' major fields of study, were not associated with the level at which graduates taught.

About 12 percent of these new full-time general elementary teachers believed their workloads were more difficult than those of other teachers in their schools. Full-time general elementary teachers who had left teaching by April 1997 were not, on average, responsible for more students in their most recent semester of teaching than those who were still teaching. Moreover, as compared with their colleagues who were still teaching in April 1997, those who left were no more likely to report that their workloads were more difficult than those of other teachers in their schools. Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, those who taught single subjects full time in their most recent semester of teaching taught an average of six periods per day in a total of two subject areas. Those who worked in secondary schools were responsible for an average of 116 students, whereas those who taught in elementary schools were responsible for an average of 91 students.

Graduates in all job categories but clerical staff, personal and service workers, and social work areas had higher average annual salaries than did those who worked as K-12 teachers.

Of these, 97.3 percent were enrolled in institutions that awarded at least an associate's degree. Over three-fourths of all students were enrolled in public institutions, of which 98.5 percent attended degreegranting institutions and 1.5 percent were enrolled in non-degree-granting institutions. About 21 percent of students in eligible degree-granting institutions were enrolled in private non-profit schools, and about 2 percent were in private for-profit schools. Of those students enrolled in non-degree-granting institutions, 48 percent were enrolled in private for-profit institutions. About 3 percent of students enrolled in eligible postsecondary institutions were nonresident aliens (individuals who are in the United States on temporary visas). Of the citizens and resident aliens enrolled in eligible postsecondary institutions, 72.8 percent were white; 11.3 percent were black, non-Hispanic; 8.8 percent were Hispanic; 6.1 percent were Asian/Pacific Islander; and 1.0 percent were American Indian/Alaska Native. As shown by the racial/ethnic distribution of U.S. citizens and resident aliens in table B, minority' students represented a higher proportion of the enrollment at non-degree-granting postsecondary institutions than at degree-granting institutions. The distribution of students by racial/ethnic background varied considerably by level, participation status, and type of institution. For example, blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives comprised a higher percentage of undergraduate enrollment than graduate or first-professional enrollments. Further, a higher percentage of blacks and whites were enrolled as first-time, firstyear students than at the total undergraduate level.  Asians/Pacific Islanders, on the other hand, comprised 11.0 percent of all first-professional students, but only 6.0 percent of undergraduate and 4.7 percent of graduate students. In 1997, a larger percentage of all students in degreegranting institutions (55.9 percent) were women. Similarly, the majority of undergraduate (56.1 percent) and graduate (56.8 percent) students were women (table C). However, women made up only 43.1 percent of firstprofessional students. Within each of the racial/ethnic 100 , I 0 groups, women composed the majority of all undergraduates as well as first-time, first-year undergraduates. Similarly, at the postbaccalaureate level, women made up over half of the graduate students in each racial/ethnic category, although Asian women were a bare majority, comprising 50.7 percent of all Asian graduate students. It is also notable that more than two-thirds of all black graduate students were women. However, at the firstprofessional level, the picture is quite different for all racial/ethnic groups except blacks. While women accounted for just 41.4 percent of white first-professional students, 46.5 percent of Asian students, 44.9 percent of Hispanic students, and 46.2 percent of American Indians, they accounted for 56.9 percent of black first-professional students. Most students (58.2 percent) were enrolled on a full-time basis (table D). Hispanic students, however, were more likely to enroll part time than whites or other minorities: about half (49.6 percent) of all Hispanic students attended school part time. However, at the first-professional and graduate levels, Hispanic students were more likely to enroll on a full-time basis than black or white students. Asian/Pacific Islander students were more likely than students of any other racial/ethnic group to attend full time at both the undergraduate (61.0 percent) and graduate levels (51.0 percent). Hispanics and American Indians/Alaska Natives were a smaller percentage of 4-year college enrollment and a larger percentage of 2-year college enrollment than might be expected from the overall distribution of enrolled students by race/ethnicity. Additionally, blacks and Hispanics made up almost 30 percent of the total enrollment in for-profit, eligible, degree-granting institutions compared with about 15 percent of the enrollment in private non-profit institutions and 20 percent of the enrollment in public institutions. Although non-degreegranting institutions enrolled only 2.7 percent of all students attending eligible postsecondary institutions, they enrolled a higher percentage of black (4.9 percent) and Hispanic (4.5 percent) students. Data on median age (table E) show that in addition to undergraduates being youngest overall, first-professional students are younger than graduate students. Indeed, in fall 1997, 64 percent of undergraduates were under 25, with a median age of 21.8. In comparison, 37.3 percent of first-professional students were under 25 (with a median age of 26.2), and 15.3 percent of graduate students were under 25 (with a median age of 30.6). Among undergraduate students, full-time students were significantly younger than part-time students. About 82 percent of full-time undergraduates were under 25 compared with 38 percent of part-time undergraduates, and there was a differential in median age of almost 8 years between full-time and part-time undergraduates. The median age of a full-time undergraduate in 1997 was 20.4 while the median age of a part-time undergraduate was 28.0. Women undergraduates, overall, were slightly older than men undergraduates, by about half a year, on average. The greatest difference in age between men and women undergraduates was evidenced among part-time students, with women being approximately 2 years older than their male counterparts. Interestingly, women first-professional students were slightly younger (median age 25.6), on  average, than their male counterparts (median age 26.5), while women graduate students were slightly older (median age 30.9) than men graduate students (median age 30.2). Fall 1997 enrollment data tend to confirm the notion that 2-year institutions serve an older population than 4-year schools. The median age of 4-year undergraduates in 1997 was 21, while the median age of 2-year college students was 24."}, {"section_title": "Changes in Enrollment Between 1996 and 1997", "text": "Between 1996 and 1997, enrollment in higher education institutions increased by 0.9 percent.

Overall, there was also an increase in the numbers of students attending 2-year institutions due totally to increases at public 2-year institutions. In private nonprofit and private for-profit 2-year institutions, total enrollment declined between 1996 and 1997. The numbers of white students and nonresident aliens declined overall, while the numbers of all other students increased. In private non-profit institutions, smaller numbers of whites, blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, and nonresident aliens resulted in an overall 4.8 percent decrease in the number of students enrolled. In private for-profit institutions, decreases in the numbers of whites, Asians or Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives were largely offset by increases in the numbers of blacks and Hispanics, and a 50 percent increase in nonresident alien enrollment. The increase in enrollment between 1996 and 1997 occurred at undergraduate and graduate student levels although at different rates. Undergraduate enrollment increased by 1.0 percent and graduate enrollment increased by .6 percent, while enrollment in first-professional schools did not change. Among undergraduates, there were increased numbers of men and women, fulland part-time students, and U.S. citizens and resident aliens (all races), although there were substantial differences in the rates of increases. Only the number of nonresident aliens decreased. The overall static level of enrollment in first-professional schools does not reflect the detailed changes. The number of whites, blacks, and Hispanics decreased while the number of Asians/Pacific Islanders and American Indians/ Alaska Natives increased. The number of women enrolled at the first-professional level increased by 2.4 percent while the number of men decreased by 1.8 percent. Additionally, while first-professional enrollments in public institutions went up, they went down in both private nonprofit and private for-profit institutions. At the graduate level, minorities, nonresident aliens, and women increased their share of graduate enrollment between 1996 and 1997. Even so, minorities comprised only 17 percent of the graduate student enrollment compared to their 27 percent share of undergraduate enrollment."}, {"section_title": "Enrollments by State", "text": "The distribution of minority enrollment by state largely reflects the distribution of minority residents within each state. To illustrate, in 1997, states differed greatly in the distribution of minority and white students. For example, in California less than half of the students enrolled in colleges and universities were white, while blacks, who represent 10.7 percent of enrollments nationally, composed only 7.8 percent of California's enrollment. By comparison, Hispanics made up 20.7 percent of California's enrollment, and Asians or Pacific Islanders, 17.8 percent. Conversely, in Alabama, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, and South Carolina, blacks' share of enrollment ranged from 22.6 to 31.0 percent, which was more than double their national enrollment share. In New Mexico and Texas, Hispanics composed 33.6 and 21.7 percent of total enrollment, respectively, compared with their 8.4 percent share of enrollment in the nation as a whole. In Hawaii, Asians/Pacific Islanders composed 60.7 percent of total enrollment, while in Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and South Dakota, American Indians/Alaska Natives had a significant share of total enrollment (4.0 percent to 11.2 percent) compared with 1.0 percent nationally. While there was very little change in enrollment between 1996 and 1997 (.9 percent increase), 16 states and the District of Columbia experienced decreases in enrollment. Nebraska had the largest percentage decrease (7.6 percent), while Minnesota and North Dakota experienced declines in enrollment of over 5 percent. Washington State posted the largest percentage increase in enrollment (3.9 percent), followed by Utah (3.7 percent), Mississippi (3.6 percent), Arkansas (3.4 percent), Nevada (3.3 percent), Missouri (3.2 percent), and California (3.1 percent). The District of Columbia and five of the states that had a decline in total enrollment between 1996 and 1997 also had a decrease in the number of minority students enrolled in institutions in their states, and one state with an overall increase had a decrease in minority enrollment (Iowa). In most states, however, the percentage increase in minority enrollment was much greater than the percentage increase in total enrollment. For example, Arkansas had a 3.4 percent increase in total enrollment and a 9.4 percent increase in minority enrollment. Reference Barbett, S. (1998).

Graduate/first-professional degree programs were most likely to be offered in business and management, the health professions, education, and engineering."}, {"section_title": "Distance education technologies employed", "text": "Changes in the types of technologies available for delivering distance education, including changes in the capabilities of networking technology and the rise of the Internet, have played a role in the adoption of distance education by postsecondary institutions. This report provides information about the types of technologies employed by all postsecondary institutions to deliver distance education in 1997-98. To provide insight into the dynamic nature of distance education technologies, the report also includes 120 information about institutions' plans for the use of different technologies in the next 3 years. According to the 1997-98 PEQIS survey: While postsecondary education institutions employed a wide variety of distance education technologies during 1997-98, more institutions that offered distance education courses were likely to use several types of video technologies and the Internet-based technologies than any other modes of delivery included in the survey. Specifically, asynchronous Internet instruction, two-way interactive video, and one-way prerecorded video were used by more institutions than any other distance education technologies. Two-way interactive video was more likely to be used by public 4-year institutions (80 percent) than by any other type of institution, and by public 2-year institutions (53 percent) more than private 4-year institutions (29 percent). One-way prerecorded video was more likely to be used by public 2-year institutions (62 percent) than by either public or private 4-year institutions, and by public 4-year institutions (44 percent) more often than by private 4-year institutions (26 percent). The Internet technologies, however, were generally about equally likely to be used by the various types of institutions, ranging from 16 percent to 22 percent for synchronous Internet instruction, and from 57 percent to 61 percent for asynchronous Internet instruction. Institutions that offered distance education in 1997-98 or that planned to offer distance education in the next 3 years reported that they planned to start using or increase their use of Internet-based technologies and two-way interactive video in the next 3 years more than any other types of technologies. This suggests that Internet and interactive video technologies will be a growing mode of delivery among postsecondary institutions."}, {"section_title": "Tuition and fees", "text": "While distance education can be seen as a cost savings approach to providing postsecondary education, the costs in developing, implementing, and delivering distance education courses can also be substantial. One might expect that institutions might pass these costs or cost savings on by charging different tuition and fees to students enrolled in distance education courses. To examine this issue, this report provides information about how tuition and fees for distance education courses compare to those for traditional campus-based courses. Analyses are presented by institutional type. Findings from the 1997-98 PEQIS survey indicate that: About three-quarters of institutions that offered any distance education courses in 1997-98 charged the same tuition for these courses as for comparable oncampus courses. Public 2-year institutions were more likely than public or private 4-year institutions to indicate that tuition charges were always the same for distance education and on-campus courses, with 90 percent of public 2-year institutions giving this response. Two-thirds of institutions offering distance education courses in 1997-98 reported that they did not add special fees to their college-level, credit-granting distance education courses that were not added to on-campus courses. Overall, 57 percent of institutions are charging both comparable tuition and comparable fees for distance education and on-campus courses. Changes in distance education since 1994-95 While this report primarily presents findings on various aspects of distance education for all postsecondary institu-V tions for 1997-98, an analysis of the data for the subset of higher education institutions allows trend comparisons with the previous NCES report on distance education. Changes in distance education since 1994-95' are presented in this report in terms of the percentage of institutions offering distance education courses, the number of distance education courses offered, the number of enrollments in distance education courses, the availability of distance education degree and certificate programs, and the technologies used to deliver distance education courses. Findings indicate that: Between fall 1995 and 1997-98, the percentage of higher education institutions offering distance education courses increased by about one-third, from 33 percent to 44 percent. From 1994-95 to 1997-98, the number of course offerings and enrollments in distance education approximately doubled. And, although the percentages of institutions offering distance education degree and certificate programs were essentially the same in 1997-98 as in 1995, the number of degree and certificate programs that were offered nearly doubled. Taken together, these findings suggest that the expansion in distance education appears to be among institutions that have offered distance education for the past 3 years. These institutions have substantially increased the number of distance education courses, enrollments, and degree and certificate programs that they offer. Among all higher education institutions offering any distance education, the percentages of institutions using two-way interactive video and one-way prerecorded video were essentially the same in 1997-98 as in 1995. The percentage of institutions using asynchronous Internet-based technologies, however, nearly tripled, from 22 percent of institutions in 1995 to 60 percent of institutions in 1997-98.4"}, {"section_title": "National Household Education Survey", "text": "This report contains the first release of information from the \"Adult Education Interview\" of NHES:1999 on the educational activities of adults in the United States from early 1998 to early 1999. The report focuses on the growth in participation in adult education activities and the extent to which participation is related to educational attainment. This analysis corroborates findings from previous studies showing that when an overall measure of participation is used, higher levels of participation are associated with higher levels of educational attainment (Courtney 1992;Cross 1984;Darkenwald and Merriam 1982;Kim et al. 1995;Merriam and Caffarella 1991).

NOTE Percents for different types of adult education sum to more than the overall participation rate because some adults participate in more than one type of activity or program. found in earlier studies may be driven by the fact that much of adult education is work related, and those with higher education are the most likely to take work-related courses. NHES:1999 was a random-digit-dialed (RDD) telephone survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the 50 states and the District of Columbia conducted from January 3 through April 3 of 1999. For the \"Adult Education Interview,\" the population of interest was civilian, noninstitutionalized adults age 16 and older who were not enrolled in elementary or secondary school at the time of the interview. What Is \"Adult Education\"? Adult education is a diverse arena defined in a variety of ways (Cross 1984;Elias and Merriam 1984;Knowles 1980;Merriam and Caffarella 1991;Peters et al. 1991). Some regard adult education as noncompulsory or voluntary learning activities constituting a continuous learning process throughout life (Belanger and Tuijnman 1997). Others include required activities in their definition because a fairly large proportion Of adults are required to participate in work-related adult education for continuing professional development purposes (Cervero 1989). Yet another way of defining adult education includes not only formal coursework, but also informal educational activities. In those definitions, informal educational activities are those that do not involve an instructor. NHES:1999 incorporates a broad approach, originally devised for use in NHES:1995 (Kim et al. 1995), to the range of activities that may be considered adult education. These include voluntary and required educational activities that are formal, as defined by the presence of an instructor. Informal learning activities are excluded. In NHES:1995 and NHES:1999,' respondents were asked about six types of adult education in the following order: English as a Second Language (ESL)Zclasses for adults whose main language is not English to develop the English language skills necessary to pursue further education, to enter or advance in the job 'In NHES:1991, an approach based on previous Current Population Survey (CPS) collections was used. Adults were asked about their full-time and part-time participation in nine educational activities presented in list form.This approach was modified for NHES:1995 and NHES:1999, as discussed in the text. 2ln the NHES:1999 survey administration, interviews were conducted in English and Spanish.

Credential programsformal postsecondary programs leading to a college or university degree, a postsecondary vocational or technical diploma, or other education certificates related to qualifications for jobs. Apprenticeship programsformal, on-the-job training and other related instruction leading to a journeyman status in a skilled trade or craft. Work-related coursesthose related to a job or career other than postsecondary credential programs or apprenticeship programs, whether or not respondents had a job when they took the courses. Some examples are courses taken at work, courses taken elsewhere that relate to a job or career, or courses for a license or certification for a job. Personal development coursesvarious types of educational activities that have an instructor and are not included in the categories described above. Examples include courses related to health, hobbies or sports, foreign languages, dance or music, and Respondents in NHES:1999 reported participation based on their understanding of the activities involved, and readers should not assume that the respondents' definitions are the same as those of federal, state, or private programs in adult basic education or ESL classes. Their participation status for purposes of the study was determined by whether they were involved in one or more of these six types of adult education where there was an instructor during the 12-month period prior to the interview. Because full-time enrollment in postsecondary credential programs has not traditionally been considered to be adult education, adults who reported participation in postsecondary credential programs as full-3Persons who received their high school diplomasor equivalent during the 12 months prior to the interview and persons who received high school diplomas in a foreign country and did not have bachelor's degrees were also asked about their participation in ABE/GED activities in the previous 12 months.

Participation in One or More Types of Adult Education Table 1 shows the percentages of adults who participated in adult education activities in the 12 months prior to the NHES:1999 interview, overall and by highest level of educational attainment. Of the six types of activities, adults were most likely to participate in work-related courses and personal development courses (23 percent for each). Other types of educational activities may have entrance criteria or be targeted to certain specific populations. About 9 percent of adults participated in credential programs, about 2 'Most full-time postsecondary credential seekers are \"traditional\" college students who are 18 to 21 years old, although many are older (Snyder, Hoffman, and Geddes 1997).

Some analysts, however, consider nontraditional credential seekers (e.g., adults over the traditional college age range) to be adult education participants. percent in ABE/GED classes, about 2 percent in apprenticeship programs, and about 1 percent in ESL classes. The sum of the percentages for each type of adult education (60 percent) is greater than the overall participation rate (46 percent) because some adults participated in more than one type of adult education.5 While some adults participated in only one type of adult education activity during the 12-month period prior to the interview, others participated in two or more types. Table 2 shows the distribution of adult education activities, classified so that each adult appears in only one category. About one adult in three (34 percent) participated in only one type 'The difference between the sum of each type of adult education (60 percent) and the overall rate (46 percent) is 14 percent. As shown in table 2,12 percent of adults participated in more than one type of activity.This apparent discrepancy (14 percent vs.12 percent) is due to the summation of rounded percentages across the six categories of adult education. 'Adult Basic Education/General Educational Development (ABE/GED). Respondents who did not have a high school diploma or its equivalent, received a high school diploma or its equivalent in the past 12 months, or received a high school diploma in a foreign country, but no bachelor's degree, were asked about participation in adult basic education, GED preparation classes, and adult high school equivalency programs.

Among participants in one type of educational activity, the most common activities were again work-related courses and personal development courses (both 13 percent). In addition, 6 percent of adults participated in both of these types of activities and none of the other types. Participation in these two activities, separately and in combination with each other only, accounts for 32 percent of adults, about two-thirds of the 46 percent overall participation rate. About 4 percent of adults participated in credential programs only, and about 2 percent or less participated in each of the other individual activities or combinations of activities."}, {"section_title": "Relationship Between Participation in Adult Education and Highest Level of Education", "text": "As shown in table 1, the overall participation rate increases with each level of education. During the 12 months prior to the 1999 interview, the overall participation rate for adults with less than a high school diploma was 22 percent as compared to 37 percent for those with a high school diploma; 52 percent for those with some college, an associate's degree, or a vocational/technical diploma; and 62 percent for those with a bachelor's degree or higher. Table 1 also shows that different patterns of participation are observed when examining the relationship between educational attainment and participation in the six types of adult education separately. Participation rates in workrelated and personal development courses, which dominate the activities reported, increase across levels of education from very low rates among those without a high school diploma to much higher rates among those with more education. Noticeably, the participation rate in work-related courses was about nine times higher for adults with a bachelor's degree or higher than for those with less than a high school diploma. However, those with less than a high school diploma participate more in ABE/GED and ESL classes than those with a high school diploma or higher. This result is consistent with the structure of the education system, where ABE/GED and ESL programs typically enroll those with lower education levels. Participation in credential programs also reflects the structure of the education system in that those with less than a high school diploma .;:,A. tia participate at very low levels; participation is highest among those with some college, an associate's degree, or a vocational/technical diploma; and participation tapers off for those who have already attained a bachelor's degree. Table 2 and figure 2 examine whether the same relationships between levels of participation and educational attainment emerge when participation in one type of educational activity only is contrasted with participation in multiple types of activities. Comparing those with less than a high school diploma to those with a high school diploma or more education shows this to generally be the case. However, if those with less than a high school diploma are excluded, the only positive relationships that emerge between educational attainment and participation rates are in work-related courses or in work-related courses combined with other types of courses. Because work-related participation is such a large component of overall participation, it appears to be responsible for differences in overall participation and participation in multiple types of activities by educational attainment. Other studies suggest this relationship exists because employers tend to provide training for more educated employees (Vaughan 1989) and require more educated employees to participate in workrelated education (Hudson 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Number of Academic Libraries", "text": "In fall 1996, 3,408 of the 3,792 institutions of higher education in the United States reported that they had their own academic library."}, {"section_title": "Services Circulation", "text": "In FY 96, general collection circulation transactions in the nation's academic libraries at institutions of higher CEMBIEMERMX111111=211titIllallini=1=111111IMIIMWAV, education totaled 186.5 million.

Vocational programs that prepare students for jobs in the services and information industries include health care programs and technology and communications programs, among others."}, {"section_title": "Changing education and skill requirements", "text": "Generally, the research literature describes a trend toward greater education and training requirements and a greater need for critical thinking, personal responsibility, and social skills among workforce participants. For example, recent projections anticipate that average growth will be greater for occupations requiring at least an associate's degree than for occupations requiring less education. However, these trends are not uniform across industries and occupations, and some disagree about their magnitude. Some emerging occupations require high education and training requirements (such as a bachelor's degree or moderate-to longterm on-the-job training), while many jobs still demand relatively low education and training levels. In 1996, 39 percent of all jobs required no more than short-term on-thejob training. Understanding these economic and labor market trends provides a context for analyzing trends in vocational education. For example, if participation in vocational programs parallels changes in the economy, one would expect to see a decline in enrollments in trade and industry programs in recent years and an increase in enrollments in service-and information-related programs. Similarly, if vocational education reflects the labor market trend toward greater education and training requirements, one would expect to find that the academic preparation of students participating in vocational education has increased in recent 140"}, {"section_title": "41222201=24111MMIEM", "text": "years and that more of these participants are seeking and obtaining higher education and training credentials."}, {"section_title": "Employer Perspectives2", "text": "Workplace practices Changes in the economy and in education are altering workplace practices, which have implications for the skills required of employees.

The percentages of black, non-Hispanic students and Asian/ Pacific Islander students concentrating in vocational education stayed about the same over this period, and the concentration rate of students with disabilities increased. The increase in participation of students with disabilities is consistent with the emphasis of the 1990 Perkins Act on serving students with special needs. Academic course-taking trends The academic preparation of high school students participating in vocational education increased between 1982 and 1994, in both absolute and relative terms (figure B). While public high school graduates generally increased their coursetaking in the core academic subjects (English, mathematics, science, and social studies), the rate of increase was greater for vocational concentrators than for either college preparatory students or those completing general coursework in high school. Vocational concentrators also generally increased the rigor of their academic coursework, particularly in mathematics, science, and social studies. However, in 1994, vocational concentrators still completed fewer total credits in each of the core academic subjects than did either college preparatory students or those completing general coursework in high school. 142 , , School reform efforts' By 1997, some public comprehensive high schools had implemented vocational educationrelated reforms, although the quality and specific forms of these efforts were not discernible from the available survey data. About half of these schools reported integrating academic and vocational education, and a similar proportion reported offering tech prep. Fewer schools reported having block scheduling, career majors, school-based enterprises, skill standards, or skill or occupational certificates. Generally, schools with career academies and larger schools were more likely to report these reforms, while rural schools were less likely to do so.

There were some variations among vocational teachers who taught in different program areas and school settings. For example, trade and industry and technical teachers and those teaching in more than one vocational field were generally less likely than other vocational teachers to have a bachelor's or advanced degree.

While the gap in enrollment rates among the three groups of students appeared to be narrowing, 1992 vocational concentrators were still less likely than their college preparatory peers and those completing general coursework in high school to enroll in a postsecondary institution within 2 years. However, vocational concentrators who also completed a college preparatory curriculum had enrollment outcomes that were more like those of their college preparatory peers than did strictly vocational concentrators.

Postsecondary completion 10 years after high school More than half of 1982 public high school graduates who enrolled in postsecondary education completed a degree or certificate by 1992. Vocational concentrators had lower overall rates of postsecondary completion than their peers. However, vocational concentrators who also completed a college preparatory curriculum were as likely as college preparatory graduates to earn a postsecondary degree or certificate during this period. Among graduates who enrolled in postsecondary education by 1992, vocational concentrators were less likely than their peers to earn a bachelor's degree, but more likely to obtain a certificate or an associate's degree. Labor market outcomes 2 years after high school Labor market outcomes 2 years after leaving high school were similar for the graduating classes of 1982 and 1992. In both cases, about three out of four public high school graduates were in the labor force. Vocational concentrators in both graduating classes were more likely than their college preparatory peers to be in the labor force 2 years after graduation. While 1992 public high school graduates had similar labor market experiences regardless of their course of study in high school, 1982 college preparatory graduates tended to have lower unemployment rates than vocational concentrators and those completing general coursework in high school. This difference between the two graduating classes may be due to shifts over the decade in economic conditions, changes in the academic preparation of high school graduates, or other factors. Labor market outcomes 10 years after high school Vocational concentrators and students completing general coursework in high school had similar labor market outcomes 10 years after graduation from high school.

However, the total number of adults who held academic associate's degrees increased over the 4 years by approximately an additional 1 million people.12 Although postsecondary enrollments overall have shown recent increases, there is no evidence that bachelor's degree holders are returning in large numbers for additional undergraduate schooling, as some have speculated. In particular, small proportions of students who were pursuing associate's degrees or certificates had already earned a bachelor's or advanced degree. The vast majority of students who enroll in postsecondary education are pursuing a higher level credential than the one they currently possess.

The available data signal that change is occurring in the directions advocated by recent reform efforts, in particular, improved academic preparation and greater postsecondary participation. Evidence of change includes findings that the academic preparation of public high school students participating in vocational education increased between 1982 and 1994; about half of public comprehensive high schools reported integrating academic and vocational education in 1997, and a similar proportion reported offering tech prep; and from 1982 to 1992, postsecondary enrollment rates within 2 years of public high school graduation increased significantly for vocational concentrators. There is mixed evidence that trends in participation in vocational programs reflect economic shifts away from manufacturing toward services and information industries. For example, at the high school level, the percentage of graduates who concentrated in trade and industry declined between 1982 and 1994, and the proportions of students who concentrated in health care and in technology and\nBased on these findings, one cannot avoid the conclusion that combining the SASS data with a school-level student achievement measure has the potential for addressing important policy questions about school-based strategies for improving student performance. Because the data are not longitudinal, causal inferences must be treated much more tentatively than conclusions based on data on the achievement gains of a specified set of students over time. Also, because the data are school means, they cannot address the factors that differentially affect the achievement of different students in the same school. Nevertheless, findings from analyses of the SASS student-achievement subfile, based on over 2,000 schools in 20 states, can contribute to the overall educational policy database.\nSome people still believe that data are collected solely for the purpose of collecting: that is, data being collected for the sake of data and for nothing else. But staff involved in data collection at the state and national levels want to make the results of that collection available to those who are responsible for gathering the information at the school and district levels. Now, with the CCD easily accessible to educators throughout the country, people can see the results of their labor, and they can compare these results with those of other states, districts, or schools. 14 19 5 It is still true that data flow up. But the information and data sets that result from the data entered at schools also flow down. School district personnel responsible for making decisions will use the CCD as the dissemination improves through the use of the Internet. The data will be used because they are comparable and dependable. They are comparable because of the work of NCES. They are dependable because of the work and dedication of the education community: from schools, to school districts, to state departments of education.\nFrom the perspective of policy use, the CCD is valuable not only as a source of information, but also as a model for federal-state cooperation that can improve data collection, quality, and use overall. If the past 10 years are a good predictor, the CCD survey system can be expected to grow and influence other collections in interesting ways over the next decade.\nThe survey data reported here point to the slowly changing nature of the community college enterprise.4 The 'Time series data would offer much more reliable assessments of the changing nature of the community college enterprise. Absent those data, however, years of experience on the job and age can serve as proxies. In addition, the data presented in this report will serve as a base of comparison for data collected in NSOPF:1999.\nFew of the quantifiable inputs described in chapters 2 and 3 explain any of the student outcomes discussed in chapters 4 and 5. This is not to say that measures such as student/ teacher ratios, intended instructional time, and financial resources are unimportant, only that they fail to explain large variations in achievement scores, completion rates, and labor market outcomes at the country level within a macro framework. Further multivariate research at the regional and school levels both within and among countries will be important in determining some of the effects of background characteristics on student outcomes. Likewise, a more specific analysis of expendituressuch as the allocation of resourcesmay illuminate where finances have the largest impact on student outcomes. For example, U.S. eighth-graders score relatively higher on the science assessment than on the mathematics assessment. Could the United States be allocating a relatively larger proportion of finances to science education than to mathematics education compared to the other countries? Answering these types of questions may help to explain the lack of findings at the aggregate level.\nBy most of the indicators in this report, females are doing at least as well as males. Girls and boys begin school with similar preschool and early literacy participation experiences, and female students have consistently outperformed their male peers in reading and writing. Females have tended to lag behind males in science and mathematics, however. Since the early 1970s, women have made dramatic gains in postsecondary education in terms of enrollment and attainment, and are successful relative to men in aspirations, enrollment, and bachelor's degree completion. Gender differences in college majors persist, however, with women still concentrated in fields like education and men more likely than women to earn degrees in engineering, physics, and computer science. In terms of labor market outcomes, the findings are mixed. Women ages 25-34 are less likely than their male counterparts to be employed, but women with higher levels of educational attainment are employed at rates more similar to those of men than are women with lower levels of attainment. Women tend to earn less than men with similar educational attainment. Data sources: More than 15 sources of data, including multiple NCES surveys.

That concern was triggered by the \"workforce crisis\" described in America's Choice: High Shills or Low Wages? (Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce 1990). It was also spurred by the recognition that with changing technology and work organizations, schools need to do more to equip students with the more sophisticated and higher level skills that today's workplace requires (Grubb 1995). These concerns have set in motion a growing demand for clearer and higher standards in occupational education, and increased industry input in the development of those standards (Lankard 1995). The push for standards and accountability in occupational education has also been intensified by several policy initiatives over the past decade. Increased accountability is also sought at the federal level. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) requires federal departments and agencies to prepare annual performance plans that establish specific goals for each year, starting with fiscal year (FY) 1999 (October 1998September 1999) (Groszyk 1995). To meet its GPRA reporting requirements, OVAE must submit an annual report comparing the status of occupational programs with the goals identified in its annual performance plan. One performance indicator in OVAE's plan for FY 99 specifies that \"by fall 2000, there will be an increasing proportion of vocational programs with skill competencies and related assessments, and with industry-recognized skill certificates in secondary and postsecondary institutions\" (OVAE 1998). The summary tables in this report present statistics relevant to this OVAE performance indicator. The findings on these indicators are based on schools and institutions that offered one or more occupational programs that prepared students for occupations examined in the surveys.\nThe need to compete effectively in the international marketplace has convinced U.S. business, economic, and political leaders of the importance of understanding the education systems of other industrialized nations. Studying how other countries educate their citizens provides insight into the competitiveness of those nations, as well as a benchmark for comparing our own education system. Data published over the last decade have shown the United States to be lacking compared with other countries in some areas of school performance, particularly at the higher grade levels. While U.S. students perform reasonably well at the 4th-grade level, especially in reading, mathematics and science scores at the secondary school level have raised some concerns. Subsequent to several reports published in 1990, the nation's governors established the National Education Goals, which included two goals relevant to international competitiveness: \"By the year 2000, United States students will be first in the world in mathematics and science achievement\"; and \"By the year 2000, every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and EDUCATION STATISTICS QUARTERLY -VOLUME 2, ISSUE 2, SUMMER 2000 exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship\" (National Education Goals Panel 1996, p. xvi). Elementary and secondary education is the backbone of every nation's education system. These levels educate all persons from approximately age 6 through age 16, and for some students it is the only education they receive. Elementary and secondary education is available free of charge, and attendance is mandatory for all children of certain ages in each country discussed in this report. To provide a broader perspective on these issues, the United States has participated in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Indicators of National Education Systems (INES) Project and several major international assessments. The latter include the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), the Reading Literacy Study, and the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS)."}, {"section_title": "Focus of this report", "text": "Occupational Programs Examined in the"}, {"section_title": "Surveys", "text": ".The secondary survey began by asking whether the schools offered vocational programs' that prepared students for any of 28 selected occupations within six broad occupation areas (business and marketing occupations, technical occupations, mechanical occupations, building trades, health/life sciences occupations, and service occupations). The postsecondary survey asked whether the institutions offered occupational programs in 32 similar occupations in the same six occupation areas. Programs at the secondary level Overall, a majority (66 percent) of public secondary schools offered one or more occupational programs that prepared students for the selected occupations: 35 percent of the schools offered 1 to 5 programs, 18 percent offered 6 to 10 programs, and another 13 percent offered more than 10 programs. However, about one-third (34 percent) of the schools did not offer any programs that prepare students for these occupations.2 On average, vocational schools offered more occupational programs than did comprehensive schools; for example, 44 percent of vocational schools compared with 9 percent of comprehensive schools offered more than 10 programs for the listed occupations. Programs at the postsecondary level A large majority of less-than-4-year postsecondary institutions (90 percent) offered one or more programs for the selected occupations. About half of the institutions offered 1 to 5 programs, another 11 percent offered 6 to 10 programs, and an additional 27 percent offered more than 10 programs.

A similar definition was used at the postsecondary level, except that a noncredit occupational program could have consisted of only one course or more than one course.This report refers to both secondary and postsecondary programs as occupational programs. zone possible reason for this finding is that the definition of vocational programs used in this survey excluded lower level vocational programs that typically do not prepare students for at least entry-level jobs within the occupations considered in the survey. Another explanation is that some of the schools might be sending their students to area vocational schools for technical education training. programs than less-than-2-year institutions; for example, 43 percent of 2-year institutions compared with 5 percent of less-than-2-year institutions offered more than 10 programs that prepared students for the occupations.

In particular, data are presented on the possible effect on the NAEP proficiency scales of including greater percentages of special needs students; the comparability of results from nonstandard administrations (i.e., administrations in which 158 accommodations were allowed) to results obtained under standard conditions; and the effect of nonstandard administrations on NAEP's capacity to provide accurate comparisons of trends over time.

In addition, a questionnaire was included that was designed to obtain information on student background and educational experiences. The questionnaire was to be completed for all sampled students with disabilities and for all sampled LEP students. The design of the NAEP 1996 assessment included three distinct national samples of schools.

The evidence for the mathematics assessment was less conclusive. Because small sample sizes necessitated the combination of students with disabilities and LEP students for IRT and scaling analyses, it is not yet clear whether future NAEP reports will need to report these categories of students separately. A future report using larger samples (combined state data) from the 1998 reading assessment should shectfurther light on this question. Despite the finding above, the inclusion of data from nonstandard administrations had no discernable effect on aggregate NAEP scaling results in mathematics and science at any of the three grades. Differences in test characteristic curves and test information curves plotted with and without the inclusion of such data differed no more than would be expected due to sampling variability. Proficiency means were estimated for the NAEP mathematics and science scales, with and without the inclusion of students with accommodations in testing, at each of grades 4, 8, and 12. There were no significant differences in the overall means or in the means for significant subgroups at any of the three grades. The results reported here suggest that the procedural changes being considered would not significantly affect the NAEP scale score results.

In reading/language arts, half or fewer of the students with disabilities received instruction that was at grade level. In mathematics and science, the situation was slightly better at the two lower grades.

This evidence was strongest at grade 4. Under the revised criteria, all LEP students receiving academic instruction in English for 3 or more years were to be included in NAEP. Analyses based on questionnaire responses as to the number of years students were receiving academic instruction in English indicated that this ideal was not quite achieved. Inclusion rates among students with 3 or more years of academic instruction in English were high, but total inclusion was not achieved, even where accommodations and adaptations were provided.

In secondary schools, the positive association with achievement included both large schools and small classes. An important aspect of the relationship between class size and achievement, shown by the comparison of results with and without between-state variance components, is that it is primarily a between-state phenomenon.

The recommended method is less affected by single-year or one-time changes in dropout rates and more accurately estimates the proportion of public school students who leave high school successfully.

Data File:Ten-Year Longitudinal CCD Local Education Agency Universe Survey File: School Years 1986-87 Through 1995-96 The Common Core of Data (CCD) \"Local Education Agency Universe Survey\" is one of the five surveys that make up the CCD collection of surveys. This survey provides (1) a complete listing of all education agencies responsible for providing free public elementary/ secondary instruction or education support services in the 50 states, District of Columbia, and outlying areas; and (2) basic information about these education agencies and the students for whose education they are responsible. Most of the agencies listed are school districts or other local education agencies. The data are provided annually by state education agencies from their administrative records. This longitudinal file supplements the standard CCD public-use databases by extensively imputing data that were not originally reported by state education agencies. This imputed, linked longitudinal file is thus more useful for testing hypotheses or studying trends over time. It is intended to meet the needs of researchers for a data set describing public school districts over a relatively substantial period of time. The information about district characteristicssuch as urbanicity (e.g., large city vs. rural locale); numbers of schools, teachers, and students; and student characteristicscan be used to measure changes over a 10-year period. Because each school district carries a unique identifier, the longitudinal file can be linked with other school or school district data sets. The data can be downloaded from the NCES Web Site in ASCII, SAS, or SPSS files. Documentation is provided in separate files.

The sample survey data are from the March Current Population Survey, conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Many factors affect employment rates among adults. Some factors influence the willingness of employers to offer jobs to individuals with different levels of education at the going wage rate, whereas others influence the willingness of individuals to take jobs at this wage rate. The percentage of young adults who are employed is an indication of both the skill levels required by employers and the advantages employment offers to individuals relative to other pursuits. Between 1971 and 1998, the employment rate of male and female 25-to 34-year-olds was generally higher among those individuals with a higher level of education (table 1; figure 1). For example, in 1998, males and females ages 25-34 with a bachelor's degree or higher were more likely to be employed than their peers who had lower levels of educational attainment. Between 1971 and 1998, the employment rate of males ages 25-34 decreased for those who had not finished high school and those with a high school diploma or GED, and remained relatively constant for those with some college and those with a bachelor's degree or higher. Between 1971 and 1998, the employment rate of females ages 25-34 increased across all education levels. However, the rate of increase for females who did not complete high school was lower than the rate of increase for females who attained higher levels of education.    . 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1998 1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1998  For questions about content, contact John Wirt (john_wirt@ed.gov).

(The Digest has been issued annually except for combined editions for the years 1977-78, 1983-84, and 1985-86.) Its primary purpose is to provide a compilation of statistical information covering the broad field of American education from kindergarten through graduate school. The publication contains information on a variety of subjects in the field of education statistics, including the number of schools and colleges, teachers, enrollments, and graduates, in addition to educational attainment, finances, federal funds for education, employment and income of graduates, libraries, and international education. Supplemental information on population trends, attitudes on education, education characteristics of the labor force, government finances, and economic trends provide background for evaluating education data. In addition to updating many of the statistics that have appeared in previous years, this edition contains a significant amount of new material, including poverty rates for 5-to 17-year -olds in large school districts; federal funds, by program, for large school districts; trends in the average size of public schools, by level of school; distribution of public school students, by racial/ ethnic concentration of enrollment in school; selected statistics for Hispanic-serving institutions of higher education; selected statistics for tribal colleges predominately serving American Indian students; percent of colleges using various selection criteria for admission; and average undergraduate tuition and fees, by percentage distribution of student enrollment."}, {"section_title": "NCES Universe Surveys", "text": "The NCES data collections include a mixture of universe and sample surveys. Each universe survey is a census of all known entities in the specific universe (e.g., all elementary and secondary public schools or all public school districts in the country). In addition to providing basic descriptive data, the universe surveys frequently serve as sampling frames for cross-sectional and longitudinal sample surveys. In total, NCES conducts 12 recurring universe surveys. One set of universe surveys, the Common Core of Data (CCD), is featured in this issue. The CCD is made up of six separate annual surveys that are sent to state education departments, where data are compiled from state administrative records for the 90,900 public elementary and secondary schools and the 14,500 regular school districts with students. The CCD surveys include public school fiscal and nonfiscal data aggregated at the state and at the school district levels, as well as school-level data. These surveys, plus the biennial Private School Survey (PSS) of data from 27,000 private schools, comprise the NCES universe surveys at the elementary and secondary school levels. At the postsecondary level, the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) includes all 9,600 institutions and educational organizations that provide postsecondary education. As of fall 2000, IPEDS will consist of two annual surveysa fall and a spring data collectionwhich will include data on institutional characteristics, completions, enrollments, graduation rates, finance, and the state of residence of first-time students. IPEDS data can be used to describe trends in postsecondary education at the institutional, state, and national levels. For example, researchers can use IPEDS data to analyze data on enrollments and completions of students at different levels by sex and race/ethnicity and by characteristics of postsecondary institutions such as tuition and room and board charges and institutional revenue and expenditure patterns. IPEDS data collection will be entirely Web based beginning in fall 2000. The Library Statistics Program includes one biennial and two annual universe surveys. The Public Libraries Survey is an annual survey of 8,900 public libraries, with data ranging from usage, size of collection, staffing patterns, and finances to electronic access. The annual State Library Agencies Survey provides descriptive data on services related to library development and the administration of federal funds for libraries. The Academic Library Survey is a biennial universe survey that collects data from the 3,800 degreegranting postsecondary institutions to provide national and state overviews of academic libraries on topics similar to those reported for public libraries. Membership: Each cooperative includes members from federal, state, and local education agencies with responsibilities for collecting and reporting education data. The members include data providers, data users, government employees, and representatives of public and private institutions and associations. Utility: The mission statement of each cooperative stresses the goal of meeting policymakers' needs for data that support policy development, implementation, and evaluation. Comparability: In order to be useful, the data must be of high quality and must be comparable across reporting units; thus, quality and comparability are also keystones of each cooperative's mission statement. Coordination: To meet these goals, each cooperative recognizes the need to work together to develop and adopt data standards, including common definitions, standards for the electronic exchange of data, guidelines to promote data collection, and data sharing processes that appropriately preserve confidentiality while permitting access and minimizing burden. Each cooperative engages in projects designed to identify and define the core data for specific topics. These definitions are formalized in handbooks that provide frameworks to promote the coordination of data collections. At this point, the National Forum on Education Statistics (the elementary and secondary education cooperative) has released handbooks on core data elements, privacy, the use of technology, financial accounting, student data, and staff data. The National Postsecondary Education Cooperative has released one handbook on human resources and related reports on technology, student access, and outcomes data.

The current design of the CCD was introduced in 1986-87, with the first data of publishable quality collected in the following school year. In short order, the survey system acquired characteristics that distinguish it from its precursors and give the CCD its current identity. Unlike earlier education directory systems, the CCD began in the late 1980s to edit the school and agency universe files with the same attention that had formerly been directed toward the state-level data collections. (These latter continued to stand as the official state statistics for the reported data.) At about the same time, the CCD discontinued the then-common practice among commercial listing services of maintaining \"open\" files: that is, allowing information to be updated as it became available, with the result that a file could include data from different years for different states. NCES decided that all CCD data reported by states would be those that were current as of October 1 of the school year. Old data could not be carried over from one year to the next, which made issues in the timeliness of state reporting more crucial than they had been in the past. The CCD of the late 1980s expanded the content of the surveys as well as established new reporting and editing conventions. This expansionand the process through which states agreed to report data items with common definitionswas accomplished in partnership with the Council of Chief State School Officers. CCSSO is a professional association representing the heads of state public education agencies, and it has a longstanding role in brokering the data interests between state data reporters and federal data collectors. In 1985, CCSSO began, under contract to NCES, to examine the completeness and comparability of data reported on the CCD as it was then structured. The project initiated the practice of negotiation, consensus, and verification between state agencies and NCES that continues today."}, {"section_title": "The Survey System", "text": "The CCD is a series of six separate annual data collections reporting information drawn from the administrative records of state education agencies. It encompasses the universe of public schools and local education agencies' and is limited to elementary and secondary school data. Two surveys provide financial data. State-level information about revenues and expenditures is reported on the \"National Public Education Financial Survey.\" The \"Annual Survey of Government Finances: School Systems\" collects comparable information about individual local education agencies. More commonly known by its form number (F-33), this survey is supported jointly by the Bureau of the Census (Governments Division) and NCES. Nonfiscal information about students, staff, and institutions is drawn from three CCD surveys. The \"State Nonfiscal Survey of Public Elementary/Secondary Education\" is the source of official state-level counts of public school students, teachers and other staff, and high school completers. The \"Local Education Agency Universe Survey\" provides information about approximately 16,5002 local agencies, in addition to the state education agencies, that are responsible for providing public education or services that support it. This survey includes information about institutional characteristics, numbers of education staff, numbers of students participating in selected education programs, dropouts, and high school completers. The \"Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey\" is similar. In 1997-98, it encompassed more than 90,000 public schools. Like its state and local agency counterparts, the school universe survey reports institutional characteristics and the numbers of teachers, student enrollment by grade (with detail on gender and racial/ethnic category), and students participating in selected education programs. All of these collections report data that are at least 1 year out of datethe information collected by the state that reflects conditions on October 1 may not be reported to NCES until the following September.

Its historic function as a directory of public schools and education agencies remains. and the CCD serves as a mailing list, institution registry, and sampling frame. The CCD serves as the only annual universe report of the numbers of students enrolled in public schools, the numbers of high school diplomas awarded, and the numbers of public school teachers. For the more than 40 states that participate in the dropout data collection (the number is growing over time), the CCD provides comparable statistics about how many students drop out of school each year. One relatively new use of the CCD is that of research database. In the 1999 Condition of Education, the CCD was used to analyze changes in the racial/ethnic isolation of students in public schools over a 10-year period. This application of the CCD has been aided by work to reconstruct lost documentation and by making archived files available through the International Archive of Education Data. It has also relied on the development of a longitudinal education agency research file that matches school districts over time and includes imputed data for a number of missing responses."}, {"section_title": "Issues in Quality", "text": "Administrative records data have had limited use in research and policymaking because they may not be considered trustworthy. The nonsampling errors to which administrative records are vulnerable include incomplete coverage, discrepancies in data definitions, varying periodicity, and inability to verify data quality. A coverage evaluation of the elementary/secondary education agency universe concluded that the CCD did a good job of representing traditional types of education agencies (Owens 1997); a companion study of school coverage is currently in review. Nontraditional agencies, particularly those not administered by the state education agency, were more likely to be missed. These evaluations set the context for discussions with state data reporters about how to improve coverage and have led to changes that will ostensibly improve the surveys' representation. Indian Affairs (BIA) had been inconsistently reported by states. BIA schools and districts are now excluded from state reports and published as a separate reporting entity. Again, there was an explicit effort in the 1998-99 collection to improve the coverage of charter schools, whose governance structure varies widely across states. This was partially successful in capturing more schools. However, as long as the CCD continues to draw upon the administrative records of state education agencies, there will be some schools and agencies that fall outside its net. Respondents may not follow definitions uniformly. For example, classification evaluations of the CCD, and subsequent technical review panels, found that states disagreed about when to classify an education agency as a supervisory union, a regional service agency, or a state operated agency. The survey continues to struggle with crafting a feasible and professionally acceptable definition of a vocational school. Definitional agreement in reporting has been approached in several ways. Topical technical review panels uncover possible sources of confusion (or inapplicability) in current item definitions, with resulting guidance to state data reporters through the CCD Home Page, direct mailings, and annual training. For the number of dropouts, a particularly high-stakes statistic, each CCD coordinator is questioned annually about the state's adherence to the CCD definition and reporting procedures. Periodicity has been addressed by arbitrarily setting October 1 as the \"as of date for CCD counts. Current-year statistics are to be reported as they were observed on October 1; pastyear statistics, such as the number of dropouts or the number of students receiving migrant education services, are reported as they were known to be on that day. Information collected from state CCD coordinators in the 1991-92 introduction of the dropout statistic found that the data from most states had been collected within a week of October 1, but that a few states reported data that had been collected 4 or 5 weeks earlier or later. This issue appears to be one that is improving due to developments in information technology. In past years, for example, the sum of students in the reported racial/ethnic categories often differed from the reported total of studentspurportedly because the counts were taken at different times. Today this problem does not arise on the state-level survey. The quality of data is promoted by attention to the conditions under which data are collected and reported conditions that were discussed in the preceding paragraphsand by editing data once they are received. A recent evaluation concluded that the CCD survey processing included more edits than necessary, based on the number of data changes in response to edit challenges (Hamann 1999). The number of edit challenges reported to state CCD coordinators has been reduced. The \"National Public Education Financial Survey\" continues to send prioryear comparisons and add checks on all subtotals to the respondents, in part because sizable federal allocations are affected by the numbers. The state nonfiscal survey, which is Web based, incorporates soft edits that respondents can override with an explanatory note. Similar editing software for the school and education agency universe surveys is available to states. More comprehensive Web-based versions of this software are expected to be available by August 2000."}, {"section_title": "Recent, Ongoing, and Upcoming Developments", "text": "The revised CCD school and education agency universe surveys that were introduced in the 1998-99 school year added a number of features that were intended to make the CCD more useful for sampling and program uses. The idea of \"flags\" was introduced. In addition to its traditional type code (e.g., regular, vocational), a school is now flagged as magnet, charter, or Title I, as appropriate. Additional detail provides school membership by gender and racial/ethnic category within each grade, and there are now reports of the numbers of students receiving migrant and limited English proficiency services. The school locale code, originally developed by CCD staff at NCES, has been refined in the last year. The variable identifies the degree to which a school is located in an urban setting, with codes ranging from \"large city\" to \"rural.\" The addition of a \"location address\" (if this differs from the mailing address) has improved the assignment of locale codes on the basis of Census place. For example, if a rural school receives its mail at the post office in a neighboring town, the location address will ensure that the school is coded as \"rural\" rather than \"small town.\" And, the existing rural category has been broken into \"rural (outside a metropolitan statistical area)\" and \"rural, urban fringe (within a metropolitan statistical area).\" CCD staff, in cooperation with state education agencies, have also reached consensus on a high school completion rate that is being introduced with 1998-99 data. This rate is the proportion of students leaving school who leave as completers. It is the number of high school completers in a given year divided by the number of completers plus the ,r. '191"}, {"section_title": "Where Do the Data Come From?", "text": "The procedures leading up to the moment that a school district sends the data to the state or county agency are complex. A supportive internal infrastructure is required. This may seem simplistic, but each piece of data is gathered, or collected, in one way or another, and reviewed by staff to make certain that it is correct. Sometimes the data are collected through a sophisticated wide-area computer 12 network connecting schools to a central office. Sometimes the collection takes place using diskettes. Sometimes there is a paper collection. In all cases, however, the data that are collected have to be validated and checked for accuracy. In the Los Angeles Unified School District, for example, more than 700,000 students will be reported on the date of the district \"snapshot\" in the fall of 2000. Information about each student and about teachers and schools has to be reported accurately. It is true that LA Unified is unusual in that it is the second largest district in the country. However, every district in the United States is responsible for collecting accurate information for each of the students, teachers, and schools within its jurisdiction. Every district has to go through the process of data collection and validation. The Infamous\"Data Burden\" This reporting process is not without difficulties. The goal is to report accurate data. But what happens when a data element is missing or makes no sense? When an error is discovered, it must be corrected. If the error results from data entered at a school, that school will be contacted. The school could be contacted by telephone, or might receive a report indicating what needs to be done to fix the problem (or, usually, more than one problem). In any case, the information must be corrected. For those in the business of collecting data, this doesn't sound like a big issue. It seems clear: the school has made an error and must correct it. But the business of schools is not data collection or data entry. The business of schools is educating our students. Anything that detracts from this central task is not appreciated by school staff. They might complain that, to make such corrections, they have to take time away from responsibilities that appear to be more closely related to the education of the students in the school. Certainly, the correction of the data will take staff away from other tasks that need to be done. Clerical staff in school offices are probably responsible for data entry and will be asked to make any necessary corrections. These office clerical staff are also still responsible for all those things we remember from the days when we were in school. However, the addition of computers in these offices, connected to databases with thousands of data elements, has imposed added responsibilities on these staff. Someone has to enter the data. In addition, in many districts, the number of clerical staff in school offices has remained static over the years, while the number of data elements that need to be entered into the computer systems has increased. Thus, when someone from the \"central office\" calls or writes to the principal stating that data were entered incorrectly, these staff will not be happy. These problems exemplify the infamous \"data burden\" imposed on schools. The burden is not merely the requirement to correct one data element. School personnel are responsible for entire databases. It is not unreasonable to assume that a moderately sized school might be responsible for more than 100,000 data elements. The burden at the school site is apparent when we recognize that staff are responsible for entering all of these data elements and updating them accurately. Once the data are received from the schools on the day of the \"snapshot,\" there must be other staff in place who can review the initial submission of data, validate the information, and assist the schools in making corrections. This is the \"data burden\" at the school district level. Although no amount of technological advance will make it go away completely, one of our tasks is to reduce this burden as much as possible. In fact, it is perceived that the \"data burden\" is decreased for a district and its schools when staff are able to see why data are collected. If the data flow down, back to the schools and districts in the form of information that can be used, staff will see the benefit from the work that they do to enter and validate the data. Information based on the data must get back to the place where the data were entered, or else staff will believe that the burden is too great. And, if this is the case, data accuracy will also suffer."}, {"section_title": "Using the CCD", "text": "The phrase \"data comparability\" is used so often that it has almost become a mantra. The fact that the data in the CCD are comparable enables district staff, and other members of the education community, to be advocates for increased funding or for a redistribution of resources in states based on data, not on simple anecdotal stories. The movement toward \"accountability\" in all aspects of education has grown. Schools and school districts across the country are being held accountable for the results of their instructional programs. As Californians know, their method of financing education has changed. Since a vote of the populace some years ago reducing the local property taxes, expenditures for education have not kept pace with expenditures in many other states. According to information from the 1998-99 CCD, California ranks near the bottom in per pupil expenditures for education in the United States and it has the second highest student/teacher ratio. These facts are important both to educators and to students in California. These data have also been used by educators to point out that if districts in the state are to be held accountable for the results of instructional programs, education needs to be funded more adequately. To the credit of the California state government today, indications are that funding for education in the state will greatly increase in the near future. Other examples of comparisons that can be made using the CCD are the number of migrant students in a school district, the number of limited-English-proficient (LEP) students in language programs, and diploma recipients by racial/ethnic category and sex. These comparisons can be made between school districts for the 1998-99 collection. This information, among other available data within the CCD, is a valuable tool that can be used to examine trends and to plan for the future."}, {"section_title": "Dissemination of the Data", "text": "Earlier, it was noted that many school and district personnel do not know about the CCD. In the past, dissemination was not adequate and information about the CCD often did not filter back down to schools and districts. This is changing rapidly. In recent years, the CCD has been placed on CD-ROM, greatly expanding awareness of it in the education community. The CD-ROM provides tools that enable users, not just computer programmers, to examine and compare the data. But the real change in the dissemination of the CCD has occurred because of the growth of the Internet. through an explanation of the CCD and the set of surveys. Reports are available along with data sets."}, {"section_title": "NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS Introduction", "text": "The interests of sound policies and decisions for governing public K-12 education in the United States are well served by the Common Core of Data (CCD), which is administered by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The CCD is a good example of the critical importance of effective collaboration and partnerships between local, state, and federal levels of government. The basic data that define public schools in the United States exist because local school districts, state education agencies, and the U.S. Department of Education work together to establish common definitions, maintain regular data collection and reporting on core measures, and uphold policies on accurate, honest data. The critical role of the CCD system for education policies at each level of our education system cannot be overestimated. The Department of Education has monitored some of the data elements of the CCD since the Department's inception in 1867. The current CCD system has experienced change and will experience further rapid change. Three main points on the uses of the CCD in education policy are emphasized in this commentary The CCD offers important building blocks for education decisions as well as key starting points for other education surveys and data systems at all levels. The CCD depends on timely cooperation among educators and managers at each level of public education, and the mutual dependence underlying the common system must be recognized by parties at each level for the system to function effectively. Movement toward an electronic integrated data system will incorporate the current functions of the CCD and significantly expand the usefulness of the data currently reported."}, {"section_title": "Recent Issues With the CCD", "text": "The data collections contributing to the CCD cover the most basic elements that describe education in the United States, including student enrollments, teachers, demographic characteristics, schools, revenues, and expenditures. School systems across the country play an active part in 196 ensuring that the data meet definitions and specifications established through the leadership of NCES. Over the past decade, improvements have been made that have strengthened the CCD system. Regarding the usefulness of CCD information for education policy, several issues can be identified. Since the 1980s, one of the emphases for the CCD and other NCES data collections has been increasing the reliability and consistency of data. Under the leadership of Emerson Elliot, former NCES Commissioner, the statistics provided by NCES have improved when judged against these criteria. Some areas of data collection within NCES have expanded, such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), longitudinal studies, and the Schools and Staffing Survey. The work with the CCD has focused primarily on improving the quality of data, although several data items have been added to the system from existing administrative records. In the early 1980s, NCES was criticized for the lack of consistency, completeness, and timeliness of data and statistics. In the past decade, NCES has worked with states and school districts in a cooperative, collaborative manner to improve the quality of data and has focused on ensuring that reports are available on a regular, timely schedule. Educators, administrators, and policymakers may have some frustration with the CCD on the issues of usefulness and flexibility. For example, the CCD does not collect or report any data that can be disaggregated or analyzed by program, curriculum, or subject area. State agency users, professional organizations, and local educators could see enormous potential benefit in being able to track trends in full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers by teaching assignment and size of school. A survey that was discontinued in the 1980s tracked secondary course enrollments, and many potential users would argue that these data would now be very important to have in common across states and districts. In the CCD, detailed data are collected by school for student characteristics such as race/ethnicity and poverty. The data can be accessed by school code, but they have not often been linked to educational measures from other national or state-level surveys such as student Featured Topic: T e Common Core o Data achievement or course enrollments. This is now an area of increased attention by NCES, and linking projects would increase the usefulness of the CCD. Another issue is the method of reporting and availability of data. For example, the CCD collects detailed data at the district and state levels. Until the mid-1990s, aggregated statistics from the CCD were available in a small number of publications, notably the Digest of Education Statistics and The Condition of Education, as well as reports summarizing each of the CCD data collections' findings. Regular mailings were made to K-12 education agencies, postsecondary education institutions, and libraries. However, many other potential users often were not alerted to the availability of data, how they could be obtained, or how they might be used. In the late 1990s, the advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web provided new avenues for CCD data to be made available to potential users, and methods of accessing data improved vastly. In addition, a series of short publications (Statistics in Brief) has alerted many educators and policymakers to the applications of the CCD series as well as other NCES surveys. Access to data and information has become an expectation in American society and the world. The key products from the CCD need to continue to be disseminated in creative ways. New means of accessing these important data and statistics should become available as more users become attuned to methods of combining data from several sources for the purposes of educational policy analyses and producing reports on progress in our schools."}, {"section_title": "Policy Applications of the CCD", "text": "What are the strengths of the CCD as educators and policymakers look into the 21st century and consider the priorities for spending to improve the infrastructure of educational systems? From the viewpoint of policy applications, I would elaborate on three main points. 1. CCD as building blocks for education decisions and data systems. States, local systems, and the public depend on the common definitions and data collection procedures provided through the CCD. With the refocusing on data quality in the 1980s, NCES has invested in a number of consensusbuilding projects to ensure that K-12 education has a common statistical foundation. The CCD depends on state and local funding and data systems to collect data. However, NCES efforts ensure that data collection and reporting 16 on central elements of educational systemsincluding school, teacher, administrator, student, graduate, and dropoutsignificantly ease the jobs of data managers at all levels and key users such as school boards and state legislatures. Educational systems increasingly operate in a national market for students, teachers, and administrators. Decisions about school budgets and allocations in many jurisdictions involve the largest portion of spending of public tax dollars. Thus, decision makers have come to rely on comparable statistics from one school district to another and from one state to another. The CCD has proved an important starting point for data collection, analysis, and reporting by local school districts and states across the country. As school systems begin to redesign education data systems to meet the many new needs for data, NCES data definitions, coding systems, core data collections, and methods of aggregation and reporting provide the basic foundation for construction of education data and statistics. The development of a common national dropout statistic in the 1990s provides a useful lesson in the role and relevance of the CCD. The reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Act in 1987 (the Hawkins-Stafford Act) called for a number of improvements in national education statistics. Among the provisions of the act was the creation of a comparable, reliable figure on the school dropout rate. Previously, school systems and states reported statistics on dropouts using a variety of methods of defining and counting a school \"dropout\" and various reference groups and periods of time to consider in computing a dropout \"rate.\" Constituencies and interest groups relied on a particular definition or rate of dropout, with some methods of computation producing much higher or lower rates than others. NCES sought expert advice from highly respected statisticians and educators in finalizing a common definition and began requesting dropout statistics from states in the early 1990s. Through the CCD system and the deliberative consensus process for developing a new data collection element \"in common\" among the states, there has been a gradual movement to adopt the CCD definition of dropout. As a result, data systems used in states have adapted to require schools to track and report dropouts using the recommended procedures. In turn, states collect and report data aggregated to the school, district, and state levels. NCES also sponsors a fellows program for state and district staff and provides some financial assistance to states to develop and improve their education data systems. The cooperative approach to operation of the CCD has obvious benefits both for states and for NCES. It moves the data and statistics program toward a joint venture for data quality, accuracy, and timeliness. This approach does depend upon the cooperative intent in federal-state relations to ensure that data systems receive appropriate priority at the state and local levels. States still must allocate funds to support state-level design, management, and staffing of data systems, and they must provide leadership toward improving data quality with local school boards and administrators. The cooperative system for the CCD has reaped real benefits in improving data quality and advancing the linkages between federal data collection and reporting and state and local data systems. Federal leadership of the cooperative system has been a plus. Two areas now need concentrated effort in the federal, state, and local partner-ship to improve the usefulness of the CCD for policy purposes. First, timeliness of state and district reporting needs to be improved. For example, CCD nonfiscal data are now available at the close of the following school year. High standards for quality and completeness have been applied, but problems in some states continue to slow the release of complete 50-state data sets. NCES and other components of the Department of Education need to continue to take a strong leadership role in assisting state and local systems to improve their data systems and maintain deadlines. States need to retain well-qualified staff who can maintain continuity in data collection and reporting and ensure that standards of quality and timeliness are upheld. On a broader level, a second area of need for federal, state, and local partnership is to improve state and local reports with education statistics and indicators of progress. All states now produce state accountability or indicator reports, and a majority of the states report indicators at the district and school levels. Many of the models for reporting provide basic statistics on student and teacher demographics, education finance, and student achievement results. Relatively few states use a range of data sources and data collections to provide reports that are useful to a variety of audiences, including decision makers, teachers, administrators, and parents. An area for further federal-state collaboration, with guidance from the National Forum on Education Statistics, should be in the areas of reporting, data analysis, and uses of data. 3. Movement toward an electronic integrated data system. The cooperative effort toward data and data system improvement that has been carried out through the National Forum on Education Statistics may change the nature of how the CCD collects and reports information. In the early 1990s, a group of state education agency and school district staff joined with postsecondary admissions officers in a Forum project to develop a format for the electronic transmission of student records. to develop extensible markup language (XML) formats for a range of information needs and data elements common at the school district level. NCES has sponsored other pilot projects in the area of electronic data collection and transmission, often within the framework of the CCD data elements and always in collaboration with states and school districts. In the mid-1990s, several pairs of school districts that considered themselves \"trading partners\" for student enrollments tested the usefulness of SPEEDE/ExPRESS for forwarding migrant students' education records. Addressing another need, NCES sponsored work in several states belonging to the Southern Regional Education Board. The project developed a multistate collaborative system for collecting, analyzing, and reporting education staff data from multiple administrative record systems (such as data on teacher certification, continuing education, and retirement). It demonstrated a regional approach with the capacity to model teacher supply and demand for state policy planning. NCES also developed and pilot-tested with states a system for harvesting CCD data from state record systems. Although never widely adopted, this early effort at electronic data aggregation and reporting addressed many of the issues that current electronic data systems have had to address, including data comparability, security in electronic transmission, hardware compatibility, and student privacy rights. "}, {"section_title": "The Early Estimates System", "text": "The early estimates system is designed to allow the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to publish selected key statistics during the school year in which they are reported. The source of universe statistical information about public elementary and secondary education is the Common Core of Data (CCD)data collected annually by NCES from state education agencies. The estimates included in this report were reported in December 1999 for the 1999-2000 school year.* In early October 1999, survey forms were sent to each state education agency. States were asked to complete the form and return it by mail or facsimile (fax). States that had not responded by mid-November were contacted by telephone. All data were checked for reasonableness against prior years' reports, and follow-up calls were made to resolve any questions. When states did not supply a data item, NCES estimated a value. These values are footnoted in the tables. If one or more states required an estimated number, then the national total for that item is marked as estimated. Any state early estimate that indicated a change of greater than 10 percentage points more or less than the national growth rate was replaced with an adjusted early estimate. Forty-eight states, the District of Columbia, and two outlying areas participated in the 1999-2000 \"Early Estimates of Public Elementary/Secondary Education Survey.\" The estimates reported here were provided by state education agencies and represent the best information on public elementary and secondary schools available to states at this stage of the school year. They are, however, subject to revision. All estimates for the two nonreporting states and the three outlying areas were calculated by NCES. (California, New Jersey, Guam, and Puerto Rico did not return the completed survey form. American Samoa's survey form was received after the cut-off date.) NCES also estimated missing data items for a number of reporting states. For other CCD surveys, in contrast, most nonfiscal data for school year 1999-2000 are reported to NCES from March 2000 through September 2000, after which they undergo NCES and state editing and are adjusted for missing data. High school graduate and fiscal data are reported a year later than student and teacher data. The tables in this publication include three kinds of data. \"Reported\" data are previously published figures. \"Preliminary\" data have not been published previously by NCES; for these, data collection is complete, and processing and data adjustments are through all but the final stage of review. \"Estimated\" data are those for the current (1999)(2000) school year.

Of these students, 533,000 were American Indian/Alaska Natives; 1,828,000 were Asian/Pacific Islanders; 6,939,000 were Hispanics; 7,923,000 were black, non-Hispanics; and 29,142,000 were white, non-Hispanics (table 5). 44 Table 6 presents the numbers of students receiving a regular high school diploma by racial/ethnic category for 1997-98. The U.S. totals could not be computed by race/ethnicity because data were missing for nine states.

This article was originally published as the Executive Summary of the handbook of the same name. This handbook helps to promote comparability of data at the local, state, and national levels, including data reported in the Common Core of Data (CCD) surveys. To make appropriate, cost-effective, and timely decisions about students, educators must have accurate and complete information. Recognizing this need, most education systems have moved from paper documents in filing cabinets to automated student information systems. These systems provide teachers and others concerned with effective program design with day-to-day access to information about the students' background, learning experiences, and performance. They also provide the flexibility necessary to supply aggregate data to school boards, state and federal governments, and other interested parties and to conduct program evaluations. To be effective, however, these systems must record data accurately and comparably for all students, in all places, and at all times. The Student Data Handbook for Elementary, Secondary, and Early Childhood Education was developed by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to provide guidance concerning the consistent maintenance of student information. This handbook is useful to public and private education agencies, schools, early childhood centers, and other educational institutions, as well as to researchers involved in the collection of student data. In addition, the handbook may be useful to elected officials and members of the public interested in student information. This handbook is not, however, a data collection instrument, nor does it reflect any type of federal data maintenance requirements. It is presented as a tool to help the public and the American school system make information about students more useful and effective in meeting student needs. This handbook was developed with the assistance of local, state, and federal education representatives and researchers. The definitions included are consistent with current state and local practice, national standards movements, and federal reporting requirements.

Since 1994, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has documented the large increase in access to computers and the Internet in the nation's public elementary and secondary schools (Williams 2000). This increase has led to a need to understand the extent and types of teacher use of computers and the Internet, as well as teachers' perceptions of their own preparedness to use these tools in their classes. To address these critical information needs, NCES commissioned a survey using the Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) that was conducted in the spring of 1999. The survey found that 99 percent of fulltime regular public school teachers reported they had access to computers or the Internet somewhere in their schools. This Stats in Brief focuses on those teachers. How Do Teachers Use Computers and the Internet at School? Teachers were asked the degree to which they used computers or the Internet to prepare for and manage their classes. Thirty-nine percent of public school teachers with access to computers or the Internet in their classroom or elsewhere 72 indicated they used computers or the Internet a lot to create instructional materials, and 34 percent reported using computers a lot for administrative recordkeeping (table 1). Less than 10 percent of teachers reported using computers or the Internet to access model lesson plans or to access research and best practices. Newer teachers were more likely to use computers or the Internet to accomplish various teaching objectives. Teachers with 9 or fewer years of teaching experience were more likely than teachers with 20 or more years of experience to report using computers or the Internet a lot to communicate with colleagues (30 percent with 3 or fewer years and 30 percent with 4 to 9 years, vs. 19 percent with 20 or more years) and gather information for lessons (21 and 22 percent vs. 11 percent for the same three groups). Also, teachers with 4 to 9 years of teaching experience were more likely to report they used computers or the Internet a lot to create instructional materials (47 percent) than were teachers with 20 or more years of experience (35 percent).

The study is based on a sample of students who began their postsecondary education in 1995-96 and were initially interviewed in 1996 as part of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:1996). These first-time beginning students were interviewed again in mid-1998, about 3 years after they had started their postsecondary education. A major purpose of BPS is to provide information about the persistence of beginning students in postsecondary education and their attainment of any certificates or degrees at different types of institutions. The report begins with an essay, which is followed by a compendium of tables. Because most students who began in 1995-96 would not have been enrolled long enough to complete a bachelor's degree at the time of the follow-up survey in 1998, the essay focuses on the persistence and attainment of students enrolled in programs leading to associate's degrees and vocational certificates at less-than -4year institutions. In particular, it compares the outcomes of students in public institutions with those in private forprofit institutions 3 years after they first enrolled. It also includes summary findings and tables about the characteristics of beginning students, with a particular emphasis on employment."}, {"section_title": "Enrollments and Persistence at Different Types of Institutions", "text": "Of the roughly 3 million students who first enrolled in postsecondary education in 1995-96, about 40 percent began in 4-year institutions (usually in bachelor's degree programs), but the majority began at less-than-4-year institutions, including 50 percent at 2-year institutions and about 10 percent at less-than-2-year institutions (figure A). Less-than-2-year institutions offer only vocational certificate programs that can be completed in anywhere from a few months to just under 2 years.. Two-year institutions offer both certificates and associate's degrees that require 2 to 3 years of full-time enrollment. The students who started at these less-than-4-year institutions in 1995-96 could have completed a certificate or associate's degree program by 80 1998, while those in 4-year bachelor's degree programs would normally just be completing their junior year of college. Persistence and attainment of students at 4-year, 2-year, and less-than-2-year institutions Attainment means that the student completed a program and earned a degree, defined broadly as including certificates. Persistence refers to all those who continued to be enrolled until they completed a program, and therefore includes those who attained a degree. Students who transferred from their original institution and continued to be enrolled or completed a program elsewhere have also persisted.

The majority of those who started at less-than-2-year institutions had attained a certificate or degree (58 percent), compared with 18 percent of those who started at 2-year institutions. Distribution of students across public and private for-profit 2-year and less-than-2-year institutions As shown in figure A, most of the beginning students who enrolled in the 2-year sector (91 percent) attended public institutions, usually community colleges. Most of those in the less-than-2-year sector (80 percent) attended private forprofit institutions (also known as proprietary or private career schools). The community colleges have a broad range of missions, from job training to offering lower division courses for students who want to transfer to 4-year institutions. The private for-profit institutions generally only offer programs that prepare students for specific occupations. 'Twenty percent of the freshmen transferred out of their initial 4-year institution."}, {"section_title": "Students Who Start at Less-Than-4-Year Institutions", "text": "The essay focuses on the less-than-4-year institutions, comparing the students who started at public with those who started at private for-profit institutions in terms of their degree programs, goals, and enrollment patterns. The analysis differentiates between students in certificate and associate's degree programs and further separates students in associate's degree programs into applied and liberal arts fields. One of the main questions addressed is why students who begin at less-than-4-year public institutions have lower rates of attainment than those who begin at less-than-4-year private for-profit institutions.' Programs, degree gols, and purpose In order to make a meaningful comparison between students who begin their postsecondary education at lessthan-4-year public and private for-profit institutions, it is important to examine the types of programs in which students enroll and, further, why they have enrolled. Figure  C illustrates how students in less-than-4-year public and private for-profit institutions were distributed with respect to both their program and field of study and their reported degree goals. 'The analysis excludes about 2 percent of beginning students, who are in less-than -4year private not-for-profit institutions (primarily junior colleges).

Unlike most private for-profit institutions, one of the missions of public 2-year institutions is to provide a means for students working toward a bachelor's degree to complete their lower division requirements and transfer to a 4-year institution. Students who transfer are not required to have earned an associate's degree. but if they successfully transfer, they have achieved their goal for that institution. Students in public institutions primarily reported goals of earning an associate's degree (47 percent) or transferring to a 4-year college without a degree (24 percent). In contrast, students in private for-profit institutions indicated goals of obtaining a vocational certificate (65 percent) or an associate's degree (18 percent), while few indicated any transfer intentions (2 percent). In both the public and the private for-profit sectors, approximately the same percentage reported having no degree goal (15 and 16 percent, respectively). That is, they were probably enrolled to advance their occupational skills or for their own personal enrichment. When students in less-than-4-year institutions were asked to report their primary reason for enrolling (separate from their degree goals), two-thirds of those in private for-profit institutions indicated that they wanted to gain job skills, compared with one-quarter of those in public institutions. Correspondingly, about one-third of students in public lessthan-4-year institutions reported plans to transfer to a 4year college, compared with only 2 percent of those in private for-profit institutions. Taking into account both students' degree goals and their primary purpose for enrolling, it is apparent that those enrolled in the private for-profit sector would be able to fulfill their intentions of earning a certificate or an associate's degree and, in the process, enhance their job skills all in the same institution. Students in the public sector, on the other hand, had less of an immediate occupational focus and often planned to transfer to a 4-year college without earning an associate's degree."}, {"section_title": "Persistence and attainment of students", "text": "A major difference between certificate and associate's degree programs is the time it takes to complete them. A vocational certificate program is often completed in about 1 year, while associate's degrees take at least 2 years to complete. Most of the beginning students at private for-profit less-than-4-year institutions were enrolled in short-term certificate programs (80 percent), while most of those in public institutions were enrolled in longer term associate's degree programs (80 percent) (figure C). Not only were the beginning students in the private forprofit institutions primarily enrolled in shorter programs, but most of them (about three-fourths) were full-time students during their entire enrollment. At the public institutions, about one-half of the beginning students started their enrollment full time, but just one-third continued to attend full time as long as they were enrolled. Moreover, about one-fourth of those in the public institu-tions were always enrolled part time, compared with about one-tenth in the private for-profit institutions. Full-time students are obviously able to progress through a program more quickly than part-time students. Since most of the students starting in the private for-profit sector were in shorter programs and attended full time as long as they were enrolled, it might be expected that they would have higher rates of degree attainment after 3 years than those who started at the public less-than-4-year institutions, where most of the students were in longer programs and less likely to attend full time. Comparing the students in the two sectors who began in vocational certificate programs and those who began in associate's degree programs controls for the effect of the difference in the length of these programs on attainment rates. The percentages displayed in figure D differentiate students who were still enrolled at the same institution from those who transferred and are limited to those who attained a degree at the first institution attended. The differences in attainment rates at public and private forprofit institutions are still evident within certificate and associate's degree programs. About one-half (54 percent) of those who began in certificate programs at private for-profit institutions attained a certificate at the first institution attended, compared with 30 percent of those who began at public institutions. The percentage of beginning students in associate's degree programs who attained associate's degrees at the first institution was also higher at the private forprofit institutions than at the public institutions (35 percent compared with 7 percent). There was no difference between sectors in the percentage of those in associate's degree programs who left postsecondary education from the first institution without a degree (34 percent). However, as might be expected from the difference in degree goals examined earlier, the percentage of those in associate's degree programs who left the first institution attended to transfer elsewhere was higher at the public than at the private for-profit institutions (23 percent compared with 9 percent). The difference in the attainment rates of beginning students in the two sectors appears to be related to the much higher percentage of full-time students in the private for-profit institutions.

Many for-profit institutions offer programs that allow continuous enrollment without regular term structures or summer vacations. This is reflected in the time it took students to attain degrees or certificates. Those fulltime students who completed certificates at private forprofit institutions finished in an average of 12 months, while those who completed certificates at public institutions required an average of 16 months. Similarly, those who completed an associate's degree at public institutions took an average of 25 months, 3 months longer than those who received an associate's degree at private for-profit institutions by 1998."}, {"section_title": "Profile of Low-Income Undergraduates", "text": "In 1995-96,26 percent of all undergraduates were low income. At private not-for-profit 4-year, public 4-year, and public 2-year institutions, the proportion of students who were low income ranged from 21 to 26 percent. A much greater proportion of students at private for-profit institutions were low income (48 percent), but relatively few (about 5 percent of all undergraduates) attended this type of institution. About one-half (49 percent) of all undergraduates were dependents, and a relatively small proportion were from low-income families ( figure A). The other half of the undergraduate population was about evenly divided between independents without and with dependents of their own. (Spouses are not considered dependents.) Independent students were more likely than dependents to be low income because their parents' financial circumstances are not considered for aid purposes.  Overall, 17 percent of dependent undergraduates were defined as low income. Certain groups were particularly likely to be in this category, including minorities and students whose parents had not gone to college. As parents' education increased, the percentage who were low income decreased (from 55 percent when both parents had less than a high school diploma to 23 percent when at least one parent had finished high school to 12 percent when at least one parent had attended college). Independents without dependents were almost twice as likely as dependents to be low income (31 percent were in this category). Rather than reflecting a disadvantaged background (there was no strong relationship between parents' education and students' low-income status), lowincome status was closely related to marital status, age, and employment and enrollment status. Independents without dependents were much more likely to be low income if they were single rather than married. The likelihood of being low income declined with age, in part because older students are more likely to be married and have greater earning potential. Students who did not work or considered themselves primarily students were more likely to be low income than those who considered themselves primarily employees. About half of those who enrolled full time, full year (51 percent) were low income. Independents with dependents include single or married students with children or other dependents. As indicated earlier, spouses are not considered dependents; their incomes are included in calculating family income. This group was the most likely to be low income (40 percent). As was true for independents without dependents, lowincome status was related to marital status, age, and primary role while enrolled (student or employee).

For dependent students, the amounts left after taking into account student earnings appear to be considerably higher than their families could afford to cover (and that data on parent contributions suggest that they are covering), especially at private not-for-profit 4-year institutions. For independents without dependents, earnings cover most of the net price at public 4-year institutions, but the gaps at private not-for-profit 4-year institutions and public 2-year institutions are large. The pattern is similar for independents with dependents. Despite these apparent gaps between the net price of attending and students' financial resources, the students are enrolled. How do they manage? One possibility is that they are surviving on a lower budget than estimated by their institutions. Other possibilities are that students are actually earning more than estimated (students often have numerous short-term jobs). are able to save from summer earnings, or have savings accumulated before they enrolled. let another is that they have received more than estimated from their parents.

The large increase in the proportion of independent student borrowers who took out unsubsidized loans in addition to subsidized loans (from about one-fourth in 1992-93 to about one-half in 1995-96) may be related in part to the organizational changes in the Stafford loan program.

Students were least likely to borrow at relatively low-tuition public 2-year (community) colleges, more likely to borrow at public 4year institutions where average tuition is about three times higher, and even more likely to borrow at private not-for-profit 4-year institutions where average tuition is about three times higher than at public 4-year institutions. The highest borrowing rates in all 3 years were among students at private for-profit institutions, which charged relatively high tuition and also enrolled large proportions of lowincome students attending full time. The percentage of all undergraduates with Stafford/SLS loans at public 2-year institutions remained low (6 percent or less) in all 3 years, although there was an increase in the percentage of full-time, full-year students obtaining loans (from 9 percent in 1989-90 to 15 percent in 1995-96). At the private for-profit institutions, the borrowing rates dropped between 1989-90 and 1992-93, but remained higher than in all other sectors (about 50 percent of all students borrowed). As a result of regulatory changes that restricted participation in the Stafford loan program of institutions with high default rates, the proportion of student borrowers attending private for-profit institutions dropped from 29 percent in 1989-90 to 12 percent in 1995-96. At the 4-year colleges and universities, there was a large growth in the percentage of all undergraduates borrowing between 1992-93 and 1995-96, both at the public institutions (from 23 percent to 35 percent) and at the private notfor-profit institutions (from 33 percent to 43 percent at public and 26 percent at private not-for-profit institutions). Tuition and borrowing at 4-year institutions At the public 4-year institutions, the average tuition for fulltime, full-year undergraduates increased by $800 between 1989-90 and 1992-93 (from $2,200 to $3,000), and by another $800 in 1995-96 (to $3,800). The change in the percentage of full-time, full-year dependent students with Stafford/SLS loans was 6 percentage points in the first period (from 18 to 24 percent), and then 15 percentage points in the second period (from 24 to 39 percent). The average loan increased by $600 in the first period (from $2,100 to $2,700), and then by $1,000 in the second period (from $2,700 to $3,700). The increases in tuition were the same in both periods, but the increases in borrowing were much greater in the second period. Borrowing increases and tuition increases were not proportional, in part because there were more restrictions on participation in the loan programs during the first period than during the second one. Over the 6-year period, the borrowing rates of full-time, full-year undergraduates at public 4-year institutions did not vary directly with tuition levels (figure E). The percent-92 age of students borrowing was about the same at all levels of tuition in each of the 3 years. Borrowing rates of students increased to similar levels no matter what the level of tuition was. A similar pattern is found among full-time, full-year undergraduates at private not-for-profit 4-year institutions. Average tuition was $8,900, $11,100, and $12,600 in the 3 years, respectively. While the tuition increase was greater between 1989-90 and 1992-93 than between 1992-93 and 1995-96, borrowing rates and average loan amounts were greater in the second period. There was also no direct relationship between borrowing rates and the level of tuition within each academic year. With some exceptions, borrowing rates increased to similar levels whether tuition was relatively low or relatively high. The annual increases in the size of loans resulted in much higher total cumulative amounts for college seniors at both types of 4-year institutions. Between 1992-93 and 1995-96, the cumulative loan amount for 4th-and 5th-year undergraduates at public 4-year institutions grew from $7,000 to $11,000.

Asian/Pacific Islander (78 percent) and non-Hispanic white (64 percent) full-time faculty were more likely than black, non-Hispanic faculty members (51 percent) to be engaged in research or similar scholarly activity, although the type of activity pursued did not, in general, vary consistently across racial/ethnic groups.

Younger teachers are still developing careers that their older colleagues have long since established. This emerges in the findings that, regardless of employment status (full time or part time), younger teachers were more likely to hold only a baccalaureate or less as the highest earned credential and more likely to accept the possibility of moving on to another full-time job. The second major difference lies in the employment histories of the two groups. For example, among full-time faculty, the younger teachers were more likely than their older colleagues to indicate that they had held other jobs since earning their highest credential (figure C).

In addition, they were more likely to accept the possibility of seeking other employment. These differences apply to both full-and part-time faculty.

Zimbler (Undo zimbler@ed.goy). To obtain the complete report (NCES 2000-192) As college costs have escalated in recent years, concern about the quality of undergraduate education has intensified. Some concerns focus on what is being taught (e.g., Bloom 1987), while others emphasize who is doing the teaching (e.g., Huber 1992). The latter concern, which is the focus of this report, has become prominent because of the widespread perception that undergraduate students are increasingly taught by part-time, junior, or nontenure-track faculty and that senior and experienced professors care little about undergraduate education (Boyer Commission 1998). Despite the considerable attention that both the higher education community and the media have recently paid to this concern, little information at the national level has been obtained regarding who teaches undergraduates in U.S. higher education institutions and what their teaching loads are. Using data from the 1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:1993), the purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which instructional faculty and staff of higher education institutions are involved in undergraduate teaching.' Specifically, it addressed the following two questions: (1) Who teaches undergraduates in the classroom? and (2) How much do they teach? The findings are based on a nationally representative sample of instructional faculty and staff who provided classroom instruction for credit to undergraduates in the fall of 1992.2"}, {"section_title": "Instructional Faculty and Staff Who Taught Classes for Credit to Undergraduates", "text": "In the fall of 1992, a vast majority (86 percent) of instructional faculty and staff employed in higher education institutions provided classroom instruction to undergradu-'Using graduate teaching assistants for undergraduate instruction has become increasingly common at U.S. higher education institutions and has recently received much attention from the media (Wilson 1999). Unfortunately, the data used in this report from NSOPF:1993, which excludes teaching assistants, cannot address this issue. 2NSOF'F:1993 is a study of faculty and instructional staff.ln the fall of 1992, there were approximately 1,034,000 faculty and instructional staff employed in U.S. higher education institutions.Of these, about 817,000 reported teaching one or more classes for credit during the fall.These individuals became the base sample of this report, from which those who taught undergraduate classes for credit were identified. Excluded from the sample were faculty and staff who did not teach any classes during the fall (i.e., those engaged exclusively in research, administration, or public service); those who taught only independent study or one-on-one classes; or those who supervised undergraduate or graduate thesis or dissertation work without teaching any class for credit. aces for credit ( figure A). Their high involvement in undergraduate teaching not only was evident in 2-year institutions, where all instructional faculty and staff reported teaching classes for credit to undergraduates, but also was apparent in 4-year institutions. For example, 89 percent of instructional faculty and staff at 4-year nondoctoral institutions and 67 percent at 4-year doctoral institutions reported teaching at least one class for credit to undergraduates in fall 1992. Because there was no variation among instructional faculty and staff at 2-year institutions regarding who taught undergraduate classes. the analysis in this section excluded these faculty members and focused on only those at 4-year institutions. While nearly four in five (79 percent) instructional faculty and staff at 4-year institutions reported teaching undergraduates in the classroom in 1992, relatively fewer taught only these students, especially only lower division students (i.e., freshmen and sophomores) (table A). For example, 66 percent of instructional faculty and staff at 4-year institutions reported teaching only undergraduate classes. Of those who reported teaching at least one undergraduate class, one in four (25 percent) reported that all of the classes they taught were at the lower division level.' Thus, while most instructional faculty and staff at 4-year institutions who had teaching responsibilities were involved in undergraduate teaching, relatively fewer of them devoted their teaching entirely to undergraduates, particularly at the lower division level. Who taught undergraduates varied considerably among instructional faculty and staff at 4-year institutions. In general, faculty who were employed part time, were female, held a lower academic rank such as instructor or lecturer, worked in a nontenure-track position, had a highest degree below a doctoral or professional degree, and earned a lower salary from their institution were more likely than their counterparts to teach undergraduates, particularly only undergraduates or only lower division students (table A). The multivariate analysis on who was likely to teach only undergraduate classes further revealed that although the 30r about 20 percent of instructional faculty and staff who had undergraduate classroom teaching duties reported teaching only lower division classes (25 x 79/100 = 20 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Undergraduate Teaching Loads of Instructional Faculty and Staff Who Taught One or More Classes for Credit to Undergraduates", "text": "In the fall of 1992, instructional faculty and staff' in all types of higher education institutions (including 2-year institutions) taught about 2.3 undergraduate classes with a 5This analysis was restricted to instructional faculty and staff who reported teaching one or more classes for credit to undergraduates.Thus, those who taught classes for credit to graduate students only were excluded. Undergraduate teaching loads were not uniformly distributed across institutions. For example, full-time instructional faculty and staff at 4-year doctoral institutions had lighter undergraduate teaching loads than their full-time colleagues at 4-year nondoctoral institutions, who, in turn, had lighter undergraduate teaching loads than those who taught full time at 2-year institutions (table C). In addition, with a few exceptions, full-time senior faculty (i.e., full or associate professors, or tenured faculty) tended to teach larger but fewer undergraduate classes, whereas full-time junior faculty (i.e., instructors, lecturers, or assistant professors, or those working in a nontenure-track position) taught smaller but more undergraduate classes. Full-time senior faculty also spent fewer hours each week teaching undergraduates in class than their junior counterparts. The combination of smaller class sizes with more classroom hours (or vice versa) resulted in full-time senior and junior faculty members having similar undergraduate student contact hours.

To obtain the complete report (NCES 2000-186) In recent years, public concern over the academic standing of U.S. students relative to students in other countries has increased dramatically. Much of this concern is due to the results of recent comparative reports that show U.S. students lagging behind their international classmates, especially in mathematics. International assessments of academic achievement provide important benchmarks to measure the progress of U.S. students, yet these studies often fail to explain the differences in achievement across countries. We are interested in not only how well U.S. students perform on achievement tests relative to their counterparts in other nations, but how different their education is in all respects. For example, we often hear people explain the low U.S. test scores by saying that the students in the United States represent a more diverse population: there are more different languages spoken in the United States, and we have higher poverty rates than other major industrialized nations. But how much truth is in this type of statement? This report examines the elementary and secondary school system in the United States relative to the education systems in 11 other countries.

The biggest earnings differential was seen in the United States, where those without a high school diploma earned about 64 percent of the salaries earned by those with a high school diploma."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The final chapter of the report examines any connections between the various educational inputs and outputs by correlating countries' input measures described in chapters 2 and 3 of the report with output measures described in chapters 4 and 5. Overall, almost none of the measured classroom, teacher, student. or financial inputs correlated with any of the achievement measurestest scores in mathematics, science, or readingwith the exception of per pupil expenditures and ninth-grade reading scores. Next, secondary school completion and tertiary enrollment rates are examined. Although no input measure correlated significantly with secondary school completion rates, one input did show a significant correlation with tertiary enrollment. Developed countries with high percentages of children in poverty, after accounting for government transfer programs, also had high percentages of 18-to 21year -olds enrolled in tertiary education. The United States exemplifies this tendency by having high college enrollment rates and high poverty rates for children. Compared to some other developed countries, the percentage of U.S. children in poverty does not decrease as much after accounting for government transfer programs. The positive correlation of poverty and college enrollment may result from such factors as the interaction of government funding decisions, availability and perceived value of higher education, and the nature (e.g., public vs. private) of social service delivery programs. Finally, input measures were correlated with the various labor market outcomes. One interesting relationship appeared between public expenditures and a labor market outcome. Figure B shows a positive relationship between expenditures as a percentage of GDP and labor force participation rates. In other words, the greater proportion of money a government spends on education relative to its wealth, the more students with an upper secondary education enter the labor force. For example, Sweden reported both the highest level of expenditures as a percentage of 290 EDUCATION STATISTICS QUARTERLY VOLUME 2, ISSUE 2, SUMMER 2000 GDP (4.7) and the highest labor force participation rate (90 percent). Similarly, Germany had both the lowest level of expenditures as a percentage of GDP (3.0) and the lowest labor force participation rate (76 percent). Both the United States and the United Kingdom fell in the middle of both categories. No other input measure was associated with any of rhe other output measures. These analyses lead us to conclude 112 that very little of the variation in educational outputs can be explained through the quantifiable inputs most frequently measured. Yet, there is a wide variation in outputs among the different countries studied. indicated by the research. Another explanation is that we are looking at the wrong measures. Another hypothesis is that some of these factors are significant, but interact in such a way that the significance cannot be measured using bivariate analyses. However, the limited number of countries precludes extensive multivariate analyses. Another explanation is that we may not be focusing on the best measures. The inputs discussed in this report are primarily quantifiable inputs, and not indicators of quality. For example, no mention has been made of curriculum content, learning processes, or quality of teacher training. In addition, ways in which students learn (e.g., how teachers present subject material), the role of the teacher, the relevance of the homework assignments, or the kinds of activities in which students are engaged after class all relate to student learning, and thus to outcome measures. Studying these components of the education system is not as easy as collecting administrative data. Understanding these types of inputs requires a more qualitative analysis of curricula, site visits to classrooms, or interviews with teachers and students."}, {"section_title": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE_", "text": "On the other hand, financial inputs and background characteristics could truly have less of an impact on student outcomes than curricular inputs and teaching methods. Other, more qualitative, measures may provide further insight into these differences among countries, but care should be taken in drawing inferences about cause and effect. For example, different teaching styles may work better in some countries than others. Elementary and secondary education is a large and complex system. International comparisons allow U.S. policymakers to evaluate strategies that appear to be successful in other countries.

Reading performance scores for 9-and 13-year-olds were somewhat higher in 1996 than they were in 1971. However, there has been little change since the mid-1980s. The reading performance of 17-year-olds was about the same in 1996 as it was in 1971. Black 13-and 17-year-olds exhibited higher reading performance in 1996 than in 1971. Black 9year -olds' performance improved significantly between 1971 and 1980, but it has not improved further. The performance levels of white 9-and 13-year-olds also rose between 1971 and 1996. Separate data for Hispanics were not gathered in 1971, but changes between 1975 and 1996 indicate an increase among 9-year-olds. There was no significant difference between the 1975 and 1996 reading performance of 13-and 17-year-old Hispanics. Mathematics. Results from assessments of mathematics proficiency indicate that 9-and 13-year-old students improved their performance between 1973 and 1996. However, there has been no significant change for 9-yearolds since 1990, and the performance of older students on advanced mathematical operations has been stable. The proportion of 17-year-olds who demonstrated skill with moderately complex procedures and reasoning rose from 52 percent in 1978 to 60 percent in 1996. During the same time period, the proportion of 17-year-olds with skill in multistep problem solving and algebra remained unchanged. White, black, and Hispanic students improved their mathematics performance between 1973 and 1996, among all three age groups. and Hispanic 9-, 13-and 17-year-olds improved between 1986 and 1996. Science. Long-term changes in science performance have been mixed, though changes over the past 10 years have been generally positive. In 1996, science performance among 17-year-olds was lower than in 1970, but higher than in 1986. The science performance level of 13-year-olds was higher in 1996 than in 1986, recouping earlier declines. The science performance of 9-year-olds increased between 1986 and 1996, after showing no significant change between 1970 and 1986. The science performance of white 9-and 13-year-olds was about the same in 1996 as it was in 1970, and the performance of 17-year-olds was lower in 1996. However, the performance at each of the three age groups was higher in 1996 than in 1986. Black and Hispanic 9-and 13-year-olds had higher science performance in 1996 than in the 1970s. Black 17-year-olds showed a decline through 1982 but then an increase by 1996. Despite significant gains by younger black and Hispanic students, their average performance remains lower than for white students. Although the performance gap between black and white students has narrowed, the science performance for black 13-year-olds was slightly lower than the average for white 9-year-olds in 1996. International comparisons. The results of a 1995 international assessment in math and science show that U.S. fourth-and eighth-graders compare more favorably with students in other countries in science than in mathematics. In mathematics, U.S. eighth-graders scored below the international average, falling below 20 of the 41 countries tested. Fourth-graders performed above the international average, scoring below 7 of the 26 countries tested, including Singapore, Korea, and Japan. Students at both the fourth-and eighth-grade levels scored above the international average in science. Eighth-grade students in the United States were outperformed by those in 9 out of 41 countries. Fourth-grade students once again compared more favorably with their international counterparts than eighth-grade students. Out of 26 countries that participated in the fourth-grade assessment, students in only 1 country outperformed the U.S. students in science. The international standing of U.S. students was stronger at the 8th grade than at the 12th grade in both mathematics and science among the countries that participated in the assessments at both grade levels. U.S. 12th-graders performed below the international average and among the lowest scoring of the 21 countries on the assessment of mathematics general knowledge. U.S. students were outperformed by those in 14 countries, and outperformed those in 2 countries. U.S. 12th-graders also performed below the international average and among the lowest scoring of the 21 countries on the assessment of science general knowledge. U.S. students were outperformed by students in 11 countries, and they outperformed students in 2 countries.

The design effect is defined as the ratio of the sampling variance of the statistic under the actual sampling design divided by the variance that would be expected for a simple random sample of the same-size. Hence, the design effect is unity (1.00), by definition, for simple random samples. For most practical sampling designs, the survey design effect is greater than unity, reflecting that the precision is less than could be achieved with a simple random sampling of the same size (if such a design were practical). The size of the survey design effect depends largely on the sample size and intracluster correlation within the primary sampling units. Hence, statistics that are based on observations that are highly correlated within institutions will have higher design effects for BPS.

Survey nonresponse results in bias when the unobserved outcomes for the nonrespondents are systematically different from the observed outcomes for the respondents. Hence, we can model the potential for nonresponse bias by modeling the pattern of mean response by date of response. We first used the date of interview (or date of last access for non-CATI responses) to subdivide the 10,268 survey respondents into 10 groups of approximately 1,000 respondents each. Then, within each institution level (less-than-2 year, 2-year, and 4-year), we again subdivided all respondents into 10 groups of approximately equal numbers of respondents. This strategy was adopted so that the mean response in each group would have approximately the same precision. However, it also results in respondent groups with shorter ranges of dates at the beginning of data collection because relatively larger numbers of interviews were completed during the first few months of data collection. We examined the pattern of cumulative mean response by date of interview for the following: mean age in the base year; percent minority; percent enrolled in spring 1998; percent who attained a degree by June 1998; and mean number of risk factors. In addition, for all students combined, we examined the mean of the institution level attended in the base year. For students who attended 4-year institutions in the base year, we examined the percentage who reported in the base year that they were attempting a baccalaureate degree. If the mean responses from the later groups of respondents are reasonably consistent, then obtaining additional responses probably will have little effect on survey estimates and nonresponse bias probably is negligible. Some potential for bias by institution level was evident for overall population estimates because it appears that additional respondents would be more likely to have attended less-than-4-year institutions. The only other evidence of potential for bias was with respect to the percentage of respondents who were enrolled in the spring of 1998. For students from 4-year institutions and for the sample as a whole, it appears that additional respondents would be more likely to have not been enrolled in the spring of 1998.
