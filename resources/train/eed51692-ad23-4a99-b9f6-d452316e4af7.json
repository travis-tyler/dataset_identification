We document robust, statistically significant one-hour weekly gender gaps in secondary students' non-school study time using time-diary data from the 2003-2012 waves of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) and transcript data from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS).

It is troubling, then, that differences by socioeconomic status (SES) in college attendance, persistence, and completion rates have grown over the past thirty years (Bailey & Dynarski, 2011; Bound & Turner, 2011) . Meanwhile, the long-standing gender gap in educational attainment has closed and actually reversed during this time, as women now attend and complete college at higher rates than men (Bailey & Dynarski, 2011; Bound & Turner, 2011) . These trends are interelated, as the gender gap has grown at the expense of low-SES males (Buchmann & DiPrete, 2006) . Both trends have received attention from policymakers, educators, scholars, and pundits. However, the underlying causes of these phenomena remain unclear (Bound & Turner, 2011; Buchmann, DiPrete, & McDaniel, 2008) .\nUnderstanding the causes of gaps in college completion is crucial for policymakers and educators seeking to devise policies that create equal educational opportunities for all students.\nDifferences by SES and gender in children's non-cognitive skills, such as self control and persistence, may contribute to such gaps (Jacob, 2002; Lundberg, 2013) . Others have speculated that higher levels of parental involvement in high-SES households may facilitate the transmission of educational attainment across generations (Checchi, 2006; Guryan, Hurst, & Kearney, 2008; Hardy & Gershenson, 2014; Ramey & Ramey, 2010) . Time devoted to academics outside the traditional school day likely reflects both the non-cognitive skills that influence postsecondary success (Jacob, 2002; Singh et al., 2002) and parents' attentiveness (Hoover-Dempsey et al., 2001; Xu & Corno, 1998) . Accordingly, the current study investigates the distribution of SES and gender gaps in effort put forth outside the traditional schoolday, as measured by secondary school students' non- The ATUS time diaries are the ideal instruments with which to measure homework time, as time diaries are relatively robust to social desirability bias (Juster & Stafford, 1991) and contain information on participation in other activities that may \"crowd out\" homework. However, the ATUS is limited by a lack of information on students' cognitive ability, past academic performance, and course taking, which may be correlated with gender, SES, and time spent on homework. Accordingly, we augment the ATUS analyses with similar analyses of the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS), which contains the high school transcripts of tenth graders in 2002 as well as students' performance on standardized math and reading tests.\nWhile the ELS did not conduct time diary surveys, it did ask students how much time they spent on homework in a typical week. Corno (1993) argues that volition, the combination of conscientiousness and discipline, has too often been omitted from theoretical models of learning. This is similar to recent arguments regarding the importance of non-cognitive skills (e.g., Heckman & Kautz, 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Background and Literature Review", "text": "Indeed, educational theorists have long believed that volition and volitional efficiency are critical determinants of educational success (Sockett, 1988) . Homework is an activity that both requires and builds non-cognitive skills, as Corno (1993) argues that completion of homework requires educational volition and Alleman and Brophy (1991) suggest that teachers should use homework assignments to develop non-cognitive skills. This view has led researchers such as Jacob (2002) to use homework time as a proxy for non-cognitive skills.\nStudents may have both intrinsic and extrinsic reasons for working on homework, though empirical evidence suggests that only intrinsic motivation is significantly related to homework completion (Xu, 2005) . Interest is another important predictor of secondary students' homework completion, which Xu (2008) notes can be derived from three sources: demographic and SES background, parental attitudes and involvement, and intellectual ability. Similarly, Cooper et al. (1998) show that parental attitudes towards homework influence children's attitudes. There is likely heterogeneity in the benefits that students receive from completing homework, particularly by the type of home environments in which students complete assignments (Corno, 1996; Kalenkoski & Pabilonia, 2014) . There are also gender differences in homework interest (Xu, 2008) and homework management skills (Xu, 2006) among secondary school students. These differences, which likely map into differences in time spent on homework, result from both sociological and psychological factors. For example, girls in this age range are more self-reliant, disciplined, and ambitious in course taking than boys (Duckworth & Seligman, 2006; Xu, 2006) .\nA large empirical literature has investigated the relationship between time spent on homework and children's cognitive and non-cognitive development; see Cooper, Robinson, and Patall (2006) for a review. Xu and Corno (1998) found evidence that homework contributed to growth in children's non-cognitive skills. Singh et al. (2002) used data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS88) to show that time spent on homework had positive effects on math and science test scores. Cooper et al. (1998) found that time spent on homework had larger effects on student achievement in secondary grades than in earlier grades, which is perhaps an instance of \"skills begetting skills.\" Most relevant to the current study, Kalenkoski and Pabilonia (2014) used time diary data to show that time spent on homework has a positive impact on boys' high school grade point averages (GPAs), which are a measure of both cognitive and non-cognitive ability.\nSeveral studies have also investigated the relationship between homework habits and educational attainment, many of which use NELS88 data. For example, Jacob (2002) used time spent on homework as a measure of non-cognitive skills and found that gender differences in non-cognitive skills had positive effects on college completion. Finally, Kalenkoski and Pabilonia (2014) used time diary data to show that high school boys' time spent on homework has a positive effect on the probability of attending college.\nThe current study connects the literatures on homework, non-cognitive skills, and academic success by furthering our understanding of the magnitude and determinants of gender and SES gaps in secondary students' time use outside of the traditional school day. Specifically, we use two complementary, nationally representative datasets to test the hypotheses that female and high-SES secondary students spend more time on homework, on average, than their male and less-advantaged counterparts. Given the established connection between time spent on homework, non-cognitive skills, and educational attainment discussed in this section, it is likely that observable differences by gender and SES in non-school study time contribute to corresponding gaps in educational attainment. We also probe the factors that might contribute to such gaps, such as household structure, cognitive ability, advanced course taking, and students' participation in activities that might \"crowd out\" homework time such as organized extracurricular activities, after-school jobs, and sibling care."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The current study tests for differences by SES and gender in secondary students' time spent studying outside of the traditional school day. Because non-school study time is arguably a socially desirable activity, traditional survey questions potentially yield upward-biased responses (Grimm, 2010) . As a result, retrospective time diaries are the preferred instrument with which to accurately measure students' non-school study time (Juster & Stafford, 1991) . Accordingly, we begin our analysis using time diaries collected by the American Time Use Survey (ATUS).\nThe ATUS is nationally representative and has been consistently administered annually since 2003 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The ATUS collects a 24-hour retrospective time diary from one individual over age 15 per household from a subset of the Current Population Survey (CPS) sampling frame and links each diary to demographic, employment, education, and income data from the CPS for all members of the diary respondent's household. The analytic sample for the current study is restricted to the 5,909 respondents aged 15 to 19 who selfreported being enrolled in high school at the time of completing the time diary and for whom basic demographic variables are observed. Because weekends and certain demographic groups and months are oversampled by the ATUS, all subsequent analyses are weighted by person-day weights that account for unequal probabilities of selection across households, months, and days of the week. The person-day nature of the sampling weights reinforces the fact that time diaries such as the ATUS sample both individuals and calendar days.\nHowever, the ATUS is limited by its lack of information on students' school environments. For example, advanced course taking, cognitive ability, and school climate are all potentially correlated with homework time, gender, and SES. Therefore, to provide a fuller understanding of the size and nature of gaps in homework time, we augment the ATUS analysis with similar analyses of the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS), which is a nationally representative survey of tenth-grade students in 2002 that was conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics. Importantly, the ELS contains student transcripts that provide information on students' course grades and the semesters in which specific courses were taken.\nAdditionally, the ELS contains students' achievement on standardized math and reading tests, which we take as proxies for cognitive ability, and school indicators that facilitate a school-fixed effects (FE) strategy to control for school climate. The analytic sample contains about 13,210 students in 735 schools for whom all relevant variables are observed. All subsequent analyses are weighted to adjust for unequal probabilities of sample selection and survey nonresponse."}, {"section_title": "Dependent Variables", "text": "The outcome of interest is time spent on homework outside the traditional school day. In the ATUS time spent on homework is measured in minutes per day. Specifically, the \"Research/Homework\" time-diary activity code includes non-school time spent doing required (assigned) homework and research, time spent doing homework and research for personal interest or fulfillment, waiting time associated with homework and research, and miscellaneous time associated with homework and research. We do not decompose the broad measure of homework time or conduct analyses of specific subcategories due to a lack of power and to avoid potential \"multiple comparison\" problems (Schochet, 2008) .\nPanel A of Table 1 summarizes the homework time of students in the analytic sample both overall and by gender. The average respondent spent about 48 minutes on homework and the standard deviation of 83.5 indicates a substantial amount of variation in homework time across respondents. On average, females spent about 15 minutes more per day on homework than males, a statistically significant difference, and there is also more variation in female homework time than in male homework time. A statistically significant eight percentage point gender gap is also observed in homework participation, as 46% of girls did at least some homework on the diary day compared to only 38% of boys. Implications of this non-participation, or \"pile up\" at zero, are discussed in the methodology section. Conditional on the respondent completing some homework on the diary day, the overall average increases to 112 minutes, but the significant difference of nearly 15 minutes between males and females remains. These descriptive statistics suggest that there are unconditional gender gaps in homework on both the extensive (participation) and intensive (time) margins.\nThe ELS contains a self-reported, top-coded, categorical indicator of students' typical weekly hours of homework. The top-code includes reports of 26 or more hours of weekly homework. It is unclear whether the \"zero hours\" category is limited to strict non-participation or if it includes small amounts of homework time that respondents rounded to zero. The implications of the limited nature of the ELS homework variable are discussed in the methodology section. Panel B of Table 1 shows that there is a statistically significant gender gap of about 1.2 hours per week, where the top-code category is simply treated as 26 hours. It is unlikely that the bias in the estimated means attributable to the top-coding is large, as only 1% of respondents reported spending 26 or more hours per week on homework and the fixed number of hours per day limits the maximum possible value of this variable. There is once again a significant difference by gender in the probability of reporting zero homework time.\nAs mentioned at the outset, one concern with the ELS estimates is that the self-reported homework times are biased upwards due to social desirability bias. It is therefore instructive to compare the ATUS, which are less susceptible to this problem, to the ELS estimates. After scaling the ATUS estimates up to the weekly level, we see that the ELS average weekly homework time is about 0.3 hours (5.5%) greater than the corresponding ATUS estimate, as expected. Interestingly, this over-reporting is entirely due to male students, as the mean weekly homework time among females is identical in the ATUS and ELS data. As a result, the gender gaps identified in analyses of the ELS data likely represent lower bounds of the true gender gap."}, {"section_title": "Independent Variables", "text": "The independent variables of interest in the current study are gender and socioeconomic status (SES). We measure SES using categorical indicators of both fathers' and mothers' educational attainment and household income, as the existing literature on parents' and children's time use stresses the differences between college-educated and less educated parents (e.g., Gershenson, 2013; Guryan et al., 2008; Kalil, Ryan, & Corey, 2012; Ramey & Ramey, 2010) and household budget constraints likely govern secondary school students' non-work time use and ability to participate in organized extracurricular activities. Household income in both datasets is top-coded and reported in coarse brackets. In analyses of both datasets, we combine households earning less than $20,000 in one ''low-income household'' category, which is in line with the U.S. census poverty line for a family of four during this time.\n1 Online appendix table A.1 summarizes the key independent variables for both datasets both overall, and separately by gender. The two datasets are broadly similar, which is unsurprising given that both are nationally representative cross-sections of similar time periods. Additionally, parents' schooling and average household incomes are similar for both male and female students."}, {"section_title": "Control Variables", "text": "In addition to testing for \"unadjusted\" gender and SES gaps in secondary students' nonschool study time, we also estimate \"adjusted\" gaps conditional on a rich set of observed household and student characteristics. This is done both to increase the precision of estimated gender and SES gaps and to control for potentially confounding omitted variables. The demographic controls are summarized in panel A of online appendix table A.2. The average ATUS respondent was about 16 years old, while all ELS respondents were tenth-graders.\nStudents in the ATUS sample are more likely to be white and to live in a two-parent household than students in the ELS sample, which is likely due to the fact that ATUS sampled the U.S.\npopulation while the ELS sampled the U.S. tenth-grade student population. Like with the SES indicators discussed in the previous subsection, the demographic, household structure, and employment characteristics of male respondents are quite similar to those of females.\nPanel B of table table A .2 reports the percentage of respondents who participated in three specific activities on the diary day that might \"crowd out\" homework time (Kalenkoski & Pabilonia, 2014) : organized extracurricular activities (including sport and non-sport activities), childcare (of household children), and work for pay (outside of household). 6 These data are only available for the ATUS sample, as the ELS did not administer time diaries. Gender differences in participation in these activities might contribute to gender gaps in time spent on homework. Boys are twice as likely to participate in an organized activity on the diary day and this difference, which is strongly statistically significant, is largely driven by participation in school sports. Girls, meanwhile, are about two-thirds more likely to care for household children than boys and again this difference is statistically significant. Male and female respondents were equally likely to work for pay on the diary day.\nAnalyses of the ATUS time-use data utilize a number of other controls that are commonly used in time-use regressions (e.g., Gershenson, 2013; Kalenkoski & Pabilonia, 2014) .\nWhen relevant, these controls are also included in ELS analyses. First, to account for possible cultural differences in time use, race and ethnicity indicators are included in the empirical model. (Zick & Bryant, 1996) .\nSimilarly, age is one of the most important predictors of children's time use (Zick & Bryant, 1996) , so respondent's age is included in the time-use regressions.\nThe day of week, month, and year of the time diary are controlled for. Time-use patterns are likely to differ between weekdays and weekends, and even across weekdays (e.g., Fridays are structurally different from other weekdays). Similarly, there may be fewer homework assignments and extracurricular activities in months at the start and end of the school year. The ATUS analysis also conditions on year fixed effects to control for changes in the national economy that may jointly predict household income and time use.\nFinally, panel C of Another potential difference between male and female high school students that might affect time spent on homework is differential rates of advanced course taking. For example, girls are more likely to be in academic tracks while boys are more likely to be in vocational tracks (Jacob, 2002) . To estimate the size of the gender homework gap conditional on course taking, we estimate models that control for tenth-grade course FE based on data from student transcripts.\nOnline appendix table A.3 summarizes the coding scheme, the specific courses assigned to each categorical indicator, and the percentage of the sample enrolled in each course category."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "We estimate linear time-use regressions of the form:\nwhere i indexes respondents; T is non-school study time; Male is a gender indicator; SES is a vector of the categorical indicators of respondents' parents' educational attainment and\nhousehold income described above; X is the vector of statistical controls described above; and u is an idiosyncratic error term. We estimate versions of equation (1) that restrict \u03b2 to equal zero to see how conditioning on covariates changes estimated time-use gaps as well as versions of (1) that exclude the state and school FE from the vector X. To further investigate the underlying causes of gender gaps in non-school study time we estimate versions of (1) Reassuringly, sensitivity analyses reported in the online appendix confirm the robustness of the OLS estimates. Specifically, the ATUS analysis is augmented with Tobit model estimates that account for the non-negative nature of time use and the \"pile up\" at zero. Tobit average partial effects (APE) (Wooldridge, 2013, pp. 596-604) , which can be directly compared to OLS coefficient estimates, are reported in online appendix table A.4. As expected, the Tobit APE are qualitatively similar to the preferred OLS estimates (Foster & Kalenkoski, 2013) . Similarly, table\nA.5 reports estimates of a variety of models that address the limited nature of the to-coded, count nature of the ELS homework variable: Type 1 Tobit, two-limit tobit, Poisson regression, rightcensored Poisson regression, and interval regression (Raciborski, 2011; Wooldridge, 2013) .\nOnce again, these estimates are remarkably similar to the preferred OLS estimates. Table 2 presents baseline OLS estimates of equation (1). Column 1 shows that on average, males spend about 15 fewer homework minutes per day than females. This gender gap is strongly statistically significant and remains so after conditioning on SES indicators, statistical controls, daily activities, and state FE in columns 3 through 6, respectively. Column 2 shows that there are significant SES gaps in homework time that are primarily driven by the children of college educated parents and students in the wealthiest households. The parental-education gaps in non-school study time are robust to conditioning on gender, statistical controls, daily activities, and state FE in columns 3 through 6, respectively. Interestingly, however, conditioning on statistical controls and state FE causes the income gap in homework time to fall by nearly 50% and lose statistical significance."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Daily Homework Time in the ATUS", "text": "Participating in organized extracurricular activities and in paid work outside the household on the diary day are both associated with significantly less homework time. However, there is no effect of participating in childcare on non-school study time, perhaps because childcare is sometimes a passive (i.e., secondary) activity during which children can simultaneously perform homework. on different subsamples to further investigate potential sources of the gender gap in non-school study time. The first result of note is that in low-income households, males who engage in childcare of siblings actually do significantly more homework than females. This could be due to a selection effect associated with males who engage in childcare or males being more likely to multitask.\nThe second result of note is that the gender gap is slightly larger in low-income and single-parent households, which is consistent with the finding that low-SES males play an important role in the reversal of the gender gap in educational achievement (Buchmann & DiPrete, 2006) . These findings could be at least partly due to teenage males in low-income and single-parent households taking on relatively more responsibilities than teenage females, both within and outside the household. Interestingly, however, the interaction terms reported in table 3 provide no evidence that this is the case. Together, the results reported in table 3 suggest that gender gaps are not explained by gendered differences in daily time use. Table 4 presents baseline OLS estimates of equation (1). Column 1 shows that on average, males spend about 1.25 fewer homework hours per week than females. This gender gap is strongly statistically significant and remains so after conditioning on SES indicators, statistical controls, academic achievement, coursework FE, and school FE in columns 3 through 7,"}, {"section_title": "Weekly Homework Time in the ELS", "text": "respectively. However, in the richest specifications that condition on coursework and school FE, the gender gap decreases slightly by about one quarter of an hour. Column 2 shows that there are significant \"raw\" SES gaps in homework time, both in terms of household income and parents' educational attainment. However, the richest model specification (column 7) that conditions on school FE all but removes the SES gap in weekly homework time.\nNinth grade GPA is positively associated with homework time in all specifications, and the effect is substantively large: a one point increase in GPA is associated with about one more hour of homework per week. This suggests that on average, low grades in ninth grade do not cause an increase in effort, as measured by homework time, in tenth grade. Performance on English Language Arts (ELA) and mathematics standardized tests is positively associated with homework time, as students scoring in the bottom quartile of either test spend between 0.4 and 0.8 fewer hours per week on homework than their higher-scoring peers. Interestingly, however, there are no significant differences in homework time between the highest-scoring students and students in the middle of the distribution for either ELA or mathematics. Table 5 reports estimates of extensions of equation (1) that interact the male indicator with the academic achievement variables and estimate the model separately by SES categories.\nThe estimates reported in column 1 of table 5 suggest that the gender gap in homework time is mostly due to the time use of high-performing and high-math ability students, as males in the top quartile of the distribution of math ability perform about twenty minutes less homework per week than similarly talented females. Similarly, while students with higher prior year GPAs spend significantly more time per week on homework than their lower-performing counterparts, this gap is significantly larger among females than males. Importantly, the results presented in table 4 and in column 1 of table 5 suggest that the gender gap is not driven by differences in course taking or academic ability, but rather by within-group differences in effort.\nColumns 2 through 5 of table 5 present estimates of the same interaction specification on different subsamples to further investigate potential sources of the gender gap in non-school study time. These estimates show that high-SES males spend just as much, if not more, time on homework as females. This result is consistent with the ATUS analyses and with the finding that there is an SES component to the reversal of the gender gap in educational achievement (Buchmann & DiPrete, 2006) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "The current study uses time diary data from the American Time Use Survey ( conditioning on spending at least some time on homework. While the gender gap in non-school study time is slightly larger in low-income and single-parent households, we find no evidence that the gender gap is driven by students' participation in extracurricular activities, employment outside the home, or the care of household children. Interestingly, however, the gap is largest among high-ability and high-performing students, as measured by performance on standardized math exams and GPA, respectively.\nRegarding other predictors of non-school study time, we find that high-SES students spend relatively more time on homework and that the SES gradient in homework time is steeper among males. Males spend nearly 15 fewer minutes on homework on days that they either participate in an organized extracurricular activity or work for pay outside of the household.\nSimilarly, females who worked on the diary day performed about 20 fewer minutes of homework. Interestingly, participating in childcare on the diary day had no effect on non-school study time, perhaps because this was largely passive childcare during which the respondent also completed homework.\nThese results are consistent with the hypotheses that the SES gap and the reversal of the gender gap in college completion are at least partly attributable to corresponding SES and gender gaps in non-cognitive skills that originate in childhood and persist into young adulthood (Jacob, 2002; Lundberg, 2013) . More generally, these results contribute to the literature on gender gaps in non-cognitive skills. Indeed, time spent on homework is unique in that it both indicates possession of non-cognitive skills and contributes to the development of non-cognitive skills.\nThese reasons underscore the importance of identifying the causal factors that lead to the gender and SES gaps in homework identified in the current study, as well as the causal relationships between such gaps and long-run socioeconomic outcomes. While this descriptive analysis identifies the presence of SES and gender homework gaps, it is unable to identify the specific causes of such gaps. Qualitative research that investigates why females, particularly high-ability females, high-GPA females, and the daughters of college-educated parents spend significantly more time on homework than their observationally-similar male counterparts would likely prove fruitful.
