[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Conservation science in practice is often constrained by resource availability, which has implications for data analysis and interpretation as well as management. Underpinning most conservation efforts, from local volunteer programs to large-scale population viability analyses, is an ongoing need to characterize population abundance and diversity based on population census counts . Scarcity of resources often necessitates making difficult decisions about how often and when to collect data. Although amassing as much data as possible is of course generally recommended, many factors, (including some biotic and abiotic factors such as weather conditions that are unrelated to resources) often conspire to prevent frequent and regular sampling of population abundance or diversity. A lack of resources often translates into data that are collected in a haphazard manner, with gaps in data collection during critical times in the life history of species being studied. Resulting poor quality data sets can lead to misleading population estimates and risk assessment ). Bird counts provide an excellent means of illustrating the tradeoffs and nuances involved in the frequency and timing of data collection. Many bird population estimates rely on the efforts of local non-governmental agencies or citizen-science groups, or other volunteer organizations . Coordinated long-term datasets, such as those generated by Christmas Bird Counts  or the North American Breeding Bird Survey  strive to maintain consistency in both the timing and regularity of sampling. In contrast, other less coordinated efforts, especially those done at a small local scale, are often conducted inconsistently with little regularity due to meager personnel resources. In the tropics, these activities often fall to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and non-profits 2 with uncertain or ephemeral funding sources, which can result in inconsistent sampling frequencies and timing. We describe here a case study stemming from bird count data collected by staff and citizenscience volunteers from A Rocha Kenya at the Mwamba Field Studies Centre, a non-profit conservation group in Watamu, Kenya. In particular, we use this case study to develop a methodology for determining the optimal sampling scheme to accurately estimate populations of a threatened bird population given limited monitoring resources. Motivated by nearly 15 years of population census counts of the East Coast Akalat, an Old World flycatcher in coastal Kenya, we employ a combined mathematical and statistical modeling approach to determine the optimal frequency and seasonal timing of mist-net capture sessions. Mist netting is a common means of sampling bird populations, and while some studies have suggested it is not an optimal technique for comparing species abundance across habitats , it has been shown to be more accurate than point counts in estimating population abundance when employed in breeding habitats . We explore the accuracy of several different sampling strategies and discuss implications for conservation in practice."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study organism/site", "text": "The East Coast Akalat (Sheppardia gunningi sokokensis Haagner) is a small forest robin that is restricted to small coastal forests in East Africa . Distributed among remnant forest patches, S. gunningi is vulnerable to continuing habitat threats such as logging and development and has been classified as near threatened (declining population trend) by the World Conservation Union (IUCN 2014). Formerly abundant along the east African coast from Kenya to Malawi and Mozambique, S. gunningi is now found primarily in the coastal forests of Kenya, with the largest remnant population (approx. 7500 pairs) residing year-round in Arabuko-Sokoke Forest (ASF), a 429km 2 forest reserve that is the largest remnant patch of indigenous coastal forest in East Africa Birdlife International 2008;). Because S. gunningi co-occurs with several other highly endangered and rare species, including several other bird species as well as the Sokoke Bushy-tailed Mongoose, Aders' Duiker, and Golden-rumped Elephant Shrew, it has become an indicator species for habitat conservation efforts in the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest reserve."}, {"section_title": "Data collection S. gunningi individuals were collected in mist nets by staff from the Mwamba Field Studies", "text": "Centre/A Rocha Kenya in an area in the north-eastern corner of Arabuko-Sokoke Forest known as the Gede Nature Trail from 1999-2012. Standard mist netting protocols were followed: for each session, total net lengths measured 180m and samples consisted of captures from two consecutive dawn capture periods. After removal from the net, plumage characteristics, molt pattern, and age and sex were recorded for each akalat, and bands were placed on birds that were not recaptures. Akalats were categorized, where possible, into one of three age classes: immature, subadult, or full adult. In cases where a clear designation was not possible, birds were categorized initially as \"unknown age\". Birds were captured in 24 sessions over 14 years, at non-uniform time intervals with consistent ringing effort. The number of sampling sessions per year ranged from zero to eight, with a mean of approximately two. Data consisting of the number of akalats in each age class for each mist-netting session (see Appendix I) were then incorporated into a predictive population model. In five of the ringing sessions, some captured birds were difficult to age because they were at a transitional stagethese birds were added to the \"full adult\" category based on the time of year when they were captured and the likelihood that they were subadults transitioning to full adults."}, {"section_title": "Mathematical Model", "text": "We incorporated life history data into a Leslie matrix mathematical model  to generate S. gunningi population projections for the 13 year sampling period.

Let in which the four parameters are as above, and are assumed to be in an admissible constraint set that reflects all reasonable values of fecundity and survivorship for S. gunningi. We accomplished this by performing a least squares optimization using the data collected by A Rocha Kenya. We estimated the S. gunningi fecundity rate by noting that an average clutch size for similar birds is roughly 3-5 eggs and halving this to reflect the fact that only females breed; thus we initially let F 3 = 2 and only estimated ( 12 , GG, 3 P ) . Because they are probabilities, survivorship parameters ( 12 , GG, 3 P ) were constrained to lie between 0 and 1. With a broad spectrum of initial guesses within the admissible range of parameter values, we then solved the inverse problem using least squares optimization in order to generate optimal parameter values (see Banks et al. 2013 for more details). The general form of this solution minimizes the discrepancy between the data and the model output of all possible vectors containing the life history parameters q. This may be described for n observations by the following expression: where denotes the data, and denotes the model (as a function of time and the life history 100 parameters in the vector ). We note that this formulation is based on an assumed statistical 101 model , where is an assumed true parameter and the errors for 102 are independent identically distributed random variables (see Banks and Tran 2009 103 for details)."}, {"section_title": "104", "text": "Because juvenile birds are less likely to be captured in mist nets than adults, we modified our 105 model assumptions. In particular, we modified the least squares formulation to reflect the fact 106 that one age class of data (full adults) was expected to be subject to less observation error than 107 the other two classes, giving more weight to the full adult data points than to the immature or 108 subadult points when searching for optimal parameters."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "The functional that we minimize in this case is thus modified by weighting as follows: where we weighted each age class in increasing order from youngest to oldest. This corresponds to a statistical model where , ), with and corresponding to immatures, subadults, and full adults, respectively. The weighted least squares method can be particularly advantageous over the ordinary least squares method when one class of data is known to have greater error than others . Therefore, the appropriate method to use is highly dependent on the data at hand. With both ordinary and weighted least squares estimates, one can calculate the standard variance and underlying distribution of each parameter by employing bootstrapping (see Banks et al. 2013 for examples). In studying the S. gunningi data, we found there appeared to be relatively high error in the data collection process. More importantly, the irregularity with which the data was collected was striking. Motivated by these observations, we turned to the more important fundamental question: Given limited resources that that may be inherent, how should one best collect data in order to validate a given class of models. For these investigations we choose the Leslie matrix models that we had been using in our Akalat studies."}, {"section_title": "Simulation-Based Experimental Design", "text": "We thus turned to the question of how the population is projected to grow or decrease over time. From this simulated data set, we then compared life history parameter estimates generated from four different sampling schemes. For the effort we report on here, we used ordinary least squares estimation (although similar results were found using weighted least squares.) Rather than present an exhaustive list of all possible sampling schemes, we describe the results stemming from several illustrative and contrasting combinations of sampling schemes. The schemes we report on are (1) sampling each month for the entire five years, (2) sampling four months each year during January, April, July and October, which includes one sample during the breeding season, (3) sampling four months each year during January, February, March and December, which includes two samples during the breeding season, and (4) sampling four months each year during May, July, September and November that excludes sampling during the breeding season. In order to quantify which sampling scheme gives us the most accurate fit to the actual population size (which is known, as it was simulated using the fixed life history parameter values), we again solved the inverse problem based on simulated data for each sampling scheme. We compared the schemes (2), (3), and (4) to the actual simulated data by examining how closely the solution to the inverse problem recovered the original life history parameters (see Banks et al. for more details)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The solution to the inverse problem with no error in the statistical model generated, as expected, an initial vector of life history values of . Population projections for the baseline monthly sampling scheme across five years generated cyclical peaks accurately reflecting the akalat breeding season (Figure 1). However, the other sampling schemes had varying success (Table 1) in capturing these akalat population dynamics broken down by life stage. Samples during four months per year that included one breeding sample ( Figure 2) resulted in a close match to the original population trajectories stemming from five years' simulated data. The scheme that included two breeding season samples was slightly less accurate ( Figure 3), with less distinct peaks and troughs, especially for immature and full adult akalats (Figure 3a, c). The scheme that excluded any breeding season samples fared much worse, especially for immature and sub-adult dynamics (Figure 4). Overall, four monthly samples per year including one breeding season in the sample resulted in the best parameter recapture and lowest cost functional of the three options when compared with the baseline simulated data (Table 1). These results were consistent with those obtained when we carried out the same estimation procedures with different levels of noise in the statistical models."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The importance of accurate population estimates in conservation science cannot be overstated. Failure to detect dynamics accurately can lead to overoptimistic assessments of how populations are faring, which can have disastrous consequences for management . In many tropical conservation settings, population census efforts are severely restricted due to underfunding or insufficient personnel and resources. These challenges are exacerbated by the fact that population counts are often done by ephemeral initiatives and oft-changing staff at nonprofit NGOsso that both sampling frequency and timing are inconsistent. In the current exercise we used population counts for a near threatened bird endemic to East Africa to highlight features of sampling schemes critically important for accurately assessing population dynamics given constrained resources. Our results highlight the need to establish regular, consistent sampling schemes to establish accurate bird population countswith special attention given to including at least one sample during the breeding season. This may present special challenges for planning population counts of tropical birds such as S. gunningi, as the breeding season in tropical birds is notoriously narrower and less predictable than temperate birds (Stauffer et al. 2013). Other recent ornithological studies have shown that multiple sampling periods within the year generally produce more accurate results, especially with respect to reproductive output (e.g., . Several complicating factors are worth noting in interpreting the results of this simple modeling exercise. First, aging birds is an imperfect process, with much uncertainty due to both observation and sampling error. In a few exceptional cases, clear correlates have been identified among traits such as wing color, age, and reproductive potential . In the current exercise we made some simple assumptions regarding the handful of birds that we captured that proved difficult to age. However, much more emphasis needs to be placed on developing accurate, dependable methods of precisely determining age. Second, better information on life history ecology, dispersal and/or recruitment rates, and other ecological attributes of rare or endangered species are needed to generate more accurate predictions of population growth/dynamics in the long term Hern\u00e1ndez-Mat\u00edas et al. 2013). For birds such as S. gunningi, this will require much more intensive study and focusa challenge for activities in important sites such as the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest and other underfunded conservation efforts. Finally, some aspects of the matrix mathematical model formulation presented here may heavily influence outcomes and interpretation. In the present model, we used constant estimates for the vital rates to generate population projections, which ignores potentially complex shifting conditions likely to be influential drivers of survivorship and fecundity through time . A different approach worth considering would be to use a model incorporating time-varying vital rates (e.g., ). Furthermore,  cautions that ignoring the initial population structure may result in unreliable short-term or transient population dynamics assessments in demographic analyses using matrix models. Although we focus here on long-term asymptotic outcomes, it is worth noting the importance of accurate parameter estimation in seeding such models. Overall, however, our results should prove to be generalizable to diverse taxa in both tropical and temperate ecosystems.
