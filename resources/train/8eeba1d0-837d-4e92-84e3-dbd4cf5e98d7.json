[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Auditory \"oddball\" event-related potentials (aoERPs), resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) connectivity, and electroencephalographic (rsEEG) rhythms were tested as longitudinal functional biomarkers of prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Diagnostic biomarkers were defined as those measuring in vivo intrinsic pathophysiological variables characterizing neurobiologically AD, namely amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. They are expected to be present at all stages of the disease, are observable even in the preclinical asymptomatic state, are not necessarily correlated with disease severity, and are indicated for inclusion of AD patients in clinical trial protocols. Diagnostic biomarkers include low doses of A\u03b21-42 and high doses of total tau (T-tau) or phospho tau (P-tau) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or evidence of significant amyloid deposition and tau aggregation in the brain in maps of positron emission tomography (PET) [2] .\nIn contrast, topographic or progression biomarkers may not be specific of AD neuropathology or absent in early disease stages, but they can be very useful to monitor the progression of the disease in the brain and may be related to the kind and severity of cognitive deficits [1] . Progression markers include hippocampal atrophy or cortical thickness, assessed by structural MRI, and cortical hypometabolism in posterior cingulate, parietal, temporal, and hippocampal regions, measured by FDG-PET [1] . Of note, these topographic biomarkers are limited in the sense that they do not directly measure brain amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangles in AD patients, so they cannot be used as primary neuropathological endpoints in the evaluation of AD-modifying agents.\nPromising candidates as topographic markers of AD are those reflecting functional aspects of brain neurotransmission, neural synchronization, and connectivity, as human cognition is the result of collective and coordinated processes within brain networks such as segregation and integration of cellular signaling [3] [4] [5] . In this line, functional MRIs accompanying a resting state condition in quiet wakefulness (rsfMRI) can be used for the computation of temporal correlations of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals between voxels belonging to brain regions as a biomarker of intrinsic (not related to events) functional connectivity between those regions [6, 7] .\nAmong various cerebral neural networks emerging from such rsfMRI analysis, the default mode network (DMN) is of interest for clinical applications to AD research, being non-invasive and repeatable over time even in patients with several cognitive deficits. Previous rsfMRI studies have shown that this network includes nodes in posterior and anterior cingulate areas, angular gyri, occipital, and parietotemporal regions [8] . In the resting state condition, the intrinsic DMN functional connectivity may be associated with specific self-related and internal processes that can be parcellated into several sub-classes including self-awareness or \"mental self\" [9, 10] (defined as the conscious ability of reflecting/monitoring about one's sense of self regarding one's abilities, traits, and attitudes that guides behaviors, choices, and social interactions), self-reflective thought [11, 12] , stimulus-independent thoughts [13] , mind-wandering [14] , introspection [15] , integration of cognitive processes [16] , and considering the thoughts and perspectives of others [17] [18] [19] .\nOther candidate topographic biomarkers of AD derive from electroencephalographic (EEG) techniques, which are noninvasive, cost-effective, and can be repeated several times along disease progression without learning effects affecting paradigms using tasks. When compared to fMRI and FDG-PET, EEG techniques recording scalp potentials have a modest spatial resolution of some centimeters but a very high temporal resolution (milliseconds); that temporal resolution is ideal to investigate cortical EEG rhythms at different frequency bands within about 1-40 Hz during a resting state condition (i.e., resting state EEG, rsEEG) and quick brain dynamics reflected by positive and negative voltage peaks within tens to hundreds of milliseconds in response to cognitive-motor events challenging attention, short episodic memory, and sensorimotor integration (i.e., eventrelated potentials, ERPs). A popular ERP paradigm used to investigate temporal dynamics of neural synchronization underpinning cognitive processes is the auditory oddball task [20] . In such a paradigm, subjects are administrated a sequence of sensory stimuli of two classes, namely those with high (e.g., 80%) and low (e.g., 20%) probability to occur, with the instruction to pay attention and react (e.g., hand motor responses or mental stimulus) only to the rare ones considered as \"targets\" [21] . The extraction of variables of interest from rsEEG and ERPs requires different procedures of data analysis and source estimation, mainly based on frequency (rsEEG) and time (ERP) domains [22] . Derived rsEEG/ERP biomarkers may reflect synchronization and connectivity between large populations of cortical pyramidal neurons during resting state or cognitive tasks [22] .\nPrevious studies have shown that compared to control seniors, patients with aMCI and dementia due to AD were characterized by increased rsEEG power density at delta (< 4 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) frequency bands in widespread cortical regions as well as decreased rsEEG power density at alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (14-30 Hz) frequency bands in central and posterior cortical regions [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Concerning the oddball paradigm, these patients were characterized by ERP peak latency increase, amplitude decrease, and abnormal topography in a late ample positive component (i.e., P3b). Specifically, P3b peaks at about 300-400 ms from the onset of rare (20-30% of probability) auditory or visual stimuli [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . As topographic biomarkers of progression, these rsEEG/ERP readouts pointed to increased abnormalities in delta/alpha rhythms and P3b peak in aMCI and AD patients with dementia at about 1-year follow up [27, 28, 34, 36] . These effects were typically discussed in relationship to death of cortical neurons, axonal pathology, and cholinergic neurotransmission deficits [29, [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] .\nLinear Mixed Models (R-package lme4) were used as statistical tests as they allow the use of individual longitudinal data sets even when some recording sessions are missing in the series (e.g., for technical failures or patients' problems). The mentioned findings motivate the evaluation of rsfMRI and rsEEG/P3b as topographic biomarkers sensitive to prodromal (MCI) and dementia stages of AD. This process needs to overcome the following methodological limitations of typical multi-centric longitudinal studies: 1) retrospective nature, 2) the use of few recording sessions over time (mostly a baseline and a 1-year follow up) subjected to the confounding effect of disease onset and trajectories in aMCI patients, 3) the lack of a careful characterization of aMCI due to AD as cognitive profile (only one test of episodic memory) and positivity to standard diagnostic biomarkers of AD, and 4) the absence of a control group of aMCI patients not due to AD with expected different disease evolution over time. The European, prospective, multi-centric study entitled \"PharmaCog -E-ADNI\" (http://www.pharmacog.org) addressed such limitations. In the PharmaCog study, 147 aMCI patients were screened as APOE genotyping and AD diagnostic markers of CSF and followed longitudinally with clinical, neuropsychological, MRI, rsEEG/ERP, and blood markers for 24 months. The aMCI patients were separated into two sub-groups, namely those \"positive\" (i.e., prodromal AD) and \"negative\" to CSF diagnostic markers of AD (i.e., statistical thresholds for A\u03b242/P-tau ratio based on APOE \u03b54 carrier status [49] ). Preparatory PharmaCog studies described the successful multisite MRI harmonization efforts [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] and the characterization of the \"positive\" and \"negative\" aMCI subjects as neuropsychological, MRI (i.e., hippocampal atrophy, morphometry, and diffusion), and rsEEG/ERP at the baseline stage [23, 52, 53] .\nThis article is part of a Mini Forum on PharmaCog matrix of biomarkers of prodromal AD in patients with aMCI, which is based on four papers published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. The specific aim of this article is to evaluate longitudinal functional topographical biomarkers derived from rsfMRI and rsEEG/ERP data in a population of aMCI enrolled in the PharmaCog project and test if these markers can differentiate the group of the \"positive\" aMCI patients with prodromal AD from the \"negative\" aMCI subgroup during a time window of 24 months with 5 serial recordings 6 months apart. A linear mixed model adjusted by nuisance covariates was used to investigate those functional biomarkers in terms of Group (\"positive\" versus \"negative\" differences regardless of time), Time (temporal effects regardless of Group effects), and Time x Group fixed effects (differential progression between the two subgroups). In the experimental design, the observation time (i.e., 24 months) was expected to account for possible different disease stages in the \"positive\" and \"negative\" aMCI patients, while the \"negative\" aMCI patients were used as a control subgroup. This allowed dissociating, at least in part, cognitive impairment and functional biomarker differences between prodromal and non-prodromal AD in the aMCI subgroups.

From a general neurophysiological point of view, this finding suggests that the prodromal AD group can be differentiated from the non-prodromal aMCI group by intrinsic functional connectivity and cortical neural synchronization differences (i.e., at rest), as well as by synchronization differences during the oddball task.\nConcerning rsfMRI topographic biomarkers, functional connectivity within the DMN, especially within the PCC, was significantly lower in the \"positive\" (i.e., prodromal AD) than in the \"negative\" aMCI subgroup regardless of Time effects, while no group difference was observed in the attention LFP network. This finding complements and extends to the prodromal AD condition a large body of previous rsfMRI evidence of cross-sectional studies pointing to a selective disruption of functional connectivity in DMN regions as possible early functional consequences of amyloidneurodegenerative cascade on cortical systems underpinning resting state condition and low vigilance in AD patients relative to cognitively intact controls ( [23, [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] ; for review, see [74] ). As a novelty, the present finding showed a selective disruption of functional connectivity within DMN regions (no difference at an attention frontoparietal network) using a longitudinal study design with several serial recording sessions and a relatively large sample of aMCI patients suffering from prodromal AD (n = 81) compared with control aMCI patients not due to AD. Such a control group made the present finding on prodromal AD independent of patients' cognitive grade (i.e., all patients suffered from an aMCI condition), while the longitudinal design with variable intercepts as random effects minimized the confound of patients' disease stage in the comparison of the two aMCI subgroups. The present finding has also the robustness of international multicentric studies using harmonized and qualified MRI scanners [49] .\nOn the whole, the design of the present study overcomes the methodological limitations of typical cross-sectional studies comparing biomarkers in cognitively intact subjects and AD patients.\nFurthermore, it overcomes the methodological limitations of longitudinal studies just based on one follow up (typically after 1 year). On the other hand, some of the methodological limitations of this study have been previously discussed [49] . In particular, the harmonization of the rsfMRI acquisitions across the 3T Consortium resulted in a common acquisition rate of TR = 2.7 s for full brain coverage. Full brain sub-second acquisition protocols [54] are possible with simultaneous multi-slice selection techniques, which are becoming more widely available as product sequences in clinical scanners and maybe preferable in future studies. The use of higher temporal resolution protocols may improve not only the sensitivity and specificity of rsfMRI connectivity estimates but also enable the exploration of advanced markers of cortical network dynamics [76] [77] [78] .\nThe rsfMRI and rsEEG recordings of this study were not recorded simultaneously.\nHowever, the results from both modalities refer to a very similar patients' psychophysiological condition as induced by instructions to the patients about the \"resting state condition\", based on a shared standard operating procedure among the PharmaCog recording units. Indeed, lower/increased level of vigilance, directed attention, and global mental efforts during the resting state condition are clearly related to the brain activity reflected by the present rsfMRI and EEG variables [63, 79] .\nConcerning rsEEG topographic biomarkers, the present Linear Mixed Models showed a fixed effect of Group (\"positive\" and \"negative\" aMCI) on several variables of interest. Compared with the \"negative\" aMCI subgroup, the \"positive\" (i.e., prodromal AD) aMCI subgroup exhibited lower posterior (parietal, occipital, temporal and limbic) source activity of the low-frequency alpha band (8-10.5 Hz) while widespread delta (< 4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) source activity was higher.\nThese results specify in source space and prodromal AD condition a bulk of previous rsEEG evidence showing that AD patients with dementia are characterized by high power in widespread delta and theta rhythms, as well as low power in posterior alpha and/or beta (13-20 Hz) rhythms [25, 31, 32, 45, [80] [81] [82] . In temporal areas, delta power is also abnormally high in AD patients with dementia in relation to regional hypometabolism and memory deficits [83] . Furthermore, a shortterm cholinergic regimen with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors partially normalizes theta [84] , alpha [85] , and delta [86] rhythms. In the same line, long-term administration of the drug regimen shows beneficial effects on theta and alpha/theta band ratio, especially over the frontal areas [87, 88] .\nConcerning ERP topographic biomarkers, the Linear Mixed Models showed a fixed effect of Group (\"positive\" and \"negative\" aMCI) on P3b peak of an auditory \"oddball\" paradigm.\nCompared with the \"negative\" aMCI subgroup, the \"positive\" (i.e., prodromal AD) aMCI subgroup pointed to lower parietal and posterior cingulate source activities. These findings extend to spatial source localization previous evidence showing that P3b peak amplitude at scalp posterior electrodes was smaller in AD patients than control seniors, as a possible dynamic neural underpinning of abnormal attention and short-term episodic memory information processes. However, these findings did not replicate in the two aMCI subgroups previous slowing of P3b peak latency in aMCI and AD patients with dementia compared with elderly control subjects, even across various \"oddball\" task difficulties and stimulus modalities [37, [89] [90] [91] . Those effects were previously discussed as related to AD pathology for visual and olfactory modalities [20, 92] . In contrast, the present findings would suggest that P3b peak latency may preferably reflect physiological aging [93] and general deterioration of cognitive performance across pathological aging rather than specific processes of prodromal AD."}, {"section_title": "Functional biomarkers Time x Group effects: differential progression profiles", "text": "Here the Linear Mixed Models showed a significant interaction between Time (5 recording sessions 6 months apart) and Group (\"positive\" and \"negative\" aMCI) on both rsfMRI and rsEEG biomarkers. This interaction suggests that in an aMCI group, differential progression profiles between prodromal and non-prodromal AD may be captured by intrinsic functional connectivity (e.g., rsfMRI biomarkers) and cortical neural synchronization (e.g., rsEEG biomarkers).\nConcerning rsfMRI biomarkers, we found that the sensitivity to disease progression in aMCI patients varies across cortical networks. Specifically, we found that functional connectivity in the whole DMN, PCC, and LFP were sensitive to short-term longitudinal decay both in the \"positive\"\nprodromal AD and the \"negative\" (control) aMCI patients. But these networks showed no significant differences in the progression of the connectivity profiles. Instead, functional connectivity in LPC exhibited significant differential effects, with increased functional connectivity over time faster in the \"positive\" (i.e., prodromal AD) relative to the \"negative\" aMCI subgroup.\nAgain, this finding stressed the selective feature of this disruption of functional connectivity within DMN regions as compared to the lack of effects in the attention frontoparietal network.\nOur longitudinal rsfMRI findings are in good agreement with previous evidence showing both cortical network impairment (connectivity reduction) and compensation (connectivity increase) effects in the DMN in aMCI subjects relative to control seniors, despite gray matter atrophy [54, [94] [95] [96] . Here we extend those results by confirming similar effects in prodromal AD relative to control aMCI subgroup. Further, the present findings showed a maximum sensitivity of rsfMRI LPC functional connectivity at 2-year follow up, generally consistent with previous longitudinal rsfMRI studies considering baseline and 2-3 year follow-up evaluations in groups of patients with AD dementia and aMCI [54] [55] [56] 96] , the latter sometimes diagnosed only on clinical basis. Interestingly, the present lateralization in the left LPC of the effects of longitudinal disease progression in prodromal AD extends recent findings of a longitudinal rsfMRI study with two measurements 2 years apart in a small population of aMCI patients [95] . Such previous study exhibited sensitivity of functional connectivity between left precuneus and other DMN nodes in accounting for the greater progression of aMCI patients in the group of converters to dementia (n=14) than that of non-converters (n=17) [95] .

It can be speculated that this functional disconnection might induce an abnormal elaboration of information about self-body milieu and autobiographical memory, thus affecting the sense of self-awareness and continuity of self across time [6, 77] (for theories and controversies about the neural basis of consciousness see [101] ). This speculation is based on the well-known concept that midline cortical nodes of DMN such as PCC and MPF contribute to the integration of the general functions related to the sense of self-awareness [102, 103] . In this line of reasoning, PCC might represent information concerning individual's own self-beliefs and firstperson perspective in adults [104] . Furthermore, structural maturation of the neural connectivity between PCC and MPF in the adolescence accompanies the development of self-related and socialcognitive functions [105] . Moreover, previous evidence has shown that posterior parietal regions of DMN might contribute to the formation of self-related cognitive representation as a convergence zone binding cortical neural populations involved in the memorization of intermodal details of episodic events concerning the self [106] . Patients with lesions in those parietal regions manifest difficulties in re-experiencing a past autobiographic event when request by experimenters [107] .\nThis speculation encourages the inclusion of cognitive tests probing the richness of the autobiographic memories and self-awareness in prodromal AD patients over time and the analysis with Linear Mixed Models of the correlation between rsfMRI topographic biomarkers of DMN and the performance to those tests.\nThe rsEEG findings of the present study enlightened neurophysiological mechanisms characterizing prodromal AD patients compared to control aMCI patients. Based on those findings and prior knowledge on the role of thalamocortical loops in the generation of rsEEG rhythms in humans, it can be speculated that in quiet wakefulness, the abnormal delta and theta source activity in prodromal AD is due to an abnormal interaction between thalamic and cortical pyramidal neural populations, associated with a loss of functional connectivity and a sort of functional isolation of parietal, temporal, and occipital cortical modules [108] [109] [110] . It can be also speculated that the alteration of this neurophysiological mechanism is responsible for the reduced parietal and posterior cingulate source activity of auditory \"oddball\" P3b peak in prodromal AD patients enrolled in the present study. Indeed, P3b peak is mostly an expression of cognitive event-related oscillatory response of thalamocortical circuits oscillating at delta and theta frequencies. In this line, previous studies have shown that delta event-related impulse oscillations in response to visual and auditory \"oddball\" stimuli were attenuated in amplitude in AD patients with dementia compared with control seniors (see for a review [111] ). In AD patients with dementia, an abnormal thalamocortical interaction might be due to a cortical blood hypoperfusion and synaptic dysfunction [83, [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] .\nAnother cause of such an abnormal thalamocortical interaction might be an impairment of the cortical gray matter especially in the posterior regions [29, 39, [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] , as well as a lesion in the brain white matter connecting cerebral cortex [2, 23] .\nAnother interesting finding of the present study is the characterization of prodromal AD patients by widespread cortical alpha sources estimated in the resting state condition in the wakefulness. A tentative neurophysiological explanation of that finding can be based on the insightful research in cats and mice performed by the group of Dr. Crunelli at the Cardiff University. Based on their research, it can be speculated that the reduction of cortical alpha sources in prodromal AD patients over aMCI control patients might denote a progressive alteration in the interplay of thalamocortical high-threshold, GABAergic (interneurons), thalamocortical relay-mode, and cortical pyramidal neurons that constitute the complex network regulating the cortical arousal and vigilance in quiet wakefulness in mammalians [107] [108] [109] . In physiological conditions, Dr. Crunelli's group demonstrated that in wakefulness, glutamatergic and cholinergic signaling to those neurons enhances the generation of thalamocortical and cortical alpha rhythms and produces cycles of excitation and inhibition in thalamic and cortical neurons that might frame perceptual events in discrete snapshots of approximately 70-100 ms during vigilance [107] [108] [109] .\nWhat is the added value of the present rsfMRI and EEG readouts with reference to the new diagnostic guidelines for research published by the International Working Group-2 [1] and NIA-AA Working Group [66] ? Summarizing, those guidelines stated that AD can be recognized in vivo by both abnormal \"A\" biomarkers of A\u03b2 and \"T\" biomarkers of phospho tau in the brain, derived from PET or CSF techniques. Furthermore, the new NIA-AA Working Group [66] proposed that early \"AD neuropathologic changes\" can be revealed in vivo by abnormal \"A\" biomarkers of A\u03b2 and normal \"T\" biomarkers. Finally, both International Working Group-2 [1] and NIA-AA Working\nGroup [66] encouraged the characterization of AD subject's brain integrity by \"N\" biomarkers of neurodegeneration derived from CSF (e.g., T-tau), FDG-PET (e.g., hypometabolism), and structural MRI (e.g., atrophy) techniques. In the PharmaCog project, we followed those guidelines for the diagnosis of the prodromal AD in aMCI patients. As a novelty, here we propose that the present rsfMRI and rsEEG readouts changing over time (e.g., 24 months) in prodromal AD patients may be used to characterize and monitor the effect of the disease on their brain functions, thus enriching the picture disclosed by the guideline biomarkers. Specifically, these readouts may complement \"N\" "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In the PharmaCog project, auditory \"oddball\" ERPs, rsEEG, and rsfMRI functional biomarkers were tested in aMCI patients to characterize prodromal AD.
