Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified at least 24 loci containing common variants associated with AD risk [37, 39, 48, 56] . AD is a complex disease that is highly heritable, with an estimated heritability as high as 79% in twin studies [31] and genetic variance analyses estimate >53% of the variance in AD status can be explained by common variants (minor allele frequency, MAF > 1%) [64] . Polygenic studies have illustrated the genetic complexity underlying AD; recent studies using polygenic risk scores (PRS) calculated by combining the small effects of independent SNPs associated with AD risk (P < 0.5) provided AD risk prediction accuracy, as measured by area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) > 0.74, which is near the maximum 1 3 AUC (0.82) [22, 23] . These studies indicate many genetic loci combine to increase risk for AD, most of the genetic risk loci are tagged by common variants (MAF > 1%), and that these loci, individually, have small effects on disease. These findings reveal that most AD risk variants have not passed the strict significance threshold required for multiple-test correction in GWAS, even in large studies such as the landmark study by the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP), involving more than 74,000 total individuals, which identified 11 novel loci associated with AD risk [48] . It is also important to note that most AD susceptibility loci identified in these GWAS are gene-dense regions and many significantly associated SNPs are noncoding (intronic or intergenic), making it difficult to determine which genes are involved or how identified variants influence these genes. Studies integrating alternative phenotypes, gene expression, and other omics data are important for understanding the underlying biology of AD.\nThere is significant evidence that AD pathology is present several years before the onset of clinical symptoms [25, 26, 41, 55] . Consequently, AD case-control GWAS can be confounded by the presence of preclinical \"controls\". Casecontrol-based GWAS are also limited to identifying genetic associations for disease risk; results from these studies do not provide information about other aspects of disease such as age at onset (AAO) or disease progression, or information about underlying biological mechanisms involved in pathogenesis. Endophenotypes are quantitative traits strongly associated with disease that also share genetic architecture with disease; therefore, genetic studies of endophenotypes are a powerful approach to identify loci associated with complex traits without many of the limitations of case-control studies. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta1-42 (A\u03b2 42 ) and phosphorylated tau (ptau 181 ) are well-established AD endophenotypes [7, [13] [14] [15] . CSF ptau 181 levels are elevated in AD cases and positively correlate with the number of neurofibrillary tangles, while CSF A\u03b2 42 levels are lower in cases and correlate negatively with plaque load [43, 59, 72] . Increased CSF ptau 181 is predictive for cognitive decline and progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD [2, 16] . Some genetic variants associated with AD also influence CSF levels of ptau 181 , A\u03b2 42 , or both [13, 44] . We previously performed GWAS of CSF tau, ptau 181 , and A\u03b2 42 on 1269 participants (591 cases, 687 controls) and identified four genome-wide significant loci associated with tau and ptau 181 , including a novel locus that also associated with AD risk, tangle pathology, and cognitive decline [13] . This study has been expanded more than twofold to 3146 participants across nine cohorts with CSF and genome-wide genotype data (Table 1) , providing additional power to identify more novel loci associated with ptau 181 , A\u03b2 42 , and AD."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ethics statement", "text": "The Institutional Review Boards of all participating institutions approved the study and research was carried out in accordance with the approved protocols.

To maximize the power in our analyses, we performed a one-stage joint-GWAS. The CSF levels were measured with different platforms and at different sites, consequently the raw values could not be combined. Instead, the raw values were log 10 -transformed to approximate a normal distribution within each separate study and centralized by each study mean. We have used this approach in previous studies and demonstrated that it is an effective way to correct for study differences [13, 19] . We also performed analyses to ensure the results were not confounded by any study bias; to determine if the top hits were being driven by any individual study, we analyzed each dataset separately and performed meta analyses. The directions of effect for the genome-wide significant signals for A\u03b2 42 and ptau 181 were consistent across studies when analyzed separately and results from meta-analyses of the individual studies were consistent with the joint results even after removing cohort from previous study ( Supplementary Figs. 1-3 )."}, {"section_title": "Alternative mixed model method to normalize A\u03b2 42", "text": "Since CSF levels of A\u03b2 42 are lower in AD cases than controls, begin decreasing prior to clinical symptom onset [25, 26, 43, 59, 72] , and the studies in this dataset varied in proportion of cases to controls, we wondered if a mixture modeling approach would be more appropriate for standardizing the data between studies instead of centering on the mean of each study. This method was successfully used previously to classify AD cases in two independent cohorts with at least 94% sensitivity [17] . Mixture modeling is a statistical method for estimating subpopulations within an overall group; in this case we assumed two normally distributed subgroups within each dataset representing individuals with low A\u03b2 42 , therefore likely to be AD cases or preclinical, and with high A\u03b2 42 , likely to be cognitively normal controls. Using an expectation-maximization algorithm, we calculated estimated means, standard deviations, and subgroup proportions for each study. Based on the assumption of two univariate normal distributions within each study we obtained two estimated means (\u03bc 1 and \u03bc 2 ), two estimated standard deviations (\u03c3 1 and \u03c3 2 ), and two estimated mixing proportions (\u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 ). We used these results to calculate the intersection of the estimated Gaussian curves using the following formula (Eq. 1):\nanalyte, including study, age, sex, and the first two principal components as covariates in the default model [11] . The genomic inflation factor was \u03bb = 1.02 for ptau 181 and \u03bb = 1.03 for tau and A\u03b2 42 ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ). There were no novel genetic associations identified for CSF tau levels ( Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 2) but we did identify novel associations for ptau 181 and A\u03b2 42 ( Figs. 1, 2 ; Table 2; Supplementary Tables 3, 4) . Conditional analyses were conducted to identify additional independent signals in a locus by adding the SNP with the smallest P value as a covariate into the default regression model and testing all remaining regional SNPs for association ( Supplementary Figs. 9, 10 ). AD status, CDR, APOE alleles, APOE \u03b54 carrier status, A\u03b2 42 , or ptau 181 levels were corrected for in additional analyses to determine the effects of these phenotypes on the genetic associations (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Tables 5-8 ). The combined dataset was stratified by AD status and cases and\nthen centered the log 10 -transformed A\u03b2 42 levels to the intersection of the curves instead of the means for each study (Supplementary Table 1 ). CSF A\u03b2 42 thresholds have been determined previously for both ADNI (192 pg/mL) [69] and ADRC (500 pg/mL) [25] ; the calculated intersects were comparable to these values (182 and 548 pg/mL, respectively, Supplementary Table 1 ). The density plots of the estimated subpopulations for each study fit the overall distributions reasonably well, but after accounting for AD status the model did not appear significantly different than standardizing to the overall mean ( Supplementary Figs. 4, 5 ). There was no difference between the two methods in a single variant analysis of the mixed model standardized CSF A\u03b2 42 levels and the levels centered at the study mean ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ).\nThe intersect was log 10 -transformed and subtracted from the log 10 Table 1) .

Results for the most significantly associated SNPs for CSF tau, ptau 181 , and A\u03b2 42 are reported here from the largest previously published two-stage meta-analysis of GWAS for AD risk consisting of a total 25,580 cases and 48,466 controls [48] , and a recently published genome-wide survival analysis of AAO consisting of 39,855 individuals (personal communication: Huang & Goate). To determine disease progression in an independent cohort of 1530 individuals, we utilized the CDR Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) which has been demonstrated to accurately stage dementia severity [57, 58] . Overall CDR is derived from scores in six individual categories (boxes) of memory, orientation, problem solving, community involvement, involvement in home and hobbies, and personal care; CDR-SB is a sum of the six boxes which provides a semi-continuous measure of symptomatic AD dementia from 0 (cognitively normal) to 18 (the most severe dementia). Disease progression from longitudinal studies at ADNI (n = 728) and Knight ADRC (n = 802) was modeled as the change in CDR-SB per year, adjusting for age, sex, baseline CDR, followup time, level of education, site, and PCs (Supplementary Table 9 ). Samples with \u22653 clinical assessments over 1.5 years after being diagnosed with AD were selected for the analysis and a mixed-model repeated measure framework was used to account for correlation between repeated measures in the same individual.

Based on the assumptions of Mendelian randomization, any gene-trait association identified in this analysis should be free of confounding from non-genetic factors. To distinguish causality of a single variant on both gene expression and the trait vs linkage of two distinct genetic variants in LD with one affecting expression and one affecting the trait, the SMR method uses a heterogeneity (HEIDI) test. For the SMR analysis, we utilized the estimates of SNP effects on gene expression from summary data of a large-scale eQTL study with gene expression measured in peripheral blood (Blood eQTL browser) [79] and gene expression data from Cardiogenics measured in macrophages [35] . There were 3000 SNPs present in both the blood eQTL data and the GWAS results so the statistical significance threshold was defined (based on Bonferroni correction) as P < 1.67 \u00d7 10 \u22125 for the associations between eQTL in blood and CSF GWAS loci.

We wanted to determine if the signal in the APOE locus was driven entirely by APOE genotype (APOE \u03b52, \u03b53, and \u03b54), or if there was an independent signal influencing CSF levels of ptau 181 and A\u03b2 42 , so we performed conditional analyses on APOE genotype accounting for both \u03b52 and \u03b54 effects. The APOE genotype showed the strongest association with CSF levels of ptau 181 (\u03b2 = 0.042, P = 3.13 \u00d7 10 \u221240 ) and A\u03b2 42 (\u03b2 = \u22120.053, P = 8.88 \u00d7 10 \u2212114 ) after correcting for age, sex, study, and two principal components. The association between the top hit in the APOE locus (rs769449) and ptau 181 or A\u03b2 42 , remained significant, but not genome-wide significant, after adding APOE genotype to the model (ptau 181 : \u03b2 = 0.034, P = 1.07 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ; A\u03b2 42 : \u03b2 = -0.036, P = 1.65 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ) suggesting that there may be a signal in this region independent of APOE \u03b52, \u03b53, and \u03b54 (Supplementary Table 12 ). To further explore this finding, we conditioned on the most significant SNP (rs769449), which is in high LD for the APOE \u03b54 allele (rs429358[C] , D\u2032 = 1, r 2 = 0.726). We found that although the associations between APOE genotype and ptau 181 and A\u03b2 42 decreased, they remained genome-wide significant (conditioned: \u03b2 = 0.029, P = 5.91 \u00d7 10 \u22129 and \u03b2 = \u22120.040, P = 2.28 \u00d7 10 \u221228 , respectively) (Supplementary Table 12 ). Together, these results suggest that most of the signal in this region is driven by APOE genotype, but additional independent SNPs in this region may influence CSF levels of both ptau 181 and A\u03b2 42 ."}, {"section_title": "Novel associations in single-variant regression analyses for A\u03b2 42 and ptau 181", "text": "The genomic inflation was minimal in all analyses suggesting no evidence of confounding by systematic biases (default model \u03bb = 1.03 for A\u03b2 42 and tau, 1.02 for ptau 181 ; Supplementary Fig. 7) .

These results suggest that all of the individuals in this study contributed to the associations with CSF A\u03b2 42 and ptau 181 levels, independent of status or amyloid pathology."}, {"section_title": "Effects of associated genetic loci on other AD phenotypes", "text": "Since the purpose of studying these AD endophenotypes was to identify genetic factors associated with AD, we tested the genome-wide significant loci for associations with AD risk [48] , rate of AD progression [58] , or AAO (personal communication: Huang & Goate) in independent cohorts. The loci associated with A\u03b2 42 were also associated with risk, AAO, and/or progression ( Table 3 ). The GLIS1 locus was associated with lower CSF A\u03b2 42 levels (rs185031519[G], \u03b2 = \u22120.059, P = 2.08 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ), increased AD risk (rs114122417[A], OR = 1.105, P = 0.034) [48] , and faster disease progression (rs185031519 [G] , \u03b2 = 0.277, P = 0.019) ( Table 3 ). The intronic SERPINB1 variant, rs316341 [G] , was associated with earlier AAO (\u03b2 = 0.043, P = 4.62 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ) as well as lower A\u03b2 42 (\u03b2 = \u22120.025, P = 1.72 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) (Table 3) . Although the loci associated with ptau 181 that we reported previously were associated with AD risk and AAO [13] , we did not find evidence that the novel loci were associated with risk, AAO, or progression (Table 3) . We were unable to test other AD phenotypes such as brain atrophy or neuropathology. However, both the MAPT locus on 17q21, which is associated with CSF tau levels in the presence of A\u03b2 deposition [45] , and the GMNC locus, which was associated with CSF levels of tau (\u03b2 = 0.040, P = 3.07 \u00d7 10 \u221211 ) and ptau 181 (\u03b2 = 0.035, P = 7.62 \u00d7 10 \u221210 ), as well as AD risk (OR = 1.044, P = 9.08 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ), tangle pathology (P = 0.039, reported previously) and cognitive decline (P = 4.86 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , reported previously) [13] , have recently been associated with total brain volume in a meta-analysis of 26,577 individuals of European descent [1] , suggesting variants associated with ptau 181 may also be associated with other brain-related or neurodegenerative phenotypes."}, {"section_title": "Bioinformatics annotation", "text": "None of the genotyped or imputed SNPs in the genomewide significant loci for A\u03b2 42 (Table 4 ).

One SERPINB1 variant, rs316339, which is in LD with rs316341 (D' = 1, r 2 = 0.993; CSF A\u03b2 42 \u03b2 = \u22120.025, P = 1.76 \u00d7 10\n), passed the SMR analysis (P = 2.95 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) and HEIDI test (P = 0.258). We performed the same test on macrophage expression data obtained from Cardiogenics and rs316341 passed the SMR analysis (P = 1.23 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ) and HEIDI test (P = 0.240). This suggests that the locus associated with CSF A\u03b2 42 is the same locus that affects expression of SERPINB1 in blood and macrophages.\nThe other genetic loci for A\u03b2 42 and ptau 181 were not as enriched for significant eQTL effects as SERPINB1, but there were suggestive results for 1p32.3 (near GLIS1) and 18q23 (near CTDP1). The signal near GLIS1 associated with A\u03b2 42 (1p32.3) had an eQTL effect on SLC1A7 throughout the brain (rs185031519[G]: P = 8.8 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ); however, overall expression of SLC1A7 was reported to be relatively low in the human brain, within the 33 rd percentile of all gene expression in the temporal cortex, primarily in endothelial cells [84] (Supplementary Table 13 ). The locus on 18q23 associated with ptau 181 , between CTDP1 and NFATC1, may have eQTL effects on both genes in the frontal cortex (rs12961169[T]: CTDP1, \u03b2 = \u22120.319, P = 3.85 \u00d7 10 ). Both NFATC1 and CTDP1 are expressed in the human temporal cortex (NFATC1 = 58th percentile; CTDP1 = 37th percentile; Supplementary Table 13) ."}, {"section_title": "Effect of AD risk loci on CSF levels", "text": "We wanted to determine whether known loci for AD risk are also associated with CSF levels of A\u03b2 42 or ptau 181 . AD risk variants identified in the IGAP study [48] that were most significantly associated with A\u03b2 42 were located in the CLU (\u03b2 = 0.014, P = 0.001) and FERMT2 (\u03b2 = \u22120.018, P = 0.009) gene regions, and SNPs in the CELF1 and ABCA7 regions had P < 0.05 (Supplementary Table 11 ). For CSF ptau 181 levels, the most significant association was in the INPP5D region (\u03b2 = 0.014, P = 0.009) and the CR1, PICALM, and FERMT2 regions had P < 0.05 (Supplementary Table 11 ). These results suggest that the risk variant in the CLU locus (rs11136000[T]) may increase risk for AD through an A\u03b2-associated mechanism and the INPP5D locus by a ptau-associated mechanism. Other loci like APOE or FERMT2 may act through both A\u03b2-and ptau-associated pathways to affect AD risk, and still other risk loci may act through alternate mechanisms such as neuronal survival, apoptosis, or homeostasis.\nAlthough the individual AD risk variants were not strongly associated with A\u03b2 42 or ptau 181 , we decided to analyze the potential overlap in the genetic architecture of AD risk and these endophenotype levels by determining whether PRS (with or without the effect of APOE genotype) calculated from the genome-wide significant hits for AD risk are also associated with CSF levels. We found not only a strong association between the non-APOE PRS and A\u03b2 42 (\u03b2 = \u22120.033, P = 5.01 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ), but also tau (\u03b2 = 0.049, P = 1.38 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ) and ptau 181 (\u03b2 = 0.049, P = 1.81 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) (Supplementary Table 11 ). The strength of the association with the non-APOE PRS was greater than any of the individual SNPs composing the PRS. The addition of APOE genotype significantly increased the PRS association with CSF levels (A\u03b2 42 : \u03b2 = \u22120.065, P = 5.01 \u00d7 10 \u221288 ; tau: \u03b2 = 0.051, P = 1.38 \u00d7 10 \u221231 ; and ptau 181 : \u03b2 = 0.044, P = 1.81 \u00d7 10 \u221231 ) (Supplementary Table 11 ). Estimation of CSF level variance explained by associated genetic loci\nTo determine the proportion of phenotypic variance (h 2 ) explained by the genetic loci identified for A\u03b2 42 and ptau 181 , we analyzed all of the tested genotyped and imputed autosomal common variants (MAF > 0.02). It was recently demonstrated that estimated h 2 may be biased if causal variants are enriched in areas with lower or higher LD than average [81] , so we used the GCTA tool to calculate segment-based LD scores (segment length = 200 kb) for all SNPs and plotted the number of SNPs with P < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 for A\u03b2 42 and ptau 181 (Supplementary Fig. 12 ). Since we observed LD heterogeneity in the associated variants, and the LDMS method can be applied to imputed GWAS data, we used the GCTA LDMS method to test all SNPs in our genetic data [81] "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Genetic studies using disease endophenotypes as quantitative traits provide power to identify loci associated with disease risk with smaller sample sizes, and endophenotypes provide biological context to help identify loci associated with other disease phenotypes such as AAO and disease progression. In our previous study using CSF levels of A\u03b2 42 and ptau 181 as endophenotypes, rs9877502 (near GMNC1 on 3q28) was reported, for the first time, to be associated with ptau 181 levels, AD risk, tangle pathology, and cognitive decline [13] . The ptau 181 association was recently replicated in an independent cohort [63] and we confirmed the association in this much larger dataset. The GMNC1 locus was also recently reported to be associated with intracranial volume [1] , suggesting that tau-associated pathology and brain volume share some genetic architecture. This larger study also revealed novel loci associated not only with A\u03b2 42 but also with AD risk and disease progression ). The associations with AD risk and AAO were tested in independent datasets. The associations of these SNPs with risk, disease progression, and AAO may not pass stringent multiple test correction if we take into account the number of SNPs and phenotypes tested. However, it is important to note that we had a very specific hypothesis, including direction of effect, for each SNP. As expected, the alleles associated with lower CSF levels of A\u03b2 42 were also associated with earlier disease symptom onset, increased AD risk, or faster progression. In any case, the associations with risk, disease progression, and AAO were identified in the largest datasets available to date, but additional studies will be needed to confirm the role of these loci in AD. By increasing the sample size more than twofold, we not only verified the results from our previous analyses, but also uncovered additional findings that can be used to inform future AD studies.\nAPOE genotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD, and is consistently the strongest association with CSF levels of A\u03b2 42 , tau, and ptau 181 in several GWAS as well [13, 36, 46, 63] . Numerous studies have explored how APOE influences amyloid pathology in AD [67] . A few studies have also looked at the role of ApoE in tau pathology [30, 49, 52] . A recent study of brain tissue from 1056 individuals (659 AD cases) found that the APOE \u03b54 and \u03b52 alleles were not associated with tau tangle pathology in the absence of amyloid deposits [27] . As we previously reported, after accounting for CSF A\u03b2 42 , there was a strong association for APOE with CSF ptau 181 , although it no longer passed genome-wide significance [13] . We verified these results in the current study, and with the larger dataset the APOE signal remained genome-wide significant after accounting for A\u03b2 42 levels. This provides additional evidence that APOE influences ptau 181 -associated mechanisms of AD independently of A\u03b2 42 -associated mechanisms. We also found, through conditional analyses, that although APOE genotype is driving most of the association for APOE with CSF A\u03b2 42 and ptau 181 , there appears to be an additional signal within the APOE gene region that is independent of APOE \u03b52, \u03b53, and \u03b54.\nCSF A\u03b2 42 and ptau 181 are well-established AD endophenotypes with a clear common genetic association for APOE and AD risk, but the shared genetic architecture between the disease and AD biomarkers is not as well-understood [7, [13] [14] [15] . Shared heritability between two traits can be estimated using different methods to calculate genetic and phenotypic correlations by linear mixed models, LD scoring, or genome partitioning; but most methods currently available usually require sample sizes in the tens of thousands to counteract statistical noise [3, 9, 10, 12, 66] . Another method to detect shared genetic etiology between traits is to calculate a PRS from a well-characterized cohort, usually from large case-control GWAS, and regress the other trait of interest, such as CSF protein levels, on the PRS in an independent cohort [21, 24] . Small studies (N < 350) have found that PRS were negatively correlated with CSF A\u03b2 42 but not correlated with tau or ptau 181 [54, 65, 71] . Recent studies of AD cases (N = 338) or individuals with mild cognitive impairment (N = 454), reported that their PRS without APOE were not associated with A\u03b2 42 , but tau and ptau were associated with the score without the APOE effect [53, 71] . In our current study of both AD cases and controls (N = 3145), we calculated a PRS composed of genome-wide significant AD risk loci that were reported in the largest AD case-control GWAS thus far [48] . Since the APOE locus is strongly associated with CSF levels and AD risk, it is not unexpected that PRS that include APOE effect would also be significantly associated with A\u03b2 42 and ptau 181 . Calculating PRS without including the APOE effect can provide information about the much smaller genetic effect of other AD risk loci, and although the individual variants were not even suggestively significant the PRS was significantly associated with both proteins. This suggests there is a genetic overlap between AD risk and the CSF biomarkers that is not apparent in single variant analyses. Since we restricted the PRS to genomewide significant AD risk loci, we may actually be underestimating genetic overlap between AD risk and CSF A\u03b2 42 and ptau 181 . Some of the AD risk loci did not appear to be associated with either biomarker, suggesting they affect AD risk through mechanisms independent of A\u03b2 42 and ptau 181 . Some AD risk loci such as CLU and PERMT2 for A\u03b2 42 and INPP5D for ptau 181 may be associated with these AD endophenotypes but did not reach genome-wide significance. Reasons for this could be that multiple risk loci interact to influence CSF levels, or possibly a lack of power due to small effect size of the individual variants. For example, we estimated that at least 4500 samples would be necessary for the association for CLU with A\u03b2 42 to pass the genome-wide significance threshold (P < 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ), suggesting that additional signals could be identified with a larger sample size.\nGenetic studies of endophenotypes not only provide enough power to identify novel associations with smaller sample sizes than case-control studies, but can also help with understanding biological mechanisms of disease. Loci identified in this study alter gene expression or protein binding, which can provide valuable information for understanding the biological basis for AD pathology. We identified here, for the first time, two genome-wide significant signals for CSF A\u03b2 42 outside the APOE region. Of particular interest is the locus on 6p25 which is associated with lower CSF A\u03b2 42 and earlier AAO. This may be mediated through SERPINB1, because the same SNPs affect SERPINB1 expression in blood and macrophages. SERPINB1 encodes a serine protease inhibitor that is a key regulator of neutrophil programmed cell death [28, 50] . SERPINB1 is expressed in the human brain, primarily in microglia and macrophages [84] . Recent research of transgenic mouse models for AD (5xFAD and 3xTg-AD) reported that neutrophils were present in the brain near A\u03b2 deposits, and researchers observed neutrophil migration from blood into the brain toward amyloid plaques [4, 83] . They discovered that A\u03b2 42 triggered the high-affinity state of integrin LFA-1, which is necessary for neutrophil infiltration of the CNS [83] . Their results, combined with our findings that genetic variants that increase expression of SERPINB1 are also associated with lower levels of A\u03b2 42 , support other studies suggesting that immune response pathways may play a key role in AD pathology [38, 75] . Our results indicate a potential role for SER-PINB1 in AD and suggest that adaptive immune response mechanisms are associated with A\u03b2-mediated pathology. Key proteins in neuroinflammation, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and YKL-40, are promising AD biomarkers [59, 60] , and TREM2 variants are also strongly associated with AD risk [6, 34, 42] . Clusterin (CLU) has been associated with AD risk in numerous studies [37, 48] and a GWAS of CSF CLU levels suggested CLU may be associated with immune response [20] . Our findings add to this growing evidence that immune response plays a key role in AD and CSF levels of A\u03b2 42 may be representative of this role.\nThe associations of the GMNC locus with ptau 181 levels and brain volume suggest biological mechanisms other than immune response may be associated with tau-mediated pathology in AD [1, 13, 63] . Although not well studied, GMNC (also known as GEMC1) is a necessary regulator of DNA replication [5] and recently was shown to be a key player in the differentiation of radial glial cells to multiciliated neuroepithelial cells during neurogenesis in the subventricular zone [47] . Combined with our GWAS results, it appears GMNC may influence CSF ptau 181 as part of the neurogenesis process. Further research is needed to determine if GMNC is indeed the gene affecting ptau 181 and what biological mechanism is involved. However, some of the loci associated with ptau 181 suggest immune response may also play a role in tau-associated pathology. NFATC1 encodes the nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 protein which is important in gene transcription induced by immune response. CTDP1 encodes the RNA polymerase II subunit A C-terminal domain phosphatase which interacts with the TFIIF transcription factor. Both NFATC1 and CTDP1 are expressed in the human temporal cortex, NFATC1 (58th percentile) more so than CTDP1 (37th percentile). NFATC1 is also the more promising candidate than CTDP1 because CTDP1 is primarily expressed in fetal astrocytes and nominally in other cell types, while NFATC1 is predominantly expressed in microglia and macrophages [84] (Supplementary Table 13 ). We were unable to test for the putative causal variant in these regions for these eQTL effects. However, these data suggest the top loci may influence ptau 181 levels by affecting expression of these genes.\nIn summary, by increasing the sample size more than twofold we not only verified the results from our previous analyses, but also uncovered additional findings that can be used to inform future AD studies. We identified novel associations between genetic loci and CSF levels that may provide insight into the biological mechanisms that affect protein levels, influence AD risk, AAO, and disease progression. Our findings suggest CSF A\u03b2 42 levels may be representative of the role of immune response on A\u03b2-associated pathology, and that this role may influence AAO. Although immune-related genes may be associated with ptau 181 , our results suggest that CSF ptau 181 may reflect pathways related to neurogenesis and brain volume. Although we did not identify individual AD risk variants outside the APOE region, the PRS results indicate shared genetic architecture between AD risk and these CSF biomarkers. Larger studies using AD endophenotypes will likely provide even more information to help understand the biology underlying AD pathology."}]
