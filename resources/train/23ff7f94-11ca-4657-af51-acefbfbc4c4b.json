[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "While a large literature examines the factors that lead teachers to leave teaching, few studies have examined what factors affect teachers' decisions to reenter the profession. Drawing on research on the role of family characteristics in predicting teacher work behavior, we examine predictors of reentry.We employ survival analysis of time to reentry for exiting teachers using longitudinal data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth. We find that younger, better paid, and more experienced teachers are more likely to reenter. We also find that women are more likely to return to teaching than men. Child rearing plays an important role in this difference. Women are less likely to reenter with young children at home. We conclude that reentrants may be an important source of teacher labor supply and that policies focused on the needs of teachers with young children may be effective ways for districts to attract returning teachers."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Because of the importance of attracting and retaining a high-quality teacher workforce for the success of public schools, researchers have developed a large literature on the teacher labor market (see Guarino, Santiba\u00f1ez, and Daley 2006 for a review) . A particular focus of this research has been on the factors that lead teachers to exit the teacher labor force (Borman and Dowling 2008) . Research on teacher attrition is motivated by concern about the high rates of turnover among teachers-approximately 7 percent of teachers leave the profession each year, with rates upward of 13 percent for new teachers (Grissom 2011; Ingersoll 2001 )-and the high costs of finding suitable replacements, which analyses suggest average around 30 percent of the departing teacher's salary (Alliance for Excellent Education 2005). An additional cost to schools from high teacher turnover is the loss of accumulated teacher human capital, since exiting teachers typically are replaced by teachers with less experience (Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin 2004) .\nIt is surprising, then, that the literature has largely ignored a potentially significant source of teacher labor that presumably comes with lower search costs and results in smaller losses in teacher human capital: former teachers. In particular, little research has examined teachers' decisions to come back to teaching after a spell outside the profession. This oversight is especially noteworthy given an influential study by Flyer and Rosen (1997) , who argued that among college-educated professionals, teachers are peculiarly predisposed to reentry because the structure of teacher pay via the uniform salary schedule ensures that they do not face large wage losses if they take time off. The flexibility this structure provides in turn attracts to the profession workers who are prone to take temporary leaves to, for example, raise small children, which, the authors suggest, helps explain why teaching is dominated by women.\nThis study helps fill a gap in the teacher work literature by analyzing teachers' propensities to return to the teaching profession after a spell outside teaching using data that are longitudinal, national, and recent. The small body of previous work on this topic has been limited to single-state studies, with the exception of Stinebrickner (2002) , who reports on data from the 1970s. We conduct a more comprehensive analysis using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 cohort (NLSY79) , which contains information on workers throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and into the 2000s. We ask what personal, work, and family factors predict a teacher's decision to return to teaching after an exit. In particular, we ask whether there is support in the data for the hypotheses suggested by Flyer and Rosen (1997) that women are more likely to return than men and that child rearing plays a role in reentry decisions. We address these questions using survival models that allow us to examine the timing of teacher reentry with respect to changes in factors such as parenthood status and age of children in the household. This analysis complements reentry studies by Beaudin (1993 Beaudin ( , 1995 , who drew on personnel data from the state of Michigan and thus was not able to consider the impact of family on teachers' decisions to return to work.\nThe next section describes prior work on the teacher labor market that drives our examination of reentry. We then test the predictions derived from this research using data from the NLSY79. We conclude with a discussion of implications for policy and future work in this area."}, {"section_title": "GENDER, FAMILY, AND TEACHER MOBILITY", "text": "A substantial body of research has investigated the labor market for teachers, with an emphasis on factors that explain why teachers change schools or leave the profession altogether. This research has uncovered important associations between teacher attrition and many workplace-level determinants, including compensation levels (Baugh and Stone 1982; Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin 2004; Imazeki 2004; Olsen 1989, 1990) , school facilities (Loeb, Darling-Hammond, and Luczak 2005) , student demographics (Boyd et al. 2005; Shen 1997) , and support from administrators (Grissom 2011; Ingersoll 2001) . Another strand of work has examined the role of teacher-specific factors, including education level and certification status (see Guarino, Santiba\u00f1ez, and Daley 2006 for a summary). In particular, this work has highlighted the important role that marriage and family considerations can play in teacher work decisions (Stinebrickner 1998 (Stinebrickner , 2001a (Stinebrickner , 2001b (Stinebrickner , 2002 . These studies have found changes in home life, especially childbirth, to be strongly associated with teachers'-especially young female teachers'-decisions to exit.\nThe empirical finding that teachers are more likely to exit the profession when they have children is consistent with an economic model of occupation choice proposed by Flyer and Rosen (1997) . Their model predicts that workers who expect to spend time out of the workforce in the future tend to choose occupations with both lower variance in wages and less depreciation in wages (due to lost human capital) during a temporary leave. They demonstrate that teaching has both of these characteristics. First, the uniform single salary schedule, which is used in virtually all school districts in the United States, ensures that there is little variation in pay among teachers with similar levels of experience and education. Second, their analysis of teacher wage data shows that, unlike nurses and administrative support professionals (two other female-dominated professions they also analyze), teacher earnings growth is not affected by time out of the labor force, a result probably also due to the structure of compensation via the single salary schedule. Thus forward-looking workers who expect to take time off from paid work during their careers-to rear children, for example-will be more likely to choose teaching than other professions that require a college degree. Given the role that future child rearing plays in their occupational choice, it is unsurprising that childbirth is associated with teacher exit (Stinebrickner 1998) . Flyer and Rosen (1997) suggest that their model helps explain, in part, why teaching is dominated by women, who are overwhelmingly more likely than men to take time off from paid work to raise children. In fact, approximately 75 percent of the teaching workforce is female (Bacolod 2007) . It also helps explain why teachers are more likely than other college-educated professionals to spend time out of the workforce; Flyer and Rosen (1997) find that female teachers spend on average 42 percent more time out of the labor force than other female workers with college degrees. There are two other implications of the model related to teacher reentry, however. The first is that women will be more likely to return to teaching after a spell outside the profession, since they will have been more likely to have chosen teaching in anticipation of time off to raise children. The second is that if teachers tend to leave the profession when they have children so they can provide child care at home, reentry behavior will be negatively associated with having children younger than school age. We address these two hypotheses in our empirical analysis.\nOur analysis also considers other factors that might contribute to a teacher's decision to reenter the teaching profession after leaving for a spell. We build directly on the handful of studies that have examined reentry, either descriptively or analytically. For example, Murnane et al. (1991) estimate the likelihood that a teacher in Michigan or North Carolina reenters the profession within five years after leaving; in both states they estimate this probability at approximately 28 percent. They observe that reentry probabilities were higher for women and elementary school teachers and lower among science teachers and teachers with high test scores, suggesting that those teachers may have greater opportunities in nonteaching fields. Beaudin (1993) similarly analyzes teacher reentry using administrative data from Michigan schools in the mid-1970s. She finds that women are more likely to come back to teaching than men, though she attributes these differences to differences in subject matter specialty, since men tend to choose subject matter specialties (e.g., chemistry) with more opportunities in the nonteacher labor market. Using the same Michigan data, Beaudin (1995) finds that minority teachers and more experienced teachers at exit are more likely to return to the same district, as are teachers who leave higher-paying districts.\nA small number of more recent studies also examine teacher reentry. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of 1972, Stinebrickner (2002) finds that 33 percent of teachers who could be observed for at least five years following an exit returned to the profession at some point during this period. Examining data from Washington State, Plecki, Elfers, and Knapp (2006) estimate that 18 percent of teachers who entered teaching in 2000 but exited in 2001 reentered in 2002. Using thirty-five years of data from Illinois, DeAngelis and Presley (2007) estimate that between one-fourth and one-third of new teachers who exit return to Illinois public schools at some point. The large numbers of teachers observed coming back into teaching following time away suggests that former teachers are an important source of teacher labor supply that policy makers might target for recruitment, particularly in school systems with elevated turnover rates. For this reason, it is important to understand what factors predict a teacher's decision to return to the teaching profession."}, {"section_title": "DATA", "text": "The analysis discussed below utilizes restricted, geocoded data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth, 1979 cohort (NLSY79), which is managed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). NLSY79 is a nationally representative sample of 12,686 men and women who were between the ages of fourteen and twenty-two when the survey began in 1979. Respondents completed interviews on an annual basis until 1994, at which time interviews became biennial. These data have been used extensively to study work behavior across many occupations. We focus our analysis on the time period between 1980 and 2004.\nWe identified teachers in each year based on census code classifications of their current or most recent occupation and up to five other jobs using the weekly work history files. We counted a respondent as a teacher in a given year if the teacher reported working in an elementary, secondary, or other K-12 teaching job for any weeks during that year.\n1 Prekindergarten teachers were not included. This search resulted in 970 respondents who were teachers at some point in the study time frame. Of the respondents identified as ever having taught, 70 percent were female, which is very close to the fraction Bacolod (2007) reports in her analysis of teachers from the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study. In addition, 61 percent of NLSY79 teachers were white, while 21 percent were black and 18 percent were Hispanic. 1. Sabbaticals present a difficulty in the NLSY79 work histories. According to NLSY79 documentation, for a time period in which a worker describes himself or herself as \"associated with an employer but . . . not working for the employer,\" no job code is recorded; in this case, we code a teacher as \"outside teaching\" for those weeks. Because we code as \"working in teaching\" any worker who reports teaching work during a year, only sabbaticals spanning a full year or longer are coded as outside teaching in the analysis data file. 2. NLSY79 contains an oversample of black and Hispanic respondents. Applying sampling weights reduces the estimates of the percentages of black and Hispanic teachers in the population to 11 percent and 6 percent, respectively.\nAfter dropping teachers with missing information, 3 we identify 341 spells in teaching that end in an exit of at least one year. We allow teachers who enter and exit teaching multiple times to appear more than once; the 341 spells cover 268 unique teachers. 4 Of these 341 exits, 175, or 51 percent, return after a minimum of one year outside the profession. Much of our analysis centers on this subset of 175 teaching spells, particularly in comparison to the 166 spells (49 percent) in which the teacher exits and is never observed returning. Besides occupation, race, and gender, we utilize a number of other measures from NLSY79 in the analyses that follow. These include age, location, educational attainment, and income. We use standardized scores from the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), administered to a large subset of participants in 1980, as a proxy for intellectual ability. We also include measures of work experience and compensation and characteristics of the local labor market. In addition, we draw on marriage and fertility data to include measures of marital status and the ages of respondents' children."}, {"section_title": "ANALYTICAL STRATEGY", "text": "To identify the factors that contribute to teachers' decisions to come back to teaching after some time out, we employ a survival analysis that models former teachers' spells out of teaching. We use the standard Cox proportional hazard model, which in this case estimates the probability that a person returns to teaching in a given year conditional on not having returned in the previous year. Multiple prior studies have used this framework to study teachers' decisions to leave teaching (e.g., Murnane et al. 1991; Stinebrickner 1998) ; here we extend its use to the modeling of time to reentry. The proportional hazard model allows us to consider the impact of both time-varying and time-invariant 3. Data in NLSY79 cover approximately 302 teachers (not spells) who exit teaching during the data panel. Missing data on the set of variables in the most basic model in the article (shown in column 1 of table 2) necessitates dropping 34 of these teachers, or 11 percent. Eighteen of these lost teachers are dropped because of missing county of residence information, which prevented us from coding the \"changed residence\" variable. The main results were not sensitive to dropping this variable and including these teachers. Adding the job characteristics variables (e.g., hourly pay) drops an additional 16 teachers; adding the child variables results in no additional losses. We tested (using simple t-tests) for differences in observables between the original 302 teachers and the smallest analytic sample (from the models with background, job, and child variables, as in column 3 of table 2). While basic background characteristics (e.g., gender, race, ASVAB score, family income, grade level taught, location) showed no statistically significant differences, one potentially important difference did emerge. Because missing data become more problematic as the NLSY cohort ages, the analytic sample tends to draw more heavily from earlier years of data. Thus the analytic sample was statistically younger at exit (by 2.2 years, on average) and less likely to be married. They were also more likely to have younger children and less likely to have older children (though not statistically different in total children), presumably because earlier years of data cover a greater proportion of likely child-bearing years. 4. We cluster our analyses at the teacher level to account for the correlated errors this structure produces.\ncharacteristics as well as to take into account censoring of observations. Tests indicated that all models presented in the article passed standard tests for the proportional hazards assumption. 5 Stinebrickner (1998) offers a description of the maximum likelihood procedure used to estimate these models.\nTo model spells out of teaching, we begin with the sample of former teachers who indicate that they are not teaching at time t but who were observed teaching in the previous year. In other words, it is at time t that a former teacher becomes \"at risk\" for reentry. If at some time T we observe the teacher returning to teaching, we code the teacher as \"failing\" in that year. If time T does not arrive by the time we stop observing former teachers, that respondent is considered right censored. The hazard model we estimate analyzes the time from t to T . Under the assumption that censoring is random and unrelated to failure, censoring is easily accommodated by excluding censored observations from the likelihood function after the time period that they are last observed. We include in our analysis former teachers who are working other jobs and those who are out of the labor force.\nOur main estimates model a former teacher's time to reentry as a function of gender, race (black or Hispanic, with white omitted), standardized ASVAB score, school type at time of exit (elementary or secondary, with other omitted), whether the teacher has a postgraduate degree (proxied by whether they report eighteen or more years of education) at exit, and age at exit. We also include an indicator for whether the spell of teaching is not the first such spell observed."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "These are all time-invariant. We also include total family income and marital status (married or not), plus indicators for census region of residence (northeast, midwest, or south, with west omitted), urban location, and whether the subject changed county of residence in a given year, all of which can change during the spell outside the workforce.\nIn a second set of models we add in work-related factors. The first is hourly pay at time of exit, which we include under the expectation that better-paid teachers will have stronger incentives to return to teaching jobs. We also include years of teaching experience at time of exit and an indicator for being part time at exit (i.e., worked fewer than thirty-five hours per week), which capture investment in and attachment to the teaching profession. Finally, we include the local unemployment rate as a proxy for alternative employment opportunities in the area.\nA third set of models adds variables related to child rearing. Following Gramm (1975) , we create a series of dummy variables for having children 5. These tests are based on the Schoenfeld residuals and were implemented as discussed in Cleves et al. (2008) . 6. Most of these higher spells (75 percent) are second spells. There are eighteen third spells (23 percent) and two fourth spells (2 percent).\nwithin a series of age brackets. The first three are 0-2 years, 3-4 years, and 5-6 years. We separate early childhood into these three groups to test for the possibility of differential reentry behavior from teachers as care demands change as children move through very early childhood, pre-school age, and age of school entry. We separate the remaining age brackets into 7-11 years (roughly elementary age), 12-17 years (middle and high school age), and 18 and higher (adulthood). Because work behavior is likely affected by the total number of dependents for whom workers must provide, we also include a measure of the worker's total number of children (aged 0-17).\nFamily income and hourly wage were both converted to real terms (2006 dollars) based on the annual Consumer Price Index for U.S. cities provided by the BLS. All models are limited to teachers who report at least sixteen years of education, which we use as a proxy for holding a bachelor's degree, since degree information is not available. We further limit the sample to teachers who report at least twenty hours teaching per week at time of exit at an hourly wage above the fifth percentile (approximately $3.50 per hour in 2006 dollars). These limits were used to avoid including nontraditional teachers or teachers reporting incorrect data. Sampling weights provided by the BLS are employed in all analyses."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "We begin our analysis by providing some basic information on the teachers in our sample. The first two columns of table 1 provide descriptive statistics for exiting teacher spells in our sample-that is, those in which a teacher becomes eligible to reenter teaching. It shows that the sample is approximately two-thirds female with an average age of twenty-nine and average teaching experience of 3.5 years. Twenty-five percent of exiters have a child age 0-4 years. Note that this sample will not be representative of all exiting teachers because we observe NLSY79 teachers relatively early in their work careers. Descriptive information about all teachers we observe working in the NLSY79 data is shown in appendix table A.1."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "The remaining columns of table 1 separate the exiting teacher spells into two groups: those that will later result in reentry and those that will not. Descriptive statistics are then shown for characteristics at time of exit. Asterisks in the column of means in the will not return group indicate statistically significant differences (in two-sided t-tests) between the two. This comparison provides a first look at how those who reenter the teaching profession may 7. Compared with all teachers in the sample, exiting teachers are approximately three years younger with two fewer years of teaching experience. Exiters are also less likely to be female than are the working teachers in the sample. differ from those who do not. Though there are no differences with respect to race or ASVAB score, reentrants are more likely to be women and less likely to be married. They are more likely to teach in elementary schools and less likely to have education beyond a bachelor's degree. They are also about two years younger at time of exit, on average, though they also have about half a year more teaching experience. They are less likely to be part time and work in places with higher unemployment rates. In addition, the table shows that teachers not in their first spell out-that is, those who have left and returned before-are more likely to return again. There are also a few differences in the child variables. In particular, although there is no significant difference in the total number of children, teachers who will later reenter tend to have somewhat younger children at time of exit, on average. Next we consider time to reentry. Figure 1 shows the proportion of teachers in the sample who reenter the teaching profession T years after exiting, conditional on ever coming back at all. As the figure illustrates, 48 percent of these teachers return after just a one-year spell outside the profession. This fraction is comparable to what Murnane et al. (1991) observed in North Carolina and Michigan in their analysis of earlier data. In each subsequent year out of teaching, the likelihood of returning falls dramatically; 67 percent of reentrants do so in year 1 or year 2, and only 14 percent return after year 5.\nThe pattern shown in figure 1 can also be illustrated using the plot of the Kaplan-Meier survivor function for time to reentry shown in figure 2. This line again shows that the probability of returning (failing) falls significantly each year that a person is away from teaching, particularly in the first three years. The value of the survival function in year 10 is 0.46, which means that approximately half of exiting teachers are predicted to reenter by their tenth year out, though it changes very little thereafter, suggesting that few additional teachers are likely to reenter if they have not done so by year 10. Note, however, that beyond about year 10, we observe so few teachers reentering the profession in our data (and none after year 14) that our estimates will be imprecise.\nA primary hypothesis investigated in this article is that women return to the teaching profession after a spell out at higher rates than men. Figure 3 compares time to reentry for men and women by plotting their respective Kaplan-Meier survival functions. A Cox test of equality for the two curves rejects the null hypothesis that they are the same ( p = 0.02). The figure shows that women are much more likely than men to reenter the teaching workforce after one year and that this gap persists in every time period. By the fifth year after exit, the difference in the predicted survival probabilities for men and women is approximately 14 percentage points. In the longer run (ten or more years), men are even more likely to persist outside teaching than women. This pattern of women returning at higher rates than men is consistent with the Flyer and Rosen (1997) hypothesis that teaching attracts women in part because reentry (after childbirth or child rearing) to teaching has lower wage penalties than in other professions. In the next section we investigate the degree to which reentry decisions are a function of both gender and fertility in the multivariate analysis. "}, {"section_title": "Modeling Time to Reentry", "text": "The main question we investigate is: What factors underlie a teacher's probability of returning to the teaching profession following a break? Finding the answer requires us to consider teachers' reentry decisions in a multivariate framework. Here we use Cox regression to model a teacher's time away from the profession as a function of personal, work, and family characteristics as a step toward more rigorously identifying the most important mechanisms underlying the decision to reenter or not. Table 2 shows Cox proportional hazard estimates for time to reentry for all exiting teachers. The coefficients have been exponentiated so they can be interpreted as the ratio of the hazards for a one-unit change in each explanatory variable. Hazard ratios significantly greater than 1 suggest that a variable is associated with greater reentry, while hazard ratios significantly smaller than 1 suggest a negative association with reentry.\nModel 1 includes personal characteristics such as gender, race, marital status, and teaching level. The primary variable of interest in this model is the first one, the indicator for whether the teacher is female. The coefficient is significant at the 0.10 level, and its magnitude suggests that women have a hazard (risk of reentry) that is 42 percent greater than that for men, conditional on the other variables in the model. This finding is consistent with the patterns observed in figure 3 . The second model in table 2 adds four variables capturing characteristics of the teacher's work context: hourly pay, whether the teacher works part time, and number of years of teaching experience at time of exit, plus the local unemployment rate. In this model the coefficient on female drops somewhat and becomes statistically indistinguishable from zero at conventional levels, a result that persists in model 3 when the variables related to children in the home are added. These findings suggest that while women indeed are more likely to return to teaching than men, this difference is driven at least in part by gender differences in the impact of work and family factors on work decisions. We return to differences in the reentry decision by gender below.\nIn addition to the results concerning gender, table 2 provides insight into the factors influencing a former teacher's decision to return to teaching more generally. We focus on model 3. This model shows no statistically significant correlations between race, ASVAB score, or marital status and the probability of returning to teaching. It also shows no impact of schooling level taught, though looking across models 1-3 suggests that in general elementary teachers are more likely to return-a finding consistent with Beaudin (1993) -but that these differences are driven by differences in pay and other factors across grade level. Results also show that returning teachers tend to come from families with lower overall incomes. This coefficient suggests that teachers from more well-off families may have greater flexibility to not work or to seek employment elsewhere. Having some postgraduate education at time of exit generally is associated with a lower probability of returning to teaching, though this coefficient is not statistically significant at conventional levels in model 3 ( p = 0.12). Teachers with higher education levels may have a larger number of higher-paying alternatives in the nonteacher labor market.\nThe models reach one conclusion that is inconsistent with results presented in Beaudin (1993)-namely, being older at time of exit is associated with a lower probability of returning. In Beaudin's analysis of data from Michigan, the estimated probability of returning increased substantially as age at exit increased, but the opposite is true in our data, with each additional year reducing the probability that we observe a teacher returning. One explanation for the discrepancy between the two studies is that they are based on different data sets (Michigan versus national) covering two different time periods. Another is because the NLSY79 is a cohort study, older teachers who exit in our data necessarily are observed in fewer time periods in which they might return, lowering their calculated probabilities. Analysis using a longer time span may find a result more consistent with Beaudin's (1993) finding.\nLike Beaudin, however, we do find that more experienced teachers at time of exit tend to return at higher rates, suggesting that teachers who have invested more in building teaching-specific capital are more likely to return after time away. Similarly, part-time teachers are less likely to return. Teachers who are paid higher hourly wages at exit are also more likely to return to teaching. Importantly, this coefficient is conditioned on experience and education, the two primary determinants of a teacher's position on the single salary schedule, suggesting that the coefficient on pay is capturing impacts on reentry probability of how well a school district compensates its teachers.\nIn addition, table 2 shows that teachers are more likely to reenter when they have already exited and returned previously, with teachers on their second (or more) spell out of teaching showing a hazard rate approximately 60 percent higher than those on their first spell out. Repeat leavers likely differ from single leavers in important ways. In particular, we might suspect that repeat leavers are people who are attached to the teaching workforce but face personal circumstances, such as dependent care, that pull them away, whereas single leavers might be more likely to be career switchers, an issue to which we return later. In fact, while 80 percent of teachers reentering from a single spell out had worked at some point in another job, for teachers returning from a subsequent spell this number was only 65 percent, a statistically significant difference ( p = 0.07)."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "The final set of variables in model 3 is concerned with the characteristics of the children in the home.\n9 This is where we return to the hypothesis implied by the Flyer and Rosen (1997) study that teachers' reentry decisions will be affected by child-rearing considerations. The hazard ratios are consistent with Flyer and Rosen's predictions. The hazard ratio for the total number of minor children (age 0-17) is greater than one. Each additional child in the home is associated with an increase in the hazard rate for returning to teaching of 0.67 ( p = 0.02). However, the presence in the household of children age 2 or younger is a strong negative predictor of reentry into teaching (hazard ratio = 0.37, p < 0.01). The presence of a child in the next age group (3-4 years) is also a negative predictor, though the magnitude of the coefficient is smaller than for younger children (hazard ratio = 0.45, p = 0.012). 10 The coefficient for 8. Subsequent spells do not appear to drive the article's results concerning the presence of young children. Splitting the sample into first and subsequent spells out yields very similar hazard ratios for the two youngest groupings. 9. Because missing data result in loss of sample size, we used an imputation procedure based on chained equations (van Buuren et al. 2006) to impute values for the three variables in the analysis whose missing values resulted in the largest reductions of sample size: hourly pay at exit, family income, and whether a respondent moved. This imputation allowed us to add information from thirty-five teachers to the estimates shown in column 3; however, the conclusions drawn from the analysis remained largely unchanged, so the article presents the unimputed results. With imputation, the hazard ratio on postgraduate education became significant at the 0.05 level, while family income became statistically insignificant (p = 0.18). 10. The null hypothesis that the coefficients for 0-2 years and 3-4 years are equal cannot be rejected (p = 0.65).\nchildren age 5 or 6 is also less than one, though not statistically significant ( p = 0.13). None of the coefficients for the higher age brackets approach statistical significance. 11 In short, these coefficients provide evidence that teachers with very young children (i.e., younger than school age) are less likely to return to teaching, while the presence of older children (i.e., school age or above) shows no clear relationship with teachers' work decisions."}, {"section_title": "12", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Examining Time to Reentry by Gender", "text": "The Flyer and Rosen (1997) hypothesis, however, implies differential implications of child rearing for the work decisions of men and women. To provide a closer look at the gender dynamics of teacher reentry, we next reestimate the Cox regression models separately for women and men. Splitting the sample in this way allows us to identify differential impacts by gender of other variables in the model. The results of reestimating the models by gender are displayed in table 3. Only the full models are shown.\nThe results uncover a number of differences for women and men. For example, the table suggests that the associations between reentry and age at exit, multiple spells, and hourly pay are all driven by differences for women, not men. The table also shows that once women and men are disaggregated, there is a significant positive association between men's ASVAB score and the probability of reentry. In contrast, the effects of years of teaching experience are very similar and statistically significant in both the female and male samples."}, {"section_title": "11.", "text": "To test the robustness of this main result to the specification of the child variables, we ran a number of alternative models. First, we dropped the variable for the total number of children but included the age bracket variables. The hazard ratios among the age brackets changed, though the patterns did not. However, only the 0-2 age bracket was statistically significant in this model. We also ran models that substituted the number of children in each age bracket rather than a simple indicator for the presence of any children. Using the same age groupings as in table 2, we found, as expected, negative correlations with reentry for having more younger children in the home and positive correlations with having older children, but only the coefficient on \"number age 12-17\" was statistically significant. If instead we reduced the number of age groupings to two (\"number age 0-4\" and \"number age 5-17\"), the two hazard ratios remain consistent with the results in table 2 but are not precisely estimated, with p-values each of approximately 0.18. A possible interpretation of these results is that the relationship between the presence of young children and teacher reentry contains a nonlinearity; what matters for the reentry decision is the presence of a young child in the home, but conditional on there being one, additional young children matter much less, though we would need more data to assess this conjecture. 12. We also tried estimating the models using a fixed effects logit estimator (where the dependent variable was the probability of reentering in a given time period) instead of the Cox proportional hazard model. The main drawback of this approach relative to survival analysis is that it throws out information for censored data. It also prevents analysis of the contribution of time-invariant characteristics. Thus we included only time-varying characteristics in these models and let the others be absorbed by the fixed effect. For the 95 individuals in these models (observed over 504 time periods), the results on the child age variables was consistent with the results from the survival analysis, with odds ratios for having a child age 0-2 and age 3-4 of 0.20 and 0.34, respectively. Both were statistically significant (at the 0.05 and 0.10 levels, respectively). Other child age variables were not statistically distinguishable from zero. More striking, however, are the results for marriage and parenthood. The impact of being married on reentering teaching is statistically significant at the 0.05 level for both women and men, but the direction of the association differs. For women, marriage is positively associated with reentry. Married women have a 50 percent higher reentry hazard than unmarried women. In contrast, for men, marriage is associated with a lower likelihood of returning to teaching. Married men have a 66 percent lower reentry hazard than unmarried men.\nTurning to the child variables, we find that the positive association between reentry and total number of children and the negative association with the presence of a very young child (age 0-2 or 3-4) is statistically significant for women only. The latter result in particular is consistent with the Stinebrickner (1998) finding that women appear to leave teaching at high rates to have and take care of children. None of the child variables is statistically significant for men, providing little evidence that men experience reentry pressures from childrearing-perhaps because, as Stinebrickner (1998) shows, the man's decision to exit teaching is not a function of this variable either. We note, however, that the smaller sample sizes for the male estimates and the resulting imprecision prevent us from ruling out the possibility that young children may matter for men. Still, the results support the idea that prior work observing that households treat men's and women's work options differently has implications for the dynamics of the teacher workforce."}, {"section_title": "13", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Working While Out of Teaching", "text": "Exiting teachers can either leave the paid workforce altogether or remain in the workforce but enter another profession. Thus far we have treated these two possibilities as equivalent, but clearly they are different and likely have different implications for the likelihood that a former teacher reenters the profession at a later date. Entering another profession may signal that the teacher wants to work in the paid labor force but is seeking more attractive job opportunities. In this case we would expect reentry to become less likely. In 13. In light of the differential findings regarding marriage and children for women and men, we also ran analyses interacting the indicator variable for married with the indicators for each child age bracket to test for the possibility that the impact of children on reentry would be conditional on marital status. This conditional relationship would be expected if, for example, married workers had greater freedom to stay home with small children because a spouse could work. This analysis could only be completed for women because of limited variation with which to estimate the interactions in the male-only sample, but the results suggest the negative association between the presence of children age 0-4 in the home and reentry is concentrated among married women. In particular, the hazard rations for the interactions between married and both the 0-2 and 3-4 age brackets were substantially lower than zero, and the hypothesis that they were jointly zero could be rejected in a Wald test at the 0.10 level.\ncontrast, teachers who simply remain out of the labor force may be those facing other considerations, such as illness or-as we have discussed-the need to care for dependents, which, if transitory, may allow the teacher to return in the future. In short, we would expect to find that teachers who hold no nonteaching employment during their spell out of the teaching profession would be more likely to return to teaching. 14 Moreover, if, as we have argued, the reentry propensity of exiting teachers-and female teachers in particular-is lowered by the presence of young children in the home because teachers tend to elect to provide child care when the children are pre-school age, we would expect to see the effects of young children on reentry to be greater among those teachers who are not in the labor force at all during their time outside teaching. To examine these expectations within the Cox model used in the previous analyses, we first created an indicator variable that we set equal to 1 for any teacher who held no other paid employment in any year during his or her spell outside teaching (and 0 otherwise). We then reestimated the full model from table 2, adding this indicator. The result, shown in column 1 of table 4, confirms the expectation of a positive and significant coefficient. Holding no other job while outside teaching is highly predictive of returning to the teacher work force, with teachers holding no other employment displaying a hazard that is 80 percent higher than teachers who hold another job at some point ( p < 0.01).\nTo test the assertion that staying home to provide child care drives the relationship between the presence of young children and reentry to teaching, we next interacted the no employment indicator with each of the child age bracket indicators. If the assertion is true, we would expect to see significant (and negative) coefficients on the interaction terms for the younger age brackets in particular. The results are shown in column 2 of table 4.\n15 A Wald test of the null hypothesis that all the interaction terms are jointly zero can be rejected at the 0.05 level. Though none are individually significant due to high collinearity between the interactions and other variables, the hazard ratios for the interactions are consistent with the idea that the presence of young children reduces the reentry likelihood more for teachers who do not work 14. In fact, we might think of entering alternative employment as a competing risk for returning to teaching and model the decision to reenter accordingly in a competing risks framework that allows for multiple \"failures\" (i.e., returning to teaching or entering another job). Descriptively, however, it would not appear that having nonteaching employment necessarily precludes returning to teaching in our data. Approximately 75 percent of the spells out of teaching that end in reentry include at least one year with some paid work in another sector. Thus instead of utilizing a competing risks model, we attempt to incorporate work in other employment into the standard Cox framework in table 4. 15. There was too little variation to include the interaction between \"no employment\" and the \"18 or older\" age bracket. while out and, moreover, that the reentry propensity is positive in the presence of children age 5 or 6 (i.e., school-age children).\nThis pattern becomes more pronounced when we limit the sample to women only in columns 3 and 4 in table 4 (there are too few men to obtain coefficients for the interactions in the male-only subsample 16 ). Once again,\n16. Though note that the \"no employment\" hazard ratio is also positive (2.1) and significant at the 0.10 level when the interaction terms are not included.\nthe indicator for holding no other employment during the spell out is positive and statistically significant. The interaction terms are also jointly significant ( p = 0.05). The hazard ratios for the interactions suggest that women with very young children (age 0-4) are less likely to return when they are out of the labor force but significantly more likely to return in the presence of a schoolage (5-6) child. The hazard ratio on the 5-6 age bracket is very large (6.7) and individually significant at the 0.05 level. In other words, among female teachers who have left the paid labor force altogether, we find evidence of lower likelihoods of returning when the children are very young but greater likelihoods when they reach the age at which child care inside the home is no longer necessary."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The results presented here uncover several new insights into teacher labor market behavior. First, rates of reentry are nontrivial. More than 40 percent of teaching spells that terminate in our sample lead to subsequent reentry. While the cohort nature of the sample, which is made up of relatively young teachers, makes this reentry percentage not necessarily representative of all exiting teachers, the fraction is large enough to suggest that teacher labor market analyses that do not consider reentry are incomplete. Attrition rates in teaching average 7-8 percent each year (Ingersoll 2001) , but some of the loss to the teacher labor supply these numbers presume is offset by reentry among former teachers. Moreover, high rates of reentry suggest that the school system recoups a significant portion of the human capital loss associated with teacher attrition."}, {"section_title": "17", "text": "Second, consistent with the expectations derived from Flyer and Rosen (1997) , teacher reentry behavior appears to be driven significantly by teachers' family characteristics, especially for women. We find evidence of a pattern of women staying home with young children and then-at least among those working in no other employment-shifting back into the teaching workforce when their children reach school age, an important empirical fact that other studies have hypothesized but not shown. In contrast, we find little evidence that these considerations affect male teachers' work decisions. 17. Though short-term attrition may reduce important firm-(i.e., school-) specific capital (e.g., understanding the school's community, relationships with fellow teachers), it is unlikely to similarly affect \"general\" teaching capital (e.g., knowledge of teaching practices) as understood in the human capital literature (see Becker 1993) . We thank an anonymous reviewer for making this point. 18. As described earlier, Flyer and Rosen's (1997) argument that the characteristics of teacher compensation create teacher labor market dynamics that differ from those of other female-dominated professions provides the basis for our examination of teacher reentry. A natural hypothesis, then, is that teachers' reentry behaviors differ from those of other female-dominated professions as well. While a complete examination of that hypothesis is beyond the scope of this article, we did use How important is the role of child rearing in female teachers' propensity to come back to teaching? In our sample, 14 percent of female teachers who exit have newborns (age 0 or 1) in the year they exit, compared with only 9 percent of men. Two years later, 14 percent of women who have not returned have newborns in the home, compared with just 5 percent of the women who do return in that year. Five years after exit, 22 percent of women who have not returned have newborns, while none of the women who return at year five does.\n19 This is not to say, however, that women staying home to care for young children are the primary driver of teacher turnover, even in our sample of relatively young female teachers. One year after exiting teaching, 66 percent of women (and 75 percent of men) report working in other paid employment, a number nearly identical to the estimate of women who are working one year after leaving teaching (62 percent) in the 2004-5 Teacher Follow-up Survey (TFS) conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics. 20 In other words, both women and men leave teaching for other paid employment in large numbers. Still, the size of the pool of former teachers who are not engaging in paid work outside the home is substantial, particularly among women, and child and family considerations appear to be important in their employment decisions. These results have a number of potential policy implications. First, they underscore that former teachers may be a significant source of teacher labor supply. In our sample, the average reentrant has nearly five years of prior teaching experience. Given the substantial gains in effectiveness teachers make during their first four or five years in the classroom (Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain 2005) , there may be significant payoffs to schools that can attract former teachers to fill vacancies, particularly when the alternative is to hire a first-year teacher. Workers who return to teaching typically exited with higher salaries than nonreturners, suggesting that increasing teacher pay may be one strategy for enticing former teachers to return to the profession. 21 At a minimum, our the NLSY79 cohort to compare reentry characteristics for teachers with those of nurses and social workers, two professions that, like teaching, employ predominantly female, highly educated workers. These comparisons are shown in appendix tables A.1 and A.2. The tables show that although probabilities of exit are similar for teachers and nurses, they are much higher for social workers (table A.1). In contrast, although the probabilities of returning are similar for teachers and social workers, they are higher for nurses (table A. 2). Reentering teachers fall between the other two in the probability that a reentering worker has small children in the home. These results call into question whether teachers are in fact very different from professions in other female-dominated fields, though further investigation obviously is necessary. 19. Admittedly, only five women return to teaching at year five, so this number is not meant to be representative. 20. Source: author calculations. This estimate is based on responses from public school teachers younger than age forty-seven, which is the maximum age observed in our NLSY79 sample. 21. Coupling our findings with the Flyer and Rosen (1997) argument about the role of the single salary schedule in attracting young women to teaching suggests implications for current debates about findings suggest that schools might benefit from maintaining contact with teachers who take time out, especially when those spells are fertility related, since it appears that some proportion of these exiting teachers could be lured back into those schools when their home situation changes. The importance of having young children at home in explaining the length of teachers' spells out of the profession suggests another avenue of policy strategies for attracting teachers to return-or perhaps even to prevent them from leaving in the first place-with which policy makers might experiment. Some young female teachers may be staying out of work to provide care to their young children because available child care options are expensive or inconvenient. Child care costs can be thought of as a kind of tax on teachers' earnings that lowers effective wages, which research in labor economics has shown to negatively affect women's labor force participation (Anderson and Levine 2000; Han and Waldfogel 2001) . School districts might combat this implicit tax and positively affect teachers' job attachment by offering teachers child care options. In fact, among former female teachers surveyed in the TFS who said they would consider a return to teaching, 32 percent reported that \"availability of suitable childcare options\" would be a very or extremely important factor in their decision to return. This fraction was even higher among younger women, totaling 57 percent among women age forty or younger who would consider returning."}, {"section_title": "22", "text": "Schools would appear to be especially well positioned to provide on-site child care at low costs because they can take advantage of the economies of scale associated with having facilities and personnel already specializing in providing care and educational services for children. Of course, our results are merely suggestive on this front; the question of whether child care assistance would in fact affect teachers' attrition or reentry behaviors remains an open one. 23 the reform of teacher salary schedules (e.g., Grissom and Strunk 2011; Podgursky and Springer 2007) . In particular, districts might consider whether compensation reforms that make it more costly for teachers to take time off to have children will adversely affect the ability to hire new (and returning) teachers. In contrast, reforms that raise pay for early-career teachers may make teacher reentry more likely. 22. Source: author calculations. This estimate is based on responses from public school teachers younger than age forty-seven, which is the maximum age observed in our NLSY79 sample. 23. One might envision several strategies for identifying the causal effect of child care assistance on teacher work behavior. For example, teachers within participating districts (or all teachers within randomly chosen schools) might be randomly assigned the opportunity to receive subsidized child care, with their outcomes compared with nonrecipients. A similar design was used to study the impacts of the New Hope program in Milwaukee-a component of which was a child care subsidy-on employment among its participants, who were very low-income (see Duncan, Huston, and Weisner 2007) . We know of no such study for teachers or similarly situated professionals. More traction in the literature on the impacts of child care availability or subsidy on parental employment decisions has come from quasi-experimental approaches exploiting the features of particular programs to create treatment and control groups (e.g., Fitzpatrick 2010; Lefebvre and Merrigan 2008) . Again, no studies of which we are aware apply such a research design to teacher child care.\nThe findings also point out that the factors informing male and female teachers' work decisions are different, suggesting that districts need differentiated policy strategies for attracting and retaining male and female teachers. This insight is important given recent policy attention to the male teacher shortage (e.g., Cushman 2005) . While our results point to a number of factors that may affect female teachers' work decisions, our analysis was not successful at identifying many factors correlated with the reentry decisions of male teachers in our sample. Further work with a larger sample of men and a larger number of potential influencing factors would be useful for policy makers interested in the labor market for male teachers.\nOur analysis faces a number of limitations. Most important, because work environment variables are scarce in the NLSY79 data, we are unable to take school characteristics into account, which may be important considerations for teachers contemplating a return to work (Beaudin 1995) . Such data are common in state administrative data sets and other sources, such as the Schools and Staffing Survey, which researchers use to study teacher work behavior. However, there is a key trade-off involved in using administrative data, since those data sets typically do not contain information on important personal characteristics, such as marriage and fertility, which studies using longitudinal data have also found to be significant determinants of exit decisions. In the same way that sorting teachers by school characteristics could mean that omitting those characteristics biases some of our coefficient estimates, excluding family characteristics may well have biased estimates in previous work of the impact of the work environment on reentry decisions. The development of longitudinal data sets that combine both sets of elements would facilitate more complete studies of teacher labor markets.\nWe are also unable to consider a number of teacher-level factors that it would be useful to investigate in future work. In particular, we lack access to measures of teacher quality or effectiveness. We cannot say whether more effective teachers are more or less likely to return to the profession or whether their work decisions are differentially affected by such factors as pay and child rearing. Examination of the implications of our results for teacher quality would add clarity to the policy discussion that our analysis informs. Notes: Sampling weights used.
