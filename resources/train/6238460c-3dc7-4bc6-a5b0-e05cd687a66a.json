[{"section_title": "o", "text": "The majority of eighth graders had positive concepts about themselves including high self-concepts, thinking they were well-regarded by their peers, and that they had sufficient control over their lives. o Most indicated that they had friends and were comfortable both with their own sex and individuals of the other sex. There was considerable variation in how they thought their friends viewed various activities. The greatest concensus was in thinking that finishing high school was important. o Three-fourths of the tenth graders took part in at least one school extracurricular activity. Almost half took part in sports at school. Slightly more than half took part in a school club or other activity. Tenth graders scattered in terms of participatrig in nonschool activities other than social interaction with friends and doing things with parents. Somewhat more than two-t lirds spent part of their free time in a sports activity. Three-fourths took part in one of the solo activitie -reading, hobbies, using a computer; a third took a nonschool lesson or class. o Almost three-fourths thought of themselves as at least somewhat religious. About two-fifths said they attended church at least twice a month. The largest percentages, about a fourth, were Catholic or Baptist. o Three-fifths had worked for pay at some time of their life. Over a fourth were working during the school year. o About one teen in twenty had run away from home at least once in the first two years of high school. For the majority, sex and marriage were no longer linked. Alcohol was the most frequently used and abused harmful substance. Over two-thirds had had at least one drink of alcohol in the year prior to the ctudy. One in five said they smoked cigarettes. Somewhat more than one in ten had used marijuana. Less than one in five had used cocaine. Most said they had been exposed to educational sessions about these areas of behavior. As they looked to the future, finding and being successful in work, having strong friendships, finding the right person to marry, and giving their own children better opportuniies were very important to tenth graders. Most felt there was at least a fifty-fifty chance that positive things would happen in their future. PART B: FAMILY CHARACTERISTICS AND RELATIONSHIPS o Almost all of the tenth graders had an adult female and most had an adult male in a parental role in their households. Most had at least one brother or sister. Less than one in ten had a grandparent or other relative living with them. A few households included the teen's new family. o Somewhat more than one tenth grader in ten lived with one original parent and a stepparent. About two in ten lived only with one parent, usually, but not always their mother. Most of the few who were living with someone other than a parent lived with a relative. o Many, over six out of ten tenth graders, had experienced at least one of 19 potentially traumatic or disruptive events during the past two years. Death or illness of a family member, moving into a new home, mother going to work, and changing marital status of parents were the only single events that more than 10% said they had experienced in the previous two years. o There was considerable diversity in how tenth graders saw relationships with their families. Somewhat less than one in ten said they did not like their parents very much and somewhat more than one in ten said they did not get along well with their parents. About one in four said they could not get along with a step or foster parent. More than one in ten said that their parents did not get along with each other. o There was considerable variation in the extent to which tenth graders said their parerAs monitored their activities. Parents were most likely to require the tenth grader to help around the home and least likely to limit the amount of time spent watching television or playing video games. Parents differed In the extent to which they tried to know about their tenth grader's activities. Parents appeared to be most concerned about the night activities of their tenth graders. o Relatively few tenth graders felt that they and their parents jointly made decisions about what the tenth grader could do, although many chose the response that indicated that either they or their parent(s) made the decision after discussion. Very few tenth graders saw their parents as arbitrarily making decisions for them without at least discussing the decision with the tenth grader. However, over a third said that their parent(s) alone made the decision about the age at which the tenth grader could leave school and how late they could stay out. o Most tenth graders had talked to their parent(s) occasionally about school related topics. Grades was the topic about which the highest percent said they frequently talked with their parents and the lowest percent said they never did so. o Over twice as many parents of tenth graders had received warnings from the school ak out grades as about behavior. Tenth graders were most likely to say their parents had been in contact with the school through speaking wjth one of their teachers or their counselor. Parents had been least likely to have volunteered."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "PART C: TENTH GRADERS AND SCHOOL o Even though most American jobs require specialized training only somewhat more than one in ten were in vocational programs and a third in college preparatory courses. The largest number, more than two in five, were in a general program. Over a fourth were in advanced placement programs. Somewhat less than one in five were in a special languaae or bicultural program. A few, about two percent, were in a dropout program or a program to ,. those who were educationally or physically challenged. o Most tenth graders thought that getting good grades was important. Students were more likely to recall getting A and B grades than they were C or lower. Differences related to the variables were greater in the NELS tests which were given as part of the study, than in relation to grades assigned by the teacher. Ethnicity (30 percentage points or more across ethnic groups), socio-economic status (30 percentage points or more across socio-economic status quartiles), family type (20 percentage points or more), and region (10 percentage points or more) consistently showed substantial differences in relation to how the tenth graders scored on the NELS tests. In addition to scores on tests, the NELS study team developed proficiency scores in Math and in Reading for each student. About one in ten tenth graders were judged as being below level in Math and one In ten were judged below level In Reading. o Slightly more than half of the tenth graders, 53%, said that they had received some kind of recognition during the first half of the school year. The most frequently indicated kind of recognition came for good grades which was indicated by one-third of the respondents. The least frequently indicated was receiving a community service award, 4%. o The tenth graders were most likely to have had something stolen at school, about two in five, and least likely to have been offered drugs or been in a physical fight, about one in five. About a fourth had been threatened with harm. o One inappropriate behavior was indicated much more frequc ly than others. Over tniee-fourths said they had been late at least once during the first half of the school year. The next most frequent poor behaviors were getting into trouble for not following school rules and cutting classes. Almost one out of ten had an in-school suspension and a few had been arrested the previous semester. o The majority of tenth graders spent less one hour per day on homework outside of school. Over a third did little or no homework in school. Almost two-thirds said they did not have a study hall at school. However, even with the Hide time spent on homework, only about a fifth said they went to class without their homework done. o In 1990, of the original 1988 sample, 89% in tenth grade, 4% in another grade, and 7% not in school. In addition to the 7% who were known not to be in same school system at the time of the survey, 1% of the others had dropped out at least once before but had returned to school. Three percent dropped out during the spring term of 1989; 2% dropped out during the fall of 1989; and 2% dropped out during the spring of 1990 before the survey was taken. o There was a good deal of diversity in the characteristics of dropouts. Although some characteristics such as being old for one's grade showed higher proportions of dropouts, some youth with each of the study variables dropped out of school. Both boys, 11%, and girls, 10%, dropped out of school. Although youth from backgrounds other than European American were more likely to have dropped out of school, European Americans accounted for a high percentage of the dropouts. Those from lower socio-economic status families were more likely to have dropped out than were others. Proficiency in language did not seem to be a factor in whether or not a student had dropped out of school. o A career-focused school program, school proficiency and ability to cope with tests seemed to he factors :elated to whether a student left school. Among the dropouts 66% were in the general program, 6% in a vocational program, and 1% in a college preparatory program. Although some of the boys and girls who dropped out showed excellent ability on the NELS tests, many did not do well and showed problems in reading and/or math proficiency. Although slightly more students with a low self-concept than wtth a high self-concept dropped out of school, both groups were found. Dropouts included both those with internal and those with external loci of control. However, those with low scores (more externally controlled) were more likely to drop out than were those with high scores. There did not seem to be substantial differences between the hourly earnings of the dropouts and those who had worked part time while they were in school. o All except 2% of the tenth graders said they thought they would graduate from high school. Most were very sure they would do so. Most thought they would graduate in two more years. Most tenth graders thought they would continue their education after high school. About three-fifths were very sure they would continue. Almost four-fifths of the tenth graders expected to complete at least two years of schooling beyond high school. Over half expected to graduate from college, and within that total, more than one in ten expected to earn a master's degree or equivalent and more than one in ten expected to earn a doctorate or equivalent. About three-fifths of the tenth graders expected to go on to college right after high school. Some expected to watt a year or more, and some didn't know when they would go to college. Most tenth graders thought their parents wanted them to graduate from high school and to continue their schooling beyond high school,. Over half thought their parents expected them to complete college. Somewhat more than a third thought their friends expected them to go to college. Over half thought the school counselor or a favorite teacher expected them to do so. o Over half of the respondents indicated that availability of specific courses, academic reputation, and availability of financial aid were very important in their choice of a college. Religious environment and being able to live at home, each rated very important by one in ten, were the least important. Less than half said that a low crime environment was an important factor. o About a fifth did not know what they expected to do immediately after high school. Less than one in ten said they were not planning to work right after high school. One in ten mentioned each of the three most frequently indicated occupations: clerical, military, and professional. Although there were varied responses in terms of occupation at age thirty, the largest number, four out of five, expected to be in some kind of professional position. This would be consistent wtth the large percent that expected to graduate from college. o Although some saw little difference between their experiences in eighth and in ninth grade, almost three-fourths thought the courses were harder. Over half thought that teachers were stricter, and school rules were more strictly enforced. Only about one-fifth said it was harder to make friends or that they felt more alone their freshman year. o Almost all of the students gave help in getting a job as the main reason they went to school. The next most frequent response, more than four out of five, was a place to meet friends. Many students said they went to school because they got a feeling of satisfaction from doing what they were supposed to in class, and thought the subjects they were taking were interesting and challenging. Teachers caring and expecting them to succeed was indicated by almost three-fourths of the tenth graders wtth 15% strongly agreeing with the statement. Somewhat less than a thiru said that they went to school because they had nothing better to do. o Although most tenth graders thought their friends saw completing high school as very important, only about half thought their friends saw attending classes regularly, continuing education beyond high school and getting good grades as very Important and only something over a third said their friends thought studying was very important. o Most tenth graders thought the follOWing behaviors as never okay: use drugs at school; abuse teachers physically; steal from school, students, or teachers: drink alcohol on the school grounds; destroy school property; or bring weapons to school. At the other extreme, more than half said it was okay at least rarely to talk back to teachers, copy someone else's work, and be late for school. Most tenth graders thought it was okay to work hard for good grades, ask challenging questions, solve problems using new and original ideas, and help other students with their schoolwork. o Most students saw their school as a place where people got along well with each other and that teaching was good. Over three-fourths of the tenth graders agreed that students made friends across ethnic lines, teaching wes good, and teachers were interested in students. Even though most thought that teaching was good, some felt teachers were not Interested in them, did not praise them enough, or put them down. Even though students thought that students got along well together, many said that other students often disrupted class and 40% said that the disruption affected their learning. Although about half said that studr nts got by with misbehaving, seven out of ten said that discipline was fair and two-thirds thought their school had strict rules. Most felt there was a good spirit at school and very few thought their school was unsafe. o Although both parochial and private schools were represented, four out of five students in this survey attended public schools. There was considerable variation in class and school size. About one in three attended a school with fewer than 300 tenth graders. Somewhat more than one in ten attended a school with more than 550 tenth graders. The average (mean) total school enrollment was between 1,000 and 1,199 students. About one in ten tenth graders attended a school with fewer than 400 students. About one in twenty attended a school with 2,500 or more students enrolled. o There was considerable diversity in the courses that tenth graders had taken since they entered high school. Almost all had taken one or more English, science, mathematics, and history courses. Almost two-thirds had taken a foreign language course. Fewer had taken other humanities courses. Most had taken physical education courses. Almost half had taken a typing or word processing course. About a fourth had taken one or more other vocational or technical courses. Relatively few, less than 10%, had taken advanced or specialized courses. o Three-fourths said they used calculators in mathematics classes. Somewhat less than a third said that they often used story problems in math classes. About a fourth said they often had to orally explain their mathematics work to the class. More than three-fifths said that they rarely or never did the following things in mathematics classes: use computer in math class, use books other than texts, or use materials or models. o The majority of tenth graders primarily saw mathematics, science,and vocational classes emphasizing facts, steps, and rules. About equal percentages saw science and vocational classes and considerably more saw math classes emphasizing problem solving. About three-fifths felt that the three subjects emphasized the importance of math and science in everyday life. o About three-Mths thought their science teacher and three-fourths thought their math teacher gave them at least moderate help In preparing for further studies in science or math. At least three-fifths, said that both mathematics and science teachers gave at least moderate emphasis to trying to Increase interest in these subjects. About three-fourths of the students thought vocational classes put at least moderate emphasis on skills that were immediately usable. Three out of five recognized that there was at least a moderate emphasis on the role of science and math In work and how ideas from these two fields were involved in the manipulation of physical objects. PART D: SUMMARY OF ANALYSIS ACROSS GROUPS Which variables showed the most difference in how tenth graders responded to questions? Which subjects showed the greatest differences?\nMore tenth graders thought others saw them as not athletic rather than very athletic. About half thought they were seen as somewhat athletic. The majority of students saw themselves as somewhat important. However, over one in ten thought others did not see them as important and two in ten thought others saw them as being very important."}, {"section_title": "OVERVIEW o", "text": "In total, the six main variables examined in this study, ethnicity, socio-economic status, family type, sex of student, urbanicity, and region and aan additional variable, former 4-H participation, showed little difference for more than three-fourths of the items examined. o Ethnicity and family type were clearly the two variables showing the most difference, followed by socio-economic status. Location as indicated by region and urbanicity seldom made a substantial difference in responses. Sex of student also showed few substantial differences. Ethnicity and family type did not always show the same percentages of substantial differences for each cluster and area. However, often they were higher than other variables. When family type, ethnicity, and socio-economic status were cross tabbed against each other, it was apparent that the three are closely but not completely interrelated."}, {"section_title": "MAJOR CONCLUSIONS o", "text": "Although there were substantial differences among tenth graders, these differences were seldom traceable primarily to a demongraphic characteristic. There appears to have been considerable homogenization across such variables of as place of residence, sex, and, to a lesser degree, ethicity and socio-economic status. o Many tenth graders were quite comfortable with themselves, their families, and their schools. Some, however, were experiencing problems. o Three areas which may be of special concern are the percent of tenth graders who had high future occupation aspirations and who were attending school primarily to get a job, but who were not in a school program likely to help them achieve those aspirations; the percent who were using substances; and the percent who had difficulty with the tests included in the study. Discussion related to specific findings is included in the last section of this report."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "What are tenth graders like? What are they experiencing at school? at home? What do they expect in their futures? How do they spend their leisure time? How similar are they nationwide?

Answers to these questions and others are available from a national study of tenth graders conducted by the Department of Education."}, {"section_title": "DATA SOURCE", "text": "This report is based upon the second survey in the NELS:88 study. The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) is the third in a series of longitudinal studies commissioned by the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics and was conducted by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) -A Social Science Research Center at the University of Chicago. Purpose. The NELS:88 study is designed to provide trend data about critical transitions experienced by students as they leave elementary or middle school and progress through high school and into college or their careers. Emphasis is placed on student learning, early and late predictors of dropping out, and school effects of students' access to programs and equal opportunity to learn. Underlying this study is a central thems that education in America must be understood as a lifelong process enmeshed in a complex social context. The eighth grade survey was the base year (1988) of this study. This report is from the 1990 survey when they were tenth graders. They were also surveyed in 1992 when the students were in the twelfth grade. The sample will be surveyed again in 1994 and 1996. Sample. The NELS:88 study used a two-stage stratified probability design to select a nationally representative sample of schools and students. The first stage selected 1052 participating schools from about 39,000 eligible public and private schools with eighth grades. Some schools such as overseas military schools and those operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs were excluded from the sample. The second sampling stage produced a random selection of 24,599 eighth grade students from these schools. The eighth grade sample represented the estimated 3,008,080 eighth graders who were in school in 1988. Hispanic and Asian or Pacirrc Islander students were oversampled to provide an adequate sample size for special analysis. Adiustr-.ent of the Sample for Tenth Grade Data Collection. The fact that the 1990 data collection had two purposes -1) cohort, following the same group over time and 2) cross-sectional, providing a valid probability sample of students enrolled in the tenth grade -resulted in changes in the sample. The sample of those for whom eighth grade data was available was reduced by natural means (death or leaving the United states) and subsampling. The sample was \"freshened\" for cross-sectional purposes by adding tenth graders from those schools attended by the eighth grade sample members. Again careful sampling procedures were used. See the National Center for Educational Statistics 1992 user's manual for details. The sample adjustment resulted in a final sample of 20,706 tenth graders and dropouts since the eighth grade. We have used the weights given to carry the sample to the total population. Tenth Grade Survey. The user manual for the tenth grade survey lists the following content categories in the 1990 student survey: home characteristics; family and friends; work status; opinions, attitudes and Analysis. The team working with the tenth grade data examined almost all of the questions in the survey first in terms of the main findings for each question. Secondly, we ran chi-square tables examining responses to each question according to six variables: ethnicity, socio-economic status, family type, sex of student, region and urbanicity. Because of the initial interest by 4-H and the funding from 4-H, responses were also examined in relation to participation in 4-H before or in the eighth grade. However, because the NELS data do not give information about the intensiveness or extensiveness of the 4-H data, there is a possibility that differences are related to differences in who took part rather than to a relationship between the topic and 4-H participation. We looked at the range across sub groups for each of the variables and used a ten percentage point difference as an arbitrarily defining a point where we thought difference was great enough to point out to readers. Our primary analytical purpose is that of determining the extent to which tenth graders are similar or different when standard demographic variables are examined. The main orientation of this analysis, however, is not that of emphasizing differences, but of helping the reader see that differences among tenth graders seldom are explained by demoaraphic characteristics. A second purpose is that of helping readers interested in youth with specific characteristics (such as African American, girls, or those from the central city) to see whether the subgroup differed from other subgroups substantially in their responses."}, {"section_title": "ORGANIZATION OF THIS REPORT", "text": "The tenth grade NELS:88 survey provided even more information than did the eighth grade study. It is difficult to organize it in a way that will suit users who want different degrees of detail. The report is even more complex because we are trying trN share two kinds of information with you: 1) the \"face responses\" or responses to a variety of questithS by the whole group of respondents 2) range in percentages when examined by key demographic variables. We have organized the report in this way to assist those readers who want some information in all areas and those who want detailed information in a few areas. Section I: INTRODUCTION. This first section introduces the study. Part II: OVERVIEW. The second section has two parts. First there is a narrative summary, Part A. Page numbers in parentheses will guide you to more detail in later sections. Second, there is a listing of the lead findings that are emphasized in Section III, Part B. Section III: SPECIFIC FINDINGS. The third section gives detail on each of the major findings including tables showing the variables which yielded a difference across ranges of 10 or more percentage points."}, {"section_title": "WHERE TO START", "text": "This report is too complex to try to read from cover to cover. We suggest that you concentrate on the Summary in Section II. Refer to Section B of Part II and Part III only for those things where you want more information. Pages are numbered separately for ease in referring across the document."}, {"section_title": "CAUTION", "text": "We realize that some readers are looking for general statements about areas where differences do or do not exist related to a specific topic of the survey. For simplicity's sake, we have used such statements in this report. However, as we worked with the data, we soon found that simpie statements of difference were often misleading because, regardless of the fact that differences existed among nine groups, a fairly sizeable percentage of each group held the trait that we were examining. For example, although when compareo with European Americans, a disproportionate percentage of Asian American and and Hispanic American tenth graders' families were in the lowest socio-economic quartile, it is important to remember that a percentage of those ethnic groups also was in the highest quartile. Almost two-thirds of the Hispanic American tenth graders were of Mexican, Mexican-American, or Chicano heritage. One in live of the Asian American tenth graders was of Filipino heritage. Somewhat less than one in five was of Chinese heritage. There was a marked difference in socio-economic status according to ethnic background. The range in percent in the lowest socio-economic status quartile was from 16% of the Asian Amer; ans to 53% of the H;spanit., Americans. The range in the highest quartile was from 7% of Native Americans to 35% of Asian Americans. All ethnic groups were found in the three urbanicity groups. However, the range in percent living in suburban areas (metropolitan not central city) was from 42% of African Americans to 60% of European Americans. There was substantial difference across regions in the distribution of ethnic groups with 50% of the Asian-American and 44% of the Hispanic-American tenth graders living in the Western region and 64% of the African-American tenth graders living in the South. Family Type (247) (3-8) Somewhat less than two-thirds of American tenth graders live with both of their original birth or adoptive parents. Slightly under 15% lived with one parent and a stepparent. About one in five lived with only one parent. A few, 2%, lived with someone other than a parent. From 37% of African-American to 80% of Asian-American tenth graders were living with both birth or adoptive parents. The percent only living with their mother ranged from 2% of Asian Americans to 39% of African Americans. About a third of those IMng with their father but not with their birth or adoptive mother were facing adjustment to a relatively new marital situation on the part of their parents. Most of those who were living with someone other than their parents lived with one or more grandparents or one or more other adult relatives. Among those who indicated they were living with someone other than a parent, 45%, indicated that one or more grandparents were In their household (9% one; 35% two). Over half, 54%, indicated living with another relative over 18 (35% one; 18% two; 10% three; 1% four). The range in percent of family types in the lowest socio-economic status quartile was from 19% of those living with both parents to 39% of those living with someone other than either parent (mother only, 34%). The range in the highest socio-economic status quartile was from 12% of those living with someone other than a parent to 32% of those living with both parents (mother only 14%). There was considerable less variation by location of family types. Over half of each family type lived in the suburbs. The range in the percent living in the central city was from 21% of those living with their father only to 36% of those living with their mother only. A disproportionate number of mother-only families were in the South."}, {"section_title": "LANGUAGE (2-38) (3-11)", "text": "Approximately one-fifth of the tenth graders lived in a home where a language other than English was spoken. The range was from 7% of European American to 76% of Asian-American and 82% of Hispanic-American tenth graders. Among those from a second language home, only somewhat more than half indicated that the language was Spanish. A wide variety of languages were listed including French, Italian, German, and Polish. For slightly over half, the other language had bean the first learned language and one in which the tenth graders considered themselves to be fluent. English, however, was used in half of the homes when the tenth graders discussed homework or other school work with their parents. Among those who Indicated another language, the percentages saying they handled ft well or very well were as follows: understand it, 90%; speak it, 82 %; read It 62%; write it, 53%. Half thought others saw them as somewhat important. Two in ten thought they were seen as being very important and one in ten thought others saw them as not important. Somewhat more thought they were not seen as popular as thought they were seen as very popular. The majority, seven out of ten, thought others saw them as somewhat popular.

Three-fourth felt they had enough control over their own lives. Most tenth graders said they could make their plans work. About a fourth said that something or someone stopped them when they tried to get ahead; a fifth felt that their plans did not work out, but eight out of ten said that their plans usually worked out. When the responses were combined into a locus of control Index and divided into quartiles, socio-economic status appeared to make a difference in how some tenth graders responded.

It is to be noted that sex of student showed no differences related to availability of various extracurriculuar activities at the school attended. Three-fourths of the tenth graders took part in at least one activity. The average student took part in either one or two school activities. Almost half took part in some sport at school. The most frequently indicated team sport was basketball with one tenth grader out of five saying they took part. One in four took part in one of the individual sports such as track. Slightly more than half took part in an activity other than sports. About a fourth took part in two or more activities other than sports. There was considerable variation in the activities selected; ranging from 3% taking part in pom-pom or drill team to 30% taking part in some school club.

NONSCHOOL ACTIVITIES (2-42)  The leisure image projected of youngsters 16 or 17 is one of constant interaction with their friends. The NELS survey supported that image. Most teens spend their leisure time in activities that involve nonguided social interaction with others. The four most frequently indicated daily activities (every day or almost every day) all Involved social action. Three-fifths talked with friends on the telephone every day or almost every day. Twice as many indicated talking on the phone with friends as indicated doing things with their parents. However, more tenth graders indicated doing something with their parents almost daily than Indicated hanging out or going for a ride with friends. Tenth graders were diverse in their nonschool activities. Relatively small percentages took part In any one of the other specific activities included in the questionnaire. However when activities were clustered, fairiy sizeable percentages took part in at least one activity of a particular type. Somewhat more than two-thirds spent at least some of their free time in nonschool sports activities. Three-fourths engaged in at least one of the survey's three solo activities -reading for pleasure, working on hobbies, or eng a computer. About a third took some kind of nonschool lesson or class. Somewhat less than half took part in one of the three guided group activities Included In the survey -religious activities, youth group or recreation program, or community service practice. About one in five said they sometimes did some community service. Overall, about a fifth of the comparisons, 22%, showed substantial differences. All of the variables showed at least one substantial differences across ranges.

Tenth graders were divided in terms of whether they believed partying and taking part in sports were important. The greatest percentage said partying was somewhat important. Equal percentages, about a fourth, said not important and very important. The greatest percentage, 44%, also said sports were somewhat important, but more said they were very important, 37%, than said they were not important, 27%.

Only 4% indicated taking part in four or more. The percentage had decreased since eighth grade. In that survey three-fifths indicated participating in one or more athletic activities (nearly half participated in varsity sports and 43% in intramural sports). The greatest difference in sports participation came in relation to socio-economic status with 34% of tenth graders from families in the lowest quartile taking part in sports as compared with 63% of those from the highest quartile. Hispanic Americans were least likely and European-American tenth graders were most likely to take part in at least one sport. Southern tenth graders were least likely and North Central tenth graders were most likely to take part in at least one sport. The percent of girls and the percent of boys taking part in at least one sport remained about the same in the eighth grade (girls 42%; boys, 54%) and tenth grade (girls, 43%; and boys 55%).

Percentages for some sports such as swim team and soccer would have been higher if the latter method had been used.) The greatest difference related to participating in any one of the sports was the difference of 26 percentage points between the percent of girls and percent of boys taking part in football. Native Americans were least likely and African Americans were most likely to take part in football. The greatest number of differences, three, related to variables appeared for individual sports (tennis, gymnastics, track and field, etc.). Those from the lowest socio-economic status, 17%, were least likely and those from the highest status, 32%, were most likely to take part in individual sports. Hispanic Americans were least likely and Asian Americans were most likely to take part in specific sports activities.

There were substantial differences in the number of non-sports activities related to six of the seven variables examined, and the seventh, region, showed a difference of seven percentage points in the range. The greatest difference came in relation to socio-economic status. Somewhat more than two-fifths of those in the lowest SES quartile had taken part in at least one activity other than sports as compared with 74% of those in the highest quartile. Hispanic Americans were least likely and Asian Americans were most likely to have taken part in other extracurricular activities. Boys were less likely to take part in activities in the tenth grade than girls. Urban tenth graders were somewhat less likely to take part in any school activity other than sports than were rural tenth graders. The greatest difference in taking part in four or more activities was six percentage points which appeared related to ethnicity.\nSomewhat more than two-thirds of the tenth graders spent at least some of their leisure time in sports activities.

This was the only variable that showed a difference in relation to rarely taking part in active sports. Family type, urbanicity, and sex of student showed differences related to rarely or never going to the park, gym, or pool.

Three items, going to local hangout, riding around, and talking on the telephone, provided indicators of tenth graders' use of leisure for interacting with their peers. The frequency with which tenth graders said they engaged in various peer activities were as follows: visit with friends at local hangout: rarely or never, 17%; less than once a week, 17%; once or twice a week, 42%; every day or almost every day, 24%; drive or ride around alom or with friends: rarcly or never, 25%; less than once a week, 19%; once or twice a week, 34%; every day or almost every day, 23%; talks on ohOne with friends: rarely or never, 9%; less than once a week, 11%; once or twice a week, 20%; every day or almost every day, 60%.

PART 0 Summary of Analysis Across Groups  In total, the six variables examined in this study, ethnicity, socio-economic status, family type, sex of student, urbanicity, and region showed little difference for more than three-fourths of the items examined. However, almost two out of five of the comparisons, 39%, which examined ethnicity or family type showed differences across subgroups of 10 or more percentage points. The fewest differences, 5%, appeared for comparisons examining differences related to urbanicity. One cluster, school performance, showed considerably more substantial differences, 41%, than did other clusters. One area, NELS test scores, showed considerably more substantial differences, 68%, than did other areas. Few individual items showed large differences. At the other extreme, only 3% of the comparisons of expected occupations (cluster: future) showed substantial differences related to the variables. Few individual items showed large differences.

How much do they differ? This was the major focus of our study. This section presents all of the answers for each question from all respondents. In addition it includes tables showing which variables showed substantial differences."}, {"section_title": "DETERMINING SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES", "text": "With the NELS data weighted to represent all tenth graders, we ran tables to identify the percent of tenth graders in various subgroups who responded to questions In certain ways. We tabled each part of a question against each of the following variables: o ethnicity o socio-economic status o family type o sex of student o urbanicity o region o having participated in 4-H at some time We examined each table and identified the highest and lowest percent responding to an item and subtracted to get the range across subgroups. We then arbitrarily decided upon a difference of 10 percentage points as showing a substantial difference. We have included all items which showed this amount of difference in the tables in this section. Ten percentage points may look like a lot to some readers, or very little to other readers. We chose 10 percentage points because it gave more differences at that level than would be found if we had taken a larger difference. On the other hand, often the difference in the percent responding to the answers to a question showed a much greater difference than ten percent. For example a much larger percentage agreed with a question than disagreed and the difference between the two responses was much greater than the difference in the percent agreeing according to a particular characteristic such as ethnicity. 4-H is included in the table but not mentioned in the narrative, in part because we suspect that the differences which show up are, in most instances, not due to 4-H participation, but are due to other characteristics of respondents. The differences usually are not between those who were members and those who were not, but often involve a group who said they were in 4-H but whose parents did not indicate that they had been when asked in the eighth grade survey."}, {"section_title": "PURPOSE OF DISCUSSION SECTIONS", "text": "The discussion comes primarily from the senior author who has relatively little connection with tenth graders. Thus it is one person's opinion and not intended to be a definitive statement. Similarities are fully as important as differences. As we finish this report, it is very clear that here, as in the eighth grade data, there are some differences related to some of the variables, but there are many similarities. The amount of similarity, regardless of gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status and family type, is important. o When there are substantial differences it is tempting to make sweeping statements. In some cases, based on the arbitrary cut off point, it is accurate to say, \"girls were more likely than boys,\" or \"Asian Americans were more likely than European Americans.\" We use such statements to catch the reader's attention. However, in many cases, although technically true, the statements are misleading if you infer that the differences are great. Be sure to check the amount of difference as given in the table and form your own conclusion as to whether you should emphasize or ignore the difference. o In the eighth grade report, we used the terms Black and White for the two main ethnic groups. However, by the time we started this report it was clear that the predominant preference was for African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American. We chose to call the group that had been called White in our eighth grade report European American to make all groups parallel when referring to ethnic background. We realize that other authors continue to use white or Caucasian. o Although the NELS study team uses the term mother and male guardian or father and female guardian, we use stepparent although in some cases the other adult may not legally be a stepparent. o The NELS survey included information in many areas. It appeared to be combining several studies into one data base. As a result you may not find the depth of information that you would like on any given area. o A variable that did not produce the arbitrarily assigned substantial differences will be mentioned in the narrative oniy at times if the absence of the difference seems to have special implications. For example, region and urbanicity seldom show differences of 10 percentage points. Rather than repeatedly saying that they do not show substantial differences related to the specific topic, we usually will not mention them in the text. Finally, treat this section as a reference to be explored in bits and pieces as your interest takes you into various areas. The NELS swveys have such a wealth of information that this section is too complex to be read in one sitting. o Check the table of contents that follows to locate those parts that are of most interest to you.

The percentages according to birth year were 1972 or before, 6%; 1973, 32%; 1974, 61%; 1975 or after, 1%. The eighth grade survey found that 63% of the sample had been born in 1974. In that analysis age differences of 10 or more percentage points appeared in relation to ethnicity, socio-economic status, family type, and sex of student. Almost half, 48%, of the Native American tenth graders had been born before 1974 as compared with less than a third, 32%, of the Asian Americans. Over half, 52%, of tht-Jse in the lowest socio-economic status quartile had been born before 1974 as compared with 25% of those in the highest quartile. Over half, 52%, of those living with someone other than a parent were older than in 1990 as compared with 32% of those living with both parents. More boys, 42%, were born before 1974 than were girls, 30%.\nAlmost three-fifths of tenth graders chose someone 16-19 as their most admired person. Somewhat more than one in ten, 12%, chose someone under 16 years of age. Slightly more 14% chose someone to 25. About one in five chose someone years of age or older. (However, in the majority of instances, 13% from 17%, the individual was one of their parents). It would appear that relatively few were thinking of news or older entertainment figures when they answered the question about characteristics. The only age group which showed a substantial difference appeared related to friends, 16-19, and family type. Those living with someone other than their parents were least likely and those living with their father and stepmother were most likely to Indicate this was the person most admired. Discussion: It is of interest to note that tenth graders when asked to indicate the person they most admired, young or adult, chose people close to them rather than musicians, television stars, sports figures or statespersons. In general, most adults will be pleased with the percentages for most and least chosen characteristics. It is heartening to think that tenth graders both admire such characteristics and are able to see them in their friends and relatives.\nRelatively few of those who were 15 or 16 at the time of the study had dropped out of school. Over a third of those who were eighteen or older in 1990 had left school without completing the tenth grade.

On the ot ar hand, because 18 year olds (birth year 1972) made up only 6% of the total sample, when one looks at the birth years of those who dropped out t.he highest percentage was 17 years of age.

Income information was not included with the eighth grade data file. Parent's Education There was considerable range in the amount of schooling that the parents of the tenth graders had completed. More than one in ten had at least one parent with a graduate degree. At the other extreme, one in ten tenth graders had parents who had not completed high school. The percentages according to the highest level of education held by either parent were as follows: less than high school, 11%; high school graduate or GED but no further education, 21%; some schooling beyond high school, 40%; college graduate, 14%; Master's degree, 9%; Ph.D., M.D or equivalent, 4%; don't know, 4%.

The percentages according to ethnic background were as follows: European Americans, 72%; African Americans, 13%; Hispanic Americans, 10%; Asian Americans, 4%; and Native Americans, 1%. Fan* Type We chose to use family type as one of the variables examined in this study. In the eighth grade analysis, we found that many of the substantial differences were between youngste. s who were living with both natural or adoptive parents and those who were living with someone other than either parent. Because the NELS team apparently had not updated their variable, we developed a new family type variable for our analysis of the tenth grade data.\nWith A Sibling About one in ten tenth graders (brothers, 10%; sisters, 11%) said that they didn't get along with one or more siblings (including step-or half brothers or sisters.) Neither family type or any of the other variables yielded substantial differences in ranges across subgroups. With Other Famiy Members A very few, 2%, said they could not get along with their grandparents, and a few more, 6%, said they could not get along with other relatives. There were no substantial differences related to any of the variables and getting along with a grandparent. Substantial differences appeared in the ethnicity subgroups in relation to getting along with other relatives. With Whole FarnOy Almost two-thircis, 63%, said they got along with all the people in their famiy. There was a substantial difference in the range when responses were examined by family type. The lowest percentage saying they got along with their whole family was 46%, found for those who lived with someone other than a parent. The highest was 69% of those who lived with both parents. Substantial differences also appeared related to ethnicity and socio-economic status. Native Americans, 49%, were least likely and Asian Americans, 66%, were most likely to say they got along with everyone in their family. Those from the lowest socio-economic status quartile were least likely and those from the highest quartile were most likely to say they got along with everyone in their family. Discussion: It was clear that there Is considerable diversity in the extent to which tenth graders and their parents understood each other. Responses seemed to be affected by specific situations rather than the broader context variables. It is this diversity built upon differences in interpersonal relations within families which makes it difficult for outsiders to know when a youngster is having difficulty with his or her parents, and how these difficulties may be affecting school or leisure activities. Literature about families often indicates tensions between a maturing teen and parents are likely to occur. It is reassuring to see the high percentage of tenth graders who did not see such tensions as serious enough to indicate that they disliked a birth (or adoptive) parent or could not get along with a parent. However, the fact that the majority of families can take such tensions in their stride may make it all the more difficult for the youngster who has a major problem in relating to one or both parents (birth, adoptive, step, or foster). While youngsters living with a father and stepmother were most likely to express difficulty it was reported by some teens from all backgrounds and family types. Those working with youth and their families may want to offer classes, coping strategies, etc. for teens, parents, stepparents, and new families. It is also of concern that about one third of the tenth graders were somewhat unsure that their parents were comfortable with how they were developing. Some thought their parents were disappointed and others thought that their parents did not feel proud of them. These kind of responses could reflect parents actual feelings or could reflect insecurity on the teens part. However, they were also likely to indicate problems in that parents may not have communicated positive feelings or may have used, \"I'm disappointed in your, so frequently the teen cannot see the love and pride that may be there.\nSubstantiai differences appeared with family type relating to decision making by the parent alone and to joint discussions (three middle responses). Socio-economic status also related to the joint decisions. Two-thirds '-f the tenth graders from the highest socio-econorric quartile said that their parents discussed this decision with them as compared with half of those from the lowest quartile. Differences in the percent making their own decisions were not substantial, the most being about 6% of those living with two parents. \nThe second finding that is of concern is the low percentage of ninth and tenth grade students who had taken a vocational class. Although the eighth grade survey only included five vocational courses, there is little evidence that the majority of tenth graders had had sufficient vocational courses in grade school that such courses were not needed in high school. If other courses were preparing students with basic ideas about the place of work in their lives, the fact that many had not taken a vocational course may be less important. However, if there were a tendency for high schools to concentrate on the college bound with little attention to the future life of those who were not headed for college, this could be a major problem. It was apparent from the combined eighth and tenth grade data that 4-H, Scouts, and other nonschool youth programs may need to make adjustments in their programs. They should teach basics of family IMng, shop, and other skills needed in everyday home maintenance so that they are more attractive to youngsters, in that schools seem to be paying little attention to these areas. The third finding which has special implications both for schools and for nonschool programs is the relatively low percentage of young people who had taken a high school (or even an eighth grade) course in one of the expressive arts. Such courses as Music, Art, Drama, Speech, help youngsters learn to express their feelings, increase creativity, and set the basis for life long leisure activities. Because a good many young people do not get experiences in the expressive arts In school, it may be especially important that nonschool youth programs provide opportunities in these areas."}, {"section_title": "Number of Parents", "text": "Somewhat less than two-thirds of American tenth graders live with both of their original birth or adoptive parents.

In response questions about polentially disruptive events which will be presented in the next section, over a third of those living with their father and a stepmother said that a parent had married during the last two years. Almost as many, 30%, living with their father only said that their parents had been divorced or had separated during the past two years. Other Relatives Most of those who were living with someone other than their parents lived with one or more grandparents or one or more other adult relatives. Among those who indicated they were living with someone other than a parent, 45%, indicated that one or more grandparents were in their household (9% one; 35% two). Over half, 54%, indicated living with another relative over 18 (25% one; 18% two; 10% three; 1% four). Because parents' siblings were not asked about, it is likely that these adults were aunts and/or uncles. In sorrvi instances the household might have included one or more grandparents and one or more aunts and/or uncles. Tenth graders living with at least one parent were much less likely to ha e a grandparent in their household. The percentages of households including a grandparent according to family *ype were as follows: both parents, 4%; mother and stepfather, 3%; father and stepmother, 6%; mother only, 8%; father only 6%.

Another very important area related to this section is that of family type. With, on the average, two of every five tenth graders living in a family pattern other than both natural or adoptive parents, those working with youth of this age must be sensitive to and acceptant of diverse patterns.

However, recent (1994) news releases indicated that the percen: of children going with their father with or without a stepmother is increasing. A second point to be considered by those who are working with this age group, is the time distance from the point in which a new family type occurred. Tenth graders who have been living with one parent either alone or with a stepparent for several years have had more time to adjust to that situation than has the tenth grader who is facing a new situation either because of divorce or remarriage of the primary parent or because of the death of a parent. Reasons Why Family Type May Show Differences in Responses to Questions Throughout the Survey. The finding throughout this report of differences in fesponses to questions of 10 or more percentage points across the range in family type may be completely due to the structure of the family. in some instances the difference may be related to ethnicity which is reflected in family structure, or it may be related to socio-economic status."}, {"section_title": "\"", "text": "Another reason why family type may show differences is that the number of respondents for the different family types are greatly different. Only 3% of the respondents live with their father only and 2% live with someone other than their father compared with the large numbers who live with both parents or even the 20% who live with their mothers oniy. However, it is also to be noted that about a third of the tenth graders who are living with their father only may not be completely reconciled to a new situation in that about a third indicated a change in the marital status of their parent(s) had taken place within the past two years. Also, more boys than girls lived with their fathers.\n4. 0 Percent Dropped Out From 7% to 8% of the eighth graders in the study had dropped out of school before the tenth grade. Among the reconstructed sample of 20,706, 85% were enrolled in the tenth grade, 3% in another grade, and 12% could not be shown to be in school. When weighted with corrections made for over sampling, the percentages were 89% in tenth grade, 4% in another grade, and 7% not in school. In addition to the 7% who were known not to be in school at the time of the survey, 1% of the others had dropped out at least once before but had returned to school. Three percent dropped out during the spring term of 1989; 2% dropped out during the fall of 1989; and 2% dropped out during the spring of 1990 before the survey was taken. Information apparently was secured from enough of the sample so that among 17,959 students for whom complete information was available, 5% were dropouts. The data in this section are based on information from dropouts that was included in the main data base. The separate tape providing dropout data was not available at the time this analysis was done."}, {"section_title": "LANGUAGE", "text": "Approximately one-fifth of the tenth graders lived in a home where a language other than English was spoken. For slightly over half the other language had been the first learned language and one In which the tenth graders considered themselves to be fluent. English, however, was used in half of the homes when the tenth graders discussed homework or other school work with their parents. There were substantial differences in ethnicity, socio-economic status, family type, and region in relation to understanding, speaking, reading, and writing English very well for the tenth graders. Other Language Almost one tenth grader in five lived in a home where a language other than English was spoken. The range was from 7% of European-American tenth graders to 76% of Asian-American and 82% of Hispanic-American tenth graders. However, among those from a second language home, only somewhat more than half indicated that the language was Spanish.

The same percent of eighth graders, 18%, said that another language was spoken in their home. Among the tenth grade group indicating that an additional language was spoken, 58% said the language was Spanish.

Among those who indicated another language, the percentages saying they handled it well or very well were as follows: understand it, 90%; speak it, 82%; read it 62%; write it, 53%. Language Used When Discussing Schoolwork. Even though another language was spoken in the home about half of the students said they usually talked to their parents about schoolwork in English. Students who indicated another language were asked how often they spoke with their parents in English about homework or other school work. The responses were as follows: do not discuss schoolwork, 13%; never in English, 11%; sometimes in English 15%; about half of the time in English, 11%; always or almost always in English, 50%.

In addition to ethnicity where there was a major difference, substantial differences in the percent of tenth graders indicating that another language was spoken in the home appeared related to region. The West hAthree times as many tenth graders from homes where a languaae other than English was spoken as was found in the North Central region. However, even in the North Central region which had the lowest percent, one in ten tenth graders came from a home where a language other than English was spoken. There were twice as many tenth graders whose parents spoke another language living in the central city rather than in a rural area. Still ten percent of those living in rural areas lived in homes where a language other than or in addition to English was spoken.

Again, those living with their father and a stepmother were most likely to say they spoke English very well. As eighth graders, 27% said they spoke English very well. Discussion: Ability to use English showed a marked difference over eighth grade responses. Either a) more youngsters had been here longer and as a result their ability to use English had improved rapidiy, b) special course work in grade school had paid off, c) more students realized they had to be proficient, or d) those who had trouble with the language had dropped out by the tenth grade. Those working with youth who are fortunate enough to know another language in addition to Englisi we a responsibility for helping those youngsters be bilingually proficient.

About a third felt useless at times or sometimes felt they were no good. About one in five said they had little of which to be proud. One in five indicated that they felt emotionally empty most of the time. When the statements were combined into a self-concept index and the group divided into quartiles, African-American tenth graders showed the highest percent in the highest quartile and the lowest percent in the lowest quartile.

The reverse held true for the highest tertile with 27% of the \u00b0iris and 40% of the boys showing high self-concept as measured by the statpment used in the survey. When the 1990 data was broken into quartiles, the range in relation to socio-economic status was three percentage points for the lowest quartile and nine for the highest quartile 'he differences between boys and girls were nine percentage points for the iowest quartile and six for thk. highest quartile. Only ethnicity showed a substantial difference in the 1990 responses. In 1988 ethnicity, socio-economic status and sex of students showed differences of 10 percentage points or more in the percent in the highest and lowest groups. However, the 1988 data was organized into thirds rather than quartiles. 19 Discussion: Perhaps the most encouraging finding is that the two years between eighth and tenth grades did not appear to reduce self-concept of this particular group of teens. Although relatively short as time goes, these years bring many experiences which could cause teens to be less satisfied with themselves. Although the majority of teens have positive self-concepts, those working with teens and with parents need to be aware that the fact that because so many are positive, this may make those who do not have positive self-concepts even more vulnerable. The consistency with which both African-American youth showed a higher percentage with higher self-concepts in both 1988 and 1990 is encouraging. Some may account for it by an assumption that African-American youth in general seem to respond most positively. However, societal changes may have been a large influence. The way in which African Americans are viewed by the broader society and the emphasis by Influentials that \"Black is Beautiful\" which grew with the Civil Rights movements of the 1960's may have established different postures on the part of the parents of these young people. Those children who were born in the 1970's grew up in an era with more positive modeling of African Americans on the media. The fact that about one in five agreed with the statement about emotional emptiness ahould be considered carefully. If the teens understood the statement in the way that you as a reader understands it, there may be cause for concern. The teen years traditionally have been a time for emotion and learning how to deal with emotion. To what extent has the heavy emotion portrayed by various forms of media affected the personal emotion of teens? If a feeling that it lacks cool to be emotional Is \"in\" with teens, what affect might peer pressure have both on teen emotionalism and on their response to this question? If the similarity of responses when the same teens were in eighth grade and now when they are in tenth grade is accurate data and not stimulated in some way by the wording of the questions, it would indicate that feelings about self may not change much during the early and mid-teens. That may mean that helping young people change their self-image may be difficult if left until this period in their life. However, the similarities between the total responses in the two years may mask increases and decreases in feelings of satisfaction on the part of individuals which might offset each other. It was not part of our purpose to examine the responses of individuals to determine how many increased or decreased their self-concept as measured by these particular items."}, {"section_title": "PERCEPTION OF OTHER STUDENTS' VIEWS", "text": "When tenth graders were given eight descriptors and asked to indicate the extent to which other students saw them as meeting the description, most chose to say that others saw them as somewhat meeting the descriptor rather than saying others saw them as very like the descriptor.

Discussion: These questions probably were not des'gned to describe a tenth grader but to give some indication of relationships with peers. How we interpret the information depends upon what we as readers value. For example, if we feel it is essentially for youth of this age to be interacting with others, then the finding that almost one in five did not feel ethers saw them as socially active or popular might be of concern. If we feel that \"status\" is important. then the one in three who did not feel they were viewed as athletic or of belonging to the leading crowd might be of concern.

Although there was little change in the percent agreeing with this statement from eicihth to tenth grade, fewer of the tenth graders strongly disagreed with the statement. The 1988 responses were as follow: strongly agree, 3%; agree, 9%; disagree, 47%; strongly disagree, 42%. Both family type and ethnicity showed substantial differences in the tenth grade responses. Those living with someone other than a parent were most likely to strongly disagree with the statement. African Americans were most likely and Native Americans were least likely to strongly disagree with this statement. In 1988 Native Americans, 21%, were most likely and European Americans, 10%, were least likely to agree or strongly agree with the statement.

The percentage responses to the statement, \"I don't have enough control over the direction my life is taking,\" were as follows: strongly agree, 5%; agree, 18%; disagree, 52%; strongly disagree, 25%. There was a slight increase in the percent who strongly disagreed with this statement since they responded as eighth graders. The eighth grade responses were as follows: strongly agree, 5%; agree, 15%; disagree, 47%; strongly disagree, 33%. The only substantial difference in the tenth grade responses was related to ethnicity. African Americans were most likely to strongly disagree with the statement. African Americans also showed the highest percent strongly disagreeing as eighth graders where the range was from Asian Americans 26% to African Americans 36%. In both years, ethnicity was the only variable that showed a difference of 10 percentage points or more. Stopped Slightly more than a fourth of the tenth graders agreed with the statement that something or somebody stopped them when they tried to get ahead. Only 15% strongly disagreed with the statement. The percentage responses of the tenth graders to the statement, \"Every time I try to get ahead, something or somebody stops me,\" were as follows: strongly agree, 4%; agree, 23%; disagree, 58%; strongly disagree, 1.

Among the tenth graders, those who lived with both parents were least likely and tho53 who lived with their fathers only were most likely to agree with this statement. Two of the statements dealt with the success of their plans. Most tenth graders said they could make their plans work. There were slight differences from their eighth grade responses.

The eighth grade responses showed a range from 21% of those in the lowest SES quartile to 35% of those in the highest quartile strongly disagreeing with this statement. A substantial difference also appeared in the eighth grade responses related to family type. Sure of Plans Most, four out of fNe, felt that their plans usually worked out. Only 3% strongly disagreed with the statement. The percentage of responses to the statement, \"When I make plans, I am almost certain I can make them work,\" were as follows: strongly agree, 15%; agree, 65%; disagree, 18%; strongly disagree, 3%. The only difference between eighth and tenth grade responses was a slight shift from strongly agreeing to agreeing.

Overall Control Socio-economic status and farnly type showed diffecences in the percent in the lowest and highest locus of control quartiles when locus of control scores were divided into quarties. Ethnicity showed a substantial difference related only to the percent in the lowest locus of control quartile. The tenth graders in the lowest socio-economic status quartile, those of Native-American heritage, and those living with their father and a stepmother showed more than a third in the lowest quartile. Over a third of the tenth graders in the highest socio-economic quartile were also in the highest locus of control quartile. Those living with both parents also showed a slightly higher percent in the top locus of control quartile. The eighth grade responses showed differences related to ethnicity and socio-economk-. status. Among the eighth graders the range in percent in the lowest socio-economic status quartile was from 20% of European American to 43% of Hispanic-American eighth graders, and from 23% of the highest to 45% of those in the lowest socio-economic quartile. The eighth grade percentages in the highest tertile of locus of control ranged from 24% of those in the lowest to 43% of those in the highest socio-economic quartile. Father only 17% to both parents 27% 10 Discussion: The finding that some eighth and tenth graders were likely to feel that chance and luck affected their lives and that they had less control over their lives is not surprising given the extent to which those factors which define socio-economic status have a definite negative effect upon many families and youngsters. For example, it is hard for some to understand that the number of low-skill jobs is disappearing and as a result why a family is thrown into dependency upon welfare or homelessness. Youngsters need to learn that for the most part they can control their own lives and affect what happens to them, but that sometimes chance and luck do indeed enter in. At one point in history experts in self-development may have encouraged greater internal control. Now there is some indication that the person who fairs best is the one who has a good blend of internal and external control."}, {"section_title": "Sett and Peers", "text": "This section is divided into the following parts: characteristics of current friends and companions, relationship with own and opposite sex, peers views of importance, and most admired person."}, {"section_title": "CURRENT FRIENDS AND COMPANIONS", "text": "Although teens make new friends as they progress through school, most, almost nine out of ten, kept some of the friends they had in eighth grade.

It also appears that most maintain at least some friends with young people their own age, although many do not limit themselves only to this age group. In general, it is thought to be advantageous for an adults to have friends of varied ages. One sign of growing maturity might be the span in the ages of friends.

Again, four out of the six variables showed substantial differences in the percent who said they had not cut any classes. The largest difference in percentage points appeared for ethnicity with Native Americans being least likely and Asian Americans being most likely never to have cut classes during the first half of the year. Those from the Western region were least likely and those from the South were most likely to never have cut classes. Family type also showed a significant difference. Those living with their father only were least likely and those living with both parents or someone other than their parents were most likely to say they never cut classes. Urban youngsters were least likely and rural youngsters were most likely to have never cut a class. None of the variables showed substantial differences in frequently cutting class. Eighth graders were asked how frequently they had cut or skipped classes in the previous four weeks. The responses were never or almost never 91%; less than once a week, 7%; at least once a week, 2%; and daily 1%. Differences in the time period asked about also makes it difficult to compare tenth grade responses to those made in eighth grade."}, {"section_title": "Selection", "text": "Tenth graders appeared to be selective in the activities they chose, and, as a result, fewer than haft indicated taking part in any one actMty.

The greatest differences appeared related to socio-economic status and living with someone other than either parent. There was a marked difference related to socio-economic status with over 80% of those in the highest quartile taking part in something as compared with less than 60% of those in the lowest SES quartile.

"}, {"section_title": "115", "text": "The 1988 survey found that 88% of the eighth graders took part in at least one school extracurricular activity and that 35% participated in four or more. It would appear that the percentage not participating in anything at school increased from 12% to 28% as the group moved from eighth to tenth grade. Among the eighth grade respondents, differences related to not participating in any activity did not reach 10 percentage points when each of the seven variables was examined. Differences in taking part in four or more activities appeared related to 4-H participation, socio-econornic status, and ethnicity. Time spent Those tenth graders who took part in school sponsored activities usually spent from one to four hours a week. Forty-one percent said they did not spend any time and 17% said they spent less than one hour a week. About a fifth, 19%, said they spent from one to four hours per week, 11% from 5 to 9 hours, 11% from 10 to 19 hours, and 2% said they spent more than 20 hours per week on extracurricular activities. The greatest amount of difference in the percent saying they did not spend any time appeared related to socio-economic status. Less than a fourth of those in the highest SES quartile said they spent no time in extracurricular activities as compared with over half of those in the lowest quartile. Family composition and ethnicity also showed differences. Somewhat more than a third of those living with both parents did not spend any time in school extracurricular activities as compared with over half of those living with their father and a stepmother. The greatest amount of difference in spending five or more hours appeared related to ethnicity and socio-economic status. The range in relation to ethnicity was from 6% of Asian-American tenth graders to 29% of European-American tenth graders saying they spent five or more hours per week in school activities. More than twice as many tenth graders in the highest (37%) as in the lowest quartile (15%) said that they spent more than five hours per week in school activities.

(These percentages are for all tenth graders regardless of whether a particular activity was available to them. Participation percentages for those attending schools offering the various activities would be higher.) Rather than activity increasing as the students moved into high school, it appeared that activity decreased slightly. The percent taking part in most school extracurricular activities in the tenth grade was slightly lower than the percentage found in the survey of the group when they were in the eighth grade. The eighth grade percentages were as follows: school academic club, 39%; school and/or orchestra, 23%; chorus or choir, 24%; vocational club, 4%; yearbook, 15%; newspaper, 12%; academic honor society, 13%; and student government, 13%. Participation by tenth graders in five of the nine extracurricular activities, school play/musical, student government, yearbook or newspaper, academic club, and hobby club, did not show substantial differences (10 or more percentage point difference in the range) related to the seven variables examined. Participation in vocational groups, Future Teachers, Future Homemakers, and Future Farmers of America, showed the greatest number of substantial differences and the difference which was the greatest. Urban tenth graders were least likely and rural youth were most likely to take part in such programs. Those in the Northeast were least and those in the South were most likely to take part in vocational clubs. Those in the highest SES quartile were least likely and those in the lowest quartile were most likely to do so. Boys and urban students were less likely to be taking part in music groups than were girls and rural residents. Native Americans were least likely and Asian Americans were most likely to be taking part in an honor society. African Americans and Hispanic Americans were least likely and Asian Americans were !lost likely to be taking part in a service club. Those from the lowest socio-economic quartile were least likely ard those from the highest quartile were most likely to be taking part in a service club. Those living with their father only were least likely and those living with someone other than either parent were most likely to be taking part in academic clubs. In general, with the exception of service clubs, high socio-economic status appeared to make more difference to taking part in sports than to taking part in other school extracurricular activities. An increase in the number of different team sports offered by school systems, the various levels of team sports offered, and the development of more individual sport activities appear to have kept about as many girls and boys involved in some form of sports activity in tenth grade as were involved in eighth grade. However, there appears to be a sizeable number of youth who have not yet found a sports activity which meets their ability and interest. Because maintenance of activities which provide a good deal of physical exercise is essential throughout life, nonschool youth programs and school systems may want to do more to encourage all youngsters to find an individual sport that they enjoy and can play at least moderately well. Almost half of the tenth graders were not taking part in other school activities. More should be done to encourage more boys, and more youngsters of all ethnic heritages to find at least one school actMty in addition to sports which they enjoy. In large school systems such participation helps the student meet others and feel more a part of the school. In those communities where it is not possible for all of the students who would like to take part In a specific kind of activity at school to do so, more attention should be paid by community groups to setting up short-term special activities in selected areas -whether they be drama, music, communication arts, or teams which utilize various subject matters like Olympics of the Mind. Ancither issue that needs to be addressed by both the school system and the community is the role that socio-economic status plays in who does and does not take part in sports and to some degree those who took part in other school extracurricular activites. School extracurricular activities, and similar activities offered in nonschool programs, can help youngsters learn to function in teams, help them increase their ability to use a variety of mental skills including problem solving and creativity, and can foster leadership and other characteristics they will need as they take their place in the workforce."}, {"section_title": "NONSCHOOL ACTIVITIES", "text": "The leisure image projected of youngsters 16 or 17 is one of constant interaction with their friends. The NELS survey supported that image. Most teens spend their leisure time in activities which involve nonguided social interaction with others. The four most frequently indicated daily activities (every day or almost every day) all involved social action. Three-fifths talked with friends on the telephone every day or almost every day. Twice as many indicated talking on the phone with friends as indicated doing things with their parents. However, more tenth graders indicated doing something with their parents almost daily than indicated hanging out or going for a ride with friends. Tenth graders were diverse in their nonschool activities. Relatively small percentages took part in any one of the other specific activities included in the questionnaire. However when activities were clustered, fairly sizeable percentages took part in at least one activity of a particular type. Somewhat more than two-thirds spent at least some of their free time in nonschool sports activities. Three-fourths engaged in at least one of the three solo activities -reading for pleasure, working on hobbies, or using a computer -included in the survey. About a third took some kind of nonschool lesson or class. Somewhat less than half took part in one of the three guided group activities included in the survey religious activities, youth group or recreation program, or community service practice. About one in five said they sometimes did some community service. Overall, about a fifth of the comparisons, 22%, showed substantial differences.

However, they were asked how their friends felt about the importance of being willing to party or get wild. Over a fourth, 28%, said not important; 44% said somewhat important; and 28% said their friends thought that being willing to party and get wild was very important. Family type showed some marked differences both related to not important and to very important responses. Those living with someone other than either parent were most likely to see partying as not important and least likely to see it as being very important. Those living with their father only showed the lowest percentage saying partying was not important, and the highest percentage, 50%, saying it was very important to their frnds. Sex of students also showed a substantial difference. Boys were less likely than girls to say that their friends saw partying and being wild as not important (22% to 34%) and were more likely to say that their friends saw such behavior as very important (23% to 33%). Substantial differences also appeared related to ethnicity. There was not a consistent pattern related to ethnicity.

However, most tenth graders were interacting fairly frequently with adults. The variables examined showed fewer differences than were found for interacting with peers. Although higher percentages indicated activities with their parents than with other adults, a fairly substantial percentage of tenth graders indicated frequent contact with adults other than their parents. The frequency with which tenth graders said they engaged in actMties with adults were as follows: does things with mother and/or father: rarely or never, 13%; less than once a week, 23%; once or twice a week, 35%; every day or almost every day, 29%; talks or does things with other adults: rarely or never, 27%; less than once a w9ek, 33%; once or twice a week, 30%; every day or almost every day, 11%. Rarely or Never. Somewhat more than a tenth of the tenth graders said they rarely or never talked or did things with their parents. This lack of activity did not seem related to any of the seven variables examined In the study. Only family type showed a sUbstantial difference, and that difference, 16 percentage points was lower than might be expected. The range was from 10% of those living with both parents to 26% of those living with someone other than either natural or adoptive parent saying that they rarely or never talked or did something with a parent. European-American youngsters, 25%, were least likely, and Asian-American tenth graders were most likely, 36%, to say they rarely talked or never did something with adults other than their parents. Daily or Almost Every Day. The variables that showed a substantial difference in the frequent talking with adults, was sex of student and family type. Boys were less likely than glrls to say they did something with a parent daily or almost every day. Those living with someone other than a parent were least likely and those living with both parents were most likely to say they did something with a parent daily or almost every day. \nTenth graders were divided in ter.is of whether they believed their friends thought playing in sports was important. The greatest percentage said somewhat important, with more saying very important than saying not important. Over a fourth, 27%, said their friends did not think it was important to take part in sports as compared to 44% saying somewhat important and 37% saying very important. Substantial differences appeared according to sex of students. Boys were somewhat more like:N./than girls to think their friends believed taking part in sports was important. However, many boys did not see this as important, and a fairly sizeable percentage of girls did feel their friends thought taking part in sports was important. Socio-economic status showed a substantial difference related in the percent not thinking sports was important, 20% of those in the highest quartile compared to 32% of those in the lowest quartile. In addition to sex of tudents, there were a substantial differences related to family type and ethnicity in the percent thinking their friends saw taking part in sports as very important. Tenth graders living with their father only were most likely to have friends who viewed sports as very important and those living with someone other than a parent were least likely to have friends who held this view. The range across ethnic groups was from 26% of Hispanic Americans to 41% of Native Americans thinking sports were very important. (Note that both African Americans and European Americans fall within that range and are not the groups that are most likely to think sports are very important.) Percentage Other Activities Most tenth graders also engaged in some solo activities, although they differend in the kind of activity. Some fook lessons. A few took part in church, or other organized youth programs.\nSomewhat over half of the tenth graders said that getting good grades was very important to them. Only about one in ten said that grades were somewhat or not Important. The percentages indicating various levels of importance of good grades were as follows: not important, 1%; somewhat important, 11%; important, 35%; very important, F Ethnicity, socio-economic status, and family type showed substantial differences in the percent saying that grades were very Important. It is to be noted that European Americans showed the lowest percentage, 49%, saying that grades were very important. Asian Americans showed the highest percentage, 66%. Even though those in the next-to-lowest quartile showed the lowest percentage and those in the highest socio-economic quartile showed the highest percentage saying that grades were very important to them, almost half of those in the next to lowest quartile, 49%, and half of those in the lowest quartile thought good grades were very important. Those living with their father only were least likely and those living with both parents were most likely to say that good grades were very important to them. Urban tenth graders were somewhat more likely to feel good grades were very important than were rural youngsters. Southern youngsters were most likely and North Central youngsters were least likely to say that getting good grades was very important to them. This question was not asked of eighth graders. North Central 47% to South 57% 10 Overall Grades C is not an average grade for tenth graders. Students recalled more A and B grades than they did C or D and below. The range in percent saying they got mostly A's and B's was from 34% In History to 40% in English. Only about a fourth of the tenth graders reported getting mostly C's or lower grades in the four basic subjects. The range was from of 21% in History to 28% in Math. The percentages reported by tenth graders were as follows: mostly A's and B's, Math, 36%; English, 40%; History, 34%; Science, 35%; mostly B's or B's and C's, Math, 34%; English, 35%; History, 28%; Science, 33%; mostly C or below, Math, 28%; English, 24%; History, 21%; Science. 27%. Fewer were earning A's and B's in tenth grade than had done so in grade schooi. In the eighth grade survey, from 63% to 69% said that they mostly earned A's or B's. Socio-economic status, ethnicity, and family type consistently showed substantial differences in relation to ades indicated by the tenth graders with the percentage point differences usually being slightly greater for socio-economic status. Those in the lowest quartile always showed the higher percentage with low grades and those in the highest quartile always showed the lowest percentage with low grades. The greatest percentage point difference appeared related to History. The tenth graders living with both parents consistently showed the highest percent with A's and B's and the lowest percent with C's and D's. Usually those living with someone other than their parents showed the lowest percent of high grades and the highest percent of low grades. The range in relation to ethnicity was always from Asian-American tenth graders with the lowest low grade percentage to Native-American tenth graders with the highest percent of low grades except in the case of History. There African-American tenth graders showed the highest percent with low grades. Ethnicity and socio-economic status also showed substantial differences in the eighth graders responses. Discussion: The impact of svcio-economic status, ethnicity, and family type on perceived importance of high grades and on the grades received should be thought provoking. As was seen in the characteristic section of this report, ethnicity and socio-economic status are closely linked with Asian-American and European American tenth graders being considerably more likely to be ir the higher socio-economic status quartiles than are those from other ethnic heritages. One wonders how much of the difference is cultural advantage and how much is socio-economic or a combination of the two? How much of it is the fact that parents' education is a component of socio-economic status and thus youngsters from the highest quartile are most likely to have parents who have completed more schooling, and help them see value In good grades? Or have biases toward the kind of experiences that those in the upper socio-economic class are most likely to have crept into the assignments and criteria on which grades are based? There may be many reasons for the definite difference that appeared in the data. The Issue is how can schools and nonschool programs help youngsters who may have one or more strikes against them to excel In school. One would have hoped that the difference related to socio-economic status would have disappeared by tenth grade. There are a variety of community programs and community resources which can help youngsters get some of the experiences which come naturally to those in the highest socio-economic quartile. However, not all communities have them and not all youngsters are able to take part in them. There are many things that either aren't In the NELS data set, or that we did not explore. For example, there was data cn whether the youngster took part In special programs which could be run against data on grades to see if those who had such experiences were more likely to have higher grades than were others. Some youngsters in each sub group received good grades and some received poor grades. For example, the range in percent of those in the lowest socio-economic quartile reporting grades of B or higher were 28% in Math, History and Science and 32% In English. At the opposite end of the continuum, the range In percent reporting low grades was from 33% with grades of C or below in English to 37% reporting such grades in History. The range in the percent of those in the highest socio-economic quartile who earned high grades was from 46% in Math to 56% in History. One also wonders about the grading system. Do teachers have to divide the group roughly into fourths and give different grades? Or if students do similar work can they all receive the same high (or low) grade? Another finding in this section that Is of interest is that, when all tenth graders are Included, there was very little variation in terms of specific grades across subjects. There might be differences within individual schools or differences for individual students. For example, a student might get A In one subject and C in another. But when all youngsters are considered nationwide, about the same percentage of students earn A grades in each of the four basic subjects. We spent a little time trying to build a composite set of grades for these students to know how many students were straight A. In the time we had to spend on the task, we were not able to come up with a composite with which we were comfortable. As a result, we are not able to identify what percent of tenth graders only receive high grades, and what percent only receive low grades."}, {"section_title": "Solo ActNities", "text": "Three-fourths of the tenth graders engaged in at 'east one of three solo actvities in their leisure hours. They were much more likely to work with hobbies or read for pleasure than they were to use a personal computer. About a fourth, 24% did not take part in any of the three; about a fourth, 27% took part in one; a third took part in two, and 16% invested their leisure in three solo activities. The percentages indicating frequency of taking part in three solo activities were as follows: reading for pleasure: rarely or never, 36%; less than once a week, 23%; once or twice a week, 23%; every day or almost every day, 18%; working on hobbies: rarely or never, 35%; less than once a week, 24%; once or twice a week, 26%; every day or almost every day, 15%; using a computer: rarely or never, 70%; less than once a week, 14%; once or twice a week, 10%; every day or almost every day,15%. The percent who did not take part in any of the three varied substantially with socio-economic status and family type and also with ethnicity. The percent taking part in all three varied substantially only with socio-economic status. It was clear that taking part in a solo-type activity was related to socio-economic status for some tenth graders. The range in percent saying they never or rarely did any of the three was from 16% of the lowest to 36% of the highest socio-economic quartile; conversely, the percent saying almost every day or daily was from 9% of the lowest to 27% of the highest socio-economic status quartile. Asian Americans were least likely and African Americans most likely to say that they rarely took part in these solo activities. Even though the comparison showed that as group the African-American tenth graders were least apt to participate, over 70% still indicated some use of at least one of the three solo activities. Rarely or never. When specific activities were examined, rarely using a personal computer in leisure hours showed the mcst differences with five of the seven showing differences of percentage points or more. The greatest difference came in relation to socio-economic status. The range was from 53% of the tenth graders from the highest quartile to 80% of those from the lowest quartile saying they rarely used a computer in their nonschool time. Asian Americans were least likely, 60%, and Hispanic Americans, 80%, were most likely to say they rarely or never used a computer as a leisure activity. Boys were less apt, 63%, and girls were most apt, 75%, to say they rarely or never did so. Tenth graders from the Northeast were least likely, 64%, and those from the South were most likely, 75%, to not use a computer. Those living with both parents were least likely, 67%, and those living with their father and a stepmother, 77%, were most likely to say they rarely or never used a computer as a leisure activity. Family type, sex of student and ethnicity showed differences in rarely reading for pleasure. Those living with someone other than either of their parents were least likely and those living with their father and stepmother most likely to say that they seldom or never read for pleasure. Girls were less likely, 30%, and boys were more likely, 43%, to indicate that they did not do so. Hispanic-American tenth graders were most likely and Asian Americans were least likely to indicate they rarely or never read for pleasure.

"}, {"section_title": "Lessons", "text": "Over two-thirds of the tenth graders did not take either of the two kinds of educational activities in the survey. Less than one in ten took both art, music, or dance classes and some kind of sports lesson. None of the seven variables showed substantial differences in the percent taking both lessons or classes. Socio-economic status showed the greatest amount of difference, 21 percentage points from highest to lowest quartiles, in the percent that never or rarely took part In these two educational activities. However, ethnicity and family type also showed differences. Asian-American youngsters were most likely and African-American youngsters were least likely to be taking some kind of class or lesson. Those living with someone other than either parent were most likely and those living with both parents were least likely to indicate they rarely or never took lessons or classes. The percentages of tenth graders according to frequency of taking lessons were as follows: music. art. dance class: rarely or never, 74%; kiss than once a week, 6%; once or twice a week, 9%; every day or almost every day, 11%; sports leswns: rarely or never, 81%; less than once a week, 6%; once or twice a week, 7%; every day or almost every day, 6%. It appeared that fewer tenth graders were taking lessons than had been taking lessons as eighth graders. When this group was in eighth grade the percentages taking specific kinds of lessons were as follows: sports, 25%; dance, 16%; computer, 11%; art, 8%; and other skills, 20%. Substantial differences appeared both in rarely taking classes and lessons in relation to socio-economic status. Those from the highest quartile were least likely and those from the lowest quartile were most likely to rarely or never take either lessons in the arts or sports lessons. Girls were somewhat more likely to be taking music, art, or dance lessons than were boys. It is to be noted that ethnicity, family type, region and urbanicity did not show differences related to rarely taking lessons or classes and that none of the variables showed substantial differences in the percentage saying they took such lessons daily or almost every day. Slightly less than hatf took part in one of the three other organized activities included in the list of possible uses of leisure time. Slightly less than half said that they sometimes took part in religious activities; about a third took part in a youth group or recreation program, and about one in five said they did some community service. The frequency with which tenth graders said they engaged in these activities were as follows: attends religious activities: rarely or never, 52%; less than once a week, 17%; once or twice a week, 28%; every day or almost every day, 3%; attends youth groups or recreation programs: rarely or never, 63%; less than once a week, 17%; once or twice a week, 18%; every day or almost every day, 2%; performs community service: rarely or never, 79%, less than once a week, 14%; once or twice a week, 6%; every day or almost every, day, 1%. The percent of tel ith graders taking part almost daily in all of the three showed no substantial differences when the seven variables were examined. However, the percent saying they never or rarely took part in any of the three showed substantial differences related to socio-economic status, family type, and ethnicity. The greatest difference again was in relation to socio-economic status. Those from the highest quartile were least likely, 32%, and those from the lowest status were most likely, 61%, to say they rarely or never took part in any of these three activities. Tenth graders living with both parents were least likely, 40%, and those living with their mother and stepfather were most likely, 61%, to indicate that they rarely or never took part in these activities. African-American tenth graders were least likely, 45%, and Native-American tenth graders were most likely, 60%, to say that they rarely or never took part in these actMties. The wording was not the same in the 1988 and 1990 surveys. The eighth grade survey only asked about religious groups and found that 34% of the eighth graders took part in religious groups. The tenth grade percentage is considerably larger but may take in activities that the eighth graders did not consider when responding to the question. It is also hard to make a firm comparison between eighth and tenth grade participation in youth programs. The eighth grade survey asked about specific groups and found the following: 19% in summer programs, 16% in hobby clubs, 15% in the YMCA/YWCA, 14% in Scouts, 11% In Boys or Girls Ciubs, and 9% in 4-H. It would appear that the percentage of young people taking part in some kind of community organized program decreased between eighth and tenth grades. Rarely or never. When the individual activities were examined, Socio-economic status showed substantial differences in rarely taking part in all three -religious activities (highest quartile 42% to lowest quartile 60%) and community service (highest quartile 72% to lowest quartile 84%). Ethnicity showed differences in rarely taking part in religious activities (African American 48% to Native American 65%) and rarely taking part in youth groups/recreation programs (European American 61% to Hispanic American 71%). Family type showed differences related to rarely or never taking part in religious activities (both parents 47% to father and stepmother 66%) and youth groups/recreation (other family 54% to father only 77%). Daily or almost every day. None of the variables showed substantial differences in the percentage who took part in the programs daily. Importance of Volunteering Almost three-frfths of the tenth graders believed that their peers thought it was not important to do community work or volunteer. Only 5% said their peers thought that volunteering and community service was very important; 59% said others viewed it as not important; 36% said somewhat important. There were substantial differences in the percent saying volunteering was not important related to ethnicity, socio-economic status, and region. European-American youngsters were most likely to not see volunteering as important and to show the lowest percentage thinking that volunteering and community service are very important. Discussion: One of the most important findings in this section is the verification that socially interactive activities which occur with little or no guidance from adults are extremely important to tenth graders. They are the activities that tenth graders engage in most frequently. However, it is also to be noted that a large number of tenth graders frequently interacted with their parents and with adults. Sometimes the media gives the image (or parents get a feeling) that this age is only interested in the teen culture and \"walls out\" adults. That does not seem to be true from the teens' perspective. This would Indicate that adults can successfully work with this age group in semi-organized church and community activities. Their role is to be a supportive background person who gives some guidance but is not upset when social interplay takes precedence over planning and other businesslike activities. There is a small minority of tenth graders in every socio-economic, ethnic, and family type group who are not very socially active. The lack of social interaction may come about for a variety of reasons ranging from shyness or poor self image to independence and complete engrossment in other activities. However, adults and older teens working with programs for this age may need to be particularly alert for those youngsters who have not built as good social skills as their peers and give them what help they can. Opportunity to take part in sports beyond those given in school is important for both girls and boys in this age group. The survey doesn't indicate whether the form of those opportunities should be programs which expect the individual to take part each week (similar to league play) or whether short, intensive opportunities are better (like state games programs where people come together in teams to practice and play in a tournament.) At first, data about the percent of tenth graders who are taking part in \"educational programs\" lessons, classes, Community service, youth and recreation programs, solo activities involving learning appears somewhat disappointing to those who believe that continued learning through community programs and resources is needed throughout one's life. But the percent that take part in some type of activity indicates that many tenth graders are making time for at least one of these kinds of learning activities. Adults and older youth may need to help the mid-teen explore interests sufficiently to find one or two which are likely to continue as lifelong learning endeavors."}, {"section_title": "REUGION", "text": "There was considerable variation among tenth graders in the extent to which they saw themselves as being religious and the extent to which they took part in church services.

Ethnicity showed the most substantial difference with Hispanic Americans being the least likely, 27%, and Native Americans most likely, 50%, to say that they were not a religious person. Those from the South were least likely, 21%, and those from the West were most likely, 36% to say they were not religious. Those from the highest socioeconomic quartile were least likely, 13%, and those from the lowest quartile were most likely, 24%, to say they were not religious. Only family type appeared related to being very religious. However, there is not an obvious explanation of the difference. Church Services Slightly more than one-half of the tenth graders said they attend church services at least twice a month. One fifth said they never attended services. The percentages according to frequency of church attendance were as follows: more than once a week, 15%; about once a week, 28%; two or three times a month, 10%; about once a month, 8%; several times a year or less, 19%; not at all 20%. Over a fourth, 28%, said they attended religious services about once a week. Only socio-economic status showed substantial differences related to weekly attendance. The range was from 23% of the lowest socio-economic quartile to 35% of the highest saying they attended church weekly. The range in percent saying they seldom or never attended church was from 15% of African Americans to 29% of Native Americans. The range related to SES was from 14% of the highest to 26% of the lowest quartile. The range in terms of family type was from 17% of those living with both parents to 33% of those living with their father and stepmother. Religious Affiliation Most, 90%, of the tenth graders Indicated some irind of religious affiliation. The largest percentages were 25% Catholic and 23% Baptist. However, small percentages were other religions including 3% Jewish and 1% Eastern religions and slightly less than 1% Moslem. Religious affiliation clearly differed related to ethnic background of the eighth grader. However, it is to be noted that only 57% of the African Americans indicated that they were Baptists and only 54% of the Hispanic Americans indicated that they were Catholic. Some African Americans were Catholic and some Hispanic Americans were Baptists. The differences were most pronounced related to Baptists and Catholics, but also appeared for Other Protestant and other religious affiliations. Region and family type also showed substantial differences. Socio-economic status showed substantial differences related to Baptists and Other Protestants. Family type was the only variable which showed substantial differences in terms of the percent who said they had no religious affiliation. The greatest difference, 50 percentage points, appeared related to ethnicity. Other family 8% to mother/stepfather 21% Importance Almost half of the tenth graders believed that their peers did not think that it was important to participate in religious activities. The percentages who answered the question, \"Among the friends you hang out with, how important is it to participate in religious activities?\", were as follows: not important, 48%; somewhat important, 42%; and important, 11%. Differences in ranges in the percent saying very important were not substantial. However, ethnicity, region. and family type all showed substantial differences in the percentages that thought their friends thought that taking part in religious activities was not important. Over half of the tenth graders from the Northeast and over half of the Asian American tenth graders said their friends did not think it was important to take part in religious activities. African-American youngsters and those from the South showed the lowest percentages. Discussion: It is encouraging that many tenth graders saw themselves as at least somewhat religious and attended church at least occasionally. However, it is of concern that many thought their friends did not see religion as being very important. If teens draw away from religious activities, a greater burden of responsibility for guiding ethical, moral, and spiritual development rests with the family. If the family fails in this responsibility and public schools are barred from doing much in these areas, there is a danger of a growing number of young adults having lower socid standards than America has known in the past. There is little to counter the modeling of violence, sexual conduct, abuse of substance, and treatment of others, that is often portrayed (and sometimes glorified) by media. There is little to help young adults learn to control and react constructively when they feel frustrated or angry."}, {"section_title": "READING AND VIEWING", "text": "Although four-fifths of the tenth graders said they did some reading for pleasure, only sorn 'what more than half indicated they spent two hours or less per week.

Among the tenth graders there were substantial differences in relation both to watching less than one hour per day (including those who did not watch any television) and watching more than 5 hours of television per day on weekdays. There were no substantial differences related to watching less than an hour, but there were substantial differences related to watching more than five hours per day on weekends. In all three examinations, ethnicity and socio-economic status showed substantial differences and sex of student, region, and urbanicity did not. Family type showed a difference in only one case. Asian Americans were least likely and African Americans were most likely to watch television. The highest socio-economic quartile was somewhat less likely and the lowest quartile was somewhat more likely to watch television. Family type showed a substantial difference in relation to none or less than an hour of viewing on weekdays. Those living with their father and stepmother showed the lowest percentage and those living with someone other than a parent showed the highest percentage of limiting television watching to the least amount. Discussion: This survey does not indicate of what students were reading and what they were watching. Either can be done purely for relaxation with learning being serendipitous. Either can be done selectively and learning enhanced. There has been a tendency to assume that watching TV is \"bad\" and \"reading\" is good. It probably depends upon what is being viewed and what is being read. Poor choices of material in either area can be bad. One of the main differences between the two is that reading requires one to use one's imagination to bring forth a visual image of what is being described in print while television provides both the words and the visual image. In that respect, television is more accurate and viewers are kept closer to whatever reality the script writer Intended. It is very likely that those who are tenth graders today will take greater advantage of the revolutionary media highways that are supposed to be on their way than will their parents and grandparents."}, {"section_title": "WORKING FOR PAY", "text": "Three-fifths of the tenth graders had worked for pay at some time in their life.

About a tenth earned from $2.50 to $3.99 an hour. About a fourth, 24%, indicated earning more than $5.00 per hour including the 6% who saia iiley earned more than $7.00 an hour. The ranges in percent earning less than $2.50 did not differ substantially with the seven variables examined.

Only one in five said that their friends said this was not important However, even though 18% said their friends thought holding a steady job was not important, 37% said their friends thought it very important. Substantial differences appeared both in the percent saying not important and the percent saying very important in relation to ethnicity and family type. However, the differences in ranges were greater in relation to the percent saying very important than to the percents saying not important.

Youngsters from the highest socio-economic quartile showed the lowest percent, 27%, and those from the lowest quartile showed the highest percent, 49%, saying their friends thought that holding a steady job was very important. Holding a steady job may be important to teens for a variety of reasons among them status, sense of worth, earning money, and building a work record for the future. The NELS survey did not explore why teens worked. However it would seem that by the time they are 16 having worked for someone and earned money is an important part of preparing for later life. The fact that two-fifths apparently had not had or had not t,Aken that opportunity may be of concern. It is also of concern that European-American youngsters were more likely to have jobs than were those of other ethnic backgrounds. Do European American kids in some communities get preference for positions because many employers are European American? On the other hand, the finding that almost one in five worked more than 30 hours a week also should be a concern because these students are only tenth graders and school is a full-time occupation."}, {"section_title": "FRIENDS' VIEWS OF IMPORTANCE OF SELECTED ACTIVITIES", "text": "Tenth graders were divided in terms of whether they bekeved partying and taking part in sports were important.

The other percentages saying their friends did not think something was important were 48% religious activities, 28% partying and getting wild, and 27% taking part in sports activities. Discussion: Perhaps the most striking thing about the data on perceived views of friends is the variation that is shown. On things like partying and getting wild, the percent saying others thought it was very important was exactly the same as the percent saying it was not important. The group was about equally divided in terms of the importance of taking part in sports activities. There are a few items that are worrisome. The lack of status of religion was commented upon pi aviously. Another area that may be of concern is the finding that most tenth graders do not feel that their peers feel community service and volunteering is important. Is that a phase that youngsters go through? Are their efforts at this age justifiably centered on themselves as they work through the process of finding out who they are? Are they different than their parents or grandparents at the same point in their lives?

The percentage responses to the question, \"Would you consider having a child if you were not married?\", were as follows: yes, 11%; maybe, 21%; no, 63%; don't know, 12%. Ethnicity and socio-economic status showed substantial differences related to those who would consider having a child if not married. Tenth graders from the lowest socio-economic status and African Americans were most likely to indicate they would consider doing so. However, the highest percentage for any group saying yes was 20%. Differences across the range of subgroups were greater for these variables when the percent saying would not was examined. Asian-American tenth graders and those from the highest socio-economic status quartile were most likely to say no. In addition there was a substantial difference related to sex of students with boys being more likely to say they would not than were girls. Have Own Chid Less than 5% had or were expecting a child. The percentages were as follows: had a child, 3%; expecting a child, 2%. One percent of the tenth graders that were in school had a child as compared with 17% of the dropouts. The only substantial difference related to having or expecting a child appeared related to family type. The range in percent saying they had one or more children was from 1% of those living with both parents to 11% of those living with someone other than either parent (possibly living with spouse). However, some tenth graders in all family types were parents. The percentages of tenth grade-aged young people in this sample who either had a child or were expecting at the time of the survey according to whom they were living with were as follows: living with both parents, 1%; father and stepmother, 2%; father only, 3%; mother and stepfather, 4%; mother only, 7%; someone other than either parent, 11%. More information on the percent having children is found in the section on household. Discussion: In the years prior to 1990 when this survey was administered, society in general had been very relaxed about sexual conduct. There is some indication that among teens currently there is more interest in chastity until marriage. However, the fact that many teenagers see sex as an activity outside of marriage means that education about safe sex Is extremely important. Media has focused on some low-income girls, and has given special attention to those of African-American heritage who have children out of wedlock supposably to gain more welfare money. It is unfortunate that the impression often is given that the majority of low-Income African American girls engage in this practice. This data would show that those who do are definitely in the minority."}, {"section_title": "POTENTIALLY HARMFUL SUBSTANCES", "text": "Alcohol was the most frequently used and abused harmful substance. Over two-thirds of the tenth graders had had a drink of alcohol within the year prior to the survey and over two-tifths had had a drink within the month of the survey. Almost one-fourth said they had taken five drinks in a row at least once during the two weeks prior to the survey. In comparison, one in five said they smoked cigarettes and one in ten said they smoked one or more per day. Only 14% said they had used marijuana and 3% said they had used cocaine. There was little difference in responses to the questions about use of substances when the variables were examined. Only 10% overall yielded substantial differences. The percent indicating substantial differences when the 22 comparisons per variable were as follows: famiiy type, 36%, and ethnicity, 23%. The other four variables did not show any substantial differences."}, {"section_title": "Alcohol", "text": "Most, more than four out of frve tenth graders had a drink of alcohol at sometime during their lives. About a fourth had had one or more drinks on at least twenty occasions by the time they reached this point in tenth grade. Over two-thirds had had a drink within the year prior to the survey and over two-fifths had had a drink of alcohol within the month of the survey. More than one in ten, 15%, said they had used alcohol on more than three occasions during the month before the survey. The percentages indicating frequency of drinking over various periods were as follows: lifetime, 0 occasions, 18%; 1-2 occasions, 23%; 3-19 occasions, 34%; 20 or more occasions, 24%; Previous year, 0 occasions, 31%; 1-2 occasions, 30%; 3-19 occasions, 30%; 20 or more occasions, 9%; previous month, 0 occasions, 58%; 1-2 occasions, 27%; 3-19 occasions, 13%; 20 or more occasions, 2%. None of the variables examined in this study showed substantial differences in the percentages not using alcohol at all and those not having had a drink during the previous year. Ethnicity and family type showed differences in the percent that had not had a drink dui ing the thirty days previous to the study. It is to be noted that half of the Native Americans and three-fourths of the African-American tenth graders said they had not consumed any alcoholic beverages during the preceding 30 days. The range related to family types was from 47% of those living with their fathers only to 60% of those living with both parents saying they had not had a drink of alcohol in the 30 days prior to the survey. Heavy drinking Some were heavy drinkers. Somewhat less than a fourth of the tenth graders Indicated consuming five or more drinks in a row at least once during the two weeks before the survey. Over three-fourths saki they had never taken five drinks in a row. The percentages indicating the number of times they had had five drinks or more In a row during two weeks previous to filling out the survey were as follows: never, 76%; once, 10%; twice, 6%; three to five times, 4%; six to nine times, 2%; ten or more times, 2%. The only variable that showed a substantial difference was ethnicity. The range was from 74% of Native Americans to 88% of Asian Americans saying they had never taken five or more drinks in a row. (The only question in the survey dealing with quantity at one time was this one which focused on five or more drinks). Cigarettes Most, 82%, of the tenth graders stated that they dki not smoke at all. Another 10% said they smoked fewer than five cigarettes per day. The percentages according to number of cigarettes smoked were as follows: Don't smoke at all, 82%; less than one cigarette per day, 5%; 1 to 5 cigarettes per day, 5%; about 1/2 pack per day, 4%; >1/2 pack but < than 2 packs, 3%; 2 packs per day or more, <1%. Ethnicity and family type showed substantial differences in the percent who did not smoke at all or smoked less than one cigarette per day. The percentage of youth smoking increased from 7% in eighth grade to 18% in tenth grade. The percent smoking five or more cigarettes per day increased from 3% of the eighth graders to 7% of the tenth graders. Marijuana --Conskierably fewer students used marijuana than used alcohol. The majority of the tenth graders, 79%, had never used marijuana. Among the 21% who had used marijuana, 8% had used it on 3 or more occasions within the last twelve months whNe 4% used it 3 or more times within the last 30 days. The percentages indicating frequency of using marijuana over various periods were as follows: lifetime, 0 occasions, 79%; 1-2 occasions, 10%; 3-19 occasions, 6%; 20 or more occasions, 5%; previous year, 0 occasions, 85%; 1-2 occasicsns, 7%; 3-19 occasions, 5%; 20 or more occasions, 3%; previous month, 0 occasions, 92%; 1-2 occasions, 4%; 3-19 occasions, 3%; 20 or more occasions, 1%. No substantial differences were found related to socio-economic status, sex of student, region, or urbanicity. Ethnicity, and family type showed substantial differences for those who had never used marijuana. Ethnicity and family type also showed differences of 10 or more percentage point in those who had used marijuana 3 or more times in their lifetime. Tenth graders who had never used marijuana were most likely to be Asian American, and to come from homes where both parents are present. Those who had used marijuana were most likely to have come from homes with a father only and be Native American. African Americans were least likely to have used marijuana three or more times within their lifetime. Cocaine --Three percent of the tenth graders had used cocaine. Approximately two percent had used cocaine, including crack, 3 or more times in their lifetime, probably all within the previous year. The percentages indicating frequency of using marijuana over various periods were as follows: lifetime, 0 occasions, 97%; 1-2 occasions, 2%; 3-19 occasions, 1%; 20 or more occasions, <1%; previous year, 0 occasions, 98%; 1-2 occasions, 2%; 3-19 occasions, 1%; 20 or more occasions, <1%; previous month, 0 occasions, 99%; 1-2 occasions, 1%; 3-19 occasions, <1%; 20 or more occasions, <1%. No substantial differences were found related to the seven variables."}, {"section_title": "Discussion:", "text": "Teenage drinking is an ongoing problem in our society. These findings support the point that many substance abuse educators have been trying to make with parents. Parents tend to run scared of drugs and ignore the dangers of irresponsible use of alcohol. These findings indicate that even though there have been several good programs which have tried to educate teens about the danger of drinking, there is still a great deal of need for effective educational programs in this area. It Is difficult to influence teens with educational programs when an adult society very visibly puts a great deal of emphasis on the enjoyment and comfort secured from alcohol. The implications to individuals, families, community and society are far-reaching. While some will not be surprised at the results as they see and hear about it in their everyday lives, it needs to be remembered that we are talking about an illegal practice that puts the lives of all individuals at risk. When alcohol and driving are combined, it can be fatal--lives are lost, many times of those who just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. A life full of potential, hopes and dreams can be snuffed out in a second. Drugs and alcohol not only affect the lives of the individual but also any children born to these individuals while under the influences of these substances. The problems that arise out of this affect all of us, be it in health care, schools, community services, or future generations. Although a much smaller percent of tenth graders smoke cigarettes, the fact that any do and the finding that the percentage doubled between eighth and tenth grade is alarming given the scientific findings about the effect of smoking on health. More attention needs to be given to the reasons why young people begin smoking and efforts made to reduce that percentage.\nNo attempt was made to determine the extent to which the youngsters who said their parents had received warnings were the sane youngsters in the eighth and tenth grade. Nor, as in the eighth grade survey, do we know the extent of the problem and the extent to which schools let parents know when there was a problem. While it is encouraging that fewer parents of tenth graders had received notices which might indicate better student performances. one has to be cautious about the comparison in reporting methods\nAlthough it is encouraging to find that about half of the parents of tenth graders attended school activities and attended rhool meetings, it is of concern that the percent Is not higher. It would seem that as the teen grows to adulthood that the parent, teacher and tenth grader would have more in common and that there might be more involvement on the part of parents in school activities and in discussing student progress and special interests. Even limited volunteer activity on the part of parents helps them better understand what is going on at school. It is likely that when parents have little or no contact the problem may rest with the parents, with the school, or with the teens as intermediaries. School boards may periodically need to check to see that high school systems are encouraging parent involvement. If they find that the opportunities are there and publicized but parents are not responding, then they may want to work with media to develop a campaign to secure more involvement on the part of parents. I 9 \" t PART C -TENTH GRADERS AND SCHOOL As might be expected of a study initiated by the Department of Education, a great deal of the survey focused on the tenth orader and his or her experience with attitudes about school. This section of the report is divided into six parts: school experiences, school behavior, dropouts, school systems and classes, future educational plans, and opinions about school,.\nAlthough the ten items chosen for inclusion in the survey covered a variety of awards, they did not provide a complete list. For example, there are sports honors in addition to being the most valuable player, and there are awards and honors for excelling in activities other than math and science fairs. It is encouraging to see that over half had earned at least one of the ten awards, and that for most awards, the six characteristics examined did not make any difference. Each youngster needs an opportunity to excel in something and to feel pr ud of things accomplished. However, it is of concern that those from the lowest socio-economic status and those of certain ethnic backgrounds were least likely to have earned an award. How does a youngster feel who never receives any special recognition at school? If only a few youngsters do receive recognition and the majority do not, he or she may not even be aware of the lack of being considered special for some school activity. However, if, as it would appear from this data, a good number of tenth graders receive special attention for something good they do, then not receiving recognition may have an adverse effect on some youngsters.\nThose concerned about the relatively high percentage of youth who do not complete high school have to consider both factors resting with the teens and factors resting with the school system which make staying in school unattractive. It is likely that not fitting with the dominant culture in the school, whether that culture be age, ethnic, or socio-economic status related, may be one reason why youngsters leave school.\nThe family characteristics which some experts say are key factors in dropouts seemed to have some effect but not to be a major explanatory factor. Aithc.ugh pregnancy and/or marriage are reasons why some youth drop out of school, that did not seem to be the most prevalent reason for these tenth graders. The fact that more were living with a mother only also raises some questions in terms of whether family finances were a problem.\nOverall self-concept as measured in this survey appeared to affect some dropouts but not to affect others. It did not appear to be a major factor in whether students dropped out of school. That is somewhat perplexing in that lack of success in school, which showed more relationship, might be thought to lead to lower self-esteem. It would appear that teens' self-esteem is not highly dependent upon their success in school. Locus of control as measured in this study seemed to have even less effect than did self-concept. Either the measures are inadequate or dropping out of school is no more associated with a youngster's being internally controlled or believing strongly that fate controls his or her life.\nIn general, one might expect that the courses would be harder in high school. One would not necessarily expect that discipline would be stricter in the ninth grade. The fact that some students saw little difference might relate to how closely the eighth grade they attended was patterned after a high school program. In some instances the eighth grade and the ninth grade were in the same school. The fact that many eighth graders did not feel that it was harder to make friends or that they were more alone in ninth grade might in part be due to the fact that many students were in large systems in the eighth grade. They had probably faced the challenge of making new friends when they moved from the earlier grades to middle school or junior high.\nThe finding that almost all tenth graders are in school because they expect schooling to help them get a job later is especially interesting given the discussion on the part of some during the late 1980's as to how well our K-12 system was preparing youth for the world of work. It would appear that if tenth graders understood tech-prep and other preparation for work programs that more would be interested in them. However, there may be a difference between a generally held attitude or goal of going to school to prepare for work and really wanting to take part in a program specificaily designed to improve employability. The finding that participation in school extracurricular teams and clubs is an important reason why some youth stay in school may be of particular interest to those developing community programs. It may be that only part of the tenth graders have the opportunity of becoming sufficiently involved in a team or club that they see it as a reason or responsibility for continuing to attend school. Or ft may be a difference In interests, with those who are interested in teams and clubs feeling this Is a reason for attending school, and those who are not interested not seeing it as a reason. The findings that many agreed that they were in school because the subjects were interesting, they gained satisfaction from learning, and teachers cared is encouraging. However, it may be of concern to some that the percentage strongly agreeing that they were in school for these reasons was relatively low, from 8% interesting subjects, 15% teacher caring, and 10% satisfaction with what they were doing in class. Idealistically one could hope that more sixteen year olds had been sufficiently *turned on\" to the excitement of learning that they would be in school because they enjoyed learning. After all, sixteen Is just two years away from legally being an adult, and the theme for adults today is lifelong learning. One would hope that by the tenth grade most youth -vould have both gained the skills needed to continue to learn either on their own or in some version of instruction, and to sufficiently enjoy learning that they want to continue. However, it is possible that some youngsters responded to this question less enthusiastically than they really felt because it may not be \"cool\" in older teen culture to be enthusiastic about school. The finding that only one out of five strongly disagreed with the statement that they were in school because they had nothing better to do can be interpreted in more than one way. From the school and perhaps society's point of view, it is disheartening that four out of five did not strongly disagree with this statement. On the other hand, we are aware that by the tenth grade youth are no longer children but are strMng to become adults. We may have to work harder to make school an attractive and valuable place, rather than counting on students having to attend However, we can be pleased that those who agreed that they were there only because they didn't have something better to do were, in fact, still in school.\nAlthough somewhat difficult to interpret, the responses to questions about attitude toward courses raises important questions. Why do students have to be required to take courses for them to be willing to take them? How can interest in courses be generated to such an extent that students want to take them? It was valuable that the survey tried to find out from students the extent to which they found their courses challenging. However, the findings can be interpreted in several ways. One way of looking at the responses is that for some youngsters the activities involved in the courses were not challenging enough to make them work hard, prove they understood the material, or really use their minds. Another way of looking at it is that the weaker students may be those who are most likely to feel that they are challenged to do these things everyday. There is enough evidence in terms of response to the question of working hard when coupled with information given elsewhere in this report on the amount of time spent on homework that would indicate that some teachers are not being demanding enough in what they expect of their students. There is also evidence that some teachers are not teaching in such a way that students feel really engaged and challenged."}, {"section_title": "EDUCATION RELATED TO SOCIAL BEHAVIOR", "text": "Most, but not all, tenth graders had been exposed to education related to social problem areas such as substance abuse, 82%; AIDS, 65%; and sex education, 65%.

Family type was the only variable showing a substantial difference related to substance abuse education. Sex Education About two-thirds also said they had taken part in an sex education program in high school. Type of family and region showed substantial differences. Tenth graders in the Northeast region were most likely to have taken part in sex education programs.

More saw leisure as very important than saw having a lot of money as very important. Although having lots of money in the future was of at least some importance to most tenth graders, the percent saying it was very important, two out of five, was not as high as the responses to the work related items.

About a third thought that helping others was very important and one out of five, thought working to correct economic inequalities would be very important in their future. It would appear that only a relatively small percentage of tenth graders are eager to get away from their parents and home communities.

Most adults will be pleased that so many saw steady work and close friendships as being very important. The finding that relatively few were eager to leave their home communities also will be appreciated in those communities who lost well educated youth during the past decades. However, the relatively small percent who thought addressing economic inequities and helping others was very important may be of concern in many communities. Youth of an earlier generation are often pictured as eager to leave home and seek their fortunes elsewhere. Is that a false picture? Or, in those days, was leaving home the main vehicle for achieving independence, and have today's tenth graders managed already to have achieved the amount of independence that they desire? Or by young adults stayed in the family home longer because of economic necessity and, has a different model been set for teens9 1 g"}, {"section_title": "CHANCES OF THINGS OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE", "text": "Most tenth graders felt there was more than a fifty-fifty chance that positive things would occur in their future.

Although neither showed very high percentages, Asian Americans were three times as likely to have a grandparent in the household than were European Americans. The highest percent of grandparents appeared in families where neither parent was present indicating that part of the families in that category probably were living with one or both grandparents. The percent with grandparents living in the tenth graders households remained the same between eighth and tenth grade; the eighth grade survey found 7% of the households including at least one grandparent. Other relative Some students had other relatives in their household. In 5% of the households there was another relative under 18 years of age. In 10% there was a relative over 18. For both age groups, European Americans and those living with both parents were least likely to have other relatives in the household. African Americans and those living with someone other than their own families were most likely to have other relatives from both age groups living in the household.

Those living with their fathers only were least likely and those 86 living with their mother and a stepfather were most likely to say that they had to care for a younger child. Asian Americans were least likely and Hispanic Americans were most likely to have child care responsibilities. Among those who took care of a child or children, 45%, said that it was less than one hour per day; 31% said it was from one to three hours per day; 6% said from five to seven hours, and 5% said more than seven hours per day. Among those caring for children, 75% said that they had not missed any days of school because of this responsibility. At the other extreme, 16% said they missed 10 or more days a month because of having to take care of a child or children. This information was not secured from eighth graders. Discussion: Most teenagers have adult men and women in a parental role. This point will be discussed more in the section on family type. Thus the main area of interest In this section is that enough tenth graders had established some part of a new family -either spouse/significant other or child, or both -by the time they were tenth graders to show as a percentage in a national sample. The finding that one out of every twenty-five tenth graders has a child, has implications for child care arrangements, sex education, parenting programs, and intergenerational programs. The other important finding about new families is that the tenth graders who had started new families this early in their lives did not seem to be clustered in any location such as the central city, or to be identified primarily with any of the five ethnic groups Identified in this study. They did not seem to be solely appearing among youngsters in the lowest socio-economic quartile. Instead, they seemed to be dispersed across all of the subgroups examined. This challenges, in part, media emphasis on early child bearing being concentrated among inner city, lower socio-economic African-American teens. It is likely that rather than a cultural pattern the early formation of complete or partial new families by young people in their middle teens is a result of a pervasive attitude toward early sexual activity which for the past few years had permeated the teen culture. The difference from earlier generations, in addition to the fact that more teens find early sexual activity okay, is that more teens may be keeping their children rather than placing them for adoption. It is also important to note that about a fourth of tenth grade boys say they are responsible for caring for a child in their family -either own or sibling. This has implications both for programs for babysitters and for school courses which include family relations or care of children. For both boys and girls, the finding that Hispanic-American teens were most likely to have child care responsibilities may be important to those developing educational programs related to child care."}, {"section_title": "FAMILY TYPE", "text": "About two-thirds of the tenth graders lived with both of their natural (or adoptive) parents.

Ethnicity also showed a difference in the percent living with a stepparent Sex of student showed a difference relataj: to living with a father and stepmother or lMng only with the father and lMng with someone other than either parent. The greatest relationship appeared to be with ethnicity. There was a major difference in the percent of tenth graders living with both parents according to ethnic groups. Asian-American youngsters, 80%, were most likely and African-American youngsters, 35%, were least likely to be living with both parents by the time they reached the tenth grade. There were similar substantial differences with African Americans showing the highest percentages and Asian Americans showing the lowest percentages living with their mother and a stepfather (5% to 16%) and living only with their mother (9% to 37%). However, differences related to ethnicity did not show substantial differences related to the percentage living with their father and a stepmother (African American 1% to Euopean American 3%), their father only (Hispanic American, 2% to African American 3%), or with someone other than a parent (Asian American, Native American, Euopean American, 2%, to African American 4%). There was also a difference related to socio-economic status in the percent living with both parents and the percent living with their mother only. However, the difference in percentage points was not nearly as great as for ethnicity. Over half of those in the lowest socio-economic quartile compared to over three-fourths of those in the highest quartile were living with both parents. About one tenth grader in ten in the highest socio-economic quartile was living only with his or her mother as compared with one-fourth of those in the lowest quartile. The ranges for the other family types were as follows: father and stepmother (2% highest SES quartile to 4% next to highest); father only (3% next to highest to 4% lowest SES quartile), other than a parent (1% highest to 3% lowest SES quartile). Family type showed a difference related to the sex of student with boys more likely to live with their father, whether it be with father and stepmother or only with their father. More girls than boys lived with someone other than their parents. The percentages of boys and girls were about the same among those living with both parents and those living with their mother, whether alone or with mother and a stepfather. Region showed a suostantial difference related to the percent living with both parents. The range was from 59% of tenth graders in the South to 71% of those in the Northeast living with both parents. The ranges for the other family types were as follows: mother only (14% North Central to 19% South); father and stepmother (2% Northeast to 4% West); father only (2% Northeast and North Central to 4% South), other than a parent (1% Northeast to 2% other three regions). The largest differences related to urbanicity were 7 percentage points in relation to those living with both parents. The range was from 61% of the urban tenth graders to 68% of rural tenth graders living with both parents. The range in percent living only with their mother was from 12% of rural to 21% of urban tenth graders. The ranges for the other family types were as follows: father and stepmother (3% all areas); father only (2% urban to 4% rural); other than a parent (1% urban to 2% rural). For about a third of those living with their father but not with their birth or adoptive mother were facing adjustment to a relatively new marital situation on the part of their parents. In response questions about potentially disruptive events which will be presented in the next section, over a third of those living with their father and a stepmother said that a parent had married during the last two years. Almost as many, 30%, living only with their father said that their parents had been divorced or had separated during the past two years. Discussion: With, on the average, almost two out of every five tenth graders living in a family type other than with both natural or adoptive parents, those working with youth of this age must be sensitive to and acceptant of diverse patterns. The tenth grade data indicates a traditional picture of children most often going with the mother when the two birth or adoptive parents split up. However, recent (1994) news releases indicate that the percent of children going with their father with or without a stepmother is increasing. A second point to be considered by those who are working with this age group is the time distance from the point in which a new family type occurred. Tenth graders who have been living with one parent either alone or with a stepparent for several years have had more time to adjust to that situation than has the tenth grader who Is facing a new situation either because of divorce, remarriage of a parent, death of a parent. Family study experts indicate that disruption in a family pattern causes some degree of stress and readjustment regardless of the age of the child. It is probable, though, that disruption occurring when a child is in the teen years and more perceptive of what is happening in the adult world may cause a different kind of stress for teens than does a disruption when the child is a toddler or small child."}, {"section_title": "Self and Fam", "text": "The NELS tenth grade survey included questions about potentially disruptive events, the extent to +A hich parents monitored activities, how much attention they paid to their tenth graders' activities, who made decisions, and parents' participation in school.

Those youngsters who only lived with their father were the most likely to have experienced at least one of the events, 80%.

Almost as many, 15%, indirrated that their mother had started work One in ten indicated that a farnly member had bedxne seriously HI or disabled.

The 19 events are clustered in the following presentation. Death A very small percent had lost a parent (father 1%, mother < 1%1 during the previos two years. However, over a fourth, 29%, had had a dose relative die. There were no substantial differences in the death of a parent when the responses were examined using the study's variables; however, ethnicity and family type showed substantial differences in the death of a close relative. African-American tenth graders were almost three times as likely to have experienced such a death as were Asian-American youngsters. Over a third of the African-American youngsters said that a close relative had died during the past two years. Illness Three percent of the respondents had become seriously sick or disabled during the year, but 11% had had someone in their family become seriously sick or disabled. There were no substantial differences in ranges for the seven variables in relation to the tenth graders' illnesses. However, almost one in five of those living with someone other than their parents had experienced a family member becoming seriously ill or disabled. Divorce or Marriage More than one youngster in twenty had experienced a change in their parent's marriage during the previous two years. Slightly more, 8%, said that their parents had divorced than said that one or more parents had married, 6%. Eight percent said their parents had been divorced; 6% said a parent had married. None of the variables yielded substantial differences in the percent indicating parents divorcing during the past two years. However, family type showed a substantial difference related to a parent getting married. Over a third of those living with their father and a stepmother said that one of their parents had gotten married during that period of time. Almost a third of the tenth graders living wkh their father only said that their parents had been divorced or separated in the year before the survey. The study variables did not show substantial differences related to homelessness. For example, there was only a one percentage point difference between the highest and lowest socio-economic quartiles which raises a question of whether youth interpreted this question differently or were willing to admit to being homeless. Moving to a new home showed differences related to ethnicity and family type. ThoselMng with someone other than either parent were more than three times as likely to have moved than were those living with both parents. Native Americans were least likely and Asian Americans were most likely to have experienced a move. Parent's Employment The most frequent change in parent's employment was that the mother had started work, 15% (fathers, 4% '1. hoi it one in twenty had experienced one of their parents losing a job during the previous two years (mother 5%; father 6%). The only substantial differences related to the study variables appeared related to the mother losing her job and family type. Those living with their father only were most apt to say that their mothers had lost their jobs. Sibling Problems Abnut one tenth grader in twenty, indicated that a sister became pregnant, 5%, and/or sister or brother dropped out of school, 4%. None of the variables showed substantial differences in the percent saying a sibling dropped out of school. Ethnicity and family type showed a difference related to a sister becoming pregnant. Welfare Apparently severe economic changes which meant a different relationship with welfare either were not experienced by the tenth graders or they chose not to indicate them. Only 1% indicated that their famgy went on welfare; 1% indicated that their family went off welfare; and 2% said that the farnly stayed on welfare. None of the variables showed substantial difference related to the three welfare items. Surprisingly, the ranges across socio-economic status quartiles were only from two to four percentage points. Discussion: These findings bring home to the reader the extent to which teens who are still in the process of finding themselves and developing their own personalities have to deal with \"heavy\" stuff. The events include those such as death or serious illness of people close to them, adjustment to new family situations, and either divorce or remarriage of parent. Often there is worry and tension before the event occurs as well as the adjustment that needs to be made after the event. Such situations are dffficult enough for mature adults. Those close to teens going through these situations need to be especially alert and helpful. Teenagers' indications of need for emotional support during trying times may be more ciffiicult to discern than they are for younger children, yet the need is often there. It is also of note that welfare seemed not to be a factor for many tenth graders. At the most 2% or 3% said their families had been on welfare at some time during the previous two years. One wonders whether the youngsters did not understand what was included in the term, did not know, or did not want to admit their situation. Another possibility is that welfare families were likely to be off welfare by the time the oldest youngsters were in high school. It is noted in particular that there were very small differences in how socio-economic subgroups and ethnic subgroups responded to this question. Certainly the amount of press attention given to welfare families would make the percentage seem higher than these data indicate. It is encouraging that such a small percentage had been in a home where a sibling had had a problem, either dropping out of school or a sister becoming pregnant. It is to be noted that the small percentage indicating a sibling dropping out t)f school remained fairly similar across all variables. Ethnicity and family type showed differences related to pregnancy, but the percentage for the highest group was only 13%. Again, this is somewhat smaller than some press accounts would lead one to believe."}, {"section_title": "FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS", "text": "It was clear that there is considerable diversity in how tenth graders saw relationships with their families.

Parents understand me Almost three-fdths thought their parents understood them. However, about one-fourth of the tenth graders thought their parents usually did not understand them. The percentage responses to the statement, \"My parents understand me,\" were as follows: 8%, false; 6%, mostly false; 10%, more false than true; 17%, more true than false; 25%, mostly true; and 33%, true. The only substantial difference appeared in relation to family type and saying the question was true or mostly true. Somewhat more than two in five of those living with someone other than either parent as compared with three in five of those living with both parents said the statement was true for them. Even though those living in some arrangement other than with both parents had lower percentages saying that their parents understood them, it is to be noted that only three out of five of those living with both parents felt that thls statement was true. Understand Why About one in five felt they did not adequately understand their parents' reasons. On the other hand, about half said this usually was not the case in their %nay. The percentage of responses to the statement, \"I often do not know why I am supposed to do what my parents tell me to do,\" were as follows: 28%, false; 21%, mostly false; 18%, more false than true; 15%, more true than false; 11%, mosty true; and 8%, true. Substantial differences appeared for both the percent saying true or mostly true and the percent saying false or mostly false in relation to family type and ethnicity. Native-American tenth graders showed the highest percentages not understanding why they were supposed to obey their parents. Those living with someone other than their family were most likely to feel they understood. Over half felt trusted, treated fairly, and not dependent upon parents to solve their problems. Responses seemed to be affected by specific situations rather than the broader context variables. Parents' Trust One in ten tenth graders did not feel that their parents trusted them. Almost two-thirds were very sure of their parents' trust. The remainder varied in their surety. The percentage responses to the statement, \"My parents trust me to do what they expect without checking on me,\" were as follows: 6%, false; 5%, mostly false; 9%, more false than true; 18%, more true than false; 30%, mostly true; and 32%, true. Only one substantial difference appeared when the variables were examined. Family type showed a substantial difference in the percent saying true or mostly true. Those living with their father and a stepmother showed the lowest percentages that their parents trusted them. Those living with their father only showed the highest percentages. Fair treatment About one in ten tenth graders did not think that their parents treated them fairly. Two in five thought their parents definitely treated them fairly. The percentage of responses to the statement, \"My parents treat me fairly,\" were as follows: 3%, false; 2%, mostly false; 7%, more false than true; 18%, more true than false; 30%, mostly true; and 40%, true. There was a substantial difference in response related to family type and socio-economic status.

Parents in the highest socio-economic status quartile were somewhat more likely to expect their tenth graders home by that time than were parents in the lowest quartile. This question was not asked of the eighth graders. Discussion: Even though the tenth graders had reached their middle teens, many parents kept a monitoring structure in place. The monitoring structure appeared to be less stringent for the tenth graders as compared to when they were eighth graders. It is likely that maintaining a comfortable monitoring process is not easy for either parents or teens because teens seek adult status and believe that they are mature enough to handle their own affairs. Yet working out comfortable monitoring arrangements remains important for teens through their high school years. Parenting programs for parents of teens and programs on family relationships addressed to teens may help families make these adjustments. Some of the differences related to characteristics raise questions and to some extent, raise concerns. The finding that fewer parents from the lowest socio-economic quartile checked on or helped with homework may be due to the parent's own limited educational backgrours'. Some of the parents In this group might appreciate some review sessions for parents. The finding of a 12 percentage point difference in the percent of boys and of girls required to help around the home may relate to traditional views of what is appropriate \"men's work\". However, perhaps more important is the fact that so many tenth grade boys and girls were not required to help around the home.

The percentages having taken various amounts of mathematics courses were as follows: General Math: none, 69%; one-half year, 3%; one year, 17%; one and one-half years, 2%; two years, 9%; Pre-Algebra: none, 66%; one-half year, 6%; one year, 25%; one and one-half years, 1%; two years, 2%; Algebra I: none, 31%; one-half year, 7%; one year, 56%; one and one-half years, 2%; two years, 3%; Geometry: none, 50%; one-half year, 5%; one year, 44%; one and one-half years, 1%; two years, 1%; Algebra II: none, 73%; one-half year, 5%; one year, 22%; one and one-half years, .3%; two years, .4%; Trigonometry: none, 93%; one-half year, 4%; one year, 3%; one and one-half years, .1%; two years, .1%; Pre-Calculus: none, 98%; one-half year, 1%; one year, 1%; one and one-half years, .1%; two years, .1%; Calculus: none, 98%; one-half year, 1%; one year, 1%; one and one-half years, .1%; two years, .2%; Consumer/Business Math: none, 90%; one-half year, 3%; one year, 6%; one and one-half years, .4%; two years, .7%; Other Math: none, 91%; one-half year, 2%; one year, 6%; one and one-half years, .4%; two years, 2%. The variables examined in this study showed several substantial differences in terms of who took mathematics courses Only Pre-Calculus and Calculus did not show any differences of ten percentages points or more. At the other extreme, Geometry showed substantial differences related to all variables except sex of students It is to be noted that sex of students did not show substantial differences for any of the math courses Socio-economic status appeared to make the most difference in who took what Math courses. Substantial differences related to socio-economic status appeared in relation to all except trigonometry and other math. Those from the lowest quartile were most likely to have taken Remedial Math, General Math, Pre-Algebra, and Consumer or Business Math. Those from the highest quartile were most likely to have taken Algebra I and II or Geometry. The greatest range, 43 percentage points, appeared when Geometry was examined by socio-econornic status. Here, as well as throughout this report, it Is important to remember that some students from the lower socio-economic quartile had taken Algebra I and II or Geometry and some from the highest quartile had taken Remedial Math, General Math, Pre-Algebra, and Consumer or Business Math. After socio-economic status, family type showed substantial differences in relation to most of the math courses. In general, those youngsters who were living with both parents were most likely have taken Algebra I and ll or Geometry courses and those living with someone other than a natural or adoptive parent were more likely to have taken some of the other math courses. Science Classes f3iology was by far the most frequently taken science class with 86% of the tenth graders having taken at least one-half semester. The next most frequently indicated co, 'rse was General Physical Science with 44% having taken at least a half semester. The percentages having taken various amounts of science courses were as follows: General Science: none, 72%; one-half year, 3%; one year, 21%; one and one-half years, 1%; two years, 3% General Physical Science: none, 1%; one-half year, 56%; one year, 5%; one and one-half years, 37%; two years, 1%; Biology: none, 14%; one-half year, 6%; one year, 76%; one and one-half years, 1%; two years, 2%; Earth Science: none, 71%; one-half year, 5%; one year, 23' ,3; one and one-half years, .4%; two years, 1%; Chemistry: none, 83%; one-half year, 2%; one year, 14%; one and one-half years, .3%; two years, .2%; Principles of Technology: none, 98%; one-half year, 1-0; one year, 1%; one and one-half years, .1%; two years, .2%; Physics: none, 95%; one-half year, 2%; one year, 3%; one and one-half years, .2%; two years, .3%; Other Science: none, 89%; one-half year, 3%; one year, 7%; one and one-half years, 2%; two years, 1%. None of the variables showed substantial differences in the percent of tenth graders who had taken Principles of Technology, Physics, or Other Science. Ethnicity, socio-economic status, and region showed substantial differences in the percent who had taken Biology. The highest perc:nt of any sub-group saying they had taken at least a semester of Biology was 93% of the tenth graders in the highest socio-economic quartile. The lowest percent was Native American, 70%. Differer;ces related to ethnicity appeared for five of the science courses. Asian Americans were most likely to have taken Chemistry and least likely to have taken General Physical Science, General Science and, with Hispanics. Earth Science Native Americans showed the highest percent having taken an Earth Science course an.4 the lowest percent having taken Chemistry 2cs Differences related to region appeared for Biology, General Physical Science, Earth Science, and Chemistry. The largest difference, 23 percentage points, appeared in relation to region and General Physical Science with tenth graders from the Northeast being least likely and those from the South being most likely to have had such a course. Those from the North Central and Southern regions were least likely and those from the Northeast were most likely to have taken an Earth Science course. The range across regions in the percent who had taken a Biology course was from 78% of Western tenth graders to 90% of those living in the South and Northeast. Socio-economic status showed a difference related to Biology, Chemistry, and General Science. Those from the highest socio-economic quartile were most likely to have taken Biology and Chemistry and least likely to have taken General Science. Conversely, those from the lowest socio-economic status quartile were least likely to have taken Biology and Chemistry and most likely to have taken General Science. Family type showed a difference in relation to Chemistry and General Science. Those living vitth both parents were most likely to have taken Chemistry and least likely to have taken General Science. Language and the Arts Many tenth graders, almost two-thirds, had taken a foreign language, but few, art, 36%; music, 31%; drama, 21%, had taken arts courses in the ninth or tenth grade. The percentages of tenth graders taking various amounts of humanities courses were as follows: Foreign Language: none, 36%; one-half year. 4%; one year, 22%; one and one-half years, 2%; two years, 36%; Art: none, 64%; one-half year, 11%; one year, 17%; one and one-half years, 2%; two years, 6%; Music: none, 69%; one-half year, 5%; one year, 10%; one and one-haif years, 2%; two years, 14%; Drama: none, 89%; one-half year, 4%; one year. 4%; one and one-half years, .5% ; two years, 2%. All of the variables examined in this study showed substantial differences in the percentage taking foreign language courses. Three of the variables, socio-economic quartile. ethnicity, and region showed differences of 25 percentage points or more Those from the highest socio-economic quartile, Asians, and those from the Northeast were most likely to have taken a foreign language before they completed the tenth grade. Those from the lowest socio-economic quartile, Native Americans, and those from the South were least likely to have taken a foreign language.\nBoys were more likely to have taken a vocational course than were girls. Students from the South and West were most likely and those from the Northeast were least likely to have taken a vocational course. African Americans were most likely and European Americans were least likely to have taken such courses. Those who lived with their father and a stepmother were most likely and those who lived with both parents were least likely to have taken a vocational course. Specific Vocational Courses The range in the percent of youth who had taken a specific vocational/technical course during the ninth or tenth grade was from 8% having taken a consumer education course and 7% having taken an agricultural class to almost half, 49%, having taken a typing or word processing course. A fourth or slightly more than a fourth had taken a Computer Education, Shop, or Home Economics course. When the percentages for Home Economics and Consumer Education were combined, it was clear that less than a third of the students who were tenth graders in 1990 had taken such a family-focused course in their first two years of high school The percentages of tenth graders taking various amounts of vocational-technical courses were as follows: Computer Science: none, 82%; one-half year, 10%; one year, 6%; one and one-half years, .4%; two years, 1%; Computer Education: none, 72%; one-half year, 16%; one year, 10%; one and one-half years, 1%; two years, 2%; Computer Literacy: none, 88%; one-half year, 8%; one year, 4%; one and one-half years, .2%; 2'0,0 two years. 4%. Tvoing Word Processiho: none. 51%; one-half year, 20%; one year. 25%; one and one-half years 1%; two years. 2%: Shop: none, 75%; one-half year, 6%; one year, 12%; one and one-half years 1%; two years, 6%; Home Economics: none, 76%; one-half year, 8%; one year, 13%; one and one-half years .7%; two years, 2%; Consumer Education: none, 94%; one-half year, 3%; one year, 3%; one and one-half years, .1%; two years, .2%; Career Exploration: none, 91%; one-half year, 6%; one year, 3%; one and one-half years .2%; two years, .3%. Agriculture: none, 93%; one-half year, 2%; one year, 3%; one and one-half years, .2%; two years, 2%. Three courses, Consumer Education, Career Exploration, and Computer Literacy did not show ranges of 10 or more percentage points for any of the seven variables. Several substantial differences appeared when the percent taking vocational-technical courses was examined according to the study's variables. Flve of the six variables showed differences of 10 percentage points or more for all of the courses except Agriculture and Computer Education. Gender differences, ethnicity, and family type appeared for Typing/Word Processing, Home Economics, and Shop. Region showed differences related to Typing/Word Processing, and Computer Education. Family type also showed differences related to Computer Education. Socio-economic status showed differences related to Home Economics and Shop. Urbanicity showed differences related to Typing/Word Processing, Home Economics, Agriculture, and Shop. The greatest difference, 30 peNentage points, appeared in the percentages of girls and boys taking Shop. However, even though there were differences -girls, 10% and boys, 40%. -fewer than half of the boys had taken a shop course in their first two years of high school. Typing/word processing classes showed the highest percent of tenth graders having taken such a course. and showed the greatest number of substantial differences when seven variables were used. All except socio-economic status showed substantial differences. The greatest difference appeared related to family type with a range from 40% of those living with their father and a stepmother to 61% of those living with someone other than either family taking such courses. Girls, 57%, were somewhat more likely to have taken a typing or word processing class. However, a fairly sizeable percent of boys, 40%, had taken such a course. Tenth graders from the Northeast were least likely and those from the North Central were most likely to have taken typing/word processing classes. Rural tenth graders were more likely to have taken such courses than were urban tenth graders. European American tenth graders were most likely and Native Americans were least likely to have taken such courses. Home Economics and Shop showed substantial differences on the same five variables. Boys were considerably more likely to have taken Shop (40% to 10%) and somewhat less likely to have taken Home Economics than girls (14% to 33%). Those from the lowest socio-economic quartile were most likely and those from the highest quartile were least likely to have taken Home Economics or Shop. Native Americans were most likely and Asians were least likely to have taken these courses. Those living with both parents were least likely to have taken Home Economics or Shop. Agriculture showed substantial differences related to urbanicity and 4-H. However, even among rural youngsters only 14% had taken an Agricultural class in 9th or 10th grade. Those who were in 4-H In the eighth grade were more likely to have taken a vocational agriculture course than those who had never been in 4-H. It was interesting to note that differences between girls, 3%, and boys, 10%, taking agriculture did not reach 10 percentage points. The other ranges in percent taking Agriculture that were not substantial were as follows: SES -highest 3% to 11% lowest quartile; ethnicity -Asian Americans 3% to 9% Native Americans; and region -Northeast 2% to 10% South."}, {"section_title": "Joint Decision", "text": "Relatively few tenth graders portrayed decision making in their fan* as being joint. The range was from 8% saying that they and their parents jointly decided how the tenth grader would spend his or her own money to 28% saying that they and their parents jointly decided whether to go to college and how late to stay out. Percentages indicating that they jointly made ether decisions were as follows: how late you can stay out, 28%; if you can have a job, 24%; classes you will take, 21%; age you can leave school, 18%; whether you can date, 17%: friends you spend time with, 11%; being in school sports, 9%; being in school activities, 9%; how you will spend your money, 8% Tenth Grader's Decision Either the tenth graders were very much in control of their own decisions or they wanted to appear that way. The range in the percent saying they made their own de.r.isions without discussing them with their parents was from 9% deciding how late to stay out to 70% saying they decided how to spend their money, being in school sports, and being in school actMties. Ihe other percentages where tenth grade indicated making the sole decision were as follows: friends you spend time with, 65%; whether you can date, 51%; classes you will take, 44%; going on to college, 39%; if you can have a job. 38%; and age you can leave school, 25%."}, {"section_title": "Parent(s) Decsion", "text": "Very few tenth graders saw their parents as arbitrarily making decisions for them without at least discussing the decision with them. However, over a third said that their parent(s) alone made the decision about the age at which the tenth grader could leave school and how late they could stay out. At the other extreme, only 2% said that their parent(s), without discussion, decided whether they could take part in school activities. The percentages of tenth graders who said their parents made decisions without consulting them were as follows: age you can leave school, 39%; how late you can stay out, 340/0; whether you can date, 11%; going on to college, 7%; friends you spend time with, 6%; if you can have a job, 6%: classes you will take, 3%; how you will spend your money, 3%; being in school sports. 3%; and being in scnool activities, 2%."}, {"section_title": "Dating", "text": "Decisions about dating showed a fairly mixed pattern. One out of ten said their parents made the decision. Over a third said there was discussion, and about half said they made this decision without consulting their parents. The percentages saying that various people made decisions abodt whether the tenth grader can date were as follows: parent(s) only, 11%; parents after discussing with the tenth grader, 9%; jointly between parent and tenth grader, 17%; respondent after discussing with parent(s), 12%; tenth grader without discussing with parents, 51%. All three categories showed substantial differences when sex of students and ethnicity were examined. Girls, 70%. were considerably more likely to have their parents make this decision for them or to make it through discussion. Boys, 71%, were much more likely to make the decision without consulting their parents. One in twenty boys and about one in five girls said their parents decided if they could date. Euopean American tenth gradxs were most likely and African-American tenth graders were least likely to make this decision on their own. African Americans were most likely to have a parent making the decision, although fewer than one in five indicated that their parents made the decision about their dating. Over half of the European American tenth graders said they made this kind of decision without discussing it with their parents. Substantial differences related to ethnicity only appeared related to parent or tenth grader making the decision. Tenth graders in the Northeast were most likely and those in the South were least likely to make this decision without discussion. Substantial differences related to region only appeared related to discussing and tenth grader making the decision. Tenth graders in the Northeast were least likely and those from the South were most likely to jointly discuss decisions. Those from the South were least likely and those from the Northeast were most likely to make their own decisions. Those living with both parents were least likely and those living with the father only were most likely to make their own decisions. How Late Over three times more parents than tenth graders decided without discussion how late the tenth grader could stay out. Almost three-fifths reached a decision through discussing together, although only a fourth thought the decision was a joint decision. The percentages saying that various peoplei. de decisions about how late the tenth grader can stay out were as follows: parent(s) only, 34%; parents atter discussing with the tenth grader, 22%; jointly between parent and tenth grader, 28%: respondent after discussing with parent(s), 8%; tenth grader without discussing with parents, 9%. Differences in the percent making their own decisions were not substantial."}, {"section_title": "School Sports", "text": "Most, se ,en out of ten, tenth graders said they did not consutt their parents when they made their decision about whether or not to take part In school sports. Almost three in ten said that there was some discussion. 1 he percentages showing which of the various people matte decisions about the tenth grader going out for sports were as follows: parent(s) only, 3%, parents after discussing with the tenth grader, 4%; jointly between parent and tenth grader, 9%; respondent after discussing with parent(s), 16%; tenth grader without discussing with parents. 70%. Family type showed a difference with those living with their father only most likely to discuss taking part in sports and least likely to make the decision on their own. Those living with someone other than a parent were least likely to discuss going out for school sports and most likely to do so if they lived with their father only. School ActMties The same proportion held for decisions about taking part in school activities. The percentages saying that various people made decisions about the tenth grader taking part in school activities were as follows: parent(s) only, 3%; parents after discussing with the tenth grader, 3%; jointly between parent and tenth grader, 9%; respondent after discussing with parent(s), 16%; tenth grader without discussing with parents, 70%. Only one substantial difference appeared when the six main variables were examined. Those living with someone other than a parent were least likely and those living with their father only were most likely to discuss taking part in activities other than sports. There was a closer to equal division in decision making about the age at which the tenth grader could leave school. The largest percent, over a third, said parents made this decision; the next largest, again over a third but not quite as many, said it was made through discussion. A fourth said that they made (would make) the decis'on without consulting their parents. The percentages saying that various people made decisions about the age at which the tenth grader can leave school were as follows: parent(s) only, 39%; parents after discussing with the tenth grader, 10%; jointly between parent and tenth grader, 18%; respondent after discussing with parent(s), 9%; tenth grader without discussing with parents, 25%. None of the variables showed a substantial difference related to discussion on decisions. Only one variable, family type, seemed to affect whether the parent or tenth grader made the decision. Those living with someone other than either parent were least likely to say the parent(s) made the decision arid most likely to say they themselves did. Those living with both parents were least likely to say they made the decision themselves and most likely to say their parents did. Going to College Well over half of the tenth graders said that they discussed going to college with their parents. Over a third said they made their decision without consutting their parents. Somewhat less than one in ten said their parents made the decision for them. The percentages saying that various people made decisions about the tenth grader going to college were as follows: parent(s) only, 7%; parents after discussing with the tenth grader, 6%; jointly between parent and tenth grader, 26%; respondent after discussing with parent(s), 20%; tenth grader without discussing with parents, 39%. Ethnicity showed a substantial difference both in terms of the parent and in terms of the tenth grader making this decision. Asian Americans were most likely to say that their parents made the decision, over one in ten, but almost half the Native Americans said that they made the decision without consulting their parents. Tenth graders from the lowest socio-economic quartile were most likely and those from the highest quartile were least likely to say that they made decisions about going to college without consulting their parents. Family type also showed substantial differences. Tenth graders were more likely to discuss with their parents whether to start a job than they were to make tne decision on their own. However, the majority of tenth graders say they spend their money without consulting their parents Having a Job More tenth graders, almost three fifths, indicated discussing whether or not they could have a job than made that decision without consulting a parent. The percentages saying that various people made decisions about whether the tenth grader can have a job were as follows: parent(s) only, 6%; parents after discussing with the tenth grader, 9%; jointly between parent and tenth grader, 24%; respondent after discussing with parent(s), 24%; tenth grader without discussing with parent(s), 38%. Both showed substantial differences in addition to family type; ethnicity showed a slightly greater difference in range than did socio-economic quartile. Here the ethnic range was between Asian Americans and Native Americans with Native Americans most likely and Asian Americans least likely to make the decision on their own. Again, those from the highest socio-economic quartile were most likely and those from thelowest quartile were least likely to discuss this decision with their parents. Those living with someone other than either parent were most likely to make decisions about a job by themselves and those lMng with both parents were least likely. Spending Own Money The majority, seven out of ten, said they spent their money without consulting thek parents. Somewhat more than a fourth said that there was discussion and a very few said that their parents make the decision. The percentages saying that various people made decisions about how the tenth grader will spend his or her money were as follows: parent(s) only, 3%; parents after discussing with the tenth grader, 4%; jointly between parent and tenth grader, 8%; respondent after discussing with parent(s), 15%; tenth grader without discussing with parents, 70%. Ethnicity and family type showed substantial differences. Again Native Americans were most likely to make their own decision without consultation and Asian Americans were most likely to discuss it with their parents. Those living with their mother and stepfather were most likely to make the decision on their own. Those living with someone other than either parent were most likely to consult with others on how he or she will spend their money. Discussion: By the time young people are 16 or 17, they are moving toward independence in making decisions. This section of data is of interest because it indicates the range in the areas in which teens felt their parents were making the decisions and where they thought they had control. The variance in pattern for each item and the variance in relation to family type needs to be considered by those working with this age group. For example, when major decisions are needed related to the teens participation in less usual activities such as overnight trips, some youngsters may be empowered by their parents to make the decision without discussion Others may not be cleared to go unless the parent talks to the person directing the program. The finding that two out of five tenth graders make decisions about what classes to take at school without discussing those decisions with parents may be of special concern to school personnel and to some parents. Although in some cases, parents may not be well equipped to help youngsters make the right decision, perhaps in others the fact that parents have not been consulted results in youth being ill prepared for future school or work."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSING SCHOOL WITH PARENT(S)", "text": "Most tenth graders seemed to be talking to their parent(s) Only occasionally about school related topics. Grades was the top;c about which the highest percent said they frequently talked with their parents and the lowest percent said they never did so. Almost half of the tenth graders said that they and their parents often discussed grades during the first half of the school year. About one in twenty said they never did so. Only one tenth grader in fivo said they had often discussed selecting school courses and programs with a parent or guardian during the first half of the school year. Almost one in five said that they had done so. One in four said they had discussed school activities often. At the other extreme, one in five said they had never discussed school activities with a parent or guardian during the first half of the school year. One in five said they often discussed things studied in class and one in five said they never did so. The majority, three in five, talked about them sometimes. Over half said they did never discussed preparing for ACT or SAT tests. Over a third, 38%, of the comparisons overall yielded substantial differences. The percent of the 14 comparisons per variable that yielded differences of ten percent or more when variables were examined were as follows: family type, 79%; socio-economic status, 79%; ethnicity, 4.3%; region, 21%; and urbanicity, 7%. None of the differences were as great as ten percentage points when sex of student was examined. Not all of the questions were asked in the eighth grade. Those which were asked took a somewhat different format so it is not possible to make a direct comparison on frequent discussion. However, it would appear that the percentage saying that they never discussed some of the aspects of school with their parents had increased slightly by the tenth grade."}, {"section_title": "Frequent", "text": "Although most tenth graders occasionally talked to their parents about school, few did so frequently. The topic that the largest percentage (fewer than half) said they talked about was grades.

About one in twenty said they never did so. The percentages according to frequency of discussing things studied in class with a parent or guardian during the first half of the school year were as follows: never, 6%; sometimes, 46%; often, 48%. There were no substantial differences in the percent never discussing grades when the six variables in the study were examined. However, family type, socio-economic quartile and region showed differences in relation to the percent who often discussed grades. Tenth graders living with their fathers were as likely as othe:z to have discussed their grades at least sometimes with a parent but only a third said they did so often. Over half of those living with someone other than a parent said that they discussed grades often. Those from the highest socio-economic quartile and from the South were most likely and those from the lowest socio-economic quartile and from the North Central region were least likely to have discussed grades often during the first half of the year. This question was not asked in the eighth grade survey. North Central 42% to South 52% 10 School Courses Only one tenth grader in five said they had often discussed selecting school courses and programs with a parent or guardian during the first half of the school year. Almost one in five said that they had never done so. The percentages according to frequency of discussing school courses with a parent or guardian during the first half of the school year were as follows: never, 16%; sometimes, 61%; often, 20%. Both the percent saying often and the percent saying never showed substantial differences related to socio-economic status and family type. Those living with their father only were least likely to discuss school courses and program selection with a parent. Tenth graders from the highest socio-economic quartile were more likely to have discussed school courses with their parents than were those from the lowest quartile. However, among those in the highest quartile. only about a fourth said they often discussed school courses with their parents. Asian-American tenth graders were most likely and European American eighth graders were least likely to have never discussed school subjects with their parents. The eighth grade survey asked how often eighth graders had discussed selected courses or school programs with their parents since the beginning of that school year. The responses were as follows: not at all, 15%; once or twice, 47%; three or more times, 39%.\nOver three in five said their parents had not received any warnings about grades this school year. However, almost one in ten saki that their parents had received three or mon, warnings. The percent indicating various numbers of warnings about tenth graders' grades were as follows: none, 62%; one or two, 32%; three or more, 7%. Differences in the percent indicating no warnings about grades appeared in relation to ethnicity, region, and socio-economic status. Native Americans were least likely and Asian Americans were most likely to not have received a warning about grades. Tenth graders from the Northeast were least likely and those from the South were most likely not to have received warnings about grades. Those from the lowest socio-economic status quartile were least likely and those from the highest quartile were most likely not to have received warnings about grades. About the same percentage of parents had received warnings about grades in the tenth as in the eighth grades. The responses to this question in the eighth grade survey were as follows: never, 63%; once or twice, 29%; three or more times, 8%. Attendance Three-fourths of the tenth graders said that their parents had not been warned about their attendance. One in twenty said that their parents had received three or more warnings during the first half of the school year. The percent indicating various numbers of warnings about tenth graders' attendance were as follows: none, 75%; one or two, 20%; three or more, 5%. Differences in the percent receiving no warnings appeared for ethnicity, socio-economic status, region and family type. Asian Americans were most likely to report no warnings about attendance and Native Americans were least likely to do so. Those from the highest socio-economic status were least likely and those from the lowest level were most likely to report no such warnings. Western students were least likely and Southern tenth graders were most likely to report no warnings about attendance. Those living with their mother only were least likely and those living with both parents were most likely to say their parents had not received a warning about their attendance. More parents in the tenth grade survey had received warnings about attendance of their children than they had in the eighth grade survey. The responses to this question in the eighth grade survey were as follows: never, 88%; once or twice, 9%; three or more times, 3%.\nMost tenth graders thought that getting good grades is important. Only about one in ten thought that grades were not important. Students were more likely to recall getting A and B grades than they were C or lower. Regardless of course, over a third said they earned a grade of B or better in the four basic courses that were asked about in the survey. In comparison, only about a fourth of the tenth graders recalled getting grades of C or less than C.\nHalf of the tenth graders said their friends thought it was very important to get good grades. About one in twenty said their friends gave good grades no importance. The percentages indicating varying degrees in the extent to which their friends thought getting good grades was important were as follows: not, 6%; somewhat, 44%; and very 50%. Again, ethnicity and sex of student showed differences. Less than half of the European American tenth graders said that their friends thought getting good grades was important compared with two-thirds of the African-American tenth graders. More girls, 56%, said their friends thought good grades were very important than did boys, 44%. Discussion: It is of concern that a fairly large percentage of tenth graders were under the impression that their friends did not think studying was very important. This finding coincides with information about the small amount of time spent on homework. Have teachers reduced pressure for studying and let so many kids get by without studying that tenth graders no longer see studying as being an important activity? Have they gained the feeling that one can learn without studying? If tenth graders responded to the term as meaning applying themselves and learning on their own, this finding is especially disconcerting in that lifelong learning depends upon people having both the skills and the discipline to seek out and master information. Or perhaps teachers have been able to induce the same kind of concentrated attention through inquiry approaches or other means so that the activity goes on and skills are built up but that the term studying is no longer an appropriate label for the activity. It is of interest that those of ethnic backgrounds other than European American were more likely to view their friends as thinking studying and attending class was very important. Do others feel they have to work harder to succeed? If teens of European-American heritage feel studying is less important, will more of them fall behind those students of other heritages who place more importance on school performance? Or do others feel they must study harder because they feel at a disadvantage because what they are studying is imbedded in a culture other than their own? Although socialization by gender seemed to be eliminated in some other aspects of the study, there remained a difference in.how boys and girls viewed the importance of being an active educational participant. Currently \"white\" men are less likely automatically to get the best jobs because they are \"white and they are men. Those boys, and especially those European-American boys, who do not accord schooling high importance may find themselves at a greater disadvantage in the job market than their fathers and grandfathers. Parents of European-American heritage may need to pay more attention to changes in the employment market and be less tolerant if they have sons who are do not give school performance high priority."}, {"section_title": "Things Studied", "text": "One in five said they often discussed things studied in class and one in five said they never did so.

Granted that teens of this age are striving for independence, adults do not loose their independence through sharing. Discussing such things as school activities, and things learned usually does not necessitate parents stepping in and making decisions. It is also of concern that youngsters from lower socio-economic status were somewhat less likely to discuss school happenings with their parents.

Special programs for potential dropouts may or may not be the best way to help youngsters who are potential dropouts. It Is of interest that only 2% recognized that they were in such a program Given the importance of completing high school, it is hoped that other schools provide special assistance without having programs specifically labeled dropout prevention. The percentage of tenth graders who were in general programs and the low percentage that were in vocational programs was startling. Work force data indicate that there are fewer and fewer jobs available to youngsters right out of high school without any special preparation. One would have expected that the majority of programs would either have been vocational or college prep. Are schools not offering such programs, or are students not electing them? If vocational programs are offered, are they limited to only a few students with certain characteristics? Or are the programs outdated and not designed to meet future careers? Have school systems not revamped and publicized their vocationally-oriented programs? Many of the well-paying positions which do not require a college degree will require good preparation for technical courses after high school. To succeed in technical courses students need a good grounding in the basic subjects in high school. Unless general programs have been upgraded, those in general courses are not as likely to get adequate career preparation as are those in college preparatory or vocational programs.

More boys than girls placed in the ton quartile in the Science test in eighth grade but the difference was not as great as ten percentage points. Discussion: The pronounced effect of socio-economic status and ethnicity on test scores raises several questions. The first, of course, is whether any of the items in the test were biased toward any particular economic or cultural group. Another is that some youngsters may be helped to understand and build better test strategy than are others. But assuming that this is not the case, then one needs to explore why the relationship takes place. In some instances, it may be purely an economic reason either that the student is distracted because of being poor, or because the student lacks the extra experiences that economic solvency or affluence has given to other children. In other instances the main factor may be the lower educational level of the parents. There are tremendous implications for both the school system, for youth organizations, and for parenting programs in terms of the kinds of efforts needed to help youngsters from lower socio-economic families succeed in school and develop the skills needed to continue life long learning. The fact that Native Americans fairly consistently have the highest percentage showing the least success in school also is of special concern. Experts who have been studying the economic position of Native Americans point out that while the position of African American has made some increases over the past ten years, that of Native Americans has not. Socio-economic status, ethnicity, and family type showed marked differences both in grades and in test scores. It is to be noted, though, that the differences across ranges were greater in relation to test scores where there was no mediation of human judgment. For instance, teacher determi led grades are based in part on the tests that he or she develops within the context of the community, school, and class setting. Unless the test items were very culturally biased (and in a national study with the amount of recent attention to cultural biases in tests one would not expect bias), it would appear that teachers rather than being negatively biased related to socio-economic class and other cultural affects, may be more understanding."}, {"section_title": "Proficiency Levels", "text": "In addition to scores on tests, the NELS study team also developed proficiency scores In Math and in Reading for each student.

However, they showed more differences than most other areas in that 42%, overall, showed substantial differences.

Substantial differences appeared related to low proficiency and high proficiency but none appeared related to Level 2. As might be expected, ethnicity and socio-economic status showed differences at each level. Asian-American and highest socio-economic status quartile youngsters had the lowest percentages at the lowest levels and the highest percentages at the highest levels. Native Amercians showed the highest percent below Level 1 and the lowest percent in Level 4, but African Americans showed the highest percent in Level 1 and the lowest percent in Level 3. These scores were not examined in the eighth grade. Discussion: Most schools indicated that they were providing remedial classes and other kinds of help. Still some youngsters reach the tenth grade and are below adequate levels in Reading and in Mathematics. Here as elsewhere, ethnicity, socio-economic status, and family type show differences in the percent below Level 1. Region also shows a difference in relation to the percent at the highest level of proficiency. Communities may need to pay more attention to the kinds of programs which can help parents and teachers of those children who need to build proficiency in reading and math. There would appear to be some excelient programs developed, but school systems or community groups need to help parents and teachers secure and use them.

Did the fact that many said they did not fall behind and some said they did not have to catch up on work mean that they were such good students that they could keep up, or did it mean that their classes were moving so slowly that they really didn't miss much? It is also of concern that some of the schools did not follow up either with parents or with the students themselves about unexcused absences. Granted large systems and parents working make it hard for school systems to get in touch with the family. Granted also that teachers may get tired of talking with students about absences.

Socio-economic status showed a difference in the percentage spending 10 or more hours on homework with a third of those in the highest quartile spending this amount of time compared with somewhat over one tenth of those in the lowest quartile. Family type showed differences in relation to spending 10 or more hours on homework outside of school as well as spending no time out of school.

The percentages according to frequency of going to class without having homework completed were as follows: never, 19%; seldom, 62%; often, 13%; and usually 6%. The percentages found in the eighth grade survey were never, 28%; seldom, 51%; often, 14%; and usually 8%. Going to school without homework may have become more pervasive across characteristics between the eighth and tenth grados. Ethnicity, socio-economic status, and family type showed differences of 10 percentage or more in the eighth grade responses. Only family type showed a substantial difference in the percent saying they often or usually went to class without their homework being completed. Those who lived with their father only were most likely to frequently attend without homework. Prepared for Class One in ten often or usually went to class without paper and pencil; almost the same number often or usually went to class without books.

Three substantial differences appeared in the tenth grade data but they did not form a pattern. Boys were more likely to say they often or usually went to class without paper and pencils. Those living with someone other than either parent were most likely to indicate they never went to class without paper and pencil. Tenth graders from the South were least likely and those from the North Central region were most likely say they never went to class without paper and pencils. Ethnicity was the oniy variable showing a difference in the percent who said they went to class without their books. European American tenth graders were least likely and Native Americans were most likely to do this. Discussion: It is hard to decide whether to be concerned about the large number of students who appear to do relatively little homework. The finding in the eighth grade data was of concern but it was expected that students would settle down in high school and do a lot more studying. It is possible that teachers have given up and just don't give much homework. However, even if teachers have found new teaching strategies that make homework less necessary or have realized that some homework of yesteryear was primarily busy work and not essential to students learning, there may be problems with not expecting students to study extensively outside of class. Regardless of whether it helps them to master what is expected in the tenth grade, spending little time studying outside of class may lessen the students' ability to build the skills and discipline needed for them to learn on their own when they are out of school. Also, more youth apparently have their evenings and weekends free which may, or may not, leave more time for inappropriate social behavior."}, {"section_title": "Dropouts", "text": "The National Educational Longitudinal Study which started in 1988 was interested in identifying how many of the original sample were still in school at the time their cohort reached the tenth grade."}, {"section_title": "WHAT HAPPENED TO THE EIGHT GRADE SAMPLE", "text": "Among the 20,706 eighth graders that they attempted to follow, 5 were deceased, 116 were out of the country, 61 were ineligible, 549 refused, 182 couldn't be located, 529 were listed as other nonrespondents, and 19,264 participated.

The fact that more of the dropouts had been in a \"general\" program is of interest for two reasons. C ne it suggests that the lack of visible career preparation may be a factor.

The percent expecting to stop their schooling after high school remained about the same between eighth and tenth grade. Eleven percent of the eighth graders expected to stop with high school graduation. The percent expecting to go to a vocational or trade school increased from 9% to 16%. It is not possible to make a direct comparison in relation two years of college in that the eighth grade question was asked somewhat differently. The eighth grade responses were as follows: will attend college, 13%; will graduate from college, 43%. Fewer tenth graders than eighth graders thought they would stop after graduating from college; about the same percent thought they would do advanced work. Among the eighth graders 23% thought they would do advanced work after completing a baccalaureate degree.

Some, 17%, expected to wait a year or more, and some, 10%, dkin't know when they would go to college. Only 2% expected to wait more than a year (15% a year) before going to college. Fourteen percent said they did not plan to go to college. Socio-economic status made the most difference in planning to go on to school right after high school. Twice as many of the tenth graders in the highest socio-economic quartile as in the lowest quartile said they were going on right after high school. Substantial differences appeared related to ethnic heritage with Asian Americans being most sure they would go on right after high school. In regard to family type, tenth graders living with father and a stepmother were more likely to plan to go on to college right after high school than were others. Those who expected to wait more than a year before attending college appeared in about the same percentage in each of the subgroups of the seven variables. There were no substantial differences. This question was not asked in the eighth grade survey. Parent's Desire Most tenth graders thought their parents wanted them to continue their schooling beyond high school. Over half thought that their parents wanted them to complete college. Only 1% said their mother or father did not expect them to graduate from high school. Five percent said their parents expected them to stop after high school. Small percentages thought their parents expected them to complete less schooling than college graduation. The specific responses were as follows: father, <1% less than high school graduation; 5% graduation from high school but not any further; 6% vocational, trade or business school; 4% attend two-year college; 9% attend four-year college; 41% graduate from college; 17% attend a higher level of school after graduating from college; 8% don't know; 2% parent doesn't care; 7% doesn't apply; mother, 1% less than high school graduation; 5% graduation from high school but not any further; 5% vocational, trade or business school; 5% attend two-year college; 9% attend four-year college; 44% graduate from college; 19% lttend a higher level of school after graduating from college; 6% don't know; 1% parent doesn't care; 4% doesn't apply.

The eighth grader responses were as follows: father, 1% less than high school graduation; 5% graduation from high school but not any further; 6% vocational, trade or business school; 10% attend college; 43% graduate from college; 24% attend a higher level of school after graduating from college; 10% don't know; mother, 5% less than high school graduation; 6% graduation from high school but not any further; 6% vocational, trade or business school; 10% attend college; 46% graduate from college; 26% attend a higher level of school after graduating from college; 7% don't know. There was no substantial difference in the percent indicating that they did not know how much schooling their mother or father expected them to complete. Ethnicity, socio-economic status, and family type most frequently showed differences in the percentage thinking their mother or father expected them to complete a certain amount of schooling. There was no difference of 10 or more percentage points in the percent saying their mother did not care how much schooling they completed. However, a sizeable difference appeared on this response related to family type and father's caring. The range was from 1% of those living with both parents to 28% of those living with their mothers only. Family type was the only variable showing a significant difference in relation to their mother (but not their father) expecting that they would not graduate from high school. Of thinking their mother did not expect them to graduate from high school the range was from 3% of those living with someone other than their parents to 18% of those living with their father only. Ethnicity and family type were the variables that showed at least a 10 percentage point difference in the percent who thought their father expected them to graduate from high school and go no further with their education. However, when it came to their views of their mothers' expectations, ethnicity did not show that great of a difference but socio-economic status did (highest quartile, 1% to 12, lowest lowest quartile). Only socio-economic status showed a substantial difference in the percent believing their mothers expected them to complete vocational, business, or trade school. The range was from 2% of the highest quartile to 12% of the lowest quartile. Differences related to their fathers' expectations that they attend such schools did not reach 10 percentage points. Ethnicity and socio-economic status both showed differences in the percent indicating that their father or their mother expected them to graduate from college. Youngsters with European-American parents were most likely to say that their father and/or their mother expected them to graduate from college. However, less than half indicated they thought this was so. Family type also had a substantial percentage relating to their mother's expectations related to graduating from college. Asian Americans were most likely and Native Americans were least likely to say that their father or mother expected them to complete more formal schooling beyond a bachelor's degree. Mother/stepfather <1% to father only 13% As might be expected, the percent of those in the lowest socio-economic status quartile were least likely and those in the highest quartile were most likely to feel that their father and/or mother expected them to graduate from college or expected them to complete schooling beyond a bachelor's degree. About half of those in the highest quartile thought that one or both parents expected them to graduate from college and an additional percent, almost a third, said that one or both parents expected them to attend a higher level of school after graduating from college. Family type also showed some substantial differences related to the kind of school the respondent expected to attend two-year or four-year. Beliefs About Others' Expectations of More Schooling The tenth graders were given a list of nine responses and asked what seven kinds of people would say as to what they should do after high school. They also had an opportunity to say that views of the particular person did not apply. The percent indicating that a kind of person was not applicable ranged from mother 1%, close relatives, 2%; friends, 4%; father, 7%; school counselor, 8%: favorite teacher, 9%; to coach, 35% (28% of the boys and 42% of the girls said that coach did not apply)."}, {"section_title": "Expectation", "text": "Many tenth graders feit that significant others wanted them to go to college. The range in percent of tenth graders feeling people expected them to go to college was from about a third thinking the coach and/or their friends expected them to do so to two-thirds saying their mother expected them to do so (father or dose relative, three-fifths; school counselor or favorite teacher, somewhat more than half). However, either the expectations in regard to others differed to some degree related to the ethnic, socio-economic, and family situation of the tenth grader, or tenth graders projected similar views onto others. For example, regardless of the category asked about, the highest percent indicating that the individual wanted him or her to go on to college appeared for Asian Americans. Those from higher socio-economic status family were more likely to view others as wanting them to go on after high school than were those from lower socio-economic status families.

European Americans, those from the highest SES quartile and those living with both parents showed the highest percent saying that the chances were very high that they would finish high school. However, it is to be noted that over 10% of each of these groups did not indicate that the chances were very high. Other family 63% to both parents 78% 15 College Almost half of the tenth graders said that the chances they would go on to college were very high. Only 13% said the chances were very low or low.

The percentage responses in relation to going to college were as follows: very low, 6%; low, 7%; fifty-fifty, 16%; high, 23%; very high, 49%. Socio-economic status showed the greatest difference. The range was from 26% of those in the lowest quartile to 74% of those in the highest quartile saying that the chances they would go on to college were very high. However, at the other extreme the range was from 2% in the highest quartile to 25% in the lowest quartile saying the chances were very low. Ethnicity, sex of student, and family type also showed substantial differences. Over half of the girls, half of the students of Asian-American heritage, and those living with both parents rated their chances very high. Only 10% of those living with both parents listed the chances as very low. Discussion: The fact that the most students are both expecting and are expected to take some kind of advanced schooling beyond high school and that the percentage did not drop off extensively between eighth and tenth grade is encouraging. However, for some it will be a concern that many more were thinking in terms of a college than were thinking in terms of formal technical education. There is some evidence that the number of jobs requiring technical education will increase during the early part of these young people's work life. Although it is encouraging that a fairly high percent of those in the lowest socio-economic status quartile expect to complete schooling beyond high school, it is of concern that many who realize the importance of further schooling will face such high barriers that they will not act upon their expectations."}, {"section_title": "FACTOF,s INFLUENCING CHOICE OF COLLEGE", "text": "Over half of the respondents indicated that availability of specific courses, academic reputation, and availability of financial aid were very important in their choice of a college.

Discussion: It was very clear not only that tenth graders and their parents expected the tenth grader to continue his or her schooling, but that most relevant others also held those expectations. If this is in fact the case, the pressure must be great and the tenth grader who chooses something other than continuing schooling must feel at odds in not meeting others' expectations. It is to be noted in particular that relatively few girls felt that others expected them to get married soon after they completed high school. This is a major change from thirty or forty years ago. Women working and the press for gender equity has certainly changed the view that work was temporary until a girl married, to preparation for work as being essential regardless of whether a girl married."}, {"section_title": "TENTH GRADERS' EXPECTED OCCUPATION", "text": "About a fifth did not know what they expected to do immediately after high school. Only 7% said they were not planning to work right after high school. One in ten mentioned each of the three most frequently indicated occupations: clerical, military, and professional. Although there were varied responses in terms of occupation at age thirty, the largest number, ft ,r out of five, expected to be in some kind of professional position.

The percent of the 28 comparisons per variable that yielded differences of ten percent or more were as follows: ethnictty, 7%; socio-economic status, 7%; and sex of student, 4%. Family type, urbanicity and region did not show any substantial differences. immediately There was considerable diversity in the kinds of work tenth graders expected to do immediately after high school. About a tenth of the students each mentioned the three most frequently indicated areas, clerical, mtary, and professional. About a fifth dkl not know what they expected to do immediately after high school. Some of the 9% of the teens who indicated professional may have failed to realize that some of the fieldsaccountant, registered nurse, engineer, librarian, social worker -require a college education. Others may have been thinking of careers such as writer, actor, actress, athlete, or polttician. After clerical, military, and professional, the next most frequently indicated occupations were 7% service, 6% craftsman, 4% laborer; 4% sales; 3% manager. It is likely that some students misunderstood this question because some indicated occupations that would not be available to them right out cif high school -2% technical (draftsman, medical or dental technician, or computer program), 2% professional (including clergyman, dentist, physician, lawyer, scientist, and college teacher) and 2% school teacher. One percent indicated each of the following: farmer, homemaker only, operative, proprietor or owner, and protective service. Even though a high percentage indicated going on to school, only 7% said they were not planning to work right after high school. The only variable showing a substantial difference related to not working was socio-economic status. However, even though a higher percentage of teens from the highest socio-economic status quartile did not plan to work after high school, even in this group over 80% indicated an expected occupation immediately after high school. There were no substantial differences for the following when the seven variables were examined: craftsman, farmer, homemaker only. laborer, manager/administrator, operative, professional, professional, proprietor or owner, protective service, school teacher, and service. No variable affected all occupations. There seemed to be unique relationships appearing. For example, girls were more likely to expect to be in clerical occupations than boys and boys were somewhat more likely to be in the military. However, the difference in percent of boys and girls expecting to enter the military immediately after high school was only nine percentage points. Perhaps the most thought-provoking finding is that only 2% of the African American and 2% of the European American tenth graders expected to be in a technical occupation immediately after high school. Native American tenth graders were most likely to see themselves in technical positions. Age Thirty Forty percent of the tenth graders expected to be in one or another kind of professional position when they were thirty. Almost all, over 99%, expected to be working. Eleven percent said they dki not know what they would like to be doing when they were 30. In addition to the 22% that Indicated the professional category that included athlete and acting; 18% indicating the professional category that included dentist and college teacher. Four percent expected to be teachers; 1% operative; 5% each expected to be managers, proprietor/owners, or in technical positions. When the eighth and tenth grader responses were compared the percentages expecting to be a farmer (1% to 1%), homemaker (2% to 2%), clerical (3% to 3%), craftsman (4% to 4%), and laborer (1% to 1%), remained the same. The military decreased from 10% to 3%; service from 5% to 2%; sales from 4% to 2%; protective service increased from 1% to 3%. Slightly more than one in ten, 11%, said they did not know what kind of work they would do when they were thirty. The percentage of tenth graders expecting to be in a professional position increased over the percentage found in the eighth grade survey. The percent saying they didn't know remained the same. The eighth grade responses to the kind of occupation they expected to be in when they were thirty were as follows: professional, business or manager, 29%; science or engineering professional, 6%; military or security, 10%; owning a business, 6%; technical, 6%; craftsperson, 4%; farmer, 1%; housewife/homemaker 2%; laborer, 1%; salesperson, clerical, or office work, 3%; service worker, 5%; other 17%; don't know, 11%. Only one of the professional categories showed substantial differences related to a variable. The professional category which required the most academic preparation showed a difference relating to socio-economic status. Discussion: Just as the percent indicating they expected to go to college rather than a technical school raises flags, so does the high percentage aiming for professional work as compared with technical work. It is also of concern that relatively few saw themselves in professional or technical positions in science or engineering, even though there is considerable emphasis on science and math in today's school system. Are schools preparing students for positions they don't want? Or are schools and society not getting the message across to students about the kinds of jobs that will be available when they are thirty years of age. Putting those two findings aside, it is good to see that tenth graders are not all heading toward the same future occupations. Opinions About School Several questions were used to attempt to determine tenth graders' opinions and attitudes about school.

Discussion: It would appear that the standards and rules imposed by the larger society so far has had an impact of tenth graders and they are not willing to say that they condone behaviors that society has been vocal in repudiating. However, the larger society has not been as vocal about attendance, cutting classes and copying work, and tenth graders are more likely to see times and reasons when missing school is okay.

These questions were not asked in the 1988 survey so no comparison can be made. It is okay Most tenth graders, over ninety percent, thought it was okay to work hard for good grades, ask challenging questions, solve problems using new and original ideas, and help other students with their schoolwork. The percentages saying yes, it was okay, were as follows: to work hard for good grades, 97%; ask challenging questions, 92%; solve problems using new and original ideas, 93%; and help other students with their schoolwork, 92%. None of the variables examined in the study showed substantial differences. It appeared that these kinds of behaviors were seer. as okay regardless of such things as ethnic background, socio-economic status, sex of student, and family type. The largest difference in range across groups was seven percentage points which appeared related to socio-economic status and asking challenging questions. Discussion: It is encouraging that 10th graders said these behaviors were okay. It is particularly encouraging that almost all felt asking challenging questions and solving problems using new and original ideas were okay. The last item, helping other students with their school work could be viewed either as a positive statement (teaching each other) or as a negative behavior (letting someone else copy or telling someone el;.'e the answers).

Discussion: It is very difficult for a teacher to be equally interested in and responsive to every one of his or her students. Yet, if one believes in equal opportunity, each student deserves to get equal attention. It is apparent from some of the responses in the section on teacher respect that some students do not feel that teachers did not give them enough attention. Another point that emerges from this study seems to be that students disturb other student's learning, but that students think that is within what is appropriate in a school which has fair discipline and strict rules. This inconsistency may need attention within school systems. It is important for those working with older teens to note that praising hard work, really listening, and not putting teens down are areas where teens continue to be sensitive as they move from youth to adulthood The finding that there was relatively little difference on any of the items between the responses of the students as eighth graders and as tenth graders indicates that neither grade was viewed as markedly different on the characteristics covered in this question.

About a fourth had fewer than 400 students in the whole system (including 5% that had few. than 200 students in the whole school). Discussion: Both the 1988 and 1990 surveys showed that many of the youngsters who are viewed as being typical of ali youngsters come from very large schools. One wonders whether all youngsters get equal attention and help in large systems. Are there enough guidance counselors to go around? Is the size of the school one reason why more young people leave school before they were to graduate in 1990 than in 1960 when school systems were smaller? Is it one of the reasons why some youngsters do so poorly on standardized tests? In Iwo schools there must be a special effort to make each youngster feel that he or she is just as important to teachers and school personnel as every other youngster. Do youngsters in a large high school get the same feeling of \"community\" that those in a smaller school do? If not, what needs to be done to help youngsters build that sense of \"community\" that they will need in later years? Ori the other hand, what limitations if any do students face who attend the fewer small schools indicated in the study? Are offerings more limited? Are they less prepared for the environments of large universities? Do the face sufficient competition to stimulate learning? Are socio.economic differences more apparent and do they have more effect upon depressing students? 0 4., Neither a large or a small sized student body is necessarily harmful or helpful; it is the way that resources and size are handled in relation to the kind of direct interest and attention that each student receives. However, regardless of size, many schools are unable to equally meet the needs of all students. Those working with community youth program need to be sensitive to those tenth graders who feel ignored or neglected by the school system and need to try to augment formal school opportunities as well as help the school system and the youngster establish better rapport."}, {"section_title": "COURSES", "text": "There was considerable diversity in the courses that tenth graders had taken since they entered high school.

The percentages of tenth graders indicating frequency of using calculators were as follows: never, 28%; sometimes, 37%; often, 34%. Region showed marked differences in the use of the calculator. The range in percent saying they never used a calculator in math class was from 20% of Western students to 45% of those from the Northeast. The percent saying often ranged from 19% of the students from the Northeast to 45% of those from the North Central region. Ethnicity and socio-economic status also showed substantial differences both in those saying never and those saying often. European American tenth graders were most likely to say that they used a calculator. However, the European American students were about equally divided between never, sometimes, and often. Those from the lowest socio-economic quartile were least likely and those from the highest quartile were most likely to use calculators. However, only 40% from the top quartile said that they used them often. Family type showed a difference in percent saying they often used a calculator.

Discussion: Student responses indicate that there was considerable variation in the kinds of experiences tenth graders have in math and science courses. Some teachers are using a variety of methods and helping youth see how these two courses relate to the everyday world. Others are using traditional methods and teaching the content of texts through lecture and use of the blackboard. Some youngsters may have good reason for feeling that they are not challenged to use their minds and take these courses only because they are required. Adults in a community who use math and science in their everyday work might want to talk with local math and science teachers to see if they can be of any help to local teachers in making courses more interesting. Teachers of adults who teach Math and Science may want to help high school teachers perfect additional teaching methods. It is somewhat surprising that computers were not being used more in these classes. It may be that school districts could not afford enough computers for student use, or it may be that some teachers are not proficient enough in the use of computers to make them teaching tools in Science and Math classrooms. Businesses or organizations in communities may need to help school systems where school budgets cannot afford sufficient numbers of computers or afford the means for adequate number of teachers to become proficient in using computers in teaching."}, {"section_title": "EMPHASIS IN TENTH GRADE CLASSES IN 1992", "text": "The majority of tenth graders primarily saw mathematics, 82%, science, 73%, and vocational classes, 78%, emphasizing facts, steps, and rules.

About three-fourths of the students thought vocational classes put at least moderate emphasis on skills that were immediately usable. Three out of five recognized that there was at least a moderate emphasis on the role of science and math in work and how ideas from these two fields are involved in the manipulation of physical objects. Regardless of background characteristics, little of the variation in how students viewed what teachers had emphasized seemed related to one of the background characteristics of students which were examined in this study.

At the other extreme, only 23% felt their teachers gave major emphasis to increasing interest in mathematics. When moderate and major emphasis were combined, the range was from 57% saying there was an emphasis on increasing interest in mathematics to 82% saying there was at least a moderate emphasis on both facts and problem solving.

The percentages indicating various amount of emphasis on learning and memorizing malii facts, rules and steps were as follows: none, 4%; minor emphasis, 12%; moderate emphasis, 30%; major emphasis, 52%. Substantial differences in perception of major emphasis appeared related to ethnicity, socio-economic status, and family type. Hispanic Americans were liast likely and African Americans were most likely to feel their teachers gave major emphasis to facts, rules and steps. Those from the lowest socio-economic quartile were least likely and those from highest quartile were most likely to feel that learning and memorization of facts, rules, and steps was given major emphasis. Problem Solving However, they were equally likely to believe their teachers emphasized problem solving. The percentages indicating various amount of emphasis on problems and how to solve them were as follows: none, 5%; minor emphasis, 11%; moderate emphasis, 30%; major emphasis, 52%.

Ethnicity and family type showed differences. Asian Americans were least likely and Hispanic Americans were most likely to recognize that their teachers put at least a moderate amount of emphasis of hOw science and math operate related to tools. Discussion: What students perceive and what teachers actually do may not be the same. However, even if teachers in some cases were emphasizing something other than facts, rules, and skills, some students apparently did not understand what they were doing. There are only so many minutes in a class year. Those minutes are set by law. Teach..s have to use those minutes as effectively as possible. One of the greatest challenges to teachers today is the amount of time to give to various outcomes. Is it more important to create interest in the subject than it is to have students learn facts, rules and steps? Is it possible to solve problems without knowing some of the basics? Can the two be combined? The issue today is not necessarily whether or not to teach basic facts, rules, and steps, but what are the minimum set of facts, rules, and steps that a student should master in order to be best prepared for the future. The fact that usually fewer than half of those taking vocational courses recognized that teachers were helping them gain experience in using math and science in real situations is of concern. In some schools both vocational courses and the rcle of vocational courses in the technical preparation of students may need some revision PART D 6UMMARY OF ANALYSIS ACROSS GROUPS Which variables showed the most difference in how tenth graders responded to questions? Which items showed the greatest differences? We indicated at the beginning of this section three that substantial differences were differences across the ranges of subgroups which were as great or greater than ten percentage points. The ten percentage points were chosen as an arbitrary point after considering the proportions found in the responses to individual questions (example, percent saying yes compared to the percent saying no) and to the number of differences at various levels of percentage point difference. This section summarizes the results of the examinations of ranges across subgroups. You will find a slight difference in the way items are clustered in this section than in the previous section. We decided to reorder and do some regrouping when we did the final write of the previous sections. Perhaps the most apparent difference Is that we held future as a separate area in this analysis, big when we completed the organization of the data sections we divided future and put one part in Section A, and the other part which dealt with future education in Section C."}, {"section_title": "Definition of Terms", "text": "The following labels are used in this section. Variable. The term variable refers to the six characteristics (ethnicity, etc.) which were used in this analysis. Topic. Topic refers to the content of the questions that were asked in the survey. Cluster. Areas are further grouped into clusters. For example, further schooling is grouped with expected occupation and other views of the future in a cluster called Future. We arbitrarily established 11 clusters. Area. Items are grouped into \"areas\", made up of questions and parts of questions which deal with the same subject. For example, the questions dealing with if, when, and how far the tenth grader expected to continue schooling after high school are summarized in an area called further schooling. The more than 1,000 items were arbitrarily grouped into 54 areas. Item. An item is the smallest unit of a topic included in the survey. It is the unit on which comparison were made. Depending upon the nature of the question used in the NELS survey, an item may be one question (if only one choice of answer), one part of a question (such as each occupation within a list of occupations) or two extremes within the same part of a question when both extremes were examined to see if responses differed according to one of the six characteristics of the respondent (example, never or frequently late to school). A total of 1034 comparisons on items were made for each variable. A total of 6204 comparisons were made in the study. Substantial Difference. A difference of more than ten percentage points in the range between the lowest and highest subgroups has arbitrarily been called a substantial difference. In some cases this amount of difference between subgroups (for example between lowest and highest socio-economic quartiles) is a meaningful difference. In other instances it is not. Substantial simply designates items where differences were greater than in the majority of the comparisons."}, {"section_title": "Number of differences", "text": "In total, the six variables examined in this study, ethnicity, socio-econornic status, family type, sex of student, urbanicity, and region showed little difference for more than three-fourths of the items examined. Overall, less than a fourth, 22%, of the examinations of responses according to variables yielded differences in the range across subgroups of 10 or more percentage points. Variables However, almost two out of five of the comparisons, 39%, which examined ethnicity or family type showed differences across subgroups of 10 or more percentage points. The fewest differences, 5%, appeared for comparisons examining differences related to the extent of urbanness of the the community in which the student lived. Ethnicity and family type were clearly the two variables showing the most difference, followed by socio-economic status. Location as indicated by region and urbanicity seldom made a substantial difference in responses. Sex of student also showed few substantial differences. Ethnicity and family type did not always show the same percentages of substantial differences for each cluster and area. However, often they were higher than other variables. As was seen earlier in this report, when family type, ethnicity, and socio-economic status were cross tabbed against each other, it was apparent that the three are closely but not completely interrelated. Fa example, the percent of African-American tenth graders living with both parents was much lower than the percent of Asian-American tenth graders. Tenth graders from ethnic backgrounds other than European or Asian were more likely to be in the lowest socio-economic quartile. Thus when one looks at substantial differences a difference may actually relate to the variable examined such as family type, or it may be reflecting or affected by either ethnicity or socio-economic status. Clusters One duster, school performance, showed considerably more substantial differences, 41%, than did other clusters. School periormance showed the greatest percentage of substantial differences, 41. Four other clusters, characteristics, self and classes, self and peers, and life skill development activities showed differences of more than 22%, but not nearly as many as scholastic performance. Views of self, the characteristics of the school attended, social behavior, and views of the future showed fewer than 20% of the comparisons yielding substantial differences (10 or more percentage points). The areas which showed the fewest differences was the area of self and school. Areas One area, NELS test scores, showed considerably more substantial differences, 68%, than did other areas Few indMdual items showed large differences. At the other extreme, only 3% of the comparisons of expected occupations (duster: future) showed substantial differences related to the variables.

Clusters --Only one of the clusters, school performance showed substantial differences in half or more of the comparisons. Fewer than 10% of the comparisons on items In the clusters school attended and social behavior showed substantial differences related to socio-economic status.

At the other extreme five areas showed no differences of ten percentage points or more when socio-economic status was examined. Those areas were: running away (cluster: Social Behavior), education about social behavior (cluster: Social Behavior), chance of things occurring (cluster: Future), school's characteristics (cluster: School), and potentially harmful substances (cluster: Social Behavior). Nine other areas showed ten percent or fewer comparisons yielding substantial differences.

None as great as 40 percentage points difference appeared. Only two, taking shop courses (duster School; area: classes) and making decisions about who to date (duster: Family; area: decision making), of the more than a thousand tests, showed differences of 30 percentage points or more. The extent of urbanicity of the school and student's location only appeared to affect the school attended.

'13 t, Areas --Only comparisons in one area, school's characteristics (duster School), yielded more than half showing substantial differences. At the other extreme, 33 areas showed no substantial differences and 13 others showed substantial differences in ten percent or fewer of the comparisons. Over three-fourths of the items related to the characteristics of the school showed substantial differences across urbanicity groups. Items --Few of the comparisons showed large percentage differences. Two of the three that stxmed a difference of more than thirty percentage points were in regard to availability of sports, soccer and swim team, (cluster: Life Skill Development; area: school extracurricular). The third area that showed this amount of difference was the lowest tenth grade enrollment category.

The eighth grade respondents were divided into four groups according to how they and their parents had responded to questions about youth group participation. Neversthe eighth grader did not say they belonged in the eighth grade and parents did not indicate that the eighth grader had ever belonged to 4-H Leavers the parent said the youngster had been in 4-H at some time but the eighth grader did not say they presently were in 4-H Stayers the parent said the youngster was or had been in 4-H; the eighth grader said they were in 4-H that year. Joinersthe parent did not say the youngster had ever been in 4-H but the youngster said they were currently in 4-H Most of the differences in the eighth grade analysis were between one other group and the joiners who seemed to be unusual in relation to other characteristics. Few differences appeared between the nevers and those who left or stayed in 4-H. However, the NELS:88 survey did not include information in terms of the extensiveness or intensiveness of the 4-H experience. Other research indicated that there is considerable variation in the numbr, , of years and the intensiveness of 4-H participation. In total, 14% of the tenth grade analyses showed substantial differences in the range across the four groups. However, joiners were at the extreme of the range in all except 8 of those analyses. Clusters -Scholastic performance showed the most substantial differences, 31%, followed by self and family, 24% and sett and peers, 23%. Views of self, future, self and school, and school attended showed the least substantial differences. Four clusters, self and courses, characteristics, social behavior, and life skill development activities showed moderate differences. Areas Only two areas, both of which were parts of the NELS study asts showed substantial differences in half or more of the items. Twenty areas showed differences in fewer than 10% of the items within the area. The areas showing the fewest substantial differences were spread throughout the clusters. Recognition at school (Self and School) 10 10% Items Only one specific item, reading level, showed a difference of 30 or more percentage points. In general, those who had left 4-H before the eighth grade showed somewhat higher test performance levels than did others. The new joiners tended to show the lowest percentages with good performance. 4-H Differences-The seven items where a difference of 10 or more percentage points appeared between those who never had been in 4-H and those who had stayed in 4-H included two items on availability of extracurricular activities (soccer and hobby dubs), three on participation (non sport extracurricular, and FFA, FHA, FTA, non school group or recreation) one on kind of work and one on religious affiliation. The other item, no school study halls, showed a range of 10 points between stayers and leavers. No study halls in a typical day, stayers 57% to leavers 67% 10 Discussion: The major conclusions from this analysis relate to the lack of variation among tenth graders as a whole when standard demographic variables were examined and the amount of individual variation within each of the subgroups. The findings indicate that each tenth grader must be understood as an individual within his or her own life space without regard for ethnicity, socio-economic status, family type, gender, or place of residence, or prior youth program participation."}]
