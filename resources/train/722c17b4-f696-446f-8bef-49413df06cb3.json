[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Kanae, S. (2017). Compound simulation of fluvial floods and storm surges in a global coupled river-coast flood model: Model development and its application to 2007\nAbstract Water-related disasters, such as fluvial floods and cyclonic storm surges, are a major concern in the world's mega-delta regions. Furthermore, the simultaneous occurrence of extreme discharges from rivers and storm surges could exacerbate flood risk, compared to when they occur separately. Hence, it is of great importance to assess the compound risks of fluvial and coastal floods at a large scale, including megadeltas. However, most studies on compound fluvial and coastal flooding have been limited to relatively small scales, and global-scale or large-scale studies have not yet addressed both of them. The objectives of this study are twofold: to develop a global coupled river-coast flood model; and to conduct a simulation of compound fluvial flooding and storm surges in Asian mega-delta regions. A state-of-the-art global river routing model was modified to represent the influence of dynamic sea surface levels on river discharges and water levels. We conducted the experiments by coupling a river model with a global tide and surge reanalysis data set. Results show that water levels in deltas and estuaries are greatly affected by the interaction between river discharge, ocean tides and storm surges. The effects of storm surges on fluvial flooding are further examined from a regional perspective, focusing on the case of Cyclone Sidr in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta in 2007. Modeled results demonstrate that a >3 m storm surge propagated more than 200 km inland along rivers. We show that the performance of global river routing models can be improved by including sea level dynamics. Key Points: Development of a first global coupled river-coast flood model that facilitates compound simulation of fluvial flood and storm surge Incorporation of sea level dynamics into river routing enhanced model performance in reproducing river water levels The coupled model was applied to Cyclone Sidr, demonstrating cyclonic storm surge propagation through rivers Correspondence to: H.

Since deltas are inhabited by more than 500 million people worldwide [Syvitski and Saito, 2007] , the potential impacts of floods in these regions are of great concern. In particular, mega-deltas in Southeast Asia, such as the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) Delta, are prone to both river and coastal flooding due to heavy and intensive monsoon rainfall and storm surges caused by cyclones [Syvitski et al., 2009] . Climate change could additionally augment flood risks in these regions. Future projections suggest that the frequency of fluvial floods will increase in large parts of the world, particularly in Asian and African regions, due to increases in extreme discharges [Cisneros et al., 2014; Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Winsemius et al., 2016] . Furthermore, recent studies indicate that some coastal regions can expect more intense storm surges [Androulidakis et al., 2015; Lin and Emanuel, 2016; Vousdoukas et al., 2016] . When river and coastal floods occur at the same time or in quick succession, their impacts could be more devastating than when either occurs separately [Kew et al., 2013; Klerk et al., 2015; Wahl et al., 2015] . The need to improve our understanding of compound hazards has been recognized by the research community as well as the user community of natural hazards information [e.g., Seneviratne et al., 2012; Leonard et al., 2014] . Thus, it is of great importance to have an understanding of how these compound fluvial and coastal floods affect mega-delta regions. Since such risks are common to most mega-delta regions, continental-scale, or global-scale models can be used to assess their influence at the large scale.\nIn recent years, large-scale assessments of fluvial flooding have been improved through flood frequency analysis [Milly et al., 2002; Hirabayashi et al., 2008; Dankers et al., 2014; Trigg et al., 2016] ; and the assessment of exposed populations [Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Jongman et al., 2012a] and flood damages [Jongman et al., 2012b; Ward et al., 2013 Ward et al., , 2014 Winsemius et al., 2016] . These assessments have been facilitated through the development of continental-scale or global-scale river routing models (e.g., PCR-GLOBWB-Dynrout, Winsemius et al. [2013] ; LISFLOOD-FP Van Der Knijff et al. [2010] ). However, their application to the analysis of compound fluvial flooding and coastal storm surges remains limited primarily due to the lack of representation of backwater effects in river discharge calculations and the lack of global coastal water level data. The backwater effect is a phenomenon where changes in water levels downstream are propagated upstream. Storm surges cause extreme sea levels at river mouths, which may propagate through rivers upstream by backwater effects. While the backwater effect is expressed as a varying water level in river discharge calculations, most global river routing models use a kinematic wave equation, thereby neglecting the backwater effect within rivers in hydraulic calculations. This means that the simultaneous assessment of fluvial flooding and storm surges has not yet been achieved at the continental-scale to global-scale.\nRecently, there has been growing attention to the need to model the interaction of fluvial flooding and coastal surges [Hoitink and Jay, 2016; Ward et al., 2015] . Several studies have been carried out using twodimensional or three-dimensional hydrodynamic models at basin-scales or regional-scales, for example, in Bangladesh [Karim and Mimura, 2008] , Taiwan [Chen and Liu, 2014] , and the United Kingdom [Skinner et al., 2015] . However, their high-computational loads limit their application to relatively small-scale analyses, precluding basin-scale, continental-scale, and global-scale assessments of compound fluvial and coastal flooding. Studies on coastal storm surges have also been expanded in recent years, for example, to encompass flood losses in the world's coastal cities [Hallegatte et al., 2013; Hinkel et al., 2014] . Muis et al. [2016] developed the first global-scale reanalysis data set of tide and surge water levels based on hydrodynamic modeling, the Global Tide and Surge Reanalysis (GTSR) data set . However, these studies only analyzed extreme water levels along the coast and their effect of flooding on land, and did not investigate propagation effects through rivers.\nIn this paper, we address several of the issues outlined above; the objectives of this study are twofold: (1) to develop a global coupled river-coast flood model; and (2) to conduct a simulation to assess the impact of compound fluvial flooding and storm surges on water levels in Asian mega-delta regions. To achieve this, we advance our physically based approach of large-scale fluvial flood modeling, by integrating a global river routing model with GTSR. The current state-of-the-art improvements are briefly explained below. Ikeuchi et al. [2015] first estimated the effect of sea level rise (SLR; values projected at the end of the 21st century) on fluvial flood inundation in the GBM Delta employing a global river routing model. They found that SLRs of 1 m and 2 m would exacerbate fluvial floods, increasing inundation depths over wide areas. However, they ignored spatiotemporal variation in sea levels caused by storm surges, which can cause much higher water level changes (e.g., >6 m) than SLR. In this paper, we bring these advances in river and storm surge modeling together, and develop a framework for the simultaneous modeling of fluvial floods and coastal storm surges applicable to global-scale analyses. Beyond model development at a global-scale, we analyze the performance of the model in reproducing water levels regionally, using the Cyclone Sidr event in the Bay of Bengal in 2007 as a case study. We analyze the effects of coastal water levels and river flows on inundation within the delta. Quantifying the impacts of coastal flooding on river flood inundation, this study will be a basis to provide better information for flood risk management in mega-delta regions."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Here we provide an overview of the method, followed by detailed descriptions of each model and the coupling scheme. We used a global river routing model, Catchment-based Macro-scale Floodplain model (CaMa-Flood, ver. 3.6.2) [Yamazaki et al., 2011] , and a global reanalysis of tide and surge water levels, the Global Tide and Surge Reanalysis (GTSR) data set . The coupling scheme was introduced into CaMa-Flood to deal with changing sea surface levels calculated by GTSR. river network map was delineated from SRTM3 Digital Elevation Model (DEM) [Farr et al., 2007] and a highresolution flow direction map, HydroSHEDS [Lehner et al., 2008] . The original resolution of these data sets is 90 m, and a coarser river network is derived from them for use in the CaMa-Flood river model to reduce computational costs . The spatial resolution of CaMa-Flood can easily be modified to any resolution coarser than 90 m [Yamazaki et al., 2011] , and river basins are discretized at that resolution into calculation units (called unit-catchments), which are consisted of subgrid river and floodplain topography (shown as Figure 1 in Yamazaki et al. [2011] ).\nImplementation of a one-dimensional flow equation (a local inertial equation) [Bates et al., 2010; Yamazaki et al., 2013] has facilitated global-scale flood risk analysis [Hirabayashi et al., 2013] with high-computational efficiency. Due to the use of a local inertial equation, the simulation of flood inundation including SLR impacts has been achieved [Ikeuchi et al., 2015] . The local inertial equation is discretized using a forward in time finite difference method as follows:\nwhere Q t and Q t1Dt are the discharges (m 3 /s) at the time t and t 1 Dt, respectively, g is the gravitational acceleration (m/s 2 ), A is the flow cross-sectional area (m 2 ), S is the water surface slope, n is the Manning's roughness coefficient (m 21/3 s), and h is the water depth (m). The Manning coefficient was set as 0.03 for river channels, which is the default value used for the CaMa-Flood model [Yamazaki et al., 2011 ] based on Chow [1959] . The discharge and the water storage are prognostic variables at each calculation time step, followed by determination of diagnostic variables such as water level, inundation area, and depth. The water storage at each grid cell is calculated by a continuity equation as follows:\nwhere S t1Dt i and S t i are total water storage (m 3 ) at the time step t 1 Dt and t, Q t i is the discharge (m 3 /s) at the time step t, A ci is the unit-catchment area (m 2 ), R t i is the runoff forcing (mm/s) at the time step t at the grid i.\nCaMa-Flood has two parameters of river channel cross sections, i.e., river channel width and height. The river channel width is determined either from the Global Width Database for Large Rivers ( where B is the river channel height (m) and R up is the annual maximum of 30 day moving averaged upstream runoff (m 3 /s).\nIn this study, runoff offline simulations by Kim et al. [2009] calculated from a land surface model, MATSIRO-GW, was used to force river routing in CaMa-Flood. MATSIRO, ''the minimal advanced treatments of surface interaction and runoff'' was developed by Takata et al. [2003] and represents energy and water exchange between atmosphere and land. MATSIRO has been updated to incorporate groundwater representation (MATSIRO-GW) [Koirala et al., 2014] . MATSIRO-GW driven by climate forcing JRA-25 [Onogi et al., 2007] was employed in this study.\nCaMa-Flood has been validated in several previous studies. Yamazaki et al. [2011] demonstrated that modeled river discharges were in good agreement with observations in most of the major continental rivers of the world. A striking feature of CaMa-Flood is that it can delineate bifurcating river channels (i.e., river channels representing multiple downstream directions) and its scheme was found to achieve better simulations of flood inundation, particularly in low-lying deltaic regions such as the Mekong [Yamazaki et al., 2014a], Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems 10.1002/2017MS000943 IKEUCHI ET AL. A GLOBAL COUPLED RIVER-COAST FLOOD MODEL the GBM [Ikeuchi et al., 2015] , and the Chao Phraya river basins [Mateo et al., 2017] , compared to simulations without channel bifurcation.\nIn this study, we simulated discharge over the period 1979-2010 at a subdaily time step. The simulation domain is the whole world at a spatial resolution of 15 min (approximately 25 km at the equator) and for validation of the coupled model (section 3.2) the spatial resolution was set as 0.18 (approximately 10 km at the equator) over each river basin (the GBM and the Mekong). Inundation depth (i.e., water level above the top of a river channel) is downscaled onto an 18 arc sec (approximately 500 m at the equator) highresolution DEM by comparing the elevation of pixels in the DEM against the water level modeled at a coarse resolution (15 arc min). Since CaMa-Flood incorporates the same high-resolution subgrid topography for both river routing and downscaling, the water volumes before and after downscaling are consistent. This downscaling method can produce inundation information detailed enough to assess fluvial flood risks (see further detail in the supporting information of Ikeuchi et al. [2015] )."}, {"section_title": "Global Tide and Surge Reanalysis (GTSR) Data Set", "text": "GTSR is the world's first dynamically derived data set of global coastal water levels. To develop GTSR, Muis et al. [2016] used hydrodynamic modeling approach to obtain a reanalysis of tides and surges during the period of 1979-2014. These were further processed to obtain extreme sea levels for different return periods, by extracting annual maxima and fitting a Gumbel distribution. Recent studies such as Vousdoukas et al.\n[2017] used similar methods, but included estimates of extreme storm surges in Europe for future climate projections. Cid et al. [2017] used statistical methods to derive global surge levels by utilizing the 2 Dimensions Gravity Waves model (MOG2D) for the correction of altimetry data (the Dynamic Atmospheric Correction). While statistical methods might be more suitable for long-term projections than hydrodynamic methods in terms of computational loads, we employ the latter in the present study because our simulation period is the past 30 years, hence the predominance of hydrodynamic modeling in accuracy outweighs computational load. Furthermore, Muis et al. [2017] has shown that GTSR provides better estimates of extreme sea levels compared to a previous data set of global extreme sea levels (DINAS-COAST Extreme Sea Levels data set) that had been the only global data available for over a decade before the development of GTSR, so the use of GTSR in this study is appropriate for the present study.\nIn GTSR, surges and tides are separately calculated, based on two hydrodynamic models: Global Tide and Surge Model (GTSM) to model surge levels, and Finite Element Solution (FES2012) to calculate tidal levels. GTSM is forced by atmospheric pressure and wind speed derived from the ERA-Interim reanalysis data set [Dee et al., 2011] . GTSM uses the Delft3D Flexible Mesh software [Kernkamp et al., 2011] . Its striking advantage is the application of an unstructured grid, facilitating simulation at flexible resolutions depending on location (i.e., higher resolution in shallow continental shelf than offshore areas), which greatly reduces computational demands compared to traditional structured grids. Spatial resolutions vary from 0.58 (50 km at the equator) in deeper parts to 3 arc min (5 km at the equator) in shallow coasts. . The observed tropical cyclone track was taken from the IBTrACS data set [Knapp et al., 2010] . Based on a number of tropical cyclone parameters, wind speed, and pressure fields are generated by applying the Wind Enhance Scheme (WES) software developed by Deltares (https://content.oss.deltares.nl/delft3d/manuals/Delft3D-WES_User_Manual.pdf), which follows the parametric hurricane model developed by Holland [1980] . Since the IBTrACS data set provides a global data set of best tracks of historical cyclones, the use of it can be considered a good approach to improve estimates of storm surge for global-scale analyses.\nThe time span of the storm surge data set is from 6:00 on 10 November to 18:00 on 15 November when Cyclone Sidr made its landfall on Bangladesh. While we did not use modeled surge results after 18:00 on 15 November due to the lack of cyclone track data of IBTrACS after its landfall, we assumed that the storm surge data before this time includes the maximum occurring water levels. To obtain sea level data after 18:00 on 15 November, the tidal component is extrapolated symmetrically. We assumed that this procedure would not make essential difference in analyzing the potential impact of storm surge on fluvial flooding, which is the main objective of this study."}, {"section_title": "Representation of Dynamic Sea Level Boundary Conditions in CaMa-Flood", "text": "To couple river and coast models, a scheme for expressing the effects of storm surge on river discharge calculations is required. The original version of CaMa-Flood assumed constant sea levels of 0 m relative to the SRTM vertical datum. While the effect of sea level variation is usually negligible in global simulations of river routing, its variation has a meaningful impact on river discharge in low-lying areas. Thus, in this study we developed a new scheme for CaMa-Flood to deal with dynamic sea levels at river mouths due to tides and storm surges. The newly developed scheme can be described as follows:\n1. Reading sea level boundary conditions from gridded data at each calculation time step; and 2. Calculating hydraulics at the river mouth considering dynamic sea level.\nWe connect the nearest GTSR output to each river mouth in CaMa-Flood. To avoid connecting CaMa-Flood and GTSR points that are too far apart, we set a threshold the distance between a CaMa-Flood river grid cell and an allocated GTSR output location should be <50 km. Note that by following this method, some river mouth grid cells in CaMa-Flood are not connected to corresponding GTSR data when the distance is too large. In such a case, input sea levels in CaMa-Flood remain 0 m. Following this method, two-dimensional gridded data of sea level at river mouths were generated every 10 min from the GTSR data."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": "3.1. Coupling Simulation at a Global-Scale and Continental-Scale Global river discharge simulations were conducted using CaMa-Flood with input of sea levels of GTSR. Figure 1 shows the difference in annual maximum water surface elevation between simulations with and without input sea levels (simulation results with GTSR minus those without GTSR). Although the absolute values of the differences are moderate (<0.1 m) in most regions of the world, we see that sea levels greatly influence simulation results in low-lying flat areas such as the Amazon basin and many river basins in Southeast and East Asia (i.e., increases in water level >0.5 m).\nFocusing on Southeast and East Asia, six major rivers (catchment areas >160,000 km 2 ) are selected to analyze the impact of dynamic sea levels on fluvial flooding: the Indus, Ganges, Irrawaddy, Chao Phraya, Mekong, and Yangtze. Figure 2 shows input sea levels modeled with GTSR (top figures) and water surface elevation modeled with CaMa-Flood with (red line) and without (blue line) GTSR (bottom figures). Even in the Indus, Irrawaddy, Chao Phraya, and Mekong Rivers, the differences in water levels caused by dynamic sea levels can be up to 0.5 m. In the Ganges and Yangtze Rivers, the differences are even greater, namely more than 1 m, due to the high surge levels calculated by GTSR. For example, the peak water levels in the Ganges in 2006 are 1.32 m higher with the input of GTSR, and 1.33 higher in the Yangtze river in 2002.\nThe reason for this is that input sea levels show >1 m amplitude variation, which may be caused by their Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems 10.1002/2017MS000943 physical characteristics, such as the fact that they face open oceans and are surrounded by a narrowshaped topography. Moreover, in the Chao Phraya River, the incorporation of GTSR strengthens the seasonal variation in river water level, i.e., increasing the high water level (10.32 m) and decreasing the low water level (20.40 m) due to the correspondence of seasonal patterns. In the Mekong River, similar impacts are seen but with a smaller extent (10.20 m for increase in high water level and 20.17 m for decrease in low water level in case of 2003). Hence, the incorporation of the sea level reanalysis data set has a large effect on river water level variation."}, {"section_title": "Validation of Coupling GTSR and CaMa-Flood in the GBM Delta and the Mekong Delta", "text": "Modeled results of river water levels obtained by CaMa-Flood coupled with GTSR are validated against observations obtained in the GBM Delta (Figures 3a and 3b) , and in the Mekong Delta (Figures 3c and 3d ). The gauging stations (CD: Chandpur, DL: Daulakhan, and RY: Rayenda for the GBM Delta, and CT: Can Tho, MTo: My Tho, and MTu: My Thuan for the Mekong Delta) are located in the coastal region in the delta as shown in Figures 3a and 3c . By incorporating the tide and surge reanalysis data set, the reproducibility of water surface elevations was enhanced. For example, correlation coefficients were slightly increased for all gauging points, and in the case of the GBM basins, RMSE and relative errors were reduced (Table 1) . Furthermore, for all gauging stations in the GBM Delta, water levels become significantly larger by inclusion of GTSR in river discharge simulations: maxima of increases in modeled water levels are 0.97 m at CD, 1.19 m at DL, and 0.48 m at RY. Note that there are missing values in observations (shown as gaps in gray lines in Figure 3b ); these coefficients were calculated over the period for which observed data are available. Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems 10.1002/2017MS000943\nWhile the coupling of GTSR and CaMa-Flood results in an increase in the correlation coefficients for water level simulations, their impacts are seemingly small. This is because water levels at river mouths of largescale rivers are predominantly determined by upstream river discharges, making the effects of tide and surge relatively small. In addition, simulated water levels are underestimated at the station DL, and do not Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems 10.1002/2017MS000943 match well with observations at RY. This may be due to the errors in determining river channel crosssectional parameters (river channel width and height). As discussed in section 2.1, the river channel width is defined by GWD-LR or the empirical equation. In this case, river channel width values at CD and DL are obtained from GWD-LR, but not at RY. In the coastal region of the GBM Delta, river channel width of GWD-LR tends to be large compared to inland regions, probably because that region is composed of both river inflow and seawater intrusion, making it difficult to exactly define the river channel width. In addition, the river channel height is determined only by the empirical equation. The use of these empirical equations may also be one cause for the mismatch between simulations and observations, such as at RY. Another potential source of the error at RY may be the existence of seasonal cycles of sea surface height driven by [Rao et al., 2010] , and by a strong modulation in the amplitude of the semidiurnal lunar tide, which is of order 10 cm [Tazkia et al., 2017] , which processes are not represented in GTSR. The current modeling framework does not include such a complex physical phenomenon unique to the Bay of Bengal. Finally, modeled river water levels in the Mekong Delta are overestimated compared to observations, shown as relatively large RMSEs and relative errors in Table 1 . The reason for the overall overestimation of river water levels in CaMa-Flood is because bathymetric depths of bifurcating river channels are relatively low, resulting in decreases in outgoing water flow from main river channels and hence increases in water levels in main river channels. Channel bathymetric depths are currently one of the largest uncertainties in river hydrodynamic modeling, though some efforts to improve them are ongoing [e.g., Durand et al., 2008; Yoon et al., 2012] . While these limitations exist, the increase in correlation coefficients of river water levels due to the incorporation of coastal water level data indicates that the coupling scheme developed in this study has the ability to achieve more reasonable flood simulations than without the coupling."}, {"section_title": "Simulation of the Impact of Cyclone Sidr on Fluvial Flooding", "text": "Before carrying out the coupled river-coast flood simulations, we checked the performance of the modeled sea levels of GTSM for Cyclone Sidr in the GBM Delta by comparing it with observed water levels obtained by BIWTA (Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority). Note that these data are not from GTSR, but are the results obtained from GTSM driven by the observed storm tracks as explained in section 2.3. Figure 4a shows the observed and modeled water levels at two locations (Khepupara and Hiron Point). When we compare the locations of GTSM outputs (the black stars in Figure 4b) and observation points (the blue and red dots in Figure 4b ), it can be seen that there are no GTSM outputs near Khepupara. On the other hand, one GTSM output is very closely located near Hiron Point, so the modeled water levels at this point are depicted in Figure 4a .\nComparing the modeled and observed water levels in Figure 4a , we can see that the tidal period and amplitude are similar (approximately 12 h and 1.6 m) but the timing and the absolute values are different between them (discrepancies of around 2 h and 0.8 m). As Krien et al. [2017] indicated, there can be a difference in the timing of cyclone landfall between observed water level data and cyclone track data (Joint Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems 10.1002/2017MS000943 Typhoon Warning Center, JTWC in their case).\nIn our case, we used the cyclone track from IBTrACS, and the comparison results show that there appears to be a lag in the timing of landfall. In addition, although we subtracted mean sea levels (MSS_CNES_CLS2011, available on http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/ auxiliary-products/mss.html) from the observed water levels, there are still discrepancies between observations and simulations, which may originate from the relatively coarse model resolution, potential biases in representation of the nearshore bathymetry as well as an inadequate parametrization of bottom friction in the Bay of Bengal.\nRegarding the storm surge heights caused by Cyclone Sidr, the modeled storm surges were much higher than the observed ones at Hiron Point as shown in Figure 4a . The reason for this overestimation may be the biases in the bathymetry of GEBCO. Krien et al. [2016] demonstrated (Figure 3 in their paper) that the submarine regions are too shallow in GEBCO (around 2-4 m), which may make the storm surge height too large in some regions. Other sources of the overestimation may be the problems listed in the previous paragraph and a location difference between the tide gauge and model output stations (e.g., the output point is closer to the ocean in the model than the actual location of Hiron Point). Potential errors in observed water levels can be another reason for the discrepancy. Observed water levels at Khepupara show an increase toward 18:00 on 15 November, however it is reported that the tide gauge stopped working suddenly after that , so that there may be a possibility that the observations may not capture actual maxima of peak water levels in this event.\nIn order to analyze the ability of GTSM to reproduce peak water levels, we referred to two previous studies that provide storm surge height data [Japan Society of Civil Engineers (JSCE), 2008; Institute of Water Modelling (IWM), 2009], which were introduced in Lewis et al. [2013] . Table 2 shows the validation results of peak water levels during the cyclone event. The output location of GTSM is selected such that its distance from the location of observed data is the minimum. This result indicates that the peak height of the modeled sea level (5.61 m) agrees with the reported extreme sea level caused by Cyclone Sidr, which ranges from 5.00 to 6.47 m.\nSimulations of flood inundation using CaMa-Flood with the input of the storm surge caused by Cyclone Sidr were conducted. Figures 5 and 6 show the spatial distribution of modeled inundation depths with (hereafter called Surge experiment) and without (NoSurge experiment) surge input, as well as the difference between the two simulations (i.e., results of Surge experiment minus results of NoSurge experiment). Figure 7 shows a time series of inundation depths at four gauging stations. In Figure 7 , the solid and dotted lines indicate modeled results of Surge and NoSurge experiments, respectively. The temporal resolution of both results is 10 min, although the results of the NoSurge experiments show gradual variation in inundation depths compared to the Surge experiments, because the original temporal resolution of input runoff calculated by MATSIRO is daily. The inundation depth at the river mouth starts to increase by >2 m at around 14:00 in the Padma River (the downstream flow from a confluence of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra Rivers). About 4 h later (18:00), inundation depth at the river mouth reaches its peak (>3 m). After that, the inundation depth in the Padma River starts to decrease, whereas the upstream rivers (the Ganges and the Brahmaputra Rivers) still show increasing inundation depths. An increase of about 0.7 m in water level can be seen at a location more than 200 km from the river mouth (GL in Figure 7 ). Note that observations are not available during this period (15-16 November 2007) , so we could not validate the modeled inundation depth.\nThe propagation of storm surge through rivers is clearly represented in Figures 5 and 6. If we do not include input sea levels, the modeled inundation depths remain low (shown as the dotted lines in Figure 7 ). This indicates that the incorporation of a storm surge reanalysis data set has a substantial impact on fluvial flood simulations during storm surge events. Furthermore, the propagation effect is expressed by the backwater effect, which has been found to be critical in fluvial flood simulations with sea level rise [Ikeuchi et al., 2015] . Hence, this study not only supports that finding, but also adds new insights, such as revealing spatiotemporal characteristics of flood inundation in the case of cyclone-induced storm surges."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "This study has several limitations related to the use of CaMa-Flood, GTSR, and the coupling scheme, which are discussed in this subsection. While CaMa-Flood can simulate river channel bifurcation flows, water flow wave effects, such as wave setup induced by wave radiation stress and/or contribution of short waves to regulate surface stresses [Bertin et al., 2015] should be addressed. In particular, nonlinear tide-surge interaction can cause significant increase in sea levels [e.g., approximately 0.2 m in Canada, Bernier and Thompson, 2007] , 0.5 m in UK [Horsburgh and Wilson, 2007] , and 1.0 m in the Bay of Bengal . These can be contributors to determine sea levels along coasts, so the total water levels of the tide and surge reanalysis used in this study may be biased particularly in regions where tidesurge interactions are significant. In addition, although GEBCO, the data used as the global bathymetry in GTSM, is widely used in studies of coastal hydrodynamics, it was shown to contain significant errors in the Bay of Bengal (e.g., too much shallow bathymetry in submarine regions), compared to a newly and locally developed bathymetry data set obtained by extensively utilizing nautical charts and river survey results available in that region [Krien et al., 2016] . This kind of the state-of-the-art bathymetric data should be employed in further studies that specifically address coastal hydrodynamics in the Bay of Bengal [e.g., Krien et al., 2017] .\nFinally, the current model coupling scheme includes neither pluvial flooding nor coastal flooding. This is because of the lack of a modeling scheme for them in global river routing models. While this study focused on the impact of storm surges on rivers, the inverse effect was not taken into account; freshwater input to the ocean may also be a factor affecting sea levels. Despite these limitations, the coupling methods proposed in this paper can contribute to improving our simulation of water levels in delta regions affected by both river flooding and surge. The coupling also serves as a starting point for further improvements in the modeling of these compound floods at large-scales to global-scales."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this study, we focused on the impact of storm surges on fluvial flooding in mega-delta regions, within a framework of global flood modeling. A global river routing model was modified to handle the dynamically changing sea levels at river mouths. Each river mouth grid cell in the river model was connected with the nearest output from the tide and surge model. Moreover, we successfully conducted coupled simulations of the global river routing model with the global tide and surge data set, showing a large influence on modeled water levels particularly in deltas and estuaries. This scheme was applied to one specific cyclone event, Cyclone Sidr in the GBM Delta in 2007, as a case study. The cyclonic storm surge caused a >3 m increase in inundation depth at the river mouth, along with a 0.7 m increase at a point approximately 200 km away from the river mouth. Including the sea level dynamics in global river routing models has been shown to improve the performance of the river model and have a large effect on the inundation estimates. Future work stemming from this study includes the development of holistic representations of flooding in coastal regions, which could be achieved by representing coastal flooding induced by storm surges. , the 1-in-100-year extreme sea levels of the GTSR data set are freely available online at the archive of the 4TU.Research Data (https://data.4tu.nl/ repository/uuid:aa4a6ad5-e92c-468e-841b-de07f7133786) and other parts of the GTSR data set may be available upon request to the developer (sanne. muis@vu.nl).
