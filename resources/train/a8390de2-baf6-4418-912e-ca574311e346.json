[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Emergence of advanced network analysis techniques utilizing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) has enabled a more comprehensive understanding of neurological disorders at a wholebrain level. However, inferring brain connectivity from R-fMRI is a challenging task, particularly when the ultimate goal is to achieve good control-patient classification performance, owing to perplexing noise effects, curse of dimensionality, and inter-subject variability. Incorporating sparsity into connectivity modeling may be a possible solution to partially remedy this problem since most biological networks are intrinsically sparse. Nevertheless, sparsity constraint, when applied at an individual level, will inevitably cause inter-subject variability and hence degrade classification performance. To this end, we formulate the R-fMRI time series of each region of interest (ROI) as a linear representation of time series of other ROIs to infer sparse connectivity networks that are topologically identical across individuals. This formulation allows simultaneous selection of a common set of ROIs across subjects so that their linear combination is best in estimating the time series of the considered ROI. Specifically, l 1 -norm is imposed on each subject to filter out spurious or insignificant connections to produce sparse networks. A groupconstraint is hence imposed via multi-task learning using a l 2 -norm to encourage consistent non-zero connections across subjects. This group-constraint is crucial since the network topology is identical for all subjects while still preserving individual information via different connectivity values. We validated the proposed modeling in mild cognitive impairment identification and promising results achieved demonstrate its superiority in disease characterization, particularly greater sensitivity to early stage brain pathologies. The inferred group-constrained sparse network is found to be biologically plausible and is highly associated with the disease-associated anatomical anomalies. Furthermore, our proposed approach achieved similar classification performance when finer atlas was used to parcellate the brain space."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is commonly characterized by cognitive and intellectual deficits, which is serious enough to interfere daily life, without effective treatment until now. It gets worse over time by gradually destroying brain cells, causing loss in memory and ability to reason, make judgments and communicate, eventually causing death. AD is the most prevalent dementia which accounts for an estimate of 60-80 % of dementia cases among elderly population (Alzheimer's 2012) and definitive diagnosis can only be made with histopathological confirmation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. It has been reported that the incidence of AD doubles every 5 years after the age of 65 (Bain et al. 2008 ) and 1 in every 85 persons will be affected by the disease by year 2050 (Brookmeyer et al. 2007 ). Based on the latest statistics, AD is the sixth leading cause of death in United States and is the only among the top ten causes of death that cannot be prevented, cured or slowed down (Alzheimer's 2012). Recently, there are 5.4 million or approximately 1 in 8 senior Americans who are diagnosed with AD (Alzheimer's 2012). It is estimated that around 44 % Americans with age 75-84 and 46 % with age [85 are AD patients. This becomes worse as life expectancy increases. The average life expectancy of AD patients varies between 3 and 10 years. The median life span is up to 7-10 years for AD patients whose conditions are diagnosed when they are in their 60s and early 70s. The median reduces to about 3 years or less for patients whose conditions are diagnosed when they are in their 90s (Zanetti et al. 2009 ). With the aging world population, this disease has been a serious problem and a huge burden to the healthcare system, particularly in developed countries. Recognizing the urgent need to slow down or completely prevent the occurrence of a healthcare crisis worldwide, effort has been underway to administer and to develop effective pharmacological and behavioral interventions for delaying the onset and progression of the disease, particularly at its early stage.\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI), an intermediate stage of brain cognitive decline between normal aging and dementia, is associated with increased risk of developing AD, especially when memory loss is the predominant symptom. This type of MCI is commonly referred as ''amnestic MCI''. Some individuals with MCI remain stable or return to normal over time, but more than half progress to dementia within 5 years (Gauthier et al. 2006) . Recent studies show that individuals with MCI tend to progress to probable AD at a rate of approximately 10-15 % per year (Grundman et al. 2004; Misra et al. 2009 ), compared with healthy controls who develop dementia at a rate of 1-2 % per year (Bischkopf et al. 2002) . According to a latest, long-term study of nearly 4,000 participants, cognitive impairment has a significant impact on life expectancy similar to chronic conditions such as diabetes or chronic heart failure (Sachs et al. 2011 ). Early detection is thus important for possible delay of the progression of MCI to moderate and severe stages. However, diagnosis of MCI is difficult due to its mild symptoms of cognitive impairment, causing most computer-aided diagnosis to achieve lower than desired performance.\nConstructing functional brain connectivity from neuroimaging data holds great promise for identifying imagebased biomarkers that are crucial for distinguishing MCI from normal aging. Many functional connectivity modeling approaches have been proposed in the literature including the correlation-based approaches, Granger causality (or lagbased measures) analysis, and regularized inverse covariance estimation . With a comprehensive comparison on different connectivity estimation approaches using realistic simulated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, it was reported that in general the correlation-based approaches can provide relatively high sensitivity to network connection detection when compared with methods that are based on higher-order statistics and lag-based approaches . A large body of work on functional connectivity were based on the correlation analysis of Azari et al. (1992) , Horwitz et al. (1987) , Stam et al. (2007 Stam et al. ( , 2009 , Supekar et al. (2008) , Wang et al. (2007) , Wee et al. (2012) , among some. However, correlation analysis only captures pairwise information and is unable to provide an adequate and complete account of the interaction between many brain regions (Huang et al. 2010) . Also, fully connected correlation-based network structure is difficult to interpret due to many spurious or insignificant connections. Many spurious connections arise due to the low-frequency (\\0.1 Hz) spontaneous fluctuation of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals and physiological noise, e.g., cardiac and respiratory cycles. Inferring brain connectivity from resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) data for better classification performance is hence a challenging task. Recent work (Supekar et al. 2008) has shown that certain sparsity constraints can be imposed to elucidate robust connections from a set of noisy connections. The sparsity constraint correlates with the fact that, neurologically, a brain region predominantly interacts only with a small number of other regions. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the effects of inaccurate ROIs arisen, particularly when using atlas-based ROIs, can almost be ignored if the ROIs of the constructed R-fMRI-based connectivity are spread sparsely across the brain and not spatially neighboring .\nPartial correlation measures, which are associated with the time series similarity of two regions after factoring out the effects of other regions, correspond to the off-diagonal entries of inverse covariance matrix (or precision matrix) of the data. Estimation of partial correlation is normally achieved via maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) of the inverse covariance matrix. One important requirement for reliable estimation of inverse covariance matrix using MLE is the sample size of the data (time series) must be substantially larger than the number of brain regions modeled (Huang et al. 2010; Yuan and Lin 2006) . Sparsity in terms of the entries of the inverse covariance matrix (Friedman et al. 2008; Rothman et al. 2008; Yuan and Lin 2006) , so-called the sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE), has been applied on PET data to learn brain connectivity of AD, MCI and healthy controls (Huang et al. 2010) . SICE imposes the sparsity constraint through l 1 -norm regularization on the MLE to reliably estimate the inverse covariance matrix with the sample size close to or lesser than brain regions. Although this method is effective in identifying the zero and non-zero entries, i.e., adjacency structure, in an inverse covariance matrix, it is not suitable for estimating the magnitude of non-zero entries due to the shrinking effect. To partially solve this problem, Huang et al. (2010) proposed a ''quasi-measure'' approach to determine the ''strength'' of non-zero connections by using a series of different regularization parameters that determine the sparseness of the inverse covariance matrix. By using this approach, the ''strength'' of a non-zero connection is assigned with the largest regularization parameter value that preserves the existence of connection. However, this approach unable to provide a complete and accurate account of the strength of connections. It also been reported that only a few of the regularization parameter values can provide reasonably good estimation of network connection . Note that the SICE without regularization is equivalent to the partial correlation, a fully connected network.\nSparse modeling based on penalization of the l 1 -norm linear regression model as in the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) has been proposed for constructing sparse functional connectivity network of autism (Lee et al. 2011 ). However, this method was performed on PET data across different subjects of same group (autism patients) and hence is not suitable to infer the functional connectivity at individual level for all subjects (patients and healthy subjects). In order to infer sparse brain connectivity at individual subject level on R-fMRI data, we suggest modifying the method in Lee et al. (2011) by penalizing the l 1 -norm linear regression model across R-fMRI time series of each subject. By using this regression model, a sparse representation of brain connectivity can be obtained with only a few of significant connections. The insignificant or spurious connections are forced to have zero contribution and hence make the constructed sparse connectivity relatively easier to be interpreted. The linear regression model enables the representation of a brain region (in terms of time series) by the linear combination of other brain regions, with the contribution of every region reflected by the magnitude of the regression coefficient (or connection strength). Zero connection strength between two regions, for instance regions A and B, implies that the region B is redundant in accurate estimation of the time series of region A and vice versa. This provides a view on how a brain region is correlated with the rest of brain regions by filtering out the insignificant or spurious connections. It is noteworthy that this sparse representationbased functional connectivity inferring model is different from SICE since no computation of partial correlation-based connectivity is required before determining the non-zero connection locations via inverse covariance matrix. Hence, errors introduced during partial correlation computation and drawbacks of estimating the magnitude of non-zero entries in SICE can be avoided.\nHowever, the sparse modeling is unable to deal with inter-subject variability problem since l 1 -norm penalization at an individual level will result in different network topological structures across subjects (Yuan and Lin 2006) , i.e., the adjacency structure is different for every subject. This will inevitably make the comparison between subjects difficult and thus possibly degrade generalization performance of trained classifiers. To mitigate the effects of inter-subject variability, we propose in this paper a groupconstrained sparse linear regression model, which follow the idea of joint feature selection concept in group-lasso for regression problems (Yuan and Lin 2006) , to jointly estimate the non-zero connections across subjects via multitask learning. Through multi-task learning, the connection topology is kept identical among subjects, while at the same time allowing individual connection strength to vary between subjects. This modeling enables easier and direct comparison among subjects in MCI identification. Recently, a work based on the similar joint feature selection approach has been proposed to address the problem of inter-subject variability (Varoquaux et al. 2010) . It is noteworthy that this work is different from our work since it was developed based on SICE with the assumptions that the data are multivariate Gaussian-distributed and the covariance has to be positive definite. In Varoquaux et al. (2010) , partial correlation or covariance matrices were firstly estimated from R-fMRI time series of a group of subjects before a mixed l 2,1 -norm was applied to penalize their inverse covariance matrices to determine the locations of non-zero connections. Although this method can be used to minimize the inter-subject variability problem, it inevitably inherits the drawbacks of SICE such as the requirement of covariance matrix estimation and is unreliable at estimating the magnitude of non-zero entries in the sparse inverse covariance matrix. Another group-level modeling, which does not correspond to group-lasso formulation, also been proposed to identify the causal connections of functional connectivity . To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first attempt to infer sparse functional brain network, based on the linear combination of R-fMRI time series of different brain regions and group-constrained multi-task learning, for the purpose Brain Struct Funct (2014) 219:641-656 643 of MCI identification. We seek to validate if this new connectivity network modeling strategy can be used to better interpret MCI-related pathological anomalies and hence to improve classification performance. We explore the biological meanings of the inferred sparse network through its significant connections and the crucial brain regions that contribute to classification performance. We also investigate the robustness of the proposed method with respect to different parcellation scales. This paper sheds new light on group-constrained sparse connectivity modeling approach for R-fMRI data and its effectiveness when applied to MCI identification. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: ''Material and methods'' section furnishes information on the image dataset, and post-processing pipeline. This is followed by a comprehensive description on the construction of the proposed constrained sparse and Pearson correlation-based functional brain connectivity networks. We also briefly describe the feature extraction, feature selection and classifier training procedures used in the study. Performance of the proposed constrained sparse connectivity modeling is validated extensively in ''Experimental results'' section by comparing with other functional connectivity inferring approaches, as well as with different parcellation scales. Findings and methodological issues are discussed in ''Discussion'' section. ''Conclusions'' section concludes this paper."}, {"section_title": "Material and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "In this study, subjects from two cohorts were combined to create a balanced dataset for better evaluation of classification performance. The first cohort contains 13 MCI subjects who were randomly selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Only the baseline scan of each subject was utilized. The second cohort contains 37 subjects (12 MCI individuals and 25 socio-demographically matched healthy controls) recruited by the Duke-UNC Brain Imaging and Analysis Center (BIAC), Durham, NC, USA. Written consent was obtained from all participants, and the experimental protocols were approved by the institutional ethics board at Duke University Medical Center in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Diagnosis of all the recruited subjects was performed by expert consensus panels at the Joseph and Kathleen Bryan Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Bryan ADRC) and the Department of Psychiatry at Duke University Medical Center. Diagnosis confirmation was made by consensus with the ultimate decision by a boardcertified neurologist in concert with available data from a battery of general neurological examination, neuropsychological assessment evaluation, collateral subject symptom and functional capacity reports. The neuropsychological battery used was a revised Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) (Morris et al. 1989) which included: (1) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (Folstein et al. 1975) ; (2) (Reitan 1958) , symbol digit modality test (Smith 1968) , digit span sub-test of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (Wechsler 1981) , and a separate ascending digit span task modeled after the digit ordering test (Cooper et al. 1991) ]; (6) premorbid verbal ability [Shipley Vocabulary Test (Shipley et al. 1946) ]; (7) finger oscillation (Reitan et al. 1993 ) and grooved pegboard (Matthews et al. 1964) iests; and (8) selfrating of memory function (Squire and Zouzounis 1988) .\nConfirmation of diagnosis for MCI if subjects met the following inclusion criteria: (1) age [55 years and any race; (2) recent worsening of cognition, but still functioning independently; (3) MMSE score between 24 and 30; (4a.) score B-1.5 SD on at least two Bryan ADRC cognitive battery memory tests for single-domain amnestic MCI; or (4b.) score B-1.5 SD on at least one of the formal memory tests and score B-1.5 SD on at least one other cognitive domain task (e.g., language, visuospatialprocessing, or judgment/executive function) for multidomain MCI; (5) 4 or lower for baseline Hachinski score; (6) does not meet the NINCDS-ADRDA (McKhann et al. 1984) or DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association: 2000) criteria for dementia; (7) no psychological symptoms or history of depression; and (8) capacity to give informed consent and follow study procedures.\nSimilarly, all healthy controls met the following criteria: (1) age [55 years and any race; (2) adequate visual and auditory acuity to properly complete neuropsychological testing; (3) no self-report of neurological or depressive illness; (4) show no evidence of depression based on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule port of the Duke Depression Evaluation Schedule; (5) normal score on a non-focal neurological examination; (6) a score [-1 SD on any formal memory tests and a score [-1 SD on any formal executive function or other cognitive test; and (7) demonstrate a capacity to give informed consent and follow study procedures. In order for safety purposes and minimizing biases, subjects were excluded from the study if they have:\n(1) any of the traditional MRI contraindications, such as foreign metallic implants or pacemakers; (2) a past head injury or neurological disorder associated with MRI abnormalities, including dementia, brain tumors, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, demyelinating diseases, etc.; (3) any physical or intellectual disability affecting completion of assessments; (4) documentation of other Axis I psychiatric disorders; and (5) any prescription medication (or nonprescription drugs) with known neurological effects. It is noteworthy that the diagnosis of all cases were made on clinical grounds without reference to MRI. Demographic and clinical information of the participants is summarized in Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Data acquisition", "text": "Subjects from the first cohort, i.e., the ADNI dataset, were scanned using 3.0T Philips scanner (Achieva, Philips Healthcare) from different sites with the following parameters: echo time (TE) = 30 ms, repetition time (TR) = 3,000 ms and flip angle = 80\u00b0, imaging matrix = 64 9 64, 48 slices, 140 volumes, and voxel thickness = 3.3 mm. Readers are referred to http://www.adni-info.org for more data acquisition information. For the second cohort from Duke University Medical Center, an 3.0T GE scanner (Signa EXCITE, GE Healthcare) was used to acquire R-fMRI volumes from all participants. The R-fMRI scans were acquired axially parallel to the horizontal plane connecting the anterior and posterior commissures (AC-PC line) with TE = 32 ms, TR = 2,000 ms, flip angle = 77\u00b0, imaging matrix = 64 9 64 with a rectangular FOV of 256 9 256 mm 2 , 150 volumes, 34 slices, and voxel thickness = 4.0 mm. The scan was acquired using a SENSE inverse-spiral pulse sequence in the same plane as the lowresolution T1-weighted images. All the subjects were told to keep their eyes open and stare at a fixation cross in the middle of the screen during scanning, which lasted for 5 min, to prevent neuron excitation problem caused by the changing stimuli across time. If stimuli such as the little cross sign in this study is presented steadily without changing across the 5-min period, the neural excitation related to the stimuli can vanish quickly. This procedure prevents the subjects from falling into sleep and avoids saccade-related activation which is unavoidable if eyes are closed. The same scanner was used to acquire the T1-weighted anatomical MRI images using the following parameters: TE = 2.976 ms, TR = 7.460 ms and flip angle = 12\u00b0. The acquisition matrix was (256 9 224) with a rectangular FOV of (256 9 256 mm 2 ), resulting in slice thickness of 1 mm. A total of 216 slices were acquired using the FSPGR ASSET sequence."}, {"section_title": "Data post-processing", "text": "Since the number of time points acquired for Duke and ADNI datasets are different, we used only the first 130 time points for functional connectivity network construction. Post-processing of the R-fMRI images, including slice timing correction and head-motion correction, were performed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8 1 ) software package. The first 10 acquired R-fMRI volumes of each subject were initially discarded before any further processing to ensure magnetization equilibrium. The remaining 130 volumes were then corrected for the staggered order of slice acquisition that was used during echoplanar scanning. The correction ensures the data on each slice correspond to the same point in time. The interpolated time point was chosen as the TR/2 time to minimize relative errors across each TR in the study. After acquisition of time delay correction, the slice timing-corrected R-fMRI time-series of each subject were realigned using a least squares approach and a rigid body spatial transformation (Friston et al. 1995) . The first volume of each subject was used as the reference to which all subsequent volumes were realigned. This step removed the head-motion artifacts in the R-fMRI time-series. There were no significant group differences in head-motion for all participants used in the study. After realignment, the volumes were resliced such that they match the first volume voxel-by-voxel.\nTo further reduce the effects of nuisance signals before inferring functional connectivity, regression of ventricle and WM signals as well as six head-motion profiles were performed (Van Dijk et al. 2010) . Given the controversy of removing the global signal in the post-processing of R-fMRI data (Fox et al. 2009; Murphy et al. 2009 ), we did not regress the global signal out (Achard et al. 2006; Lynall et al. 2010; Supekar et al. 2008) . We then parcellated the brain space into 116 ROIs by warping the automatic anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. 2002) to the R-fMRI images using deformation fields estimated from T1-weighted images via a deformable registration method called HAMMER (Shen and Davatzikos 2002) . For each subject, the mean time series of each individual ROI was obtained by averaging the regressed R-fMRI time series over all voxels in that particular ROI. Temporal band-pass filtering with frequency interval (0.025 B f B 0.100 Hz) was then performed on the mean time series of each individual ROI. It provides a reasonable trade-off between avoiding the physiological noise associated with higher frequency oscillations (Cordes et al. 2001) , the measurement error associated with estimating very low-frequency correlations from limited time series (Achard et al. 2008) , and the magnetic field drifts of the scanner (Tomasi and Volkow 2010) . This frequency interval was further decomposed into five equal-length spectral, enabling a more frequency-specific analysis of the regional mean time series (Wee et al. 2012) . For each frequency sub-band, we inferred a functional connectivity network by utilizing three different approaches: (1) Pearson correlation between the regional mean time series of all possible pairs of ROIs; (2) sparse regression without group-constraint via l 1 -norm regularization; and (3) sparse regression with group-constraint via l 2,1 -norm regularization. These three approaches will be discussed in detail in the following subsections.\nPearson correlation-based functional brain connectivity Assuming we have N training subjects with each of them having M ROIs, and the denoting regional mean time series of the pth ROI for the nth subject as y p n . By considering the brain regions as a set of nodes and the correlation coefficients as signed weights on the set of edges, functional connectivity that examines interregional correlations in neuronal variability (Friston et al. 1993 ) can be measured using Pearson correlation coefficient between a given pair of y p n and y q n , given that p = q. The Pearson correlation matrix is a symmetric matrix in which each off-diagonal element is the correlation coefficient (similarity in terms of time series) between a pair of ROIs. A Fisher's r-to-z transformation was then applied on the Pearson correlation matrix to improve the normality of the correlation coefficients as\nwhere r is the Pearson correlation coefficient and z is normal with standard deviation r z \u00bc 1= ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi N \u00c0 3 p : The inferring of Pearson correlation-based functional connectivity map is graphically shown in Fig. 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Sparse functional brain connectivity without groupconstraint", "text": "With a total of M ROIs, the regional mean time series of pth ROI for nth subject, y p n , can be regarded as a response vector that can be estimated as a linear combination of time series of other ROIs as\nwhere e p n is the error, y . . .; a n p\u00c01 ; a n p\u00fe1 ; . . .; a n M is the weight vector that quantifies the degree of influence of other ROIs to pth ROI. The formulation of this inferring model is graphically illustrated in Fig. 2 .\nThe sparse brain functional connectivity modeling of the nth subject and pth ROI can be considered as a standard l 1 -norm regularized optimization problem with the following objective function\nwhere k [ 0 is the regularization parameter controlling the ''sparsity'' of the model, with a higher value corresponding to a sparser model, i.e., more elements in a n are zero. It is noteworthy that the l 1 -norm penalization of a n p is imposed individually on different subjects. By using this approach, topological structure of the generated sparse functional connectivity differs for each subject. This causes significant inter-subject variability which may possibly incur various problems in group analysis and classification. To minimize the inter-subject variability, we force the inferred connectivity networks to have identical topological structure across all subjects. This is accomplished by imposing a group-constraint into the sparse model in Eq. (3) via an additional l 2 -norm penalization across all subjects. Hence, the problem becomes minimizing the following objective function via multi-task learning as\nwhere a p 2;1 is the summation of l 2 -norms of a p n , i.e., P p a n p"}, {"section_title": "2", "text": ": Specifically, the l 2 -norm penalization is imposed on the same elements across different matrices a p which forces the weights corresponding to certain connections across different subjects to be grouped together. This constraint promotes a common connection topology among subjects, while at the same time allows variation of connectivity values (connection weights) between subjects. This mitigates the inter-subject variability problem and hence allows for easier and more consistent inter-subject comparison, particularly for patient identification. The nonzero coefficients in a p matrix are treated as an indicator on how significant other ROIs influence the currently considered ROI. We use the SLEP toolbox (Liu et al. 2009 ) to solve the objective function in Eq. (4). The modeling of group-constrained sparse functional connectivity via multitask learning is graphically shown in Fig. 3 ."}, {"section_title": "Feature extraction and feature selection", "text": "Local clustering coefficient (Rubinov and Sporns 2010) , a measure that quantifies the cliquishness of the nodes, was extracted as feature to reflect network property from all functional connectivity maps. Since the AAL atlas with 116 ROIs was utilized in brain parcellation, a feature vector consisting of 116 clustering coefficients, one for each ROI, was generated from each map. The feature vectors from all frequency sub-bands of each individual subject were concatenated to generate a long feature vector with 580 elements. We then utilized a hybrid method to effectively select the most relevant features from the long feature vector for classification. Two filter-based approaches were first used to reduce the number of features, followed by a wrapper-based approach to further select a subset of features that is favorable for MCI classification. Specifically, in the first filter-based approach, only features that differ significantly between the MCI and the healthy control groups, measured using t tests, were retained for subsequent feature selection. Despite the reduction in dimensionality, the features retained by this simple approach may still inevitably be inter-correlated. Therefore, we employed another filter-based approach, named as minimum redundancy and maximum relevance (mRMR) Peng et al. 2005) , to further reduce the feature dimension. The mRMR model provides a balance between two aspects of feature selection, i.e., efficiency and broadness. Efficiency ensures that characteristics can be represented with a minimal number of features without significant reduction in prediction performance. Broadness ensures that the selected feature subset can be the maximally representative of original space covered by the entire dataset. Mutual information is utilized in mRMR to measure the relevance of every feature pair and between features and classes. Specifically, we minimized the total relevance of each feature pair to achieve minimum redundancy, while simultaneously maximized the total relevance of each feature-class pair to achieve maximum relevance. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) (Guyon et al. 2004; Rakotomamonjy 2003 ), a wrapper-based method, was used to select a subset of features that is most discriminative and favorable for MCI classification. SVM-RFE removes features that make the classification error smallest one by one. In this study, we employed SVM with a simple linear kernel to evaluate the discriminative power of the selected features. It is noteworthy that the raw features were firstly scaled individually to range [-1, ?1] before feature selection is performed. Every scaled feature was normalized across all training subjects to obtain its standard score (z value). These steps ensured that all the extracted features were within the same scale, minimizing possible bias that may occur when performing selection on features with different dynamic ranges."}, {"section_title": "Classifier training", "text": "In this study, we employed SVM with a simple linear kernel to evaluate the discriminative power of the selected features derived from three different functional connectivity inferring approaches. The optimal SVM models as well as an unbiased estimation of the generalization classification performance were achieved via a nested leaveone-out cross-validation scheme due to limited number of sample size. Specifically, for N total number of subjects involved in the study, one was first left out for testing, and the remaining N -1 were used for constructing the optimal SVM model. From these N -1 samples, N -1 different training subsets were formed each time by leaving one more sample out, i.e., N -2 subjects in each training subset. For each training subset, functional connectivity construction, feature extraction and feature selection were performed. The performance of each combination of SVM parameters along with the selected features was evaluated using the second left out subject. The combination that gives the best performance was used to construct the optimal SVM model for future classification. This procedure was repeated N -1 times, once for each training subset. When the completely unseen test sample was to be classified, all N -1 classifiers were used, and the final classification decision was determined via majority voting. This process was repeated N times, each time leaving out a different subject, finally leading to an overall cross-validation classification accuracy. In this study, the optimal k value in Eqs. (3) and (4) was determined via grid search."}, {"section_title": "Experimental results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Group-constrained sparse functional brain connectivity", "text": "Functional connectivity maps inferred using the proposed group-constrained sparse linear regression model of one healthy normal control (NC) and one MCI patient are shown in Fig. 4 . Spatial connection topology of the constrained sparse and the fully connected Pearson correlationbased networks are projected on a 3D brain as shown in Fig. 5 . Connectogram of group-constrained sparse functional connectivity for single and multi-spectrum are provided in Fig. 6 . Links with red and black colors indicate inter-and intrahemispheric connections. Generally, the significant connections for single-spectrum case were relatively balanced between inter-and intrahemispheres. However, there were more inter-hemispheric connections that have been selected via the group-constrained sparse regularization when the BOLD time series was decomposed into several frequency bands.\nIt can be observed that the generated group-constrained sparse connectivity networks are significantly sparser than the fully connected correlation-based networks. This sparse connectivity network shows a number of biologically interesting findings. First, the bilateral temporal lobes show a smaller amount of intra-lobe connections than other lobes of the brain for all five frequency sub-bands. Second, there are significantly more inter-lobe connections between parietal and occipital lobes than any other lobe pairs. Third, there are more negative connections, which are widely distributed in sparse network of different frequency bands, in the MCI subjects than the NC subjects. Fourth, MCI subjects show markedly reduced (or negative) functional connectivity in the frontal lobes.\nComparison between group-constrained sparse and correlation-based functional connectivity Performance of the proposed group-constrained sparse connectivity network was compared with the conventional Pearson correlation-based connectivity network (after correlation correction with a cut-off FDR\\0.2) using single and multi-spectral BOLD signals. In the single spectrum case, feature extraction was directly performed on the bandpass-filtered BOLD signals without further frequency sub-band decomposition. Sub-band decomposition in the multi-spectral case enables more frequency-specific characterization of subtle changes in BOLD signals, and hence provides better discriminative power (Wee et al. 2012 ).\nDuring evaluation, SVM classifiers with the same linear kernel but different hyperparameters were used in a leaveone-out fashion due to the limited number of available samples. Classification performance of both the group-constrained sparse and correlation-based networks using single and multi-spectral BOLD signals are summarized in Table 2 . The proposed group-constrained sparse network with multi-spectral BOLD signals yields the best classification performance with an accuracy of 84.0 %, which is an increment of at least 8.0 % from that of the Pearson correlation-based approach. A cross-validation estimation of the generalization performance shows an area of 0.8656 under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), indicating good diagnostic power. It is also observed that the multi-spectral case not only shows better classification accuracy, but also provides higher AUC and sensitivity values for the sparse connectivity networks.\nComparison between sparse functional connectivity with and without group-constraint MCI classification performance of two sparse functional connectivity networks, i.e., with and without group-constraint, were compared using similar setting that was used in the previous experiment. Note that the optimal k value for the sparse functional connectivity networks with and without group-constraint were determined and the best classification performance of each network are summarized in Table 3 . The classification performance of using the multi-spectral approach was significantly better than the single spectrum approach in both the sparse functional connectivity networks. In addition, the proposed sparse network with group-constraint performed better than those without group-constraint in both the single and multispectral cases. With group-constraint, the inter-subject variability problem is minimized through the generated identical network topology among subjects and thus enables relatively easier differentiation between MCI subjects and healthy controls, as given by the significantly higher sensitivity value. It is interesting to observe that the sparse functional connectivity without group-constraint performed better than the Pearson correlation-based approach in terms of AUC and sensitivity values in multispectral case.\nClassification performance using different atlas scales\nIn order to investigate the effects of brain parcellation scale on our proposed modeling, we repeated the MCI classification procedure using a finer atlas with 238 ROIs. This finer atlas was generated by subdivision of the ROIs of the AAL atlas,by setting the size of every new ROI to be approximately equal. Results of using the original 116 ROIs and the finer 238 ROIs are summarized in Table 4 . It can be observed that all the compared methods did not show significant difference in terms of classification accuracy when finer parcellation was used. However, with the finer parcellation all the compared methods experienced decrease in sensitivity value, although this decrease was relatively smaller for the proposed group-constrained method. We also observed slight improvement of AUC value when the proposed method was used together with the finer scale of atlas. In addition, the proposed method outperformed the other compared methods in various metrics for both the coarse and fine parcellation scales. This implies that the proposed method is relatively robust with respect to parcellation scale, at least in terms of classification accuracy."}, {"section_title": "Most discriminant regions", "text": "Since the proposed approach was evaluated in a nested leave-one-out fashion, the selected subset of features might be different for each leave-one-out fold. We hence defined the most significant features (or ROIs) as the regions that were most frequently selected during the construction of optimal SVM models in the training stage. For easier interpretation, the reported most discriminant regions are based on the original AAL atlas with 116 ROIs. The most discriminant regions that were selected for the best classification performance using the proposed group-constrained sparse functional connectivity include regions located in frontal lobe (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex, frontal gyri and rectus gyrus), temporal lobe (e.g., temporal gyri and temporal pole), and other regions such as cingulate gyri, amygdala, angular gyrus, and occipital gyri. These selected regions, as shown graphically in Fig. 7 , are found to be associated with MCI pathology."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This paper investigated a novel brain connectivity inferring method for R-fMRI data based on the fact that a brain region predominantly interacts only with a small number of other regions. Thus, each region can be accurately and effectively represented or modeled by using a small number of regions according to their contributions. Compared to the fully connected correlation-based functional connectivity, sparse brain connectivity have been successfully applied to elucidate robust and meaningful connections from a set of noisy or spurious connections. It has be recently shown that the sparse functional brain connectivity in terms of sparse inverse covariance matrix or compress sensing can be inferred via l 1 -norm penalization across subjects to provide biological meaningful information on AD (Huang et al. 2010 ) and autism (Lee et al. 2011) datasets. The major advantages of using l 1 -norm penalization including its sparsity-inducing property, convenient convexity, and strong theoretical guarantees (Cand\u00e9s and Wakin 2008) . The l 1 -norm penalization automatically finds significant network connections with the weights of insignificant connections automatically driven to zero, i.e., minimizing spurious connections in constructed network. The derived solution is helpful in interpreting the estimated networks, without further statistical thresholding in inferring the significant network connections. Although l 1 -norm penalization has been used successfully, it is unable to deal with inter-subject variability problem at an individual level (Yuan and Lin 2006) and inevitably causes the comparison between subjects in classification difficult. The variations of network topologies across subjects without any constraint, i.e., non-zero connections are distributed randomly across different subjects, may confuse classifiers during the training process and eventually degrade the generalization performance of trained classifiers.\nTo address the inter-subject variability problem, a group-based constrained sparse linear regression model which is implemented via multi-task learning was proposed in this study to enforce an identical connection topology among subjects, while at the same time allowing variations of individual connectivity values between subjects. Modeling with group-constraint sparsity provides an easier and more direct comparison among subjects in classification. This group-constraint is accomplished by imposing an extra l 2 -norm penalization on the sparse modeling (l 1 -norm penalization) of each individual subject. This extra constraint determines connection topology that is crucial for MCI classification by using a common set of significant sparse functional connections that are learned from different individuals. The elimination of spurious and redundant connections between ROI pairs improves the effectiveness and capability of the inferred sparse functional connectivity network in conveying crucial and ACC accuracy, SEN sensitivity, SPE specificity, Correlation Pearson correlation-based connectivity, Sparse sparse connectivity without group constraint, Constrained sparse connectivity with group-constraint Fig. 7 Most discriminant regions that were selected during MCI classification from the group-constrained sparse functional connectivity disease-related information. This contribution is particularly crucial since an identical disease-related sparse topological structure can be applied to all new subjects, no matter whether they are patients or healthy controls, for providing good disease diagnosis rate. It is interesting to know that the proposed group-constrained sparse functional connectivity network results in a number of biologically meaningful findings which provide better interpretation when compared with the conventional correlation-based network. Compared with other lobes, the bilateral temporal lobes demonstrate a relatively smaller amount of intra-lobe connections, which has been extensively reported in the literature (Supekar et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2007 ). In addition, significantly more inter-lobe connections between the parietal and occipital lobes are observed when compared with other lobe pairs (Supekar et al. 2008) . Also, many inter-and intra-hemispheric connections were preserved in the inferred sparse network. The observation regarding affected inter-and intrahemispheres, either functionally or anatomically, has been reported recently in literature (Bajo et al. 2010; Haller et al. 2012; Tsutsumi et al. 2012 ). This can be partially explained by the progressive loss of synapses, as well as atrophy of corpus callosum that links both hemispheres. These topology patterns are identified via multi-task learning across R-fMRI time series of different subjects. Most of the retained connections have been found to be significantly altered in AD and/or MCI patients, thus providing a higher discriminative power than other connections. Taken together, these findings suggest that the proposed group-constrained sparse modeling method reveals anatomically plausible resting-state brain architecture that is associated with AD or MCI. Hence, the SVM classifiers trained using these small amount of disease-related connections perform much better than the conventional correlation-based networks in MCI classification. It is noteworthy that even without group-constraint, the sparse connectivity network still performs better than the conventional correlationbased network. This can be partially explained by the elimination of spurious or insignificant connections that reduces the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional classification.\nClassification performance evaluated via a nested leaveone-out cross-validation, which ensures performance generalization, using the proposed group-constrained sparse functional connectivity demonstrated a significantly higher accuracy of 84.0 % when compared with the conventional Pearson correlation-based and the sparse functional connectivity without group-constraint. The proposed method also yields an AUC value that is larger than 0.86, indicating good diagnostic power, especially in view of the relatively limited number of samples available in this study. The conventional correlation-based approach can only provide low to moderate performance as indicated by their relatively smaller AUC and sensitivity values. Significant improvement in sensitivity value indicates the superiority of the proposed approach in facilitating MCI classification using the conveyed disease-associated information. It is tremendously important since misclassifying a patient to be a healthy person may cause severe consequences, particularly if treatments that are required to delay or cure the disease may not be provided within critical treatment period. This may accelerate the progression of disease from mild to severe stage, a point where no effective treatment is available, and eventually causing death of patient.\nThe most discriminant regions that were selected for the best classification performance from the proposed groupconstrained sparse functional connectivity networks include several regions that have been reported in previous studies such as regions located in the frontal lobes [e.g., orbitofrontal cortex (Grady et al. 2003) , frontal gyri (BellMcGinty et al. 2005 ) and rectus gyrus (Fleisher et al. 2009 )], temporal lobes [e.g., temporal gyri (Convit et al. 2000; Fleisher et al. 2009; Smith et al. 2007 ) and temporal pole (Nobili et al. 2008)] , and other regions such as cingulate gyri (Gold et al. 2010) , amygdala (Dai et al. 2009 ), angular gyrus (Smith et al. 2007) , and occipital gyri (Nobili et al. 2010) , which is in line with findings that AD, strongly related to episodic memory impairment, causes atrophies in temporal and frontal lobes at the beginning stages of the disease. It has been reported that compared with control group, the AD group has decreased functional connectivity values within the temporal lobe, but increased functional connectivity within the frontal lobe, including the prefrontal areas (Supekar et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2007) . Based on fMRI studies, increase of prefrontal activation in AD during task performance may rely on increased prefrontal connectivity to compensate for reduced temporal connectivity (Gould et al. 2006 ). This observation can be explained in part by the ''cognitive reserve'' phenomenon (Stern 2006) , that the ability to make such compensatory changes in the frontal lobe connectivity allows some patients to perform better than others despite equivalent pathological burdens.\nRecent evidence suggests that topological organization of anatomical brain networks are critically affected by a priori atlases or spatial scales derived from random nodal parcellation (Romero-Garcia et al. 2012; Sanabria-Diaz et al. 2010; Zalesky et al. 2010) . We investigated the classification performance of the proposed method using finer parcellation scale with 238 ROIs compared with 116 ROIs in the original AAL atlas, and found that it performed with greater stability than other methods that were used for comparison.\nAnother important issue of the current study is the limited number of samples which may cause statistical power to be a potential concern. Leave-one-out cross-validation, as employed in this study, provides an optimistic estimate of the classification accuracy since all except one of the subjects are used to train the classifier. Almost all information available in the dataset is used in classifier model construction. Other approaches such as k-fold crossvalidation might be more precise when compared to leaveone-out cross-validation provided that there are sufficient data to accurately train the classifier. Hence, the results in this study have to be verified in the future with larger datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We proposed a novel approach to infer functional connectivity networks from R-fMRI data for classification purposes by imposing group-based sparsity constraint via multi-task learning on training subjects. This approach minimizes spurious and redundant connections, as well as the inter-subject variability problem that may influence the performance of MCI classification. Group-based sparsity is accomplished by considering a constrained sparse linear regression model via l 2,1 -norm penalization. Specifically, R-fMRI times series of a ROI is modeled as a sparse linear regression of time series of remaining ROIs via a l 1 -norm penalization to filter out spurious or insignificant connections. The inter-subject stability of network structure is encouraged via a multi-task learning using l 2 -norm penalization across subjects. This group-constrained sparse representation generates topologically consistent functional connectivity networks that allow direct comparison between subjects in classification. The experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach in constructing functional connectivity network that yields markedly improved classification performance compared with the conventional Pearson correlation-based network."}]
