The objective of this paper is to describe the design and methods of the Pearl Neurodegenerative Diseases, as well as baseline descriptive variables, including their biomarker profile. Methods: The Pearl Neurodegenerative Diseases is a 3-year follow-up study of patients referred to a memory clinic with cognitive complaints. At baseline, all patients are subjected to a standardized examination, including clinical data and biobank materials, e.g. blood samples, MRI and cerebrospinal fluid. At present, in total more than 1000 patients have been included, of which cerebrospinal fluid and DNA samples are available of 211 and 661 patients, respectively. First descriptives of a subsample of the data (n = 665) shows that patients are diagnosed with dementia (45%), mild cognitive impairment (31%), and subjective memory complaints (24%). Discussion: The Pearl Neurodegenerative Diseases is an ongoing large network collecting clinical data and biomaterials of more than 1000 patients with cognitive impairments. The project has started with data analyses of the baseline characteristics and biomarkers, which will be the starting point of future specific research questions that can be answered by this unique dataset."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "The parelsnoer institute\nThe Parelsnoer Institute (PSI; www.string-of-pearls.org) is a collaboration of the eight Dutch University Medical Centers (UMCs), designed to create an infrastructure for collection of clinical data and biomaterial from patients with chronic diseases. The conceptual starting point for PSI is the idea that clinical practice and research can mutually strengthen each other. By providing a harmonized infrastructure for the clinical evaluation of patients, data collection and storage of data in a centralized database, PSI enables the use of multicenter clinical data to answer research questions targeted to improve patient care. PSI takes advantage of the Dutch context, where it is relatively easy to achieve nationwide coverage of disease populations because of the close connections. Initially, eight patient cohorts were created, symbolized by \"Pearls\". Besides Neurodegenerative diseases, in particular dementia, the Pearls include stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hereditary colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), leukaemia, renal failure, and rheumatoid arthritis and arthrosis."}, {"section_title": "Neurodegenerative diseases", "text": "Dementia is one of the major health care challenges of the 21st century. There are currently more than 35 million people affected with dementia worldwide, of which Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type [1] . Other types of dementia include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia and more rare variants [2, 3] . To date, there is no cure for AD or any of the other types of dementia. In fact, we are only just starting to understand the aetiology and disease course of these diseases. Research in AD has long time been hampered by the fact that neither plaques nor tangles (nor any of the proteins involved in other types of dementia) could be measured during life. The development of biomarker assays as diagnostic tests in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and amyloid imaging using PET has been a great breakthrough, together with structural imaging using MRI, acting as a catalyst for AD research. The biomarkers have been used to develop a hypothetical model, which serves to test hypotheses regarding the order of events leading to AD dementia [4, 5] . In addition, there is increasing evidence that some biomarkers can be used as early diagnostic markers in the continuum of AD. Results from several large studies have demonstrated that a combination of CSF biomarkers and neuroimaging measures is useful in predicting the likelihood of developing AD [6] . This has resulted in their incorporation in new diagnostic criteria, as a means to provide evidence for the presence of Alzheimer pathology [7] [8] [9] . It is now widely recognized that AD has a long pre-dementia stage, as brain changes start to accumulate as early as 15 to 20 years before dementia onset [10] . Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to a stage where memory impairment can be objectified, but the patients' daily functioning is still intact. In university memory centres, patients with MCI have a mean annual conversion rate of 10% to dementia, mostly AD [11] . With the use of biomarkers, it is possible to make a better prediction of conversion to AD, though still far from perfect [12] . Preclinical AD is the proposed terminology to describe the stage when the earliest brain changes have begun, but there are no clinical signs yet [13] ."}, {"section_title": "Aim pearl neurodegenerative diseases", "text": "The aim of the Pearl Neurodegenerative diseases is to provide an infrastructure for the study of biomarkers for early diagnosis predicting clinical decline and incident dementia in those who are not demented yet, and for differential diagnosis and discriminating AD from other etiologies. The evaluation of a broad spectrum of patients, representing a tertiary memory clinic population, allows answering both questions. This is achieved by establishing a biobank containing blood, CSF, DNA with available extensive clinical phenotyping of patients, neuropsychological tests, and brain MRI. The data collection is completed by data from annual follow-up assessments.\nIn this paper, we describe the design and methods of the Pearl Neurodegenerative diseases as well as baseline descriptive variables. In addition, we extracted DNA and CSF from the biobank, and determined APOE genotype, and CSF concentrations of amyloid-beta 1-42 (ab42), total tau and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (ptau)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design", "text": "PSI is a collaboration of all eight UMCs in the Netherlands (University of Maastricht, Amsterdam (Free University and Amsterdam Medical Center), Rotterdam, Leiden, Groningen, Utrecht, and Nijmegen), and is jointly financed by the Dutch government and the eight Dutch UMCs.

The dataset makes it possible to perform nationwide research into early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, in particular AD. The uniqueness of this data set lies in the national coverage as our consortium includes all Dutch UMCs. Among the most important achievements until now is the harmonization of diagnostic procedures across academic memory centers. The use of SOP's and therefore a strict uniform data collection guarantees high quality of the data. We already see that other local memory clinics start to adopt the PSI-procedures, resulting in further standardization of diagnostics across the country and opening up further possibilities for collaborating in research projects.\nThe infrastructure of the Pearl Neurodegenerative Diseases is used as a framework for other studies, including"}, {"section_title": "Box 2 MRI protocol (Continued)", "text": "Number of slices [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] In-plane resolution 2.5 -3.3 mm"}, {"section_title": "Number of volumes 200 (excluding run-in scans)", "text": "All scans have full brain coverage except DTI, which has coverage of at least 140 mm and resting state fMRI that had coverage of at least 105 mm.

In addition, both clinical data and biomaterial (specifically CSF) have already been incorporated in large international consortia (BIOMARK-APD; EMIF-AD) in the context of the Joint Programming of Neurodegenerative Diseases (JPND; www.neurodegene rationresearch.eu) and Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI; www.imi.europa.eu) of the European Union. Several other multicentre initiatives have collected data to study the value of new biomarkers for early identification of AD and related disorders. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) in North America aims to identify neuroimaging measures and biomarkers associated with cognitive and functional changes in healthy elderly subjects and in subjects who have MCI and AD (www.adni-info.org). The Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of ageing aims to study biomarkers, cognitive characteristics and health and lifestyle factors determine AD (www.aibl.csiro.au). The Swedish Brain Power Network (www.swedishbrainpower.se) aims to enhance early diagnosis, treatment and care for patients with neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, Parkinson's Disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The Pearl Neurodegenerative Diseases adds to these other programs by firmly consolidating research in a clinical setting. The implementation of SOPs in clinical routine guarantees maximally efficient use of data and is thought to allow swift feedback of research results into clinical practice.\nAmong the limitations of the Pearl Neurodegenerative diseases is the potential referral bias as a consequence of inclusion of patients at tertiary UMC. The study results are generalizable to a population of patients referred to an academic memory clinic, but not to patients referred to a general practitioner, or any other community hospital or from the general population. Our sample provides a good reflection however of the patient population for which biomarkers might have high relevance. In addition, we included a broad range of patients, covering the continuum of cognitive decline from subjective complaints until the clinical diagnosis of dementia, but not healthy controls. One might argue, however, that for the aims of the present Pearl Neurodegenerative Diseases that the comparison of patients with dementia with patients with subjective complaints has more clinical relevance than comparing patients with dementia to healthy controls.\nBased on our recent experience, we have continued patient inclusion to enlarge our data set. In addition, the consortium has decided to prolong clinical follow-up to at least three years, to allow the study of biomarkers in relation to long-term follow-up."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In conclusion, the deep phenotyping in combination with longitudinal data collection, the multi-center set up, and the firm basis in regular patient care, resulting in a sample of real life patients, rather than a highly selected research sample, make our sample attractive for future studies aiming to develop diagnostic biomarkers, prognostic biomarkers, 'theranostic' (i.e. predicting response to therapy) biomarkers and biomarkers aiming to monitor disease progression. As such, the Pearl Neurodegenerative Diseases forms an ideal real life sample to host studies aiming to improve trial design and to validate new targets of therapy."}]
