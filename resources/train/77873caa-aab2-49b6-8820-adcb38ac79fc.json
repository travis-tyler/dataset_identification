[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This report develops information on resource management practices used by U.S. corn producers. It contributes to the policymaking process that seeks to balance public and private goals related to agriculture and the environment. The report presents findings from the 1996 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) of U.S. corn producers, which documents the most common soil, nutrient, and irrigation management systems adopted by corn farmers. The ARMS report linked these physical descriptors of corn production with the economic characteristics of the operating unit on which the corn was grown. Previous surveys of cropping practices provided information on the types and frequency of practices, but included few variables that could be used for economic analysis. The present report describes selected operator, farm, and enterprise characteristics of farms producing corn and, for the first time, links these socioeconomic variables to the management systems. One reflection of the significant increases in the productivity of U.S. agriculture over the last 50 years is the quadrupling of average corn yields. These yield increases have resulted from a combination of improved seed varieties, greater fertilizer and pesticide use, and improved tillage, rotation, and irrigation practices used in the complex production systems that characterize modern agriculture. However, the same factors that have increased productivity can have negative impacts on the environment, particularly on water quality. The use of commercial fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides in the United States has increased rapidly in the second half of the 20th century as the predominant form of agriculture has evolved from integrated crop and livestock farming to commercial grain farms. Public concern has been expressed about surface and ground water contamination, soil erosion, pesticide residues in food, and the environmental impact of agricultural chemicals. This has stimulated interest in alternative production systems that are less dependent on chemicals, conserve the soil, and mitigate the loss of nutrients to the environment. However, efforts to reduce pollution from agriculture can have adverse economic impacts on the agricultural community. Developing policies to reduce both the potential environmental damages attributed to agriculture and the economic impact on farmers requires understanding not only the technologies, but also the factors that influence farmers to adopt practices that could improve the environment. Identifying the farm and operator characteristics associated with specific practices and systems may provide information for targeting education, technical assistance, and cost-sharing programs for nutrient management. Numerous studies have focused on the potential impact on the environment of various technologies for managing soil, nutrients, and water. However, many of these studies were local or regional in scope and did not provide a national perspective. Others were limited to identifying the practices in use, without addressing the dynamics involved in their selection. This study of corn production was undertaken to: (1) provide information about the major corn-producing regions of the United States in terms of their management practices, and (2) link this information with variables related to corn producers and the overall economics of their farms. The 1996 ARMS data makes this possible because it links physical field-level descriptors of corn production with the economic characteristics of the entire operating unit on which corn is produced. The study is part of an ongoing USDA effort to provide information on the technical and economic characteristics associated with the production of major crops. Its focus is on corn raised for grain because of the crop's major use of resources and its importance to agriculture in general. Corn was planted on nearly one-fourth of all U.S. cropland in 1996, on 79.5 million acres (U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, 1997a). Actions taken by corn farmers as they choose from a variety of soil, nutrient, and water management systems can have a major impact on both profitability and environmental quality. The production of corn is associated with the use of large amounts of chemicals, and water is the primary transport mechanism that moves chemicals and sediments from the field to the environment. Information on soil, nutrient, and water management is essential for an understanding of the relationships between agriculture and the environment and for developing policies to improve these relationships. The management of surface water flow and drainage is an important conservation tool for non-irrigated as well as irrigated corn production. Approximately 14 percent of total corn acreage was irrigated in 1992 and 15 percent in 1997 (U.S. Dept. of Commerce, 1994;USDA, 1999b). Much of U.S. corn is grown on or near environmentally sensitive land, requiring intensive management to avoid sediment or chemical transport. For example, in 1995 about 20 percent of the corn was grown on acreage designated as highly erodible land (HEL), and additional corn was produced near wetlands, shallow aquifers, rivers, and streams (USDA, 1997b). Nearly 44 percent (4.9 million nutrient tons) of all commercial nitrogen fertilizer used in 1992 in the United States and 45 percent (1.9 million nutrient tons) of phosphate fertilizer was applied to corn acreage (Lin et al., 1995). Some agricultural production practices may have negative environmental impacts. Nitrogen from agricultural runoff entering either ground or surface water can diminish drinking water quality; phosphorus in surface water can lead to eutrophication; and volatilization of ammonia fertilizer can contribute to greenhouse gases. While it is difficult to trace the exact source of nonpoint pollution, production agriculture has been implicated as a leading cause of impairment of the Nation's rivers, streams, and estuaries (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1995 and. The Chesapeake Bay and Gulf of Mexico have experienced degradation due primarily to elevated levels of nitrogen and/or phosphorus (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1995;Antweiler et al., 1995). Some groundwater resources, especially from shallow aquifers, have also been found to contain nitrates linked to agricultural sources, often in irrigated crop production areas (CPNRD, 1998). The public has an interest in protecting the quality of water resources, which are affected by the agricultural practices and technologies adopted by producers. All farmers, of whom corn growers are a significant share, will be encouraged by public policies, educational programs, and economic incentives to adopt improved soil, nutrient, and irrigation management practices to conserve resources and reduce risks to the environment."}, {"section_title": "Objectives and Approach", "text": "This report describes U.S. corn production with regard to soil, nutrient, and irrigation management practices and links these practices with operator and farm characteristics. The information provides an objective baseline of the extent to which various agricultural production practices have been adopted. This then provides a basis for further analysis of the factors that influence the decision to adopt specific management practices for corn production. Following a description of the data and methodology, there is a brief overview of the literature on the adoption of management systems for soil, nutrients, and water, with a more detailed review in appendix A. Information from the 1996 ARMS survey of corn producers, characterizing corn production practices, is then presented. Relationships between soil tillage, nutrient, and water management practices will be used as the focus of the analysis. From the key relationships identified, suggestions for future research on the factors aiding or hindering adoption of these management practices will be made. (Pest management issues are not included in this analysis because the data on pest management practices for corn in 1996 are presented in Pest Management in U.S. Agriculture, Fernandez-Cornejo and Jans, 1999)."}, {"section_title": "ARMS Data and Analytical Methodology", "text": "As noted, data for this study are from the 1996 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). The ARMS is USDA's primary instrument for data collection on a broad range of issues related to agricultural resource use and costs and farm sector financial conditions. The ARMS is a cooperative project between USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS) and National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), designed to collect data to support the ERS and NASS estimation programs and the ERS research program on economic and environmental topics. Each year, producers in the States growing the primary field crops (corn, soybeans, wheat, potatoes, and cotton) are sur-veyed regarding their cropping practices. The 1996 ARMS also included a separate farm-level economic survey of U.S. producers of corn for grain, which provided detailed data on corn production practices and costs and farm financial conditions. Data from the two surveys were combined to create a national dataset of the soil, nutrient, and irrigation management practices used in corn production and to begin identifying some relationships between socioeconomic factors and the adoption of these management practices. Sampling and data collection for the corn version of the ARMS involved a three-phase process (Kott and Fetter, 1997). Phase 1 involved screening a sample of producers to identify farms that produced corn for grain. For phase 2, production practice and cost information was collected on a randomly selected cornfield from the acreage of each corn producer in the sample. Respondents to the phase 2 interview were questioned in phase 3 about farm financial conditions such as income, assets, and debt. Data in phases 2 and 3 establish the link between agricultural resource use and farm financial conditions, a cornerstone of the ARMS design. It is these data that are described in this report. The analyses of soil management and nutrient management systems are based upon a sample of 950 corn producers. The analysis of irrigation management is based upon responses from 64 producers in Nebraska, Kansas, and Texas identified in the overall sample of 950 corn growers as irrigators of corn. Respondents in all phases of the 1996 ARMS operated farms in 16 States, aggregated into 4 geographic regions: the Corn Belt, the Lake States, the Plains States, and the Southeast. 1 Each sampled farm represents a number of similar farms in the population, as indicated by its expansion factor, or survey weight, determined from the selection probability of each farm."}, {"section_title": "Literature Highlights on the Adoption of Management Practices and Systems", "text": "The literature on the adoption of soil, nutrient, and irrigation management practices and technologies was surveyed to determine which factors might be expected to influence farmers' choices. Some of these factors are identified in the ARMS dataset and can be used to help develop hypotheses for future analyses. Brief highlights from the literature follow, with a more detailed literature review in appendix A. All these studies of conservation technology adoption agree that the probability a practice will be adopted increases as its profitability increases relative to practices in use. Other factors identified as potentially important influences on adoption were size and location of the farming operation and age, education, and managerial capacity of the farm operator. Numerous studies have identified a variety of economic, demographic, geographic, and policy variables that affect the adoption of conservation tillage and other conservation practices in the United States. Management complexities and profitability are key factors impeding the adoption of conservation tillage. The consensus of many studies is that the relative economic performance of any conservation tillage practice depends on a number of site-and operator-specific factors. Variables found to influence the choice of tillage practices include operator characteristics such as degree of risk aversion and level of managerial expertise and physical characteristics of farms like soil type, topsoil depth, cropping systems, and local climatic conditions. The studies surveyed found that the factors explaining the adoption of nutrient management practices are regional and practice-specific. Adoption depends on the type of farming in the region (irrigated or not), the type of soils, and the presence of regulation. Some tests, such as manure testing for its nutrient content, may more commonly be done on farms that have a livestock component. It is also probable that operators who believe a nutrient problem exists in their own or their community's drinking water would be more likely to practice improved nutrient management, but this hypothesis has not been tested. There appears to be no single nutrient management practice or set of practices likely to be adopted nationwide. Rather, farm operators will choose among techniques appropriate for their farming systems, soils, and the type of regulation that applies to their area. Many studies have examined the economic relationships and field conditions associated with the adoption of improved irrigation technologies. The most significant influences appear to be land quality and water cost savings. Included in most of the studies is a marginal water cost based upon the water-use efficiency of alternative technologies, which helps explain why producers select advanced water management technologies."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Farms Producing Corn", "text": "In 1996, 69 million acres, comprising nearly onefourth of U.S. cropland, were planted to corn, on 363,000 farms. Farms growing corn averaged around 600 acres, with the largest average size in the Plains States (table 1 and fig. 1). On all farms producing corn, corn was planted to the most acreage, followed by soybeans ( fig. 2). There are regional variations; corn and soybeans account for about the same acreage share in the Corn Belt, for example. However, the importance of irrigated corn in the Plains States is reflected in its large share of acreage. Similarly, the relative importance of other crops, such as cotton and peanuts on farms raising corn, are reflected in the Southeast ( fig. 3). As would be expected, corn is raised on a larger share of farms in the Corn Belt than in any other region, 45 percent ( fig. 4). Over 50 percent of the acreage was rented, with cash rent predominant in all regions except the Corn Belt ( fig. 5). The average gross cash sale from farms raising corn was $162,000, with crop sales accounting for over 50 percent of total sales ( fig. 6). Fifty percent of the farms had sales of $100,000 or more, and 6 percent had sales greater than $500,000 ( fig. 7). The gross cash income of farmers raising corn was over $160,000 and the net farm income exceeded $40,000. The average balance   sheet appears favorable, with assets approaching $700,000 and equity approaching $600,000 ( fig. 8). Over 40 percent of corn farmers had attended or completed college ( fig. 9). Corn production involves a complex management system and myriad decisions that affect technical, economic, and environmental factors. Some of these choices can be made singularly, but most require consideration of numerous interactions. For example, choices about tillage or crop rotation practices influence, or are influenced by, those made about nutrient and pesticide management. Similarly, irrigation decisions are intertwined with nutrient and soil management decisions. The following sections discuss the use of soil, nutrient, and irrigation management systems in corn production in the major corn-producing regions of the United States.   Crop sales were the largest share     Income and balance sheet information for average farm raising corn "}, {"section_title": "Soil Management Systems in Corn Production", "text": "Soil is the key resource in all crop production. Beyond supporting the basic physical, chemical, and biological processes for plants to grow, it regulates water flow between infiltration, root-zone storage, deep percolation, and runoff and acts as a buffer between production inputs and the environment. Soil management is an important component of corn production because of its beneficial impacts on soil erosion and topsoil loss, organic content, soil compaction, acidification, and the loss of nitrate, phosphorus, pesticides, salt, and trace elements to surface and groundwater supplies. Hence, the selection by corn producers of soil management practices can have a significant impact on input use, productivity, output, and costs and returns, as well as on environmental quality. The soil management practices included in the survey are designed to maintain the quality and long-term productivity of the soil and to reduce potential environmental damages from crop production. They include using cover crops and crop rotations and maintaining crop residues on the soil surface. They also include various field structures and buffer zones, such as grass waterways, terraces, contour farming, stripcropping, underground drainage outlets, and surface diversion and drainage channels. Many of these practices may be used in combination, depending on topographic and agriclimatic conditions. The extent to which particular soil management practices are adopted depends on site-specific soil and climate conditions, as well as on technical and economic feasibility and farmers' attitudes toward the practices."}, {"section_title": "Crop Production Systems", "text": "Crop production systems comprise combinations of crop rotations, and crop production and soil conservation practices. These systems are important to soil management, particularly among producers searching for production methods that depend less upon chemicals, conserve soil, and mitigate the loss of nutrients to the environment. Before commercial fertilizers, crop rotations were the primary means of replenishing soil nutrients. Crop rotations take many forms, including a monoculture rotation, where there is continuous production of the same crop, such as corn or cotton, in the same field year after year. Crop rotations may be repeated in a rigid pattern or a flexible one that varies from year to year, or even within a season, to accommodate changes in climatic and market conditions. There can also be an intensive rotation within a year, or a season, under favorable agriclimatic conditions. Cropping systems are designed with differences in soil and climate in mind as well as the socioeconomic conditions under which the crops are produced (see box for \"Crop Rotation Definitions\"). Crops are rotated to: (1) improve fertility by including nitrogen-fixing legumes in crop rotations, reducing the subsequent need for commercial nitrogen fertilizer, (2) control insects, diseases, and weeds, (3) reduce soil erosion and related loss of soil nutrients and moisture, (4) increase water-holding capacity of the soil through increased organic matter, (5) reduce the water pollution often associated with runoff and leaching, and (6) promote crop diversification to provide an economic buffer against price fluctuation for crops and production inputs. A corn-legume rotation was used on almost 60 percent of the 1996 corn acres.

CRM is in contrast to conventional tillage methods, which typically leave less than 15 percent of residue on the soil surface. CRM has a number of site-dependent beneficial effects, on and off the farm. These include: (1) reduced erosion and chemical runoff, (2) improved moisture retention in soil and better water penetration, (3) increased sequestration of soil organic carbon (some of which might otherwise be released to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide), (4) improved long-term productivity of the soil, and (5) potentially higher economic returns. Crop residue management practices include reducedtillage and three conservation tillage methods: mulchtill, ridge-till, and no-till. These practices are often combined with off-season cover crops and field-level structural measures for control of erosion (see box, \"Tillage Practice Definitions\"). Conservation tillage was not the major tillage system in corn production in the United States in 1996. Over 60 percent of the corn acreage was in either conventional (30 percent) or reduced-till systems (32 per-cent), with the balance split between mulch-and notill. Ridge-till was used on only 2 percent of the total corn acreage (table 2 and fig. 11). A primary use of ridge-till is to create furrows for water flow in irrigated corn production. There are some regional differences in the adoption of tillage systems for corn production (table 2). In the Lake States, conventional tillage was predominant, used on almost half (46 percent) of the total corn acreage. This share was nearly equal to that of reduced-and mulch-till combined. No-till made up a very small proportion of Lake States corn acreage, and ridge-till was not practiced at all. Conventional tillage was also the predominant practice in the Southeast, used on 37 percent of corn acres, followed closely by no-till at 35 percent. In the Corn Belt, reduced-till was the principal practice, used on 42 percent of regional acreage, with the remaining acreage dominated by conventional tillage systems. Only in the Plains States were tillage practices distributed fairly evenly among conventional, reduced, and conservation tillage, with ridge-till at 6 percent of the regional total ( fig. 12). About 20 percent of the acreage in corn production in 1996 was identified as highly erodible land (HEL) (table 3), and conservation tillage methods were frequently used on these fragile acres. All four regions have about the same share of corn acreage in HEL, 20 percent, indicating that productivity-damaging erosion is a potentially serious problem across corn-producing areas. On 85 percent of HEL acres in corn production, a tillage practice was used that left more than 15 percent residue on the surface, that is, tillage by other than a moldboard plow. For the corn area as a whole, the shares of HEL in reduced-till, mulch-till, and notill are just about equal. Mulch-till was the most common HEL option in the Lake States, Plains States, and Southeast, while for the Corn Belt reduced-till and notill were equally practiced. The 1985 Farm Bill and its successors have encouraged the adoption of crop residue management (CRM) on HEL by tying USDA program benefits to implementation of the USDAapproved soil conservation management plan (USDA, 1977b, p. 299). CRM tillage practices have been adopted in response to environmental concerns as well as to economic and public policy incentives (figs. 13 and 14)."}, {"section_title": "Soil and Water Conservation Structures", "text": "Soil and water conservation structures can significantly reduce erosion caused by water runoff. These structures allow for surface water to be captured onsite or slowed and diverted from the field via erosion-resistant waterways, channels, or outlets. While crop rotation and tillage practices may also be used to help control erosion, they may be ineffective at controlling runoff water after heavy rains. Therefore, engineered structures are often important components of farm soil management systems. The use of engineered structures for soil and water conservation is widespread in corn production (table Tillage types that leave less than 15 percent crop residue cover after planting, or less than 500 pounds per acre of small-grain-residue equivalent, throughout the critical wind erosion period.

In total, 66 percent of planted corn-for-grain acres have at least one of the six soil and water conservation structures included in the survey ( fig.15). The presence of these structures varies from one region to another. The Corn Belt (79 percent of regional acreage) and Lake States (75 percent) use such structures more than the Southeast (52 percent) and Plains States (32 percent). Climatic and landscape conditions may be responsible for much of the difference in the use of conservation structures across regions.   than those who used a conventional tillage system (54 years, on average). While 12 percent of operators using a conventional tillage system had graduated from college, 30 percent of those adopting a no-till system were college graduates. The age of the equipment was not measured, so there was no way to determine if a replacement decision might be influencing the choice of tillage systems.  The number of acres operated, a variable correlated with several other farm size measures, showed wide variation across tillage systems (table 5). The most notable difference was in the size of the farms: those using a conventional tillage system averaged 460 acres, compared with 718 for farms using reducedtill and 913 acres for farms using no-till systems. Farms using mulch-till systems operated an average of 612 acres. Predictably, gross cash sales, sales class distribution, and acres harvested of specific crops increased with the number of acres operated. Hence, these size indicators also imply that farms using conventional tillage systems tended to be smaller than farms using conservation tillage. Measures of farm production diversity such as cropping patterns and source of cash receipts differed little by tillage system (table 5). Farms with no-till systems were, on average, less diverse (a large share of acres harvested are corn acres and cash sales are primarily from crops) than those with conventional tillage. Reduced-till farms appeared to be the least diverse, with corn comprising 46 percent of all harvested acreage vs. 35 percent for conventional tillage farms. Farm finance measures reveal several contrasts between farms adopting no-till systems and those using conventional tillage. Farm size, as reflected in gross cash income and assets, was much smaller for farms using conventional tillage systems than for notill farms. Furthermore, net farm income was much smaller on the conventional tillage farms ($26,000) than on no-till farms ($67,000) (table 6). Depending on the finance measure, even reduced-till and mulchtill farms tended to be larger and produce higher incomes than conventional tillage farms. 2 Care must be exercised when comparing the means presented throughout this report. They were obtained from farm survey data and are not the same as those from controlled experiments. Conditions other than the factor being analyzed, e.g., tillage systems or nutrient management practices, are not equal in farm surveys. Thus, differences between mean estimates for operator and farm characteristics from the survey results cannot necessarily be attributed to type of tillage system used. Results are influenced by many other factors, including weather, soils, and nutrient and pest management practices. While one cannot infer causality from the means, they are useful for identifying interrelationships and formulating testable hypotheses for subsequent analysis. The field-level input use data and cost and return enterprise data indicated few consistent differences among farms using different tillage systems. The reduced-till systems tended to have higher gross production values and lower per bushel costs of production than the conventional tillage systems. Yields, with the exception of differences between conventional and reduced-till systems, were fairly consistent across all tillage systems in 1996, which is not surprising given that seed, fertilizer, pesticide, and manure use per acre were similar for most tillage categories (      "}, {"section_title": "Nutrient Management Systems in Corn Production", "text": "Nutrient management in corn production has an impact on soil fertility, yields, profitability, and environmental risk. Soil fertility involves the complex interactions between the biological, chemical, and physical properties of the soil. Physical properties encompass such factors as soil density, waterholding capacity, and rooting depth, all of which can affect both plant growth and nutrient leaching and runoff. Chemical properties include soil pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potash, and sulfur status and organic matter content. Of the factors affecting soil fertility, many are rarely in equilibrium and change from year to year. These dynamics create the need to periodically monitor soil nutrient levels and assess the need for fertilizer and soil amendments. Commercial or organic fertilizers enhance the soil content of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash, critical nutrients for corn production. If these nutrients were not applied, the soil's store of nutrients would become depleted and current yields could not be sustained in most corn-growing areas. A number of nutrient management tools are available to corn producers to improve economic performance and reduce the availability of residuals that may pollute the environment (Ferguson et al., 1994). In U.S. corn production, the recommended or best management practices typically include a number of actions, done individually or combined with others. Some of these tools are identified in the box \"Examples of Nutrient Management Tools.\" Agronomists typically advise farmers to use these recommended practices in sequence, beginning with the establishment of a yield goal, as a precursor to estimating the total amount of nutrients needed by the crop. However, several approaches can be used in the first step, formulation of yield goals. If a goal of profit maximization is assumed, the optimal input use and yield goal will be determined jointly, taking into account price and cost relationships. In contrast, yield goals set by agronomists typically reflect average or normal yields for the field, considering only agronomic response relationships. The amount of commercial fertilizer is typically determined after credit is given to the amount of nutrients available from the soil, the previous legume crop, and livestock manure. Once the needed amount of fertilizer is estimated, management decisions can be made about the fertilizer application method and timing, as well as whether to use more sophisticated technologies such as nitrogen inhibitors or variable-rate fertilizer application. Variable-rate application is a precision agriculture tool that can be used to vary fertilizer application rates within a field, with a goal of tailoring total fertilizer applications to reflect the variability of soil conditions within a field."}, {"section_title": "Sources of Nutrients Used in Corn Production", "text": "Most corn producers fertilize, using a variety of sources. The share of acreage on which nutrients are used varies among the major farm production regions (table 7). Commercial nitrogen was applied to 98 percent of the corn acreage and commercial phosphate to 87 percent ( fig. 18). The use of both manure and commercial fertilizer was reported on 15 percent of the acreage nationally but on 29 percent of the Lake States acreage, reflecting the relatively intense livestock industry, particularly dairying, in that area. Only 14 percent of the Corn Belt acreage received manure, followed by 10 percent of the Southeast and 6 percent of the Plain States. Table 7 also shows the 1996 commercial fertilizer application rates on corn acreage. Nationally, commercial fertilizer is the major source of nutrients, providing an average of 83 percent of all the nitrogen available per treated acre, 91 percent of all the phosphorus, and 88 percent of all the potassium. Legumes contributed an average of 13 percent of the total nitrogen available, and manure an estimated 4 percent. In the Lake States, however, manure accounted for an estimated 10 percent of the available nitrogen."}, {"section_title": "Use of Selected Nutrient Management Practices", "text": "Survey results indicate that the use of nutrient testing techniques in corn production varies widely among regions. Forty-three percent of planted corn acreage received a soil or plant tissue test, but only 21 percent received a nitrogen test. However, nitrogen management on the acres receiving the nitrogen test followed recommendations closely, with 82 percent of the acres receiving nitrogen at exactly the rates recommended or lower (table 8). In the Plains States, nearly half of the corn acres were tested for nitrogen, and on 84 percent of the tested acres, nitrogen was applied at rates matching or below the test recommendations. These application rates probably reflect the rigorous nitrogen monitoring process in Nebraska, one of the major corn-producing States in the Plains area. In the Southeast, by contrast, only 13 percent of the acres were tested for nitrogen, and only 40 percent of the tested acreage followed the recommendations or applied less nitrogen than recommended (table 8 and figs. 19 and 20). The timing and method of nitrogen fertilizer application and incorporation varies by region, as is shown in table 8. Broadcast application with incorporation was used on 15 percent of the acreage. Methods other than broadcasting were used on 40 percent of the acreage. Over 40 percent of the corn acres had some nitrogen applied by broadcasting, but without incorporation (table 8). Nitrogen fertilizer was applied before planting, either in the fall, the spring, or both, on 42 percent of the total acreage. All the nitrogen was applied in the fall to 13 percent of total acreage, but to almost 20 percent of the acreage in the Corn Belt. Thirty percent of all corn acreage received 100 percent of the nitrogen at or after planting, but this ranged from 45 percent in the Lake States to 24 per-cent in the Corn Belt. Nitrogen inhibitors were used on 9 percent of the national acreage, mostly in the Corn Belt (table 8). Manure was applied to almost 40 percent of the acreage in the Lake States, a region with relatively intense livestock production. In other areas, manure was applied to 4 to12 percent of the acreage, with the lowest application in the Plains States (table 8 and fig.  21). Manure incorporation into the soil following application was reported on 7 percent of the acreage, and application without incorporation on 10 percent. In the Lake States, 25 percent of the acres received manure without incorporation and 12 percent with incorporation ( fig. 21). Precision agriculture technologies, such as grid sampling, variable rate fertilizer application, and yield monitors, are primarily used for more intensive subfield management of commercial fertilizer. Precision agricultural technology applications in corn production Incorporating fertilizer into the soil during or soon after application to minimize surface runoff or volatilization of nutrients. Timing fertilizer applications to minimize potential losses to the environment; for example, applying all nitrogen at or after planting, when the demand by the crop for nutrients is greatest, to reduce the risk of nitrogen loss through leaching. Applying all nitrogen in the fall may increase the risk of leaching. Using nitrification inhibitors where necessary to slow the release of nitrates from ammonium fertilizers until later in the growing season, in order to reduce nitrate leaching by delaying the conversion of ammonium into nitrate. Using precision agriculture technologies to increase the efficiency of each unit of fertilizer, lime, and pesticide applied, thereby reducing negative environmental residuals. (Adapted from Ferguson et al., 1994) have become more common since the mid-1990s. In 1996, some form of precision agriculture technology was used on 23 percent of the total corn acreage, with a range of 19 to 26 percent among the regions. The Corn Belt had the highest precision technology use, which reflects an early emphasis by the developers of the technology on its application to corn production. As these technologies are relatively new, 1996 was the first time information was collected for them in the ARMS survey."}, {"section_title": "Interrelationships of Nutrient and Tillage Management", "text": "ARMS survey results highlighted how tillage systems also seemed to influence nutrient management practices. Soil or tissue tests were used most often on acreage using no-till or mulch-till systems and least often on conventionally tilled acreage. Few differences were noted in the use of nitrogen inhibitors, with a range of 6 to 11 percent among the various tillage systems (table 9 and fig. 22). A greater share of acres in no-till than in conventional tillage received nitrogen in the fall prior to planting, with a smaller percentage in the spring at or before planting. The broadest spectrum of methods used for all fertilizer was on conventionally tilled acreage. Broadcast and injection application was used on a larger share of no-till acreage than on conventionally tilled acreage, 74 percent compared with 67 percent for broadcast and 60 percent compared with 50 percent for injection (figs. 23, 24, and 25). Analysis of the crop residue management systems and types of fertilizer applied or application rates found few differences among various tillage systems, except for manure application, where a much smaller share of no-till acres received manure than did conventional acreage. This is understandable given the need to incorporate manure following application, for both environmental and economic reasons ( fig. 26).           Nitrogen fertilization rate by tillage type and method of application "}, {"section_title": "Irrigation Management Systems in Corn Production", "text": "Corn for grain has substantially more irrigated area than any other single crop in the United States. According to the most recent census of agriculture, 10.6 million acres of irrigated corn were harvested in 1997, 15 percent of the total corn acreage (USDA, 1999a). Irrigated corn was produced on 9 percent of the farms harvesting corn for grain and represented about 19 percent of total grain corn production. Nationwide, irrigated corn yields were about 29 percent higher than nonirrigated yields. In addition to increasing yield, irrigation expands production into areas normally too arid for corn production, as evidenced by the fact that 9 million (85 percent) of the irrigated corn acres were in the 19 Western States. 3 While the 31 Eastern States irrigate only 3 percent of the total corn area, Western States irrigate 50 percent. Most of the nonirrigated area in the Western States is in the eastern half of the Plains States, where climate is more similar to that of Eastern States. Nebraska had 47 percent of the irrigated corn acreage in 1997. The other major States producing irrigated corn are Kansas, Texas, and Colorado, with 14, 8, and 7 percent of the irrigated corn acreage, respectively, in 1997. Irrigated corn producers make choices that result in more or less efficient use of water. These producers, like other irrigators in the Nation, face increasing competition for tightening water supplies. Irrigators have responded by reducing water losses, increasing yields, and becoming more efficient in the use of all inputs. More output per inch of water input may be achieved by producing higher yields with the same water application, by maintaining yields with reduced water applications, or by achieving some combination of higher yields and less water. One mechanism to increase water available for plant growth relative to the quantity of water taken from streams or aquifers is by reducing water losses, in other words, by increasing the irrigation efficiency of the delivery system. Negri and Hanchar (1989) provide ranges of irrigation efficiencies for different water delivery technologies. In general, sprinkler technologies can be more efficient than gravity irrigation and provide more uniform water application, which can reduce nitrate leaching. In addition to the potential for water conservation and higher yields, sprinklers may also use less labor and have potential as a nutrient and pesticide delivery system. However, substituting sprinklers for gravity systems can be expensive from both a fixed cost (initial system expense) and a variable cost (pumping expense) perspective. Improving the irrigation delivery system is one way to use water more effectively. Better management through proper timing of water applications and applying the optimal water depth for a given field, crop, growth stage, and climate may greatly improve the efficiency of an existing system. Adding a delivery system capable of greater water control-a sprinkler system, for instance-may enable such improvements in irrigation management."}, {"section_title": "Irrigation Management Systems", "text": "Irrigation management systems generally incorporate a variety of irrigation technologies and water management practices. Previous studies of the adoption of water-conserving systems have examined either a technology or a management practice independently. However, irrigation systems are combinations of application technology, management practices, and information. The data available in the ARMS enable simultaneous consideration of these components to develop more inclusive measures of irrigation management systems. Many technologies are available for irrigating corn, ranging along a spectrum of capital and labor intensiveness/extensiveness. They also differ according to irrigation water conservation potential and management requirements. Irrigation technologies can be grouped into several categories, according to their potential for increasing water conservation: gravity, basic sprinkler, improved sprinkler, and \"other\" technologies. Details on the technologies in each of these categories are given in appendix B. For irrigated corn producers, several water management techniques are available to help with decisions about irrigation scheduling and water conservation. A producer may use one or more of these, including: (1) scheduling irrigation with commercial services or computer simulation models, (2) scheduling irrigation with on-farm techniques such as soil-moisture sensing devices, and (3) on-farm use of special furrowing techniques to control water distribution and reduce water loss. Numerous sources of information are available to help establish the efficient scheduling of irrigation water and are important in making water management decisions. These sources include: (1) irrigation equipment dealers or neighboring farmers, (2) extension agents and university and government specialists, (3) offfarm electronic information and media reports of area water use, and (4) commercial scheduling services or local water district specialists."}, {"section_title": "Prevalence of Irrigation Management Systems on Corn Acreage", "text": "The ARMS asked producers to identify, in addition to their application technology, the management practices they use and their sources of information. For this analysis, the components of farm irrigation management systems were combined in keeping with common understanding about how choices among application systems, management practices, and information sources are likely to affect irrigation efficiency. The sampling and editing procedure used for the ARMS resulted in only 64 usable irrigated corn farm responses, all from the Plains States of Nebraska, Kansas, and Texas. While the geographic coverage is limited to these three States, they account for almost 70 percent of the corn area under irrigation nationally. Nebraska alone accounts for 47 percent of this area (USDA, 1999a). The small sample size limits the ability to draw strong inferences from the data. Of the corn acreage irrigated, 42 percent was by gravity flow systems, 19 percent by basic sprinkler technologies (for example, big gun and center pivots with sprinklers on the main pipe), and 39 percent by advanced sprinkler technology (such as center-pivot and linear-move tower sprinklers with sprinklers below the main pipe) (table 10). Irrigation technology use was mixed, with some farms having most of their irrigated acreage under improved sprinkler technologies but also using gravity systems. The use of irrigation management practices varied considerably. The practices requiring the most intensive management include on-farm, special furrowing techniques to control water distribution and reduce water loss. Another intensive management tool is to schedule irrigation using off-farm services (commercial services or computer simulation models). Survey respondents were asked to choose their top three sources of irrigation information. The source described as \"information provided by local irrigation district personnel or specialists hired by the local water district\" was used by 43 percent of all farms. Private irrigation specialists served only 5 percent of farms. Many farmers relied on local information sources. Neighboring farmers were an information source for 31 percent of corn producers and irrigation equipment dealers for about 24 percent. Extension agents provided irrigation information to about 19 percent of the irrigators and specialists from other government agencies to about 10 percent. Computer-based information sources, including the Internet, were a resource for about 19 percent of producers. But information from these sources is generally developed by the Extension Service or other government agencies (county, State, and Federal) (table 10). Local irrigation district personnel or specialists hired by the local water district provided information for producers farming about twothirds of the irrigated corn area. 4 Thus, irrigated corn producers have many sources of information to help them in their decisionmaking. More analysis is needed to assess whether these resources provide information of the quality and credibility to make it useful to producers in their individual locales. 4 The strong role of irrigation district personnel or specialists hired by the local water district as information sources is not representative of the Nation's, or the West's, irrigated area. Over three-quarters of the usable surveys are from Nebraska farms. Nebraska has a strong, well-supported, statewide local water district system. Results from a 1998 survey (USDA, 1999b) indicate about 20 percent of the West's irrigators rely on local irrigation districts as an information source. Irrigated corn yields averaged 154 bushels per acre, and water application rates averaged 10.5 inches per year. Groundwater was used for irrigation on almost 90 percent of irrigated corn area in Nebraska, Kansas, and Texas. Gravity irrigation systems were used on almost two-thirds of the acreage supplied by surface water. Gravity distribution is typically used with surface water sources because of lower water cost, level topography, and the older capital infrastructure built around such systems. Turbine pump technology, allowing extraction and pressurization of water at one point, makes it easier for groundwater-supplied farms to adopt sprinkler technologies, but at a substantial cost in higher energy requirements per acre-foot of water when compared with surface water. This can provide a strong incentive to increase groundwater irrigation efficiency. Thus, it was not surprising to find more lower-pressure, drop-tube center pivots among groundwater-supplied farms. Reducing the operating pressure directly translates into fuel cost savings. Farmers producing irrigated corn operated an average of 5.5 wells per farm. Among irrigated farms, 64 percent of wells (serving 77 percent of the area irrigated) used backflow prevention devices to protect the water quality of aquifers, and 23 percent of wells had meters. Seventeen percent of irrigated corn acres received chemical fertilizer through the irrigation system. Pesticides were applied through irrigation systems to 8 percent of the irrigated area (table 10)."}, {"section_title": "Comparison of Irrigated and Nonirrigated Systems", "text": "Comparisons of farm and farm operator characteristics of irrigated and nonirrigated operations are tenuous at best due to the small number of irrigated farm samples. However, the data may provide some insights for future research. The most obvious difference between the two types of farms is their size. Irrigated farms had more than twice the acreage of nonirrigated farms and had a higher proportion of their total acreage in corn. The gross cash sales of farms with irrigation were almost double those of nonirrigated farms, reflecting larger acreage and higher yields. However, the share of gross cash sales from livestock, crops, government payments, and other sources was comparable, with irrigators having a smaller share from livestock. Over twice as many farms with irrigated corn had sales of $250,000 or more compared with nonirrigated farms, reflecting larger farms and higher irrigated yields (table 11). The average age of operators of irrigated corn farms was 4 years less than that of operators of nonirrigated farms. Farmers with irrigated corn were almost twice as likely to have graduated from college as those without irrigated corn. About 25 percent of those with irrigation had their farm records computerized. Almost 90 percent of the farmers producing irrigated corn identified farming as their primary occupation. Irrigated farms had a smaller percentage of their corn acreage in conventional, reduced, and mulch tillage than did nonirrigated farms, but a higher percentage in no-till/ridge-till. Both had the same share of acreage in highly erodible land (HEL), about 28 percent. The higher share of irrigated acreage in no-till/ridge-till reflects the use of ridge-till to create furrows for irrigation water flow. Ridge-till is typically the no-till system used by furrow irrigators (table 12).  "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The previous sections examined soil, nutrient, and irrigation management systems used in the production of corn, based on ARMS data for 1996. The characteristics of the practices, as well as those of the operators and the farms on which corn was produced, provide basic information for those interested in resource-use questions dealing with corn production. The information may be used by those working in the public arena to develop resource-use programs and policies that will meet both private and public objectives. As new agricultural technologies emerge or established practices become widely recommended by public institutions, social scientists have asked why some farmers adopt a new technology and others do not. While this study does not address this question, it does identify some areas for future analyses. Productivityenhancing practices and technologies were the focus of attention in early studies, but more recently attention has shifted to technologies that reduce negative environmental effects or conserve resources such as soil and water. Analysis of adoption behavior can help researchers and policymakers to adapt technologies and practices or design policy instruments that will encourage adoption. This report documents the extent of adoption of many of the most common soil, nutrient, and irrigation water management practices used on U.S. farms producing corn. It also examines selected operator, farm, and enterprise characteristics of the farms adopting various conservation strategies. Tillage systems and structures designed to reduce soil erosion from intense rainfall are key components of most soil management and conservation systems. Conservation tillage, a widely recommended crop residue practice to conserve soil and reduce other environmental risks, was used on about 38 percent of the land in corn production in 1996. Other tillage systems that do not leave as much residue on the soil surface, such as reduced tillage and conventional systems, were used on 30 and 32 percent, respectively, of the corn acreage. The Lake States had the highest share of acreage in conventional tillage systems, while the Southeast had nearly 50 percent of its corn acreage in mulch-till or no-till. However, a major motivating force for adopting CRM (crop residue management) is the designation of a cornfield as HEL (highly erodible land). Farmers who adopted conservation tillage systems (mulch-and no-till, specifically) tended to be younger and better educated than those using reduced-till and conventional systems. By nearly all size measures (acres or sales), farms producing corn with no-till practices were larger and less diverse (with relatively less livestock and fewer crop types) than farms using conventional tillage systems. Conservation tillage farms generated more income than farms using other tillage systems. However, producers adopting other tillage systems were not found to use significantly different levels of inputs to produce corn. The survey results also show that two recommended nutrient management practices were each used on nearly 60 percent of the corn acreage: (1) corn-legume rotation, primarily using soybeans, and (2) application of nitrogen fertilizer to minimize surface runoff, either by methods other than broadcasting or by broadcasting followed by soil incorporation. Soil testing, applying all nitrogen at or after planting, and using precision agriculture technologies were each used on 20 to 30 percent of the corn acreage. Nitrogen inhibitors were used on less than 10 percent. At least four of the recommended practices were used by 12 percent of the farms; 19 percent used one or none of the practices. Corn is one of the most widely irrigated crops in the United States, and as competition for water from nonagricultural sources intensifies, the importance of irrigation water conservation in corn production will likely increase. The ARMS estimated that 7 to 9 million acres of corn were irrigated in 1996. Most of this was in the moisture-deficient Plains States, primarily Nebraska, Kansas, and Texas. Forty-two percent of the irrigated corn was produced using gravity flow application systems and 39 percent using water-conserving sprinkler systems. The adoption of sprinkler irrigation technology and the use of irrigation information sources are identified as critical water conservation strategies. This report is largely descriptive in nature. It leaves for further analysis questions about the empirical relationships between operator and farm characteristics and the adoption of management practices that can reduce negative environmental impacts from corn production. Identifying the farm and operator characteristics associated with specific practices and management systems may be useful in targeting education, technical assistance, and cost-sharing programs for nutrient management.\nThis study argues for a revision of USDA's estimates of retail-farm price margins for major U.S. food commodities. The argument is supported by empirically defensible estimates that automatically account for the implications of structural change, the diversity among firms, and the diversity of final products associated with a food market. In contrast, current USDA-ERS estimates fail to automatically account for diversity and structural change in food markets. Without appealing to market power, both the current and revised estimates for seven major U.S. food markets trend upward over the 1980-97sample period. Although the revised estimates appear to be more volatile than the current estimates, the two sets are highly correlated. More significant is the finding that the responses of the two sets of estimates are either not statistically correlated or are negatively correlated. These differences are explained by the differences in assumptions concerning diversity in food markets. The revised estimates allow for diverse firm-level responses to market changes, a feature that allows for input substitution as the industry allocates production across different firm-level technologies. The current estimates rule out this source of response by presuming identical firms. The revised estimates link rising retail-farm price margins and declining farm shares to changes in demand for the elementary products that consumers actually purchase. Without essentially ad hoc adjustments, the current estimates cannot be linked to the diverse array of final consumer products. Expenditure-based measures of composite consumer demand are central to the computation of the revised estimates because they directly link changes in food quality and marketing services to changes in retailfarm price margins. Empirical results suggest that the revised estimates are more sensitive to changes in food quality than the current estimates. Improvements in the revised series will emerge from improved estimates of the farm receipts generated from at-home sales. Because away-from-home sales compete for the same farm ingredients, continued growth in away-from-home demand is likely to increase the retail farm price margins."}, {"section_title": "Suggestions for Future Research", "text": "Comparing producers who have adopted different soil, nutrient, or irrigation management practices and systems, even for the same commodity, poses several challenges, especially when a number of performance criteria are of interest. Roberts and Swinton (1996) note that \"profitability and environmental impacts are the two performance criteria of greatest interest for contemporary comparisons\u2026of different production or management systems.\" 5 They note that factors such as the dynamics of different systems (for example, crop rotations), responsiveness to shocks (weather and price changes), and environmental resource endowment (highly erodible soils and sandy soils over shallow aquifers), make multiobjective comparisons difficult across production or management practices. So do differences in human capital (such as age and education) and in attitudes about the environment. Further research needs to address how regional differences in soil and climate impact the selection of management practices. Some practices may be more appropriate and profitable in certain regions of the United States and for certain soil and agriclimatic zones. Analyzing a set of practices rather than each one individually helps offset the problem of circumstances that prevent use of a practice in a particular year. For example, adverse weather may prevent using a nitrogen inhibitor or broadcasting nitrogen during a year, or the producer may not employ a practice annually (as with soil testing). A number of questions for future research arise from the data discussed in this report. Some concern the interrelationships between operator and farm characteristics and management practice selection. How important are age and education, compared with experience in making management system decisions? Do larger farms use more complex management systems, with more extensive sources of information and more explicit management linkages between soil, nutrient, and irrigation resources? How much does the income level and the balance sheet condition influence the choice of management systems? What implications do the relationships between farm size and adoption of management systems have for policy concerned with more benign environmental impacts? Do better managers control a larger asset base or have a significantly different return on equity than others? Is there a significant difference in the variable cost per bushel produced or the total cash expenses that can be related to operator characteristics and various management practices? Other questions pertain to whether reasonable relationships can be established between the number of management practices adopted and the intensity of a corn producer's commitment to effective soil, nutrient, or irrigation management programs. What correlation can be assumed between the number of practices adopted and impacts on the environment and sustainable agricultural systems? Is reliance by producers on a set of practices, rather than a single specific practice, more effective in meeting the multiple objectives of resource management systems? A number of studies identify the factors or characteristics associated with farmers who have adopted conservation practices. Conservation tillage studies are the focus here. The numerous studies that examined other conservation practices, such as grassed waterways, contour farming, stripcropping, and terraces, are not discussed, except to note that: (1) they have found that education and perception of a soil erosion problem are positively associated with conservation practice adoption and (2) the proportion of land rented was significant and was negatively related Norris and Battie, 1987;Young and Shortle, 1984). A variety of economic, demographic, geographic, and policy variables have been identified that affect the adoption and use of conservation tillage in the United States. Management complexities and profitability are key factors impeding its adoption. The use of conservation tillage varies by crop and is dependent on sitespecific factors, including soil type, topsoil depth, and local climatic conditions. The consensus of numerous studies is that the relative economic performance of any conservation tillage practice depends on a number of site-specific and operator-specific factors. The degree to which farmers are risk averse and soil type, topsoil depth, choice among cropping systems, level of managerial expertise, and local climatic conditions have all been identified as important variables. In a study of Iowa farmers in 1976,  found that farmers with larger operations, a higher soybean-to-corn acreage ratio, and rolling, lighter, and better-drained soils were more likely to adopt conservation tillage. Human capital variables such as education, continuing operator education, and good health were found to positively impact the adoption decision.  reported on the conservation tillage decision of farm-ers in the Piedmont area of Virginia in 1983. They found that younger farmers and those that plan to transfer the farm to a relative operate more acres with conservation tillage. Farm size was also positively associated with acres under conservation tillage. Farmers with off-farm jobs and higher total incomes had fewer acres under conservation tillage. Norris and Batie did not find variables such as the operator's education and tenure status to be associated with conservation tillage acreage. Belknap and Saupe (1988) examined factors influencing conservation tillage among farmers in southwestern Wisconsin in 1982. They found that adopters of conservation tillage were more likely to be risk takers and to be owners, to operate large farms, and to farm in areas with less precipitation and warmer climates. They also considered factors such as education, farming experience, family income, and debt-to-asset ratios, but did not find them to be important explanatory factors. A follow-on study in 1987  found the proportion of farm acres with conservation tillage to be positively associated with total farm acres planted, nondairy farms, sloping land, row crops, a dry, cool climate, and higher household income. Younger farmers and farmers who perceived an erosion problem on their land had a larger proportion of acres in conservation tillage. Fuglie and Klotz (1994) studied the conservation tillage decisions made in 1991 by farmers in the Lower Susquehanna River Basin of Pennsylvania. They found having larger farms and farms subject to conservation compliance, as well as having fields with higher inherent soil erodibility, to be the only important variables differentiating farmers who used conservation tillage from those who used conventional tillage. Variables such as the operator's education or experience and the use of manure or planting of row crops were not important factors in their study. These results were confirmed in a more recent study by . They found that participation in farm programs and the use of technical advice had a positive influence on the probability of adopting conservation soil management practices, particularly practices with offsite benefits. Much of the literature on adoption of new technologies focuses on why farmers differ in their willingness to adopt them (Antle and McGuckin, 1993;Westra and Olson, 1997). Among the reasons sug-gested for adoption of conservation tillage are differences in entrepreneurial ability, risk preferences, and the availability of complementary inputs . Soil-conserving tillage systems are quite complex and normally require a higher level of management skills for the proper timing and placement of nutrients and pesticides. These managerial requirements have been found to be the key to successful use of conservation tillage (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1997a). Conservation tillage provides fewer opportunities to correct mistakes or adjust to changed circumstances once the growing season is underway. New technologies must be integrated with existing inputs. In the case of conservation tillage, this implies that the system must be compatible with the soil characteristics and climatic conditions (Nowak, 1984 and. Several studies provide insight into the factors that affect the adoption of conservation tillage. Pagoulatos et al. (1989), using an erosion-damage function analysis for corn grown in Kentucky, found that the decision to convert to conservation tillage from conventional tillage is dependent on the price of output, the discount rate (with a higher rate leading to slower adoption), and the capital cost of conversion. Large capital costs for new machinery serve as a deterrent. Uri (1997) found that cash grain enterprises were more likely to adopt conservation tillage than other farm types. Factors associated with a greater likelihood of adoption included the greater slope of the cropland and higher average rainfall. Adopters spent more on fertilizer and pesticides, but less on fuel, than nonadopters. Conversely, the age and education level of the farmer/operator was not associated with adopting conservation tillage. The productivity of the soil, as measured by average yield across farms in a county, had no identifiable impact. Texture of the soil, total acres planted, number of acres in the acreage reduction program, extent of irrigation, and proportion of acres not receiving any pesticide treatment likewise were not associated with the adoption of conservation tillage on corn acreage. Batte et al. (1993) found that commercial farms in Ohio in 1992 tended to operate with a single system. Thus, farms classified as no-tillage used a no-tillage system on 85 percent of planted acreage, while conventional tillage farms used moldboard plowing on 80 percent of their acreage. Farms using conservation tillage tended to be substantially larger than farms using conventional tillage. The greater volatility in yields or in net returns associated with the use of conservation tillage has been found to be a deterrent to its adoption. Mikesell et al. (1988) found conservation tillage systems had slightly higher expected returns but were more variable, based upon an evaluation of alternative tillage systems for a 640-acre grain farm in northeastern Kansas. Williams et al. (1989) found that conservation tillage used in grain sorghum production had higher expected net revenues but greater risk than conventional tillage. Westra and Olson (1997) found that larger Minnesota farms are more likely to use conservation tillage and that the probability of this is greater if the owner/operator is more concerned about erosion."}, {"section_title": "Nutrient Management", "text": "Most adoption studies of natural resource management practices in agriculture have concentrated on mediumto long-term conservation practices such as conservation tillage, terraces, grassed waterways, contour farming, or stripcropping Feder and Umali, 1993;Belknap and Saupe, 1988). Recent studies have looked at the adoption of nutrient management practices intended to increase nutrient use efficiency, and thus to decrease the harmful environmental effects of nutrient runoff and leaching into ground and surface waters. Fuglie, Bosch, and Keim (1994) and  examined the adoption of soil and tissue nitrogen (N) testing by corn producers. The variables significant in explaining N-test adoption differed across regions studied. In Indiana, only the use of crop insurance was found to be a significant explanatory variable. In Pennsylvania, farmer experience was negatively associated with N-test adoption, while manure use had a positive impact. The explanatory power of the model was much greater when applied to Nebraska data. This model included policy and land quality variables as well as farm and farmer characteristics. Fuglie and Bosch found that irrigators were more likely than nonirrigators to use N-tests. N-test use was also higher on fields located in counties requiring a higher proportion of cropland to be N-tested. Farm operators who completed high school and at least some college were more likely to adopt N-testing than operators who had not finished high school. Farms with gross annual sales between $100,000 and $250,000 were less likely to N-test than farms with lower gross sales. Operators used N-testing less on owned fields than rented fields and more on fields covered by crop insurance. Finally, N-testing was more likely to be practiced on sandy soils with above-average organic matter and pH. Variables hypothesized to be important in the decision to adopt N-testing but not found to be significant included operator experience, the presence of a USDA water quality project in the county, and whether a legume was grown in the field the previous season.  analyzed the nutrient management practices of legume crediting (estimating nitrogen amounts legumes collect from the air on their root nodules), nutrient value, manure testing, and split applications of nitrogen in Iowa, Illinois, Virginia, North Carolina, and Idaho. They found farm operators in Iowa and Idaho to be more likely than operators in Florida and Georgia to use legume crediting. Farmers who use rotations, manure, or tissue testing were more likely to adopt legume crediting. Education was positively associated with legume crediting, while the number of days worked off-farm showed a negative association. Beef, hog, and sheep farms were found less likely than others to use split nitrogen applications. The practice is also less common in Iowa. Manure testing was found to be more commonly adopted by operators who applied manure to the sampled field and by beef, hog, and sheep farms. Education was also a positive and significant variable in the manure-testing regression. Using the same survey data,  found that information-intensive nutrient management practices, such as soil testing or micronutrient use, were more likely to be adopted by farmers with more formal education, operators of larger farms, and those who sought technical advice. In a number of studies, the operator's perception of an erosion problem was found to increase conservation expenditures or the number of conservation practices used (Belknap and Saupe, 1988;. A similar variable for nutrient management, such as the perception of a nutrient problem in local water supplies, may significantly impact the decision to use nutrient management practices, but such a variable has not been measured by any study to date. In summary, factors explaining the adoption of nutrient management practices are both regional and practicespecific. Adoption depends on the type of farming in the region (irrigated or not), the type of soils, and the presence of regulation. Some tests, such as manure testing, may more commonly be done on farms that have livestock. It is also likely that operators who believe that a nutrient problem exists in their own or their community's drinking water supply will be more likely to practice improved nutrient management, but this hypothesis has not been tested. Nutrient management is not one practice or set of practices likely to be adopted across the country by all operators. Rather, farm operators will choose among a suite of nutrient management techniques appropriate for their crops, soils, and level of regulation."}, {"section_title": "Irrigation Water Management Studies", "text": "Previous studies have examined the economics and field conditions associated with the adoption of improved irrigation technologies. Several of these studies were based in California (Caswell and Zilberman, 1985;Green et al, 1996;Caswell and Zilberman, 1986). Among the reasons for the California analysis was the availability of data to relate irrigation technology with crop production, soil quality, and field conditions. Most of these studies include a marginal water cost that helps explain why producers select advanced water management technologies. (Note that over the 10-year span of the California studies, the definition of \"advanced\" irrigation technologies changed.) All of these studies used cross-sectional data to statistically estimate multivariate adoption functions. California is not the only place, nor is cross-section data the only base, for estimating the adoption of improved irrigation practices. Nieswiadomy (1988) used time-series data for seven counties in the Texas High Plains region to examine irrigation in an input substitution methodology, which included substitution among technology choices and farm labor. While this study did recognize the interaction between technology choice and other inputs (labor, in this case), it did not include the field-level data the California studies found important. In a review of empirical research, Caswell (1991) found that the most significant factors influencing water saving irrigation technology appeared to be land quality and water cost savings. Lichtenberg (1989) captured the simultaneous nature of the crop/technology choices. He showed that land quality exerts a marked influence on cropping patterns and that the introduction of center-pivot irrigation has induced changes in cropping patterns. The field-level approach of Caswell and Zilberman (1985) was combined with the elements of Nieswiadomy's input substitution approach in a national examination of water-conserving technologies by Negri and Brooks (1996). Negri and Brooks used cross-sectional data and considered improvements to gravity irrigation and adoption of sprinkler technology separately. This study developed important procedures for examining field-level characteristics with a national database and showed that improving gravity irrigation systems is an effective alternative to replacing them with an entirely new technology. Surge flow is an adaptation of gated-pipe systems in which water is delivered to the furrow in timed releases. Furrows are alternately wetted and allowed to dry. As the soil dries, the soil surface forms a water seal, permitting the next surge of water to travel farther down the furrow with less upslope deep percolation. This technique significantly reduces the time needed for irrigation water to be distributed the full length of the field, thereby reducing deep percolation and increasing application efficiency. Cablegation is a gated-pipe system in which a moveable plug is allowed to slowly pass through a long section of gated pipe, with the rate of movement controlled by a cable and brake. Due to the oversizing and required slope of the pipe, water will gradually cease flowing into the first rows irrigated after the plug has progressed sufficiently far down the pipe. Improved water management is achieved by varying the speed of the plug, which controls the timing of water flows into each furrow. Alternate furrow irrigations involve wetting every second furrow only. This technique limits deep percolation losses by encouraging lateral moisture movement. Water applied and time required to irrigate each time may be significantly less than under fullfurrow systems, but more irrigations may be required to supply crop needs. The technique is very effective when the desired strategy is to irrigate to a less-thanfield-capacity level to more fully utilize rainfall. Special furrows have been employed to enhance water management. Wide-spaced furrows function much like alternative-row irrigation, except that every row is irrigated and rows are farther apart. Compacted furrows involve compacting the soil in the bottom of the furrow to provide a smooth, firm surface to speed water advance. Furrow diking places dikes in the furrows to capture additional rainfall, thereby eliminating runoff and reducing irrigation requirements. Furrow diking is typically used on irrigated fields in combination with alternative furrow irrigations (in the nonirrigated row) or low-pressure sprinklers on fine textured soils. Tailwater reuse systems recover irrigation runoff in pits below the field and pump the water to the head of the field for reuse."}, {"section_title": "Pressurized Application Systems", "text": "Center-pivot sprinklers are the predominant pressure technology. A center-pivot sprinkler is a self-propelled system in which a single pipeline supported by a row of mobile A-frame towers is suspended 6 to 12 feet above the field. Water is pumped into the pipe at the center of the field as towers rotate slowly around the pivot point, irrigating a large circular area. Sprinkler nozzles mounted on or suspended from the pipeline distribute water under pressure as the pipeline rotates. The nozzles are graduated from small to large so that the faster moving outer circle receives the same amount of water as the slower moving inside. Typical center-pivot sprinklers are one-quarter mile long and irrigate 128-to 132-acre circular fields. Center pivots have proven to be very flexible and can accommodate a variety of crops, soils, and topography with minimal modification. Hand move is a portable sprinkler system in which lightweight pipeline sections are moved manually for successive irrigation sets of 40 to 60 feet. Lateral pipelines are connected to a mainline, which may be portable or buried. Hand-moved systems are often used for small, irregular fields. These systems are not suited to tall-growing field crops due to difficulty in repositioning laterals. Labor requirements are higher than for all other sprinklers. Solid set refers to a stationary sprinkler system. Water supply pipelines are generally fixed-usually below the soil surface-and sprinkler nozzles are elevated above the surface. In some cases, hand-moved systems may be installed prior to the crop season and removed after harvest, effectively serving as solid set. Solid-set systems are commonly used in orchards and vineyards for frost protection and crop cooling. Solid-set systems are also widely used on turf and in landscaping. Big gun systems use a large sprinkler mounted on a wheeled cart or trailer, fed by a flexible rubber hose. The machine may be self-propelled while applying water, traveling in a lane guided by a cable. Other systems may require successive moves to travel through the field. Big guns require high operating pressures, with 100 psi not uncommon. These systems have been adapted to spread livestock waste in many locations. Side-roll wheel-move systems have large-diameter wheels mounted on a pipeline, enabling the line to be rolled as a unit to successive positions across the field. A gasoline engine generally powers the system movement. This system is roughly analogous to a handmoved system on wheels. Crop type is an important consideration for this system, since the pipeline is roughly 3 feet above the ground."}, {"section_title": "Improved Pressurized Systems and Practices", "text": "Improved center pivots have been developed that reduce water application losses and energy requirements. Older center pivots, with the sprinklers attached directly to the pipe, operate at relatively high pressure (60-80 psi), with wide water spray patterns. Newer center pivots usually locate the sprinklers on tubes below the pipe and operate at lower pressures (15-45 psi). Many existing center pivots have been retrofitted with system innovations to reduce losses and energy needs. Linear or lateral-move systems are similar to centerpivot systems, except that the lateral line and towers move in a continuous straight path across a rectangular field. Water may be supplied by a flexible hose or pressurized from a concrete-lined ditch or along the field edge. LEPA (Low-energy precision application), is an adaptation of center-pivot (or lateral-move) systems that uses droptubes extending down from the pipeline to apply water at low pressure below the plant canopy, usually only a few inches above the ground. Applying the water close to the ground cuts water loss from evaporation and wind and increases application uniformity. On fine-textured soils with slower infiltration rates, furrow dikes may be necessary to avoid runoff. Low-flow irrigation systems, including drip and trickle, use small-diameter tubes placed above or below the field surface. Frequent, slow applications of water are applied to soil through small holes or emitters. The emitters are supplied by a network of main, submain, and lateral lines. Water is dispensed directly to the root zone, precluding runoff or deep percolation and minimizing evaporation. Microsprinklers, a variation of low-flow systems, use the same type of supply system, with low-volume sprinkler heads located about 1 foot above the ground. (Microsprinklers are used in place of multiple drip emitters when wetting an area or perimeter is necessary.) Low-flow systems are generally reserved for perennial crops, such as orchard products and vineyards, or other high-value vegetable crops (USDA, 1997b)."}]
