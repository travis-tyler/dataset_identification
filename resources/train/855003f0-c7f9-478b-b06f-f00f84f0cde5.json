Arterial properties, plasma glucose, lipid profile, total and bioavailable testosterone levels were measured in fasting state.

Low testosterone (T) level is associated with insulin resistance and abdominal obesity (1) (2) (3) . On the other hand, pharmacological suppression of testosterone levels by GnRH analogues reportedly increases HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, an effect that is abolished by administration of T (4, 5).\nCastration apparently attenuates and testosterone repletion increases mRNA expression of angiotensinogen and renin in kidneys of spontaneously hypertensive rats (6). Supraphysiologic doses of testosterone used in the treatment of female-to male transsexuals increased plasma endothelin level compared with untreated females (7).\nDiverse functional properties have been ascribed to the action of androgens in the vasculature.\nFor example, patients with low T level reportedly exhibit improved vascular endothelial function as measured by endothelium-dependent dilatation (8). Malkin and colleagues recently showed that whereas T functions as an acute vasodilator in human subcutaneous arteries ex vivo, T replacement in men with androgen deficiency impairs the vasodilator effects to acetylcholine (9).\nUnrelated to the latter observation, androgens apparently possess direct vasodilator properties in variety of arterial beds, including the coronary and pulmonary circulation (10). These effects may be independent of a functional androgen receptor and gene transcription, as T appears to induce vasodilation presumably by blocking a membrane-associated calcium channel in vascular smooth muscle cells (11) and/or opening of a potassium channel (12). T confers symptomatic benefits in patients with coronary heart disease and heart failure (13, 14) apparently through its action as a vasodilator. T can also increase nitric oxide availability and improve flow-mediated dilation in hypogonadal men (15) .\nThat androgen deficiency may adversely impact vascular structure in human subjects can be indirectly inferred from observations linking male hypogonadism to increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (16) . In the experimental setting T may retard atherogenesis through both aromatization to estradiol and activation of non-classical androgen receptors (17) . Just as estradiol, testosterone was shown to exert anti-atherogenic effects in the cholesterol fed rabbit Page 3 of 24 (18) . Finally, pharmacological suppression of circulating T in men with prostate cancer can result in increased arterial stiffness (19, 20) , thus indirectly suggesting the induction of structural changes.\nBecause low androgen levels in older men are now recognized as a fairly common finding, we set out to assess the possibility that androgen replacement therapy favorably affects arterial function in this setting. Among the various non-invasively determined parameters of arterial function, PWV appears not only to detect the presence of vascular disease, but also to predict future cardiovascular events, independent of established cardiovascular risk factors, as has been recently shown in hypertensive patients (21) , type 2 diabetic patients (22) , elderly subjects (23) and apparently healthy individuals (24)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects and study design", "text": "Eighteen male with untreated acquired hypogonadism aged 62.5 \u00b1 8.33 years (means \u00b1 SD) and twelve age-, sex-, and weight-matched controls (59.8 \u00b1 8.67 years; p = NS) participated in this study. All hypogonadal patients suffered from hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which was either secondary to pituitary tumor (n = 9) or reflected adult-onset acquired idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The latter condition was defined by the combination of adult life appearance of clinical symptom/s associated with hypogonadism, the presence of low serum bioavailable testosterone (BT) unaccompanied by increased circulating LH and the absence of abnormal finding on pituitary imaging (MRI or CT scan).

The determinations were made between 8-10 AM at the supine position. During the examination subjects stayed with extended legs and did not talk or sleep. Room temperature was between 21C\u00b0 and 23 C\u00b0. All participants abstained from caffeinated beverages on the day on which the measurements were performed. Brachial blood pressure (BP) was obtained after a resting period of 15-minutes, using an automated blood pressure monitor (Omron 705-CP) with the radial artery kept at the heart level during the measurement. Five measurements were averaged, enabling a determination of systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), mean blood pressure and heart rate. All measurements were performed by a single investigator (M.Y). Intra-observer reliability was measured by\nPearson correlation coefficient and high reliability was found for each of 4 parameters (C1, C2, PWV and AIx, respectively) with correlation coefficients \u22650.92.\nNon-invasive assessment of arterial properties was initiated following the measurement of BP, with the following devices:\n1. The SphygmoCor system (AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia): Peripheral pressure waveforms were recorded from the radial artery at the wrist, using applanation tonometry with a high-fidelity micro-manometer (SPC-301; Millar Instruments, Houston, Texas). After 20 sequential waveforms had been acquired, a validated generalized transfer function was used to generate the corresponding central aortic pressure waveform (26, 27). Augmentation pressure, which reflects the increase in systolic pressure induced by the initial recoil from the aorta and large arteries in response to the initial outflow from the left ventricle, was then derived through pulse wave analysis. The augmentation index (AIx %) was defined as the augmentation pressure divided by pulse pressure (expressed in percentage). In addition, because AIx is influenced by heart rate, AIx was then normalized for a heart rate of 75 bpm (AIx@75) according to the method of Wilkinson et al (28).\n2. The Complior device (Artech-Medical, France) was used for automatic assessment of pulse wave velocity (PWV), a gold standard measure of arterial stiffness. This method of PWV determination has been previously described in detail and extensively validated (29). In brief, waveforms were recorded transcutaneously over the right common carotid artery and the right radial artery, and the transit time (T time) was determined from the time delay (t) between the appearances of the two feet of the corresponding waveforms. PWV is calculated from measurements of pulse transit time and the distance traveled by the pulse between two recording sites as PWV = distance (in meters) / transit time (in seconds), according to the foot-to-foot method (29-30). The distance between the recording sites was measured with a tape over the surface of the body, as specified by the manufacturer, and PWV was automatically calculated by the Complior unit."}, {"section_title": "CR-2000 instrument (Hypertension Diagnostics, Eagan, MN)", "text": "was also used to assess systemic arterial stiffness based on analysis of the diastolic pressure decay using a Windkessel model of the circulation (31). According to this model, the arterial tree is loaded in systole by the stroke volume and during the following diastole, the diastolic pressure contour is a function of resistance, compliance, and inertance of an isolated arterial system. The model defines two components of compliance, a proximal phase and a more distal component influencing predominantly the frequency and decay rate of the oscillatory pressure waves originating at reflecting sites in the smaller arteries. This algorithm, then, identifies separately, through computer analysis the total systemic large artery compliance (C1) and the small artery compliance or elasticity (C2). Pulse wave analysis was performed in duplicate, and average values were reported. The radial artery waveform was obtained with a sensor positioned over the artery and calibrated using an oscillometric method on the opposite arm. Thirty seconds of analogue waveforms were digitized at 200 samples / sec. A beat marking algorithm determined the beginning of systole, peak systole, onset of diastole, and end diastole for all beats in the 30-sec measurement period. Small artery elasticity or oscillatory components (C2 ml/mmHgx100) and large artery elasticity or capacitive components (C1 ml/mmHgx10) were then automatically calculated by this device."}, {"section_title": "Biochemistry", "text": "Blood sample were collected after overnight fast.

As shown, BMI, LDLc, HDLc, triglycerides and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of the hypogonadal and control men were similar. By design, the two groups differed in their circulating T and BT concentrations. In addition, hypogonadal subjects had significantly higher SBP. In the hypogonadal subjects, mean bioavailable testosterone (BT) was 2.01 \u00b1 1.04 nmol/L and mean SBP was 137 mmHg, compared to a mean BT of 3.85 \u00b1 1.04 nmol/L and a mean SBP of 123 mmHg in the control group (p = 0.0001 for BT; p = 0.009 for SBP).

This finding complements observations that GnRH analog-induced hypogonadism is associated with increased arterial stiffness as reflected by higher AIx (19) or PWV (20) . In our cohort of \"spontaneous\" acquired chronic hypogonadism, PWV was ~ 45% higher and AIx was ~ 33% higher in the hypogonadal group than in a matched control group, although the latter difference fell somewhat short of attaining statistical significance (P = 0.06).\nThere are several differences, however, between our study and these earlier reports. First, Smith et al (19) as well as Dockery et al (20) studied GnRH-induced hypogonadism, a rather acute form of hypoandrogenicity unaccompanied by other pituitary abnormalities. Second, blood pressure was considerably higher, and indeed, clearly within the hypertensive range in the cohorts of prostate cancer patients assessed in the former studies, but not in our patients [e.g., 152/90 in reference 18 vs.137/79mmHg in our patients]. Because blood pressure per se affects AIx (33) the results of the two studies are not necessarily comparable. Of potential importance is also the fact that our patients were, on the average, approximately 5 years younger than the subjects evaluated by Smith et al (19) and 8-10 years younger than in the report by Dockery and associates (20) .\nA recent report by Webb et al indicated that oral testosterone therapy administered to men with coronary artery disease and low testosterone levels can reduce AIx (34). Again, the subjects studied in that report were rather different from our hypogonadal cohort. First, the degree of T deficiency was relatively minor, if any, such that baseline T and BT levels were more than twofold higher than in our hypogonadal patients. Second, AIx was extremely high in Webb's study, presumably reflecting a very advanced form of arterial stiffening in patients with well established atherosclerosis as reflected by the presence of clinical coronary disease. Despite these differences in patient characteristics and the specifics of the experimental outcome, these studies, including our own, collectively lend support to the possibility that T has a favorable effect on large artery stiffness."}, {"section_title": "Several lines of evidence support the concept that circulating testosterone affects arterial", "text": "properties. There is an apparent inverse correlation between serum testosterone and blood pressure (35) . Further, in a cross-sectional study of 55 older men, Dockery et al reported that PWV was inversely related to circulating free testosterone index (36) . In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, an arterial stiffness index calculated from peak systolic and end diastolic diameters of the common carotid artery and simultaneous brachial artery blood pressure correlated negatively with serum testosterone, after adjustment for confounding factors such as age, pulse pressure, fasting plasma glucose, and body mass index (37) . The finding in that study that serum testosterone obtained 5 years prior to the assessment of arterial properties predicted the arterial stiffness index, suggested a cause and effect relation between low testosterone and the evolution of subsequent increased arterial wall rigidity.\nDespite this apparent overall agreement that low serum testosterone is linked to increased arterial stiffness, the effect of testosterone replacement therapy on arterial properties remains a surprisingly understudied area. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the overall vascular effects of androgen replacement therapy are complex. Many of the study protocols of testosterone replacement therapy relied on testosterone depot injections, which are inherently linked to supraphysiological serum testosterone levels during significant parts of the treatment cycle.\nLikewise, observations in experimental models that testosterone replacement may increase blood pressure by such mechanisms as increased oxidative stress, enhancement of tubular sodium and water reabsorption, activation of the renal renin-angiotensin system and endothelin and reduced nitric oxide availability (38) could potentially reflect, at least in part, pharmacological rather than physiological effects of testosterone.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of how testosterone replacement therapy, aimed at attaining physiological and relatively stable concentrations of serum testosterone through the use of transdermal testosterone preparation, acutely and chronically affects non-invasivelydetermined arterial properties in clearly hypogonadal men. A unique aspect of the present report is also the fact that arterial properties were examined by several independent techniques, albeit in a small number of subjects. We observed a rapid but partial decline in PWV, such that the lowered PWV after 48 hours and three months of treatment was still above that seen in control eugonadal men. At least the early favorable effect on PWV likely reflects functional adaptation of the large arteries to T. Of interest is the observation that C1, another measure of arterial stiffness, which was not impaired at the outset of the study, improved significantly by three months of therapy, thus indicating increased compliance of the conduit arteries with normalization of serum testosterone. This delayed effect, may reflect structural changes in the large arteries, in addition to the rapid functional effects detected by the early reduction in PWV. Notably, AIx was unaffected by treatment regardless of the assessment phase. We are presently unable to explain why these three measures of arterial stiffness, which presumably reflect predominantly larger artery status, show a differential pattern both in the baseline analysis and in their response to testosterone treatment. The possibility that in the hypogondal men in whom testosterone replacement therapy had been withdrawn prior to the initiation of this study, longer withdrawal period might have allowed the detection of better agreement among the various parameters cannot be excluded.\nHowever, a recent report indicated a poor correlation between PWV and C1 and recommended, for that reason, the use of a combination of techniques (39) rather than reliance on one method.\nIn conclusion, acquired hypogonadism in men is associated with increased arterial stiffness as reflected in increased PWV and, possibly, in increased AIx. Transdermal testosterone replacement exerted a rapid, though partial favorable effect on PWV. Large artery compliance as measured by C1 improved after 3 months, suggesting that chronic testosterone replacement therapy is required to modify some arterial properties. Because initial rapid effects are more likely to reflect functional changes, whereas more prolonged treatment can potentially drive structural effects, these results raise the possibility that testosterone can precipitate both functional and structural arterial responses. Whether or not longer term treatment will induce further changes in arterial stiffness, perhaps through direct changes in arterial structure or remodeling of body composition, remains to be determined in future studies."}, {"section_title": "Declaration of interest", "text": "We fully declare that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported.\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or non profit sector.
