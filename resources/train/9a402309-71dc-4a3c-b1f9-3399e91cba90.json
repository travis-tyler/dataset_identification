[{"section_title": "", "text": "defines an IBCLC as a \"health care professional who specializes in the clinical management of breastfeeding.\" While the International Board of Lactation Consultant Examiners (IBLCE) certifies all IBCLCs, some IBCLCs have additional professional licenses as registered nurses or medical doctors, while other IBCLCs do not. IBCLCs work in inpatient, ambulatory, and community settings, offering inpatient and outpatient support to nursing mothers. Recognizing the important role that IBCLCs can have on mothers' decisions to initiate and maintain breastfeeding, ensuring access to IBCLCs was stated as a key action step in the U.S. Surgeon General's Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2011) .\nDespite these national recommendations to provide access to IBCLCs, data about access to IBCLCs are largely limited to state-level assessments of the number of IBCLCs per 1,000 live births collected by the CDC. The CDC (2018) considers this to be an important indicator of access and tracks it biannually in its Breastfeeding Report Card. According to the CDC (2018), in 2016 there were 3.8 IBCLCs per 1,000 live births in the United States, an increase from 2.1 IBCLCs per 1,000 live births in 2011. While the number of IBCLCs in the United States is rising, access to IBCLCs' care is known to vary significantly across states. Five states now have at least 6 IBCLCs per 1,000 live births, while 22 states, including Pennsylvania, have fewer than 3.5 IBCLCs per 1,000 live births (CDC, 2018) . The U.S. Surgeon General's Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2011) provides a recommended standard of 8.6 IBCLCs per 1,000 live births, yet IBCLC supply in nearly all of the U.S. states remain below this threshold. These data provide a glimpse into IBCLC access at the state level.\nDespite these state-level data, a knowledge gap remains regarding the availability of IBCLCs to specific motherinfant dyads or specific communities. It is clear that there is an unmet need for lactation support in the United States, with only 57% of women reporting any lay or professional support for any breastfeeding problems (CDC, 2015) . Granular, community-level data about IBCLC access enable the quantification and parsing of access disparities in a way that supports actionable interventions.\nTo guide and contextualize an examination of geographic access to IBCLCs, we used the conceptual framework of access to health care proposed by Levesque, Harris, and Russell (2013) , in which geographic location of providers is one component of availability of care. Availability of care, in turn, is one of five dimensions of accessibility of care, along with approachability, acceptability, affordability, and appropriateness. These five dimensions of accessibility interact with five dimensions of abilities of those seeking care, namely ability to perceive, seek, reach, pay, and engage (Levesque et al., 2013) . Thus, an analysis focusing on geographic access to care (i.e., proximity to IBCLCs) provides data about one necessary component for availability of lactation services, but other system-level and individual-level factors may further facilitate or restrict IBCLC access.\nInformed by this background and framework, the aims of this study were 1. to determine the proportion of young children throughout Pennsylvania who have ready geographic access to IBCLCs and to IBCLCs who practice in specific clinical settings 2. to compare the proportion of young children with geographic access to IBCLCs in rural and urban counties in Pennsylvania 3. to compare the proportion of young children with geographic access to IBCLCs by county level of breastfeeding initiation rates (high, medium, or low) in Pennsylvania."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Design", "text": "This is a cross-sectional observational study using retrospective data.

We identified the distribution of these children across census block groups using 2010 U.S. census data, available from Esri (Esri, TomTom, & U.S. Census, 2015) . Census block groups are geographic subdivisions of the larger census tracts and generally comprise 600 to 3,000 individuals. We included all children 0 to 4 years old in Pennsylvania, as captured at the block group level in the most recent U.S. census. We included children across these ages as a convenience sample because this is the youngest age bracket reported in U.S. census data. While this sample includes young children no longer in infancy, inclusion of 1-to 4-year-olds would not be expected to bias the results because the geographic distribution of these children is not likely to be significantly different from the geographic distribution of children 0 to 1 years old. There were no exclusion criteria, and no children were excluded."}, {"section_title": "Measurement", "text": "Data were collected and derived from multiple data sources to obtain the following variables needed for analysis: county rural-urban status, county breastfeeding rates, and Pennsylvania IBCLC location (Table 2 ). Because we obtained data about IBCLC location from two data sources, we assessed agreement between these two data sources during this stage of data preparation. To identify members of the sample living in rural versus urban counties, we used the USDA rural-urban continuum codes (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2015) to identify counties that were designated as urban (metropolitan, or rural-urban continuum codes 1-3) versus rural (nonmetropolitan, or ruralurban continuum codes 4-9). To identify members of the sample living in counties with varying breastfeeding initiation rates, we used county-level breastfeeding initiation rates derived from Pennsylvania birth certificate data (Pennsylvania Department of Health, Bureau of Health Statistics and Research, 2012) to identify counties with high (76-87%), medium (68-75%), and low (52-67%) breastfeeding initiation rates.\nThe primary variable of interest was geographic access to IBCLCs. To identify and determine the location of IBCLCs within Pennsylvania, we obtained data about IBCLCs from two sources, the IBLCE (2016) and the ILCA (2015) website. The IBLCE maintains a list of all IBCLCs, and provided a deidentified list of Pennsylvania IBCLC zip codes We examined agreement between these two data sources regarding IBCLC location at the zip code level. Both data sources were in agreement about the number of IBCLCs present in 1906 out of 2174 Pennsylvania zip codes (87.7%), with IBLCE data reporting more IBCLCs than ILCA data in 258 zip codes (11.9%) and ILCA data reporting more IBCLCs than the IBLCE data in 10 zip codes (0.5%).\nRecognizing the strengths and weaknesses of these different data sources, we performed separate analyses using the two data sources, and we present these analyses separately. Using ArcMap 10.1 (Esri, Redlands, CA), we geocoded the location of each IBCLC identified through both IBLCE and ILCA data. Because IBLCE data were limited to IBCLC zip code, we assigned the IBCLCs identified in these data to their zip code centroid. Because ILCA data included more granular geographic information, we assigned the IBCLCs identified in these data to their street address."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "To describe the population living in all of Pennsylvania and in rural and urban counties within Pennsylvania, we used descriptive statistics. To answer Research Aim 1, we determined the percentage of children 0 to 4 years old who live within 15, 30, and 60 straight-line miles of any IBCLC. We first allocated the population of children 0 to 4 years old for each census block to the census block group centroid. In separate analyses, we then determined the distance from each census block centroid to the closest IBCLC first using IBLCE data and then using ILCA data. Using the practice settings available in ILCA data, we also determined the distance to the closest IBCLC in specific settings: hospital, office-based, private practice, and Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)-affiliated. Using multiple buffer rings, we identified the child population living within 15, 30, and 60 straight-line miles of the closest of each type of IBCLC. We used straight-line distance (i.e., the distance drawn directly from one point to another, regardless of roads and obstacles) based on prior work in which Boscoe, Henry, and Zdeb (2012) demonstrated that straight-line distance is highly correlated with on-road travel time and may be used as a proxy for driving time in geographic studies. For all spatial analyses, we used ArcMap 10.1 (Esri, Redlands, CA) .\nTo answer Research Aim 2, we compared the percentage of children 0 to 4 years old within 15, 30, and 60 straight-line miles of IBCLCs in urban versus rural counties. We separately applied multiple buffer rings as described previously for children in block groups in urban counties and in rural counties. We then used chi-square tests to test for significant differences in the percentage with geographic access to an IBCLC at the p < .05 level using StataSE 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).

Residents of rural counties were less likely to identify as black or Hispanic compared to residents of urban counties.\nAmong the ILCA website IBCLCs (n = 105), 59 reported consulting in a hospital setting, 17 in a physician officebased setting, 32 in private practice, and 9 in WIC-affiliated or other public health settings.

Of the four specific types of IBCLCs examined using ILCA data, those who are hospital-based appear to have the highest accessibility throughout Penn sylvania, although they remain clustered in the southeast and southwest (Figure 2a ). Based on ILCA data, examination of the population distribution relative to hospital-based IBCLC location showed that 75% of children live within 15 miles of a hospital-based IBCLC. Access to IBCLCs outside of hospital-based settings was lower, with 59% of children living within 15 miles of a private practice IBCLC (Figure 2b ) and 51% of children living within 15 miles of a physician's office-based IBCLC (Figure 2c ).

Access to each type of IBCLC within 15, 30, and 60 miles was significantly lower for children in rural versus urban counties (p < .001, all).

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Using geographic information systems methodology, we found that the majority of young children in Pennsylvania lived within 15 miles of an IBCLC. However, our results indicated lower geographic access to IBCLCs within outpatient practice settings (i.e., offices and private practices), lower geographic access to IBCLCs for children in rural counties, and lower geographic access to IBCLCs for children in counties with the lowest breastfeeding initiation rates. Below, we discuss the implications of these findings from each research aim, while also reviewing our results in the context of our conceptual model and discussing the relevance of the different results obtained from the ILCA versus IBLCE data sources.\nIn the analysis of Research Aim 1, we found that out patient lactation support was less accessible than hospital-based lactation support. While hospital-based lactation support may be crucial for initiation of breastfeeding, researchers have identified a range of breastfeeding challenges that can occur in the days, weeks, and months after hospital discharge (Demirci & Bogen, 2017) and have been associated with early breastfeeding cessation (Demirci & Bogen, 2017; Wagner, Chantry, Dewey, & Nommsen-Rivers, 2013) . Our results indicate that increasing the outpatient IBCLC workforce may be necessary to meet the needs of mother-infant dyads after hospital discharge.\nThrough Research Aim 2, we identified particular concern for access to IBCLCs for Pennsylvania children living in rural counties. In a prior geographic analysis in Ohio, Grubesic and Durbin (2017) found a similar decrease in most breastfeeding resources, including ILCA-identified IBCLCs, in the rural portion of that state. Related to this, Allen, Perrine, and Scanlon (2015) reported that hospitals in less urbanized counties perform more poorly on assessment of breastfeeding assistance, which could be partially related to decreased accessibility of hospital-based IBCLCs in these counties. Together, these results indicate a need to increase access to lactation services for children living in rural communities. However, \nIBCLCs in any practice setting a demand in these lower-density population areas may not be enough to support full-time IBCLCs. Novel strategies (e.g., tele-lactation services, where mothers can access remotely located IBCLCs via two-way video conferencing; UscherPines, Mehrotra, & Bogen, 2017) could be evaluated as a means to increase access to IBCLCs in these communities. Through Research Aim 3, we identified decreased access to IBCLCs for children in counties with lower breastfeeding initiation rates. Grubesic and Durbin (2016) similarly reported a positive association between IBCLCs per capita and county-level breastfeeding initiation rates in the state of Kentucky. Wouk, Chetwynd, Vitaglione, and Sullivan (2017) found that that a higher density of IBCLCs was associated with higher breastfeeding rates at 6 weeks in North Carolina. These correlations in cross-sectional analyses are not proof of causation-increased proximity and density of IBCLCs may be associated with higher breastfeeding rates due to higher community socioeconomic status or more breastfeeding-friendly medical communities. However, our results add to a growing body of work indicating that communities most in need of breastfeeding support are least likely to have ready access to IBCLCs.\nIt is important to note that while the results described here are informative in identifying gaps in geographic accessibility, geographic proximity to IBCLCs is only one component of access to lactation services. As Levesque and colleagues (2013) indicated in their conceptual framework, an individual's ability to reach care (i.e., transportation and mobility barriers) may further limit access. Availability of alternative providers (i.e., certified lactation counselors) and the quality of care from these providers are additional dimensions contributing to access to lactation support. Affordability and ability to pay also contribute to access (Levesque et al., 2013) and are particularly relevant because few insurers cover IBCLC visits (Chetwynd, Meyer, Stuebe, Costello, & Labbok, 2013) . While the Affordable Care Act (ACA; HealthCare.Gov, 2015) \nIBCLCs in any practice setting a required all new private plans to cover breastfeeding support and counseling with in-network IBCLCs, post-ACA analysis did not reflect a substantial increase in lactation education (Hawkins, Noble, & Baum, 2017) , suggesting financial accessibility remains an additional barrier, although Kapinos, Bullinger, and Gurley-Calvez (2017) did find increased breastfeeding initiation post-ACA. Ability to perceive a need for lactation consultation and ability to seek IBCLC care are additional important dimensions of access according to Levesque and colleagues (2013) . Because most postpartum women reported use of technology for breastfeeding information and tracking (Demirci, Cohen, Parker, Holmes, & Bogen, 2016) , incorporating guidance on when and where to seek care from IBCLCs in social media platforms may help address this barrier, although further research is needed. The difference in IBCLC data across different data sources is a strength of the methodology used in this study. Data from the IBLCE identified four times as many IBCLCs in Pennsylvania as identified through the ILCA website. We present separate results using each set of data, with IBLCE data offering a more generous estimate of IBCLC access and ILCA data more conservative. True IBCLC access likely falls between these two estimates. Importantly, differences in access persisted for rural versus urban children and for children in counties with high, medium, and low breastfeeding initiation rates regardless of data source. In the future, researchers in this area will need to be mindful of the potential for significantly different results from these two sources."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Several limitations to this study exist. First, this analysis is within a single U.S. state, and each state within the United States has unique characteristics and contexts. Second, there are limitations in our data sources. The ILCA directory relies on self-report and may be outdated for some IBCLCs. For this reason, we also conducted the analysis with IBLCE data. In both data sources, there is also the potential for the reported geographic location to reflect residential rather than practice site. While estimates differed based on the data source, important differences in access persisted across counties. For these and other data sources used in this analysis, we used the most up-to-date data available; however, the data years included are not precisely the same throughout. In addition, our analysis focused on straight-line distances rather than travel time.\nResearchers have suggested that straight-line distances versus on-road travel time often are highly correlated (Boscoe et al., 2012) . However, especially for families relying on public transportation, our analysis may have overestimated accessibility of IBCLCs. We based our analysis on children 0 to 4 years old rather a younger cohort, as this was the youngest age bracket in our data source at the block group level. Because our analysis focused on the relative geographic distribution of children (rather than absolute population), we would not expect results to differ within different age ranges, unless there were significant differences in the geographic distribution of 0-to 1-year-olds compared to 2-to 4-year-olds across the state. We examined only the association between access to IBCLCs and breastfeeding initiation; we recognize the potential value of further research focused on breastfeeding exclusivity and duration. Finally, while other providers offer crucial lactation support (e.g., certified lactation educators/counselors, lactation support providers, other pediatric health care providers), we did not incorporate these groups into our study."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We identified decreased geographic proximity to IBCLCs for children in rural counties compared to urban counties and for children in counties with lower breastfeeding initiation rates compared to counties with higher breastfeeding initiation rates. We also observed that the percentage of children with proximity to hospital-based IBCLCs exceeded the percentage with proximity to outpatient IBCLCs (i.e., office-based, private practice, and WIC-affiliated). While several other factors contribute to access, increased distance to IBCLCs for these vulnerable populations is concerning."}, {"section_title": "Declaration of Conflicting Interests", "text": "The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: One author is an IBCLC."}]
