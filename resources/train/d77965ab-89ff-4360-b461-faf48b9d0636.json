[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This document describes the process used to map sea level rise inundation effects on anchialine pool ecosystems in West Hawai'i. The Nature Conservancy's (TNC) Coastal Resilience program supports practitioners around the world who are working to address coastal hazards with adaptation and risk mitigation solutions. In partnership with scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Conservancy led the development of the \"Ecological Effects of Sea Level Change\" application (app), a web-based decision support tool to help planners understand the potential future risk to anchialine pool ecosystems. Understanding the magnitude and urgency of risk will help prioritize pool conservation/restoration actions, inform regional coastal habitat management, and influence future development decisions. Anchialine pools present an ideal focal ecosystem target for this risk assessment tool. Anchialine pools, also known locally as loko wai 'opae, are coastal water features that have no overland connection to the ocean, but are connected to the marine environment through the underground porous substrate. This subsurface connection enables fresh groundwater from upslope areas to mix with marine waters (Holthuis 1973). In Hawaii, the subterranean connection to the ocean is apparent as pool surface elevations rise and fall with the daily tidal cycle (Oki 1999, Marrack 2015). Because they exist at the interface between freshwater and seawater, anchialine pools represent an ideal system for understanding water quality and host a unique biology. The endemic shrimp Halocaridina rubra and Metabetaus lohena (opae'ula); endangered species such as the shrimp Procaris hawaiana and the damselfly Megalagrion xanthomelas; and other rare species rely on these habitats (Maciolek and Brock 1974, US Fish and Wildlife Service 2017, Sakihara 2012. Introduced fishes, changes in land-use that contribute to habitat loss, reductions or impairments of freshwater water quantity and quality, overgrowth by introduced vegetation, and rising sea levels threaten the integrity of pool ecosystems (Capps et al. 2009, Carey et al. 2010, Brock and Kam 1997, Marrack 2016. Visualizing future scenarios enables more effective management decision-making for anchialine pool ecosystem conservation. Additionally, the data demonstrating anchialine pool impacts can inform impacts to other coastal ecosystems and features."}, {"section_title": "Flood Mapping Approach", "text": "Maps were created to visualize potential impacts to anchialine pools due to coastal flooding that could potentially occur during 2030, 2040, 2050, and 2080 time periods. Flood predictions incorporated field surveys of over 500 anchialine pools, in-situ measurements of local groundwater levels (collected at 12 sites over a year), high resolution LiDAR-based topographic data, and probabilistic projections of future sea levels in the region (Marra and Getz 2018). The analysis of changes in flood frequency and magnitude at different time periods and its connection to changes in local groundwater levels enabled us to determine when current pools could be inundated by the ocean and where future pools could appear. In unconfined coastal aquifers such as in West Hawaii, the groundwater table is elevated above Mean Sea Level sloping up and away from the shoreline, and typically moves in response to changes in ocean level (Oki, 1999). As a result, groundwater may exacerbate inundation as sea levels rise (Bjerklie et al., 2012). Changes in ocean and groundwater levels will directly affect groundwater-fed anchialine pool habitats and the species within them (Marrack 2016). Based on widespread field observations of daily tidal fluctuations in groundwater levels within wells and anchialine pools, it is assumed that there is high connectivity between ocean and groundwater across the study site (Oki 1999, Marrack 2015). Because anchialine pools require water to be present most days of the year, we were interested in flood frequency data as well as extreme water levels. We assume that a new pool will emerge on the landscape when a natural area begins to flood most days of the year. In pools that go dry everyday, endemic shrimp (opae'ula) and other pool species can be observed coming out of the subterranean aquifer up to the groundwater surface to graze on the substrate during higher tides. Our approach differs from many sea level rise analyses that focus on extreme water levels and risk assessments for coastlines and coastal infrastructure. From the anchialine pool ecosystem perspective, more frequent flooding that might be considered \"nuisance flooding\" in an area with human infrastructure, is an opportunity for new pool habitats to form. However, extreme flooding might negatively impact pools due to dispersal of introduced fishes. We have worked to incorporate both aspects of sea level rise effects on pool habitats."}, {"section_title": "Overview of Flood Mapping Methods", "text": "Regional sea level rise projections from Sweet et al. (2017) were combined with flood frequency and flood extreme analyses derived from observed water levels at local tide gauges to determine the plausible range in changes in the Still Water Level (SWL) at different time periods. Scenarios of water levels incorporate local tides and storm surge, regional patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and regional patterns of vertical land motion, as well as global changes in absolute sea level. Details of the analyses to derive SWL elevations for this project are described in Marra and Genz (2018). Summary tables of SWL scenarios are below (Table 1). To make flood maps for a specific SWL projection, any coastal areas that were lower in elevation than the SWL of interest, were represented as inundated with water. Then, models of groundwater levels above sea level were used to determine flooding that would be associated with each SWL scenario in inland areas. To generate spatial data layers for the mapping application, flood maps combine the SWL \"bathtub\" mapping approach in areas adjacent to the ocean with additional inland flooding due to groundwater. At each time period included in the app, flood maps were created to represent flood frequency according to four ranges: frequent, semi-frequent, infrequent and rare flooding. Frequent flooding is defined as flooding that occurs daily to every other day. Semi-frequent flooding will occur on a weekly to monthly basis. Infrequent flooding might happen one to several times a year. For each of these first three categories, the maps show a range of return intervals such that areas with a high likelihood of being inundated at a specific flood frequency are indicated in one color and areas with a lower likelihood of inundation at that frequency are indicated in another color (Marra and Genz 2018, Table A-1). Rare flooding represents areas that are expected to flood once in multiple decades. These rare flooding elevations were derived from the extreme SWL analysis rather than the flood frequency analysis (Marra and Genz 2018)."}, {"section_title": "Goals of Mapping", "text": "\u2022 Use the most update ocean water level predictions for the region. \u2022 Improve precision by incorporating field measured elevation and groundwater levels into flooding maps because groundwater is higher than Mean Sea Level in the study area. \u2022 Map sea level rise on top of Mean Higher High Water (MHHW, 0.376m). \u2022 Incorporate accurate maps of current and future anchialine pools with and without invasive fish. \u2022 Analyze potential dispersal of introduced fishes due to connectivity at high water levels. \u2022 Provide a screening tool to identify areas of concern and facilitate data sharing with managers and decision-makers."}, {"section_title": "Caveats and Assumptions", "text": "\u2022 The data and web app are meant to be used as screening tools for planning, educational, and public awareness purposes only and should not be used for legal purposes, site level planning, or permitting. \u2022 The mapping does not incorporate future changes in coastal geomorphology such as erosion.

Water level sensors (In-Situ Rugged Troll 100) collected data at 5 or 15 minute intervals for over a year at each location starting in August of 2015. At each level logger position, semi-permanent benchmarks were established using CHC X90-OPUS (GPS) receivers during September, 2015 and July, 2016 by NOAA, TNC and Ed Carlson of the Geodetic Survey. These surveyed control points allowed us to calculate the mean groundwater level over sea level as well as examine the effect of tides on groundwater heights with high vertical resolution (5 cm). Data showed that as expected, mean groundwater levels are elevated above mean sea level and that these heights increase with distance from shore ( Figure 2). Furthermore, data support previous observations from Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park ( Figure 2). Data were therefore pooled with the Kaloko-Honokohau water levels and a new function was determined using established methods (Marrack 2015). Groundwater levels in an unconfined, homogenous aquifer, such as the aquifer in West Hawaii, are expected to be a function of the square root of distance from the shoreline (Glover 1959). Using our data for West Hawaii, the equation describing mean groundwater level as a function of distance from shore is: To account for the effect of tides on groundwater, a tidal efficiency component was also computed and multiplied to the MHHW (0.376 m). This part of the model accounts for the fact that tidal effects on groundwater decrease with increased distances from shore. The equation below is the tidal component of groundwater heights above Mean Sea Level (MSL).

A series of analyses were conducted to evaluate how coastal flood magnitude and frequency might change along a section of shoreline extending from Kawaihae to Kailua-Kona, on the Island of Hawai\u02bbi in response to such sea level change. Analyses of flood frequencies derived from a normal distribution and flood extremes derived from a Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution of observed water levels in tide gauges were combined with probabilistic projections of future regional sea levels to determine the plausible range in changes in the Still Water Level (SWL) at different time periods. Possible contributions to SWL attributable to climate variability, changes in sea level associated with changing patterns in atmospheric and oceanic circulation occurring on time scales of years to decades, were also accounted for. The results of these bounding analyses are expressed in a risk-based construct, where representative values are selected to represent the low, middle, and high end among calculated outcomes. Similar analyses were conducted for other parameters of interest (i.e., the Dynamic Still Water Level (DWL), the Total Water Level (TWL), and Extent of Shoreline Retreat). Consistent with results reported elsewhere (e.g., Woodworth and Blackman, 2004; Men\u00e9ndez and Woodworth, 2010; Tebaldi, 2012; Obeysekera and Park, 2013; IPCC 2013), changes in flood magnitude track mean sea level trends -high tides and storms will ride the rising seas. For the future regional sea levels used here, changes in flood magnitude over the next 30 years or so are relatively small, on the order of one to two-thirds of a meter (1-2 feet), regardless of the GMSL scenario. Where effects are most likely to be felt is changes in flood frequency. Owing to the nature of the factors affecting coastal flooding along this segment of shoreline, increases on the order of 10 or 20cms in water level elevation were found to correspond to considerable changes in the projected return interval -from once a week to once a year, or from once a year to once a century. Thus, while 'major' floods are unlikely to change significantly in terms of frequency and magnitude, the frequency of 'minor' floods (~0.3m or 1 foot above MHHW) is expected to increase dramatically under all GMSL scenarios. What were relatively rare events will quickly become relatively common. Similar observations have been reported elsewhere Marra, 2014, 2015)."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Elevated sea levels result from the complex interplay of a spectrum of oceanic, atmospheric, and terrestrial processes (Figure 1). The total water level (TWL) spectrum can be divided into three principal components: 1) fluctuations at the highest frequencies associated with local wave runup (e.g., setup (after Marra et al., 2012 plus swash); 2) fluctuations across a broad range of frequencies from local storm surge through to regional natural variability associated with patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation; and 3) fluctuations at the lowest frequencies associated with regional and global changes in absolute sea level and vertical land motion. Traditionally, the combination of components 2) and 3) are referred to as the Still Water Level (SWL). Here, the higher frequency components 2) are treated as 'Variability', and further subdivided into astronomical Tidal versus Non-Tidal Residual (NTR) components, where the NTR contains both weather-related components associated with tropical and extra-tropical cyclones and climate-related components associated with seasonal to inter-decadal variability. Lower frequency components 3) are treated as Trends and associated with the Mean Sea Level (MSL). This depiction is consistent with previous work and has been found to have broad application in the context of Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) and other statistical techniques related to assessing the likelihood of occurrence of extreme sea levels (e.g., Pugh 1987;Pugh 2004;Haigh et al., 2010;Haigh et al., 2013a;Haigh et al., 2013b;Merrifield et al., 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1.

The impact of wavedriven processes is twofold -breaking waves cause water levels to rise (wave setup) at the shoreline in some cases by 20-30% of the breaking wave height, and energetic wave motions including harbor seiche can lead to inundation and flooding. Wave impacts vary with local topography, particularly with the presence of coral reefs, which significantly reduce wave energy. Flooding and erosion impacts will also vary with the elevation of the groundwater table and rates of precipitation. Thus it is important to understand the contribution of TWL (not just the SWL) as this has the potential to significantly alter spatially and temporally varying patterns and trends of coastal flooding."}, {"section_title": "Study Area and Data Sources", "text": "An analysis of the potential impacts of sea level rise (SLR) on coastal flooding and shoreline retreat was conducted along a segment of shoreline on the Island of Hawai\u02bbi that extends from Kawaihae on the north to Kailua-Kona on the south (Figure 2). Results of the SWL and dynamic still water level (DSWL) analysis discussed below apply to this entire segment of shoreline. Results of the TWL and shoreline retreat analysis apply only to limited area of shoreline, the west-facing beaches that front the Kiholo and \u02bbAimakap\u0101 fishponds. Both are relatively steep beaches, with the gravel beach at Kiholo being smaller and narrower than the expansive stretch of sand beach at \u02bbAimakap\u0101 (Figure 3). Both beaches are subjected to North Pacific swells in the winter and South Pacific swells in the summer. However there is significant blockage and thus reduction in nearshore wave heights because of the main Hawaiian Islands northwest of the Big Island, (Vitousek, et al., 2010). Tides are semi-diurnal, with a mean range of 0.45m and diurnal range of 0.66m. Data to support the analyses was collected from a range of field and lab-based sources. Ground control (horizontal and vertical) was established at multiple locations along the Kohala-Kona coast using CHC X90-OPUS (GPS) receivers over 7 days during September of 2015, with spot elevations and beach transects measured using a TopCon Total Station theodelite. In addition to being used for the flooding analyses per se, this information was used to rectify the 2013 USACE NCMP Topobathymetric Airborne LIDAR data that formed the DEM used in this study. For the LIDAR topographic data Horizontal Positional Accuracy is compiled to meet 1m @ 95% confidence level and Vertical Positional Accuracy 19.6cm @ 95% confidence level (10cm RMSE).

Two basic types of analysis were conducted as part of this study: 1) Analyses of flood extremes derived from a GEV distribution; and 2) Analyses of flood frequencies derived from a normal distribution. Details about these methods are considered below.

A widespread approach to compute the extreme value statistical distributions is the GEV distribution. Three parameters characterize the cumulative distribution function given as: where [a]+ = max [a, 0], \u00b5 is the location parameter that specifies where the distribution is centered; \u03c8 is the scale parameter which represents the dispersion, or spread of the extremes; and \u03be is the shape parameter that determines the shape of the upper tail of the distribution, with \u03be>0, \u03be<0, and \u03be=0 defining Fr\u00e9chet, Weibull, and Gumbel members of the GEV family respectively (Figure 4). The method selected to fit the data to the distribution is important. Block maxima used by the GEV can be annual or monthly. Most common is the Annual Maxima Method (AMM), where the GEV distribution is fitted to the sea-level annual maxima. Monthly block maxima provide further resolution into intra-annual variability as well as climatic co-dependence (M\u00e9ndez et al. 2007). In the R-Largest Method (RLM), the GEV distribution is fitted to the r largest sea levels within the year, for a small number of r values in a year. Much of the attention with respect to future estimates of extreme sea levels has focused solely on accounting for sea level rise. A commonly used approach involves generating the stationary extremes distribution using direct forms of EVA, and then creating a future estimate of extreme levels by simply adding back in the historically observed trend and/or sea level rise scenarios (e.g., Zervas, 2005;Tebaldi et al., 2012;Zervas, 2013). We used this same approach on Kawaihae tide gauge ( Table 1). The hourly observed time series was downloaded from the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center (UHSLC) fast delivery database.

They center on the issue of the extent to which any given station record is truly representative; for example, of sufficient length and, in particular, a length to accurately capture low probability events attributable to tropical cyclones. Because Kawaihae station only has 29 years of observations, Regional Frequency Analysis (RFA) from similar stations can minimize bias due to record length (Hosking and Wallis, 1997). RFA is a common approach in hydrology, but it is increasingly used in tide gauge analyses (Hall et al. 2016, Bardet et al. 2011, Barnadara et al. 2011. In RFA, data from different stations are combined with the assumption that the frequency distribution at each station is similar. A heterogeneity \"H\" score determines the homogeneity of different data stations. Once the stations are selected, a local scaling factor (\"index event') is used to pool the data from different stations and then analyzed using EVA. Based on the \"H\" score, the stations in Table 1 were considered homogeneous and used in RFA. The index event for each station is the mean of the observed annual maximum values. Each time series was divided by its index event and combined into one time series. The time series was then analyzed using a stationary AMM of GEV. We used this approach to generate another estimate of extreme sea levels along the Kohala-Kona coast."}, {"section_title": "Non-Stationary EVA", "text": "Perhaps the biggest concern with the approaches considered above is their failure to account for changes in extreme event likelihood associated with patterns of sea level variability and storminess (as well as trends). As a result potential changes in the extremes distribution over discrete periods of time may in some cases be considerably under (or over) estimated. Similarly, changes in the extremes distribution over time due to changes in storm frequency (from changing storm tracks) for example, may also result in under (or over) estimation of the impacts of higher sea levels. The time varying approaches employed by Mendez et al. 2007, Men\u00e9ndez et al. 2009, and Men\u00e9ndez and Woodworth 2010 among others, that fit a GEV model to monthly tide station maxima so as to decipher long-term tidal cycles, intra-annual seasonal cycles and covariability with climate patterns as well as trends, can be used to address some of these concerns and generate products that provide a more accurate assessment of potential impacts due to extreme water levels in a changing climate. We applied these approaches to the Kawaihae tide station data to generate yet another estimate of sea level (i.e., SWL) extremes. We  used monthly maxima without the trend removed and decomposed the extreme signal into the seasonal cycle, perigean and nodal (tidal) cycles, and the long-term trend ( Figure 5). We also assessed the change in extremes due to climate variability, using the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) as a covariate in the extremes model."}, {"section_title": "SWL Scenarios", "text": "The three different analyses described above generated a range of results that were used to establish a set of \"current\" (2010) values for SWL elevations at different (high, medium, low) return intervals. In this document we used the Sweet et al. (2017) updated global mean sea level rise scenarios with the most recent research at the time on ice melt in Greenland and Antarctica and produced 1-degree gridded regionally-adjusted sea level change projections for the United States and its territories. Each gridded position has six SLR scenarios starting from Low (0.3m rise by 2100) and ending at Extreme (2.5m by 2100). SLR scenarios were also produced at locations of TGs along the U.S. coastline. All SLR scenarios account for oceanographic factors, changes in Earth's gravitational field and rotations, flexure of the crust and upper mantle, melting of land-based ice, vertical land movement, and other nonclimatic factors. We used values associated with the Intermediate-Low (0.5m), Intermediate (1.0m), and Intermediate-High (1.5m) scenarios for the Kawaihae tide gauge projections in our analysis. In some cases we added what amounted to a very small amount of sea level (0.05m) to the combined extreme plus sea level rise values to account for observations from the non-stationary GEV analyses which suggested there is a small amount of sea level change attributable to sea level variability (associated with the PDO) that could at any time occur in conjunction with sea level rise attributable to global warming. The projected SWL scenarios resulting from this analysis are considered further below.\n"}, {"section_title": "Dynamic Still Water Levels", "text": "Tide gauges are generally positioned at the ocean-land interface in protected waters and are covered by protective walls that dampen water level oscillations with periods \u2264 5s .

Averaging the segments removes the high frequency signal in the data.  proposed using the standard deviation of the segments (i.e., sigma) to capture this high frequency. They showed that sigma estimates incident (wind and swell waves) and infragravity wave variability and is correlated to significant wave height. Adding the sigma to SWL in the following equation produces a dynamical water level (DWL) that contains a wave component: where is the exceedance duration coefficient (i.e., 1.96 approximates the 95% of the Gaussian distribution). We used sigma for Kawaihae and fit this wave component with a stationary GEV (AMM) to generate values of DWL return intervals with an = 1.96. Our assumption was that the DWL observed in the tide gauge was comparable to wave setup (a component of wave runup -see below). We compared our values to those calculated for wave setup by Vitousek et al. (2010) using the dynamical Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) model, and found them to show reasonable agreement across a range of return intervals. As a result we used the range of values generated by the two analyses to select a set of values for 'projected setup' under various scenarios and added this to the projected SWL values. As was the case with SWL we also used a nonstationary GEV analyses to estimate the amount of sea level change attributable to sea level variability (associated with the PDO) and in some cases added this to the combination of SWL and setup values. The projected DWL scenarios resulting from this analysis are considered further below."}, {"section_title": "Wave Runup and TWL", "text": "Estimates of SWL (or DWL for that matter) do not fully capture the potential for coastal flooding. To do so requires an assessment of the TWL, the sum of SWL and wave-induced runup (e.g., Komar et al., 1999;Ruggiero et al., 2001;Mull and Ruggiero, 2014). Together with beach slope they determine the maximum inland extent of ocean incursion. Wave runup is itself the sum of setup and swash ( Figure 6). Setup is the increase in water levels nearshore due to waves and swash (and backwash) is the layer of water that moves up (and down) the beach.  Komar et al (1999). To quantify the maximum extent of TWL, Stockdon et al. (2006) introduced a 2% exceedance of extreme wave runup height (R2) that takes into account deep-water significant wave height (H0), deep-water wavelength (L0) and foreshore slope (\u03b2f). This formula includes both setup (<\u03b7>) and swash (S). Vitousek et al. (2010) indicated Stockdon's et al. (2006) R2 equation did not take into account fringing reefs and suggested a modified R2 equation that uses SWAN model outputs for nearshore significant wave height (Hn), wavelength (Ln), and setup. In a study conducted along the same segment of shoreline considered here, Vitousek et al. (2010) used probability exceedance levels of H0 as boundary conditions to compute the nearshore output model outputs from SWAN. To assess probability exceedances for H0, Vitousek et al. (2010) determined the largest wave heights affecting the Kohala coast occurred within the swell window 282\u00b0-305\u00b0. They selected data within this window and applied AMM to assess exceedance for deep-water wave using the top three significant wave heights per year. Because Hawai\u02bbi Island is sheltered by neighboring islands, wave exposure is reduced. Based on the SWAM model outputs, the effect of island blockage is accounted for as a 20% reduction in H0. To model nearshore wave conditions and nearshore processes that result in further reductions in wave height at the shore (e.g., shoaling, refraction, convergence, and divergence) were also accounted for in SWAN (Vitousek et al., 2008). Because of the relatively short length of the record in combination with the directional swell window used by Vitousek et al. (2010), as well as the inclusion of three maxima per year in their analysis (which increases the possibility of including non-extremes into the analysis), it is our belief that the return interval runup values they generated are under-estimates of what could actually occur. To address this concern, we conducted a corollary analysis using significant wave heights from deep-water buoys northwest of Kauai. We combined data from two buoys (NDBC buoy #51001 is 170 NM northwest of Kauai and #51101 is 190NM northwest of Kauai, Figure 7) using overlapping years to correct for any offsets. The resulting time series spans over 30 years . We use a stationary AMM of GEV to calculate probability exceedances at 1-yr, 2-yr, 10yr, 25-yr, 50-yr, and 100-yr (e.g., a 50-yr exceedance is the probability a wave will exceed a threshold once in 50 years, and can also be expressed as a 50 year return interval). H0 values were reduced by 20% due to island blockage and Hn was calculated by applying a shoaling factor to H0 (after Vitousek et al., 2010). We then used Vitousek's et al. (2010) modified R2 equation and nearshore outputs from the SWAN model to calculate runup. In the case of our analysis, it is our belief that the return interval runup values we generated are over-estimates of what could actually occur, because we used non-directional significant wave heights (i.e., did not filter the record so that it included only waves within the swell window) and only one maxima per year to assess exceedance probabilities. Consistent with the approach used throughout this effort, we used a combination of the results from the two analyses described above to create a set of projected runup values at different (high, medium, low) return intervals for Kiholo, blending the \"low-end\" Vitousek (et al.2010) values with our \"high-end\" values and selecting values that fall within the bounds of this range. We then add these runup exceedance estimates to the SWL scenario estimates to get TWLs. The projected TWL scenarios for Kiholo that are the result of this analysis are considered further below. There are other things to note with respect to the TWL analysis. Beach slope is an important factorsmall changes in beach slope result in large changes in wave runup. We ran the analysis for the range of beach slopes observed at the two sites. We did the same for a range of wave periods. So, the range of runup values we selected from -our range of plausible outcomes -was greater than would be the case with varying wave heights alone. We considered the possibility that wave heights (in addition to sea level) might be changing in a changing climate. Here, our review of results from Storlazzi, et al. (2015), who prepared a report on future wave and wind projections for the United States and United States-Affiliated Pacific Islands, suggested that little to no change is likely in the waves reaching the study area in the foreseeable future. We also conducted a simple empirical validation, comparing the observed height of the beach crest at \u02bbAimakap\u0101 with the projected TWL at a low exceedances (e.g. 1-5 year return intervals). The assumption was that the existing beach morphology was an accurate reflection of the conditions it is exposed to (as this author has found to regularly be the case). The results were in good agreement. Taking this a step further, at Kiholo, where the beach is composed of gravel, we needed to account for a reduction in runup due to percolation into the beach. There, we were able to measure runup (on a separate occasion) during a high wave event, run these conditions back through our analysis and compare what was predicted to what we observed. We also compared the observed crest height and TWL heights projected for low return intervals like we did for \u02bbAimakap\u0101. Through these empirical analyses we calibrated runup at Kiholo, deriving a correction factor of 0.75 that was applied to calculated runup at this location."}, {"section_title": "Shoreline Retreat", "text": "An assessment of how far the shoreline/beach might migrate landward in response to the combined effects of sea level rise and storms was conducted using a 'geometric' model described in Komar et al. (1999). A modification of a model proposed by Bruun (1954), this \"K99\"model was developed to estimate erosion of beaches backed by foredunes along the Oregon coast. This model is currently used by the state of Oregon to determine coastal hazard zones (Mull and Ruggiero, 2014). A similar approach is being applied in the Sea Level Report being prepared for the Hawaii State Interagency Climate Adaptation Committee. This model assumes that the slope of the beach remains constant, such that the shoreline moves up this slope as the beach erodes landward. The landward extent of shoreline retreat is dependent on the elevations of the projected TWL and the toe of the dune (dtoe): In our analysis, we use the distance measured from mid-beach (i.e., 1m above MSL) instead of dtoe. Other assumptions in the model are that: the sediment budget is balanced ( there is no net increase or decrease in the supply of sediment to the nearshore system); the duration that the beach is exposed to the conditions associated with the projected TWL is unlimited ( there is enough time for all the possible erosion that could occur to occur ); and the composition of the beach being eroded is constant (e.g., there is no point where erosion would stop because the runup encounters underlying bedrock)."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Flood Frequency", "text": "One particularly important consequence from rising sea levels is the increased frequency of coastal flooding due to storms, tides, and other climatic forcings. The gap between mean sea level and a flood threshold decreases, allowing for smaller storm surges or the highest tides to exceed the flood level.  and  describe this type of chronic minor flooding as nuisance (tidal-related) flooding. These relatively frequent flood events are not considered part of the extremes found in the upper tail of a probability density function (PDF) and as a result, potential changes in minor flooding needs to be analyzed differently. If nuisance flooding should occur simultaneously with either rainfall or wind-forced storm surges, the result could be severe and considered 'extreme' . As sea levels rise, there is corresponding increase in the probability of exceeding a threshold, or 'tipping point' (e.g., MHHW or the elevation of a feature of interest such as the top of a sea wall or the base of a building foundation; Sweet and Park 2014). At Kawaihae, the annual probability of exceedance of MHHW from 1996 to 2015 increased from 3% to almost 16% (Figure 8). Similar to  and , based on an analyses of flood frequencies derived from a normal distribution we calculated the number of days in a year the daily maximum SWL exceeded a nuisance threshold for a range of regionally adjusted sea level rise projections. The nuisance threshold varied in increments of 10 cm starting at MHHW and ending at MHHW + 2.6 m. We used regionally adjusted scenario-based sea level rise projections from Sweet et al. (2017) (see above) to project the annual number of days the SWL exceed a given flooding threshold (Figure 9). The low, medium, and high scenarios correspond to Intermediate-Low, Intermediate, and Intermediate-High SLR scenarios. In addition to the sea level projections, we used historical observations without any future sea level adjustments and identify this as our LOW projections (see Sweet and Park 2014 for more information).  "}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Results of the various analyses described above are described below and summarized in the Tables that follow. Table 2 shows the potential magnitude of the SWL (in m above MHHW) for a range of flood scenarios for the time periods 2030, 2040, 2050, 2080, and 2100. In terms of flood frequency (or return intervals) the LOW, MEDIUM, and HIGH scenarios correspond to roughly once every 1-2 years, once every 25-50 years, and once every 100plus years. Details about the derivation of these values are provided above. Extreme Value Return Intervals are 0.3m, 0.4m, and 0.5m (above MHHW) for low, medium, and high scenarios respectively. In our assessment of extreme SWL, RFA analysis and the analysis from Kawaihae we found result to be quite similar. For example, the 2-yr return level (also referred to as 2-yr storm: the probability a water level can reach this elevation once in 2 years) at Kawaihae of 0.3m above MHHW is similar to the 2-yr return level (0.31m) with RFA. RFA results are slightly higher as the return periods increase (2-yr storm to 100-yr storm). For example, the 100-yr storm for Kawaihae is 0.42m and RFA is 0.50m. Bringing in other tide gauges is probably a better indicator of potential exposure than relying solely on the results from one tide gauge. Hence, we selected the higher value. The non-stationary results (see Figure 5) tend to site somewhere between, having higher water levels at lower return periods (2-yr storm = 0.38m) and lower water levels at higher return periods (100-yr storm = 0.46m) compared to the stationary analyses. What is particularly noteworthy is that in all cases the maximum difference between a 2-yr storm and a 100-yr storm is quite small -around 20cm. Sea level trends applied here increase that range from 20cm by 2030 (from 2010 'current' conditions) to just over 2m by 2100. An important point to note is that the magnitude of sea level change over the next 30 years or so is relatively small and the spread in value is quite narrow, on the order of one to two-thirds of a meter (1-2 feet) -regardless of which GMSL scenario is selected (and this includes those of Sweet et al., 2017).

This 'DWL' estimate is rather novel and unique. It is provided here as a way to get a better sense of the potential for coastal flooding beyond that which is provided by the SWL alone. It includes some, but not all of the 'extra' flooding induced by waves. Unlike the TWL, owing to its linkage to beach slope, is highly localized, the DWL has broader regional application, for example, by providing a buffer on the potential exposure to flooding that extends beyond that provided by SWL. Table 4 shows the potential magnitude of the TWL (in m above MHHW) for a range of flood scenarios for the time periods 2030, 2040, 2050, 2080, and 2100 at Kiholo. Each of the scenarios reflect a combination of the projected SWL (in Table 2) and an increase above SWL associated with wave \"runup\". Differences in runup values at each site are attributable to differences in projected wave heights and periods associated with each scenario. We used three runup values for our TWL calculations. The <10-yr storm waves (2.06 m) is based on Vitousek et al. (2010) results. The 10-50-yr storm wave (2.40 m) is based on the high-end estimate of Vitousek et al. (2010) and the low-end estimate of our runup analysis, and the 50-100-yr storm wave (2.57 m) is based on our runup analysis. Differences in runup values between the two sites (for similar wave conditions) are the result of differences in beach slope and the material that composes the beach.

For example, across all time periods and using the LOW Scenario, the results suggest shoreline retreat will be at least 5-7m (~16 to feet inland) between now and 2100. For the HIGH Scenario, shoreline retreat will be at least 13-22m (~43 to 72 feet inland) between now and 2100.

For example, for 2030 a 20cm increase in the threshold (from 20 to 40cm above MHHW) corresponds to a roughly 5 fold difference in flood frequency. For 2080 at the 90cm threshold, the difference between the LOW and MEDIUM scenarios corresponds to a change from no flooding to flooding every day.

(2017). As in the previous version, they are intended to serve multiple applications. A full discussion of such is beyond the scope of this document. Attention is briefly given to how the results presented here compare to those reported in previous studies of the same general study area -though principally the beach fronting the \u02bbAimakap\u0101 fish pond -that also assess future flood and erosion potential. Hapke, et al., (2005) conducted a study of coastal change at Kaloko-Honok\u014dhau National Historic Park, an area that encompasses the beach fronting the \u02bbAimakap\u0101 fishpond. A major part of their work was the analysis of shoreline change from 1950 to 2002 using aerial photographs. Average annual recession rates (AARs) were found to be variable along the segment of shoreline fronting the \u02bbAimakap\u0101 fishpond and areas just north and south (the area considered in this study), ranging from -0.6 to -0.2m/year for areas north and south of the fishpond and < -0.1m/year for the area directly in front of the fish pond. The combined AAR for the entire study area was -0.3m. For the time periods used in our study and the AARs from Hapke et al. (2015), landward retreat of the shoreline in 2030 (from 2010) is projected as 6m for the area average, and as high as 12m and as low as 2m using values elsewhere. For 2040, the average is 9m and the range is 18 to 3m. For 2050, the average is 13.5m and the range is 27 to 4.5m. For 2080, the average is 22.5m and the range is 45 to 7.5m. For 2100, the average is 27m and the range is 54 to 9m. Although we did not update \u02bbAimakap\u0101 with the Sweet et al. (2017) scenarios, our previous version (using Kopp et al., 2015, and centering on the year 2005) did assess \u02bbAimakap\u0101, which had corresponding values of 12-20m by 2025, from 12-22m by 2035, from 13-22m by 2050, and from 14-26m by 2080. Without getting into a lengthy discussion about the limitations of AARS from aerial photographs, suffice it to say that that there is reasonable agreement between the results from the two different analyses. The AAR-based estimates tend to be lower than the geometric-model based estimates during the early years and vice-versa for the later years, where the AAR-based estimates tend to be higher than the geometric-model. Vitousek et al. (2010) is noted in multiple instances above. Their work was very similar in nature to that presented here. Some of the differences between their work and the work presented here have already been highlighted (e.g., differences in wave climate estimates). Here the focus is on how their result compare to those of this study as far as future flood magnitude and frequency."}, {"section_title": "The work of", "text": "For the beach fronting the \u02bbAimakap\u0101 fishpond, Vitousek et al. (2010) report projected runup ranging from 1.97m to 2.54m for 5-to 50-year return intervals respectively. Here the projected runup for the corresponding range return intervals is 2.30 to 2.59m. Vitousek et al. (2010) do provide estimates of sea level rise, using values of plus 0.25, 0.5, and 1m. Their range is less than that used here, which range from 0.20 to 2.03m. However, unlike this study they do not provide explicit time periods associated with these estimates. Vitousek et al. (2010) conducted an analysis of changes in flood frequency. Similar to what is reported here they noted that \"impacts to fixed structures (relative to a given threshold) do not increase linearly; they accelerate.\" They go on to suggest that beach fronting 'Aimakap\u0101 Fishpond at elevations > 2 m above MSL elevation) should be relatively resilient against overtopping impacts until sea-level rise scenarios greater than +0.5 m become reality. Using 2.25m above MSL as a threshold (assumed to correspond to the elevation of the beach crest at this location and consistent with our observation of such) they report an increase from 1 to 12 hours of overtopping per year for a 0.5m increases in sea level. Our results are not directly comparable because we expressed the changes in flood frequency in days per year (not hours). However, for the sake of discussion, using the Vitousek et al. (2010) 1-year runup estimate of 1.6m along with a corresponding value (0.48m MEDIUM by 2050) suggests overtopping of the beach crest would be an almost daily occurrence (at that elevation/by that time). Using our estimates, even by 2035 overtopping of the beach crest could occur as frequently as every other day. Vitousek et al. (2010) also conducted an analysis of shoreline change from 1950 to 2002 using aerial photographs. For the beach fronting the 'Aimakap\u0101 Fishpond an average long term shoreline change rate (EX) of -0.3 \u00b1 0.1ft/yr (i.e.,-0.1m/yr). This is consistent with results of Hapke, et al. (2005) reported above. Later, they suggest AAR along the beach fronting 'Aimakap\u0101 Fishpond is between 0.25-0.5ft/year, which corresponds to shoreline retreat on the order of 10-20 feet (3-6m) by 2050. This also falls within the bounds reported by Hapke et al. (2005).

In general, results are consistent with those reported elsewhere (e.g., Woodworth and Blackman, 2004;Men\u00e9ndez and Woodworth, 2010;Tebaldi, 2012;Obeysekera and Park, 2013;IPCC 2013), changes in flood magnitude track mean sea level trends -high tides and storms will ride the rising seas. For the future regional sea levels used here, changes in flood magnitude over the next 30 years or so are relatively small, on the order of one to two-thirds of a meter (1-2 feet) regardless of the GMSL scenario. Where effects are most likely to be felt is changes in flood frequency. Owing to the nature of the factors affecting coastal flooding along this segment of shoreline, increases on the order of 10 or 20cms in water level elevation were found to correspond to considerable changes in the projected return interval -from once a week to once a year, or from once a year to once a century. Thus, while 'major' floods are unlikely to change significantly in terms of frequency and magnitude, the frequency of 'minor' floods (~0.3m or 1 foot above MHHW) is expected to increase dramatically under all GMSL scenarios. What were relatively rare events will quickly become relatively common. Similar observations have been reported elsewhere . Results compare favorably with previous work carried out by others in this area (i.e., Hapke et al., 2005;Vitousek et al. (2010), though projected SWL and TWL magnitudes presented here tend to be somewhat higher and shoreline retreat distances further inland than that suggested by previous studies (for comparable time frames). What is particularly unique about this work is that it does provide specific time frames for the estimates for projected changes. Also it provides an analysis of flood frequency that is particularly amenable to assessing potential risks to built and natural assets. The results presented here are presented in a risk-based construct that provides a range of scientifically defensible scenarios. Which scenarios should be selected depends both on the application and the level of risk deemed appropriate for that application. It is strongly recommend they be used in consultation with qualified professionals. They should not be used for siting and design purposes.
