INTRODUCTION", "text": "The results of the previous studies showed that the majority of chemistry concepts in Central Kalimantan are understood by the students through the teacher's explanation. In fact, there are only few students acquire the knowledge by their own thinking or reasoning process. This situation has an impact on the poor ability of students in reasoning. The study of Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) in 2011 placed Indonesia in the 38 th rank of the 42 countries for mathematics skill and in 40 th rank of the 42 countries for science skill. These facts indicate that the students' skills in reasoning is still poor since the understanding of math and science is a reflection of the ability to reasoning. This condition can also be interpreted that the learning which has been done has not been able to optimally develop students' reasoning skill.\nLearning in the perspective of constructivist theory is a process in which the students are mentally active to construct new knowledge based on the cognitive structure already mastered. Reference [3] stated that constructivist learning approach is the process of developing new knowledge in the students' cognitive structure based on their own experiences. Constructivist learning approach puts an emphasis on students' active role in gaining understanding and interpretation of the information and events they experienced. This approach includes creating the awareness of students related to the current concepts, creating a broad mental space including multiple conceptual parts, and providing the adaptation of the new information to the previous knowledge through constant contextual communication and harmonization. This model is a promoting model for the students to take into account the importance of the concepts as mental elements, to develop not only positive attitudes towards science and learning, but also towards scientific process skills in order to increase the their achievements [5] . Based on the perspective of constructivist, the task of a teacher is to create a learning environment that is often referred to \"scenario of problem\" that reflects their authentic or real learning experience that can be applied in a real situation.\nOne method that is very relevant to the constructivist view of learning is a method of discovery learning developed by Jerome Bruner. In the process of learning, the ability of students to construct new knowledge can be optimally developed through discovery learning. According to Bruner [15] , in the learning process students should actively use the concepts or principles they have mastered and conduct investigations or experiments to discover the concepts and principles of a new one. Methods of the invention provide a positive impact on learning outcomes for the students to participate actively to gain experience and learn to find the concept of interacting with the environment [4] .\nThe process of constructing new knowledge in learning follows the framework of the invention (inductive and deductive reasoning) that meets the characteristics of the substances being studied. However, inductive reasoning is generally preferred in scientific work. Inductive reasoning, according to [11] , is the process of thinking in our sense of knowledge dealing with the events or things that are concrete and specific to infer more general knowledge. Reference [7] mentioned that the development of conceptual knowledge can be acquired through the relations among information. The process of relating occurs among the information stored in the memory or between the existing knowledge and new information.\nTaba [10] introduced a learning strategy that is based on inductive thinking. The inductive learning strategies is also developed on the basis of the concept of students' mental processes by giving attention to how the students handle information and get it done. Inductive learning strategy is a strategy designed to help students develop higher level thinking skills and creative through observation, comparing, finding patterns, and generalizing [8] . Reference [9] stated that the inductive learning model relies on information processing through the process of thinking inductively.\nThe model of inductive thinking is developed on the basis of some postulates as follows: (1) the ability to think can be taught; (2) thinking is an active transaction between the individual and the data; (3) the thinking process is a sequence of steps that is regular (lawful). In the process of learning and teaching activities, materials are a means for students to develop certain cognitive operations. In these activities, students learn to organize facts into a system of concepts such as: (a) relating the data obtained mutually to each other and make conclusions based on those relations; (b) drawing conclusions based on the facts that have been learned in order to state a hypothesis; and (c) predicting and explaining a particular phenomenon.\nInductive learning strategy is oriented to learning information processing. The steps of inductive strategy includes: (1) the establishment of the concept (recording, classifying, and naming) of the works to be appreciated; (2) analysis of concepts (interpreting, comparing, and generalizing); (3) application of the principles (analyzing a new problem, making hypotheses, answering the hypothesis, and checking the hypothesis) can be terminated through the creation of new works. Some studies showed that an inductive strategy, model, or approach provides better learning outcomes at various levels of education. The research result [12] showed that the average scores obtained by science students who learned using integrative-based inductive learning model were higher than the average scores obtained by science students who learned using conventional learning. Reference [13] , based on the research results, suggest that there are significant differences due to the effects of the application of inductive learning models using animation macro media flash on seventh grade students' learning outcomes of the seventh grade at SMP Negeri 1 Pagaran on the materials of the heat. Inductive approach referring to constructivism in learning is able to optimally develop the power of reason, the ability of students to think logically, critically, and creatively [14] .\nChemistry is a science that is developed from empirical facts through scientific processes. Scientific processes in the development of chemistry largely involve inductive thinking process; therefore, inductive strategy is the right choice in studying chemistry. In this perspective, chemistry should be used as a vehicle to train the students' ability to think.\nIn inductive learning activities, the students are required and trained to make reason or think to be able to find the knowledge they have mastered. Of course, this is not easy for students who have been accustomed to receive knowledge from the teacher's explanation. In this case, the students need help in the form of guidance, counseling, or referrals to think that they are able to assemble the facts, concepts or principles into new knowledge that must be mastered. Therefore, the real success is highly dependent on the model of inductive strategies given to the students. The model includes guidance, counseling, or direction of thinking that can be packaged in the form of students' worksheets. The worksheets contain tasks that must be done by the students.\nThis research has developed a learning guidance (in the form of worksheets) with inductive line of reasoning that \"enables\" the students to create reasoning in order to find their own knowledge of chemistry to be mastered. In this study, the substance of fundamental laws of Chemistry\" was chosen as a vehicle to develop inductive reasoning and thinking skills: (a) knowledge of the fundamental laws of chemistry in the form of concepts and principles developed from empirical facts; (b) the basic knowledge which is a prerequisite for all quantitative chemical knowledge.\nThis research is a research and development study having a common goal to develop worksheets based on inductive reasoning (inductive worksheets) based on the data presented in the fundamental laws of chemistry in high school which includes: (1) Law of Conservation of Mass; (2) Law of Definite Proportions; (3) Law of Multiple Proportions; (4) Law of Volume Proportions; and (5) Avogadro's Law.\nSpecific goals to be achieved are: (1) to test the feasibility of the product (inductive worksheets) on aspects of readability, the potential of enforceability and expediency; (2) to determine the ability of students in constructing knowledge about the fundamental laws of chemistry.\nThe practical utility of these results is that the worksheets developed inductively are expected to be used as a learning guidance that enables students to construct their own knowledge of chemistry to be mastered. The results of this study are also expected to provide theoretical benefits to enrich the theoretical and empirical studies on learning strategies oriented to the development of student abilities in constructing knowledge independently."}, {"section_title": "II. METHOD", "text": "This is a research and development. The subject of this research is the development of products in the form of inductive worksheets. The worksheets were designed by implementing inductive reasoning to gain new knowledge. The assessment of feasibility on the worksheets developed involved experts and teachers as potential users.\nThis research was conducted in two stages. The first stage of the research was to develop a model of the invention learning in the form of student worksheet for being used in the [15] .\nThe stage of defining began with an analysis of the curriculum, analysis of learners and learning problems, and analysis of learning materials. At the design stage, the draft of the worksheets was created. It was called draft-1. The worksheet drafting refers to the common used format, while the substance of the coverage refers to the results of the analysis of curriculum and learning materials. At the stage of developing, assessment on worksheets feasibility was carried out using expert judgment through expert validation and tryout. The initial step of assessing was the validation and revision of the earlier draft (draft-1) by the experts. The assessment of experts was carried out to test the feasibility of draft-1 in terms of (1) the legibility, (2) the applicability, and (3) the utility. The results of the assessment and corrections of experts were then used to revise the draft-1. The revised draft-1 was herein after referred to draft-2 and it was ready for pilottested on the try-out. The try-out was conducted on the teaching and learning process of chemistry at SMAN 4 Palangkaraya.\nThe data of the worksheets feasibility including readability, applicability, and utility were collected using questionnaires distributed to the experts and potential users (teachers) of chemistry in high schools. The ability of students to acquire the knowledge of chemistry through inductive reasoning was revealed from the try-out document of students' worksheets. The scores of the experts on the assessment of worksheet feasibility using five-scale parameter were tabulated and calculated to get the average scores. Determining the content validity coefficient was using Aiken's formula as in [1] . Aiken's statistics can be written as follows: V = \u03a3s / {n (c -1) (1) note: V = coefficient content validity s = r -Io Io = lowest judging scores C = the highest assessment score r = scores given by assessors n = number of experts\nTo determine the ability of the students in constructing the knowledge, the documents of the students worksheets were scored using the scoring guidelines already prepared. The scores were transformed into a value range of 0 to 100 and were then calculated on the average and subsequently were converted to a qualitative five-scale catagory i.e. from \"very poor\" to \"very good\"."}, {"section_title": "III.
