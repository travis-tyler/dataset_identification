[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Beginning December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory disease, known as novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia , occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. [1] [2] [3] In January 2019, SARS-CoV-2 was identified and confirmed as the cause of COVID-19. 4 Then, the full genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2) were published in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website. The full-genome sequence and phylogenetic analysis indicated that SARS-CoV-2 forms a clade that is distinct from the beta coronaviruses associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 3, 4 Phylogenetic analysis also revealed that the gene sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is about 88% identical to that of bat SARS-like coronavirus ZXC21 (bat-SL-CoVZXC21, accession no. MG772934.1) and ZC45 (MG772933.1), 5 which indicated SARS-CoV-2 has closer homology to bat SARS-like coronavirus and bats could be the primary source of SARS-CoV-2. 6, 7 The antigenicity of coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, seems to be largely dependent upon two viral proteins that comprise the nucleocapsid protein (N) and the spike protein (S). The N protein, which is a nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, has been demonstrated to be highly immunogenic and seems to be an important component of the humoral response to SARS-CoV. 8, 9 The S protein, which is a surface glycoprotein, is a large type-I transmembrane glycoprotein that is not only responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion, but also serves as a potent immunogen that induces neutralizing antibodies. 8, 10 Whole-sequence alignment showed about 79% sequence identity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. 5 Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins could serve as target antigens for immune intervention protocols against coronaviruses.\nT cell immunity, such as CD4 and/or CD8 T cell responses, plays a vital role in controlling the SARS-CoV infection and/or pathological damage after infection with MERS-CoV. 11 ,12 T cell responses have been shown to provide long-term protection. [13] [14] [15] Several studies reported that T cells had the strongest immunogenicity to structural proteins in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of convalescent SARS-CoV patients. 16, 17 Based on the high avidity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), CTLs are considered the major eradicators of viral infections through adaptive immune response. Several studies showed that the presented CTL epitopes of S and N proteins in the context of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles will aid in characterizing the virus control mechanisms and immunopathology of SARS-CoV infection and could provide a new strategy to develop an epitope-based vaccine for SARS. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] For example, in 2007 and 2008, Cheung et al. predicted the SARS N protein peptide T cell CTL epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins were predicted using the Proteasomal cleavage/TAP transport/MHC class I combined predictor, which combines predictors of proteasomal processing, TAP transport, and MHC binding to produce a total score indicating the intrinsic potential of each peptide as a T cell epitope. Based on HLA allele data from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) Analysis Resource (http:// tools.iedb.org/processing/), only HLA alleles occurring in at least 1% of the human population or with an allele frequency of 1% or more were selected. This prediction method is recommended by IEDB. The total score combines the proteasomal cleavage, TAP transport, and MHC binding predictions, which predicts a quantity proportional to the amount of peptide presented by MHC molecules on the cell surface. As the prediction method recommended, high score equal to the high efficiency of the epitope presented by MHC molecules. The total score was used as the cut off value for epitope selection in the present study."}, {"section_title": "Epitope cluster analysis", "text": "Based on sequence identity, the predicted epitopes were grouped into clusters using Epitope Cluster Analysis (http:// tools.iedb.org/cluster/). A cluster is defined as a group of sequences having a sequence similarity greater than the specified minimum sequence identity threshold. An identity set percentage means that any member of the cluster will be at least the set percentage identical to at least one member of the cluster. 29 In the current study, a cluster was defined as a group of sequences that have a sequence similarity >70% minimum sequence identity threshold, which is the default of the cluster analysis (http://tools.iedb.org/cluster/help/)\nUsing the selected epitopes (90 epitopes in N protein and 106 epitopes in S protein), the predicted epitopes were grouped into 16 and 34 clusters, respectively.

In the current study, according to the SARS-CoV-2 S and N protein sequences, we predicted putative HLA-restricted CTL epitopes using immunoinformatic methods. We found 14- Based on the antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins, they could be major targets for preventing and treating SARS-CoV -2 infection. In 2007 and 2008, Cheung et al. predicted the DNA vaccines encoding the N-protein peptides LLLDRLNQL 223-231 and LALLLLDRL 220-228 presented by HLA-A*02:01 could trigger the highest T-cell cytotoxicity toward N protein-expressing cells, which indicated that these two N-protein peptides could be valuable peptide candidates for SARS vaccine. 18, 23 In the current study, we also predicted that LLLDRLNQL 223-231 could be presented by HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*02:06, which covered 39.08% and 1.95% individuals worldwide, respectively. Moreover, the sequence of the epitope is identical to those of SARS coronavirus (KT444582.1 and FJ882944.1) and nucleocapsid protein Bat SARS-like coronavirus (MG772934.1 and KY417144.1), but not MERS (MG987420.1 and MG021451.1), which indicated that LLLDRLNQL 223-231 could also be a valuable vaccine candidate peptide for SARS and Bat SARS-like coronavirus. In 2020, Ahmed et al. revisited previously tested and functional HLArestricted SARS coronavirus epitopes and found many epitopes were also conserved in SARS-CoV-2, such as epitope LLLDRLNQL 223-231 presented by HLA-A*02:01 allele. 30 Thus, epitope LLLDRLNQL 223-231 could potentially offer protection against these two viruses. In addition, in 2020, Austin Nguyen et al. analyzed viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across HLA-A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides in silico, and found that different HLA alleles showed various capacities to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides. 31 Among the conserved sequences, PRWYFYYLGTGP 106-117 in N protein was highly conserved. In the current study, we also predicted that FYYLGTGPEAGLPY 110-123 was presented by HLA-A*29:02 and HLA-C*14:02 alleles. In 2006, Zhou et al. predicted the SARS S protein epitopes and identified KLPDDFMGCV 411-420 as a novel HLA-A*02:01-restricted S protein epitope. 11 Their results indicated that the epitope could be a novel SARS-associated coronavirus-specific CTL epitope and a potential target for characterizing virus control mechanisms and evaluating candidate SARS vaccines. Then, Liu et al. also predicted a SARS-CoV N proteinderived CTL epitope and identified QFKDNVILL 346-354 , which was restricted by HLA-A*24:02, by a series of in vitro studies. 19 In the current study, we did not predict these two epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins. After aligning SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, we found only one mutation in the S protein epitope KLPDDFMGCV 411-420 and two different mutations in QFKDNVILL 346-354 between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Then, we replaced these mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and reconducted the predictions; KLPDDFMGCV 411-420 and QFKDNVILL 346-354 could be predicted, which indicated that these mutations could change the affinity between epitopes and HLA molecules.\nEvasion of the host CTL response through the mutation of key epitopes is a major challenge to achieving natural or therapeutic vaccine-induced immune control of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we used two SARS-CoV-2 sequences (NC_045512.2 and MT007544.1) retrieved from NCBI to predict the epitopes and found that 14 epitopes shared identity with these two SARS-CoV-2 sequences, which include two major types of SARS-CoV-2 (Designated L and S). Thus, the 14-epitope combination could be feasible in vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, including SARS-CoV-2 types L and S.\nMoreover, 13 of the 14 epitopes we selected in the current study could also serve as candidate epitopes for the SARS coronavirus and Bat SARS-like coronavirus (MG772934.1, KT444582.1, KT444582.1, and FJ882944.1) due to identical sequences between the epitopes and coronaviruses; additionally, these 13 epitopes Our results indicated the possibility of using candidate CTL epitopes to produce vaccines to effectively control SARS-CoV-2 infections and development. In the current study, we obtained the 14-epitope combination based on the distribution of HLA-A, -B, and -C could cover 89.60% of individuals globally and overcome the limitation of HLA specificity. However, the epitopes we selected were only predicted with respect to binding ability between epitopes and specific MHC molecules based on the total scores as the cut off value for epitope selection. Thus, there were epitopes being ignored because the total scores were below the cut off value (0.5 for N protein, 1.07 for S protein). CoV protein-derived peptide-1 (RLNEVAKNL 1167-1175 ) could induce peptide-specific CTLs both in vivo and in vitro. 21 In the current study, we have predicted this epitope using epitope prediction analysis; however, its total score was \u2264-0.54. So, this epitope was not selected in the current study. Thus, the candidate epitopes which were predicted to reduce infection effects in the current study should also be demonstrated using peptidesensitized peripheral blood mononuclear cells or isolated CD8 + CTL responses in vivo or in vitro level and animal model in the future. Our results will aid in exploring the possible use of these epitopes for the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infections. "}]
