AD is associated with regional cerebral hypometabolism, extracellular A\u03b2 plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) containing hyperphosphorylated tau, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, loss of synaptic connections, neural death and atrophy and resultant clinical manifestations of AD. [4] [5] [6] [7] The progressive accumulation of A\u03b2 and NFT is believed to begin more than 15 (A\u03b2) to 10 (NFT) years prior to onset of clinical disease.\nDeposition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide in the brain is considered to represent the primary event in AD 8 and the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a trans-membrane receptor, is central to the pathogenesis though its exact function is unknown. A\u03b2 is generated by sequential proteolytic cleavage of APP by \u03b2-secretase or Bsite APP cleaving enzyme (BACE)-1 from within and by \u03b3-secretase from outside the membrane. When normally soluble A\u03b2 peptides attain a definite level, they become insoluble, misfold and aggregate into A\u03b2 plaques. These plaques are composed of insoluble peptides, generally 42 amino acids in length (A\u03b21-42) and the oligomeric forms of A\u03b21-42 are thought to have a greater neurotoxic potential than monomers or fibrils. 9, 10 Cleavage of APP by the \u03b1-secretase followed by \u03b3-secretase generates neuroprotective amyloid precursor protein (APP\u03b1). 11 Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) \u03b54 allele of ApoE gene encodes the transporter of cholesterol in the brain and is the major genetic susceptibility factor for late-onset AD. 12, 13 AD is associated with higher membrane-associated free cholesterol and overall greater brain cholesterol load. Genetic mutations of APP (chromosome 21) or trisomy 21 cause early onset autosomal dominant AD. [14] [15] [16] Mutations of presenilin-1, presenilin-2, clusterin (CLU), phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), complement component (3b/4b) receptor 1 (CR1) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) have also been found to be associated with the disease. [17] [18] [19] [20] While increased production of A\u03b2 may cause earlyonset AD, late onset AD may be caused by impaired A\u03b2 clearance due to interactions with ApoE\u03b54, reduced proteolysis, decreased transport across the blood-brain barrier, or inefficient cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) transport. 21 Tau binds and stabilizes microtubules and supports axonal transport. Tau interacts with Fyn in the postsynaptic compartment. Fyn phosphorylates the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit 2B (NR2B) and facilitates its interaction with postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95). 22 The NR2B/PSD95 interaction is essential in A\u03b2-induced neurotoxicity. 23 As increased neuronal membrane cholesterol is an important factor in AD and also causes overexpression of Fyn gene, this could be the link between cholesterol, A\u03b2 and tau. 24 Casoli, et al. have proposed that mitochondrial DNA mutations are also important factors in AD. 25 The two structural proteins NEDD9 (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 9) and CASS4 (Cas scaffolding protein family member 4) and the kinase PTK2B (protein tyrosine kinase type 2 beta) apart from their roles in neoplasia, have been found to have a role in inflammation, hypoxia, vascular changes, microtubule stability and calcium signaling, and are relevant in AD. 26 Altered post-translational modification in the form of autophosphorylation of serine (Ser) and threonine (Thr), blocks the phosphorylation of tyrosine (Tyr) on insulin substrate receptor proteins (IRS) 1 and 2, impairs insulin signaling and leads to diabetes and AD-like complications. O-glycosylation of these Ser and Thr sites prevents phosphorylation and these sites may be targets for future drugs. 27 Metal dyshomeostasis has also been proposed as a contributing factor to the disease. Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV) has been investigated as a potential cause of AD with a role of antiviral therapy in future. 28 Deficiency of nutritional factors like docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and vitamins have also been implicated in the causation of AD and are being investigated. 29 People with higher educational attainment or socioeconomic status have been found to have a greater reserve against AD as do people who exercise regularly.

This is especially so with the advances in DMT and hence these have been incorporated into the new diagnostic criteria for AD (albeit for research purposes only). These biomarkers can be genetic (ApoE genotype), biochemical (CSF or plasma) or imaging biomarkers. They have a role not only in early diagnosis and prognosis, but also in selection of subjects for shorter and smaller clinical trials with greater statistical power (selection of inclusion and exclusion criteria), in providing evidence of target engagement and disease-modifying effects of DMT (as surrogate end points) and in monitoring side-effects of DMT."}, {"section_title": "CSF biomarkers", "text": "Due to its direct contact with the brain extracellular space, CSF constituents closely reflect molecular events in the brain. Low CSF A\u03b21-42 is a sensitive marker of cerebral A\u03b2 deposition but it does not correlate well with duration or severity of disease. Low CSF A\u03b2 is not very specific for AD as it is also seen in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), vascular dementia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). CSF tau (totaltau or t-tau and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 or p-tau181) is increased in AD and its higher levels correlate with greater cognitive impairment. When A\u03b21-42 and t-tau are considered together (A\u03b21-42 to ttau ratio), the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing AD is more than 85%. 33 Huded, et al. in a study from southern India also found that p-tau/ttau and p-tau/A\u03b2 ratio are good indicators of severity of dementia and may help differentiate between mild AD and moderate to severe AD. 34 Different phosphorylated epitopes of tau may also be helpful in distinguishing AD and FTD (p-tau231) or AD and DLB (p-tau181). 35, 36 Levels of orexin (hypocretin), a neuropeptide that regulates arousal, wakefulness and appetite are altered in AD. Liguori, et al. have found that CSF orexin levels correlate with total tau protein levels, sleep impairment and cognitive decline in moderate to severe AD. 37 "}, {"section_title": "Imaging biomarkers", "text": "The diagnostic value of imaging in AD is in identifying characteristic topographical, structural and functional alterations in the brain and in differentiating it from other causes of cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)", "text": "AD is characterized by progressive atrophy of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in a typical sequence: entorhinal complex, followed by hippocampus, amygdala, parahippocampus and posterior cingulate gyrus. Patients with atypical language and visual presentations have left temporal and occipital atrophy, respectively. Volumetric MRI (T1-weighted imaging) has been validated against pathological post-mortem markers such as Braak stages and is the most mature imaging biomarker of disease progression. 38 Savva, et al. in their epidemiological-autopsy study of individuals with and without dementia found that though plaques, tangles and atrophy were all associated with dementia, atrophy was most strongly related to dementia. 39 Progression of whole cerebral and hippocampal atrophy closely matches clinical worsening in AD. 40 Visual evaluation of MTL atrophy vis-\u00e0-vis normal ageing has a sensitivity and specificity of around 80%-85%. Paradoxical hippocampal volume loss noted after antiamyloid immunotherapy is likely due to amyloid removal and fluid redistribution rather than atrophy. Strict standardization is required for manual volumetry and automated software like FreeSurfer, learning embeddings for atlas propagation (LEAP), and QUARC analysis software. Haris, et al. in a small study have shown that T1rho MRI (a technique that can probe the protein content of various tissues) may be useful in the early diagnosis of AD. 41 Vascular MRI T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversionrecovery (FLAIR) images are used to identify amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs, vasogenic edema and microhemorrhages) which are associated with A\u03b2-lowering drugs. 42 Regulatory authorities require usage of vascular MRI for safety reasons in clinical trials using DMT. The occurrence of ARIAs is dependent on the dose of anti-A\u03b2 drug and ApoE\u03b54 genotype. 43 "}, {"section_title": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) MRI", "text": "DTI is based on the directionality of diffusion in the brain parenchyma and is used to assess white matter orientation and integrity using two parameters: fractional anisotropy (a marker of axonal integrity and myelination) and mean diffusivity (marker of cellular integrity).

In this modality, statistical maps of cerebral activation are produced based on changes in regional microcirculation inferred from measuring changes in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) MR signal. The MRI signal changes because of changes in blood flow, volume and oxyhemoglobin/deoxyhemoglobin ratio induced by external stimuli, specific tasks or drugs. Decreased activity in the hippocampus/MTL and increased activity in the prefrontal cortex is seen during encoding of new information in patients with AD and prodromal AD. 45, 46 Increased activity may be sometimes seen in the MTL in the early stages of the disease and in individuals at genetic risk of AD, and this has been attributed to compensatory mechanisms during hippocampal failure. 47 Apart from the MTL, memory function is also subserved by the \"default mode network (DMN)\" (precuneus, posterior cingulate, lateral parietal, lateral temporal and medial prefrontal regions). 48 The DMN that normally exhibits beneficial deactivation in healthy subjects, shows increased activity in both preclinical and clinical AD patients. [47] [48] [49] [50] Task-free resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) It is more easily applicable and places less technical demands than activation-task fMRI, especially in severely demented patients. Impaired DMN has been shown even on rs-fMRI and with a direct correlation to disease severity. rs-fMRI has been found to be a stronger classifier than activation-task fMRI in distinguishing risk groups in non-demented adults carrying familial AD genes. 49 "}, {"section_title": "Arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI", "text": "This is an fMRI technique for measuring tissue perfusion using magnetically labelled protons in blood as an endogenous contrast agent. ASL MRI in comparison with perfusion PET was found to be as informative about regional hypoperfusion in prodromal AD and symptomatic AD, with greater resolution and no radiation exposure. 51, 52 Although this modality is promising, standardization issues need to be addressed. 18 "}, {"section_title": "Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)", "text": "PET involves detection of two oppositely directed annihilation photons generated by positronemitting radiopharmaceuticals. FDG is a glucose analogue and enters cells by the same transport mechanism as glucose and is phosphorylated to FDG-6-phosphate (FDG-6-P). FDG-6-P does not enter into further enzymatic pathways and accumulates in the intracellular compartment proportional to the glycolytic rate of the cell. While FDG-PET is considered mainly a measure of synaptic activity, BOLD fMRI is indicative of integrated neuronal synaptic activity. The pattern of resting FDG hypometabolism in AD involving the limbic and association areas has been called an \"endophenotype\" of AD. These hypometabolic areas are highly vulnerable to A\u03b2 deposition and the FDG pattern correlates with histopathology at autopsy. 53 The extent and severity of FDG hypometabolism is predictive of conversion of prodromal AD to AD, and directly correlates with cognitive decline. 54, 55 Amyloid PET Amyloid PET involves use of A\u03b2-selective radioligands that bind to fibrillar A\u03b2. 18 F-FDDNP was the first PET tracer to be used in AD. Although there was higher retention of the tracer in the hippocampus, amygdala and entorhinal cortex of AD patients, it had a relatively high nonspecific binding and it also bound tau. 56 The most commonly used tracer has been 11 C-PiB (Pittsburgh Compound-B). However newer tracers that do not require a cyclotron like 18 F-PiB and florbetaben, florbetapir and flutemetamol are being studied. In positive cases, A\u03b2 deposits in a distribution that follows that of elevated aerobic glycolysis in the resting brain. 57, 58 Changes in amyloid PET can be seen as early as changes in CSF A\u03b2 and so both may be used as screening tools, but as CSF A\u03b2 reaches a final level early, amyloid PET is better at detecting cerebral amyloid load. 53 The requirement of assessing disease progression is better served by structural MRI and FDG-PET vis-\u00e0-vis amyloid PET as amyloid deposition is an early event accumulating rapidly in the early stages and very slowly in the later stages. 53, 56 A direct correlation has been found between APOE\u03b54 and A\u03b2 deposition (as measured with 11 C-PiB) and on CSF A\u03b21-42, but not on tau or p-tau181 levels, suggesting that A\u03b2 initiates the disease. 56 A\u03b2 selective radioligands have also been used to provide http://ijnl.tums.ac.ir 6 July evidence of dose-dependent reduction of A\u03b2 PET signal on treatment with bapineuzumab and gantenerumab; this was however not associated with clinical improvement. 42, 59 Another development has been development of tracers directed at NFT: 18 F-T-807, 11 C-PBB-3. 60 62 However, these proteins need to be validated in more longitudinal studies and the issue of specificity addressed as many of these proteins may not be specific to AD. Nevertheless, the concept of a suitable panel of plasma protein and imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and monitoring progress of AD appears promising.\nThese biomarkers are summarized in a tabular form in table 1."}, {"section_title": "Targets for DMT", "text": "The various targets of novel DMT can be broadly classified as a) interventions related to A\u03b2 production, aggregation and clearance, b) immunotherapy against A\u03b2, and c) interventions related to tau hyperphosphorylation. 33 Interventions related to reduction of A\u03b21-42 production, reduction of aggregation and increased clearance BACE-1 is modified by bisecting Nacetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and AD patients have increased bisecting GlcNAc on BACE-1. Kizuka, et al. have shown that deficiency of GlcNActransferase (GnT)-III, the biosynthetic enzyme for GlcNAc, reduces cleavage of A\u03b2 by BACE-1 resulting in reduced A\u03b2 plaques and improved cognitive function in animal models. 63 Thus, GnT-III and notch-sparing 2 nd generation \u03b3-secretase inhibitors (e.g. begacestat, avagacestat, PF-3804014 and NIC5-15) are promising candidates for DMT. 64 A\u03b2 levels can also be reduced by blocking BACE-1 and trials are on anti-\u03b2 secretase antibodies. Thiazolidinedione antidiabetic drugs (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone) via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) activation can suppress BACE-1 expression. However, a lack of conclusive beneficial effects and the attendant cardiac risks have led to termination of rosiglitazone trials for AD. 65 The results with pioglitazone in a pilot clinical trial have also been conflicting. 66 Another strategy can be upregulation of \u03b1-secretase activity, leading to increased neuroprotective APP\u03b1. Though some drugs are undergoing trials, no results are yet available.\nAs the neurotoxic potential of A\u03b2 oligomers is greater than A\u03b2 monomers or fibrils, antiaggregants like ELND005 (scyllo-inositol), tramiprosate (homotaurine) and PBT2 are also under investigation. 67 Though ELND005 did not achieve the trial endpoints, it did produce changes in CSF A\u03b2. Similarly, tramiprosate (binds soluble A\u03b2) and PBT2 (impedes metal-induced oligomerization of A\u03b2) did not achieve trial endpoints.\nReceptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) mediates influx of A\u03b2 and also mediates neuroinflammation and apoptosis, and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) mediates efflux of A\u03b2 from the brain. So their inhibitors and activators, respectively are targets of ongoing research. 68, 69 An oral RAGEinhibitor (PF-04494700) has been tried but results were unsatisfactory. 70 Another approach can be specific activation of proteases that degrade A\u03b2 like neprilysin, insulin-degrading enzyme and plasmin."}, {"section_title": "Immunotherapy against A\u03b2", "text": "Two approaches are being pursued: active immunity (anti-A\u03b2 vaccine) using compounds containing the N-terminal fragment of A\u03b21-42 or N-terminus mimic peptides (ACC-001, CAD106, V950, AFFITOPE \u00ae AD02) and passive immunity using monoclonal anti-A\u03b2 antibody (bapineuzumab, solanezumab). 71, 72 Though the clinical efficacy of bapineuzumab has not been consistent, it did demonstrate good tolerability with lowering of CSF p-tau and A\u03b2 on PET.
