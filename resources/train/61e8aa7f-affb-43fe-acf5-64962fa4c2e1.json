Resolution No. 2014-084 Guiding Principles to Address Climate Change was adopted by the Lummi Indian Business Council (LIBCthe governing body of the Lummi Nation) on May 27, 2014 and directed the LIBC administration to undertake efforts to develop goals for addressing the potential effects of climate change, to develop policies and strategies guided by these goals that will enable climate mitigation and adaptation, and to develop and implement programmatic and/or regulatory actions to address the potential effects of climate change and contribute to the reduction of the causes of climate change. An important step toward fulfilling this mandate is this CCMAP, which provides a comprehensive analysis of climate change impacts on and potential mitigation and adaptation strategies for the natural, social, and built systems of the Reservation. Based on the CCMAP, the Lummi Nation finds that the potential impacts of climate change have a direct, serious, and substantial adverse effect on the political integrity, economic security, health, and welfare of the Lummi Nation, its treaty rights, its members, and all persons present on the Reservation. The goal of the CCMAP is to identify the potential impacts of climate change on the natural, social, and built systems of the Reservation and identify actions to minimize the causes of climate change and damages from climate change impacts that cannot be avoided. This goal will be attained through the achievement of the following objectives: 1. Review existing climate change impacts assessments and scientific literature relevant to the Puget Sound region to evaluate projected climate change impacts on the Reservation. 2. Assess the vulnerability of the natural systems (i.e., water resources, coastal resources, forest resources, and fish, wildlife, and traditional use plants), social systems (i.e., human health, emergency services, and cultural resources), and built systems (i.e., land use, transportation, and utilities) on the Reservation to climate change impacts. 3. Develop a range of mitigation and adaptation strategies that may be implemented to reduce identified vulnerabilities and make the Reservation and the Lummi Nation more resilient to climate change. Changes in climate affect not only air temperatures (i.e., global warming), but also sea surface temperatures, precipitation patterns, sea level, storm events, and other physical systems. The best available science indicates that climate change impacts on the Reservation over the coming decades-to-centuries are likely to include increasing surface temperature, changes in precipitation (i.e., wetter winters, drier summers), changes in the seasonality and magnitude of streamflow (i.e., higher winter flows, earlier spring snowmelt, lower summer flows), increasing extent, frequency, and/or intensity of extreme weather events (e.g., heat waves, drought, flooding, wildfire), and changes in the coastal ocean (i.e., increasing sea surface temperature, sea level rise, ocean acidification). The extent and severity of future climate change will be inextricably linked to the level of human response to climate change. To better understand how climate change impacts will affect the natural, social, and built systems of the Reservation, a framework was established for the purpose of the CCMAP in which each system was divided into several sectors and each sector further divided into planning areas. For instance, the natural system (i.e., natural environment) is divided into several sectors, including water resources, coastal resources, forest resources, and fish, wildlife, and traditional use plants; the social system is divided into human health, emergency services, and cultural resources; and the built system is divided into land use, transportation, and utilities. At the subsequent level, the water resources sector is divided into three planning areas (i.e., freshwater, groundwater, and wetlands), the coastal resources sector is divided into three planning areas (i.e., shorelines, tidelands, and seawater), the forest resources sector is divided into three planning areas (i.e., forest type, wildfire, insects and disease), and so on. Within this framework, the vulnerability (i.e., susceptibility to harm) to climate change of the Reservation's natural, social, and built systems was determined as a function of the sensitivity and adaptive capacity of that system, and was rated using a five-step scale (i.e., low, mediumlow, medium, medium-high, high). Findings indicate that the majority of planning areas on the Reservation have a high level of vulnerability to climate change impacts, while some planning areas demonstrated medium-high or medium levels of vulnerability. Given that anticipated impacts of climate change on the Reservation are significant and diverse, building a climate resilient community in the face of these impacts will require coordinated and comprehensive climate preparedness planning. Climate preparedness should include implementation of both climate mitigation and climate adaptation strategies. Climate mitigation means taking action to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, the quantity of which will determine the extent and severity of climate change over the coming decades-tocenturies. Although the Reservation accounts for only a relatively minor contribution to global carbon emissions, achieving emissions reduction goals globally will require universal support and participation. Accordingly, the recommendations of this CCMAP are to undertake action on climate mitigation as soon as practicable. To address climate change impacts that are already occurring and impacts that will unavoidably occur in the future regardless of mitigation efforts, it is also recommended that the Lummi Nation take action on climate adaptation as soon as practicable. Several climate mitigation and adaptation strategies are provided for the natural, social, and built systems on the Reservation. The key recommendations for implementing climate mitigation and adaption actions on the Reservation that will protect public health and the environment are: 1. Establish and maintain a Climate Preparedness Committee with, at a minimum, one representative from the LIBC, the Natural Resources Department, the Planning and Public Works Department, and the Cultural Resources Department and two representatives from the General Council to provide guidance and oversight in climate mitigation and adaptation planning. Committee membership may be expanded to 2. Provide community education and outreach to increase awareness of and preparation for climate change impacts and engender community support for climate mitigation and adaption. 3. Focus initial efforts in climate mitigation and adaptation on the following high priority items as determined from the core concepts for strategy development: a. Improve building-, behavior-, and transportation-related energy efficiency. b. Improve emergency preparedness planning and response capabilities. c. Implement flood risk reduction measures. d. Implement wildfire risk reduction measures. e. Reduce existing stressors to salmon populations. f. Improve water quality in shellfish harvest areas. g. Restore and protect instream flow in the Nooksack River basin. h. Protect the potable groundwater systems on and adjacent to the Reservation. 4. Further refine and prioritize climate mitigation and adaptation strategies for implementation based on guidance of the Climate Preparedness Planning Committee, community feedback, the recommendations of this report, and other vulnerability assessments as appropriate. 5. Identify and obtain funding to implement selected mitigation and adaptation strategies and determine which tribal entity will be responsible for implementation."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The purpose of this section is to describe the goals of the Lummi Nation Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Plan: 2016-2026 (CCMAP) and to summarize the CCMAP organization.

This is a principle that has long been recognized by the Lummi Nation and is evidenced by adoption of the original Lummi Nation Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan in 2004, the first state-level plan approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) nationwide. The impacts of climate change are likely to exacerbate some existing natural hazards on the Reservation (e.g., riverine and coastal flooding, coastal erosion, drought, and wildfire) and introduce new hazards (e.g., spread of diseases and pests, ocean acidification). Climate change mitigation, which addresses the causes of climate change, requires taking action to reduce greenhouse gases emissions and greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and is necessary to limit the damage of future climate change. For Reservation residents, this means reducing energy use from energy sources (e.g., gasoline, diesel, propane, electricity generated at coal-fired power plants) that result in emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Although climate change mitigation is necessary to limit the extent of future warming and other impacts, many climate change impacts are already occurring and some future impacts are unavoidable even with extensive mitigation efforts. Given these circumstances, it is imperative that the Lummi Nation take action to minimize the impacts of climate change on the Reservation by developing and implementing climate change adaptation strategies. If adaptation actions are not taken, climate change may lead to irreversible or unacceptable losses to the Lummi Nation. As such, the Lummi Nation has a responsibility to be proactive in preparing for climate change. In many cases, planning for the future will benefit the present and build upon existing programs designed to protect human health, environmental and cultural resources, and infrastructure. For example, the Lummi Nation Wetland and Habitat Mitigation Bank that is currently being developed by the Lummi Natural Resources Department has tangible benefits that are already being observed, such as restoring and enhancing wetland areas that provide critical habitat for culturally and economically important fish species (e.g., salmon) . Preservation of open space in the floodplain also protects future generations by preventing development and retaining flood storage capacity in an area that is projected to experience an increase in the frequency and intensity of flood events as a result of climate change. This type of \"win-win\" strategy simultaneously reduces the impacts of climate change on the Reservation and provides environmental and economic benefits to the Lummi Nation that serves both current and future generations. Additionally, American Indian and Alaska Native tribes and nations are expected to be disproportionally impacted by changes in climate (Dalton 2013). As stated by the LIBC: \"The Lummi Nation, like other place-based American Indian and Alaska Native peoples, lives on the frontlines of a changing world where the disruption to our natural resources caused by changes in the climate are having real and measurable effects on the livelihoods of our people (LIBC Resolution No. 2014-084).\" In recognition of the fact that climate change poses unique threats to tribal cultural resources, traditional practices, ways of life, and treaty-protected rights, the U.S. Global Change Research Program's Third National Climate Assessment (NCA 2014b) for the February 2016 first time included a chapter addressing Indigenous Peoples, land, and resources; drawing attention to this important issue."}, {"section_title": "Adoption of the CCMAP", "text": "The Lummi Indian Business Council passed Resolution No. 2016-040 on February 16, 2016 to formally adopt the Lummi Nation Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Plan: 2016-2026. In adopting the plan, the LIBC considered not only the merits of the plan, but also the recommendation of the Lummi Natural Resources Department Director and Deputy Director (meeting held on December 1, 2015), the Lummi Fisheries and Natural Resources Commission (meeting held December 3, 2015), and the Lummi Planning Commission (meeting held on December 8, 2015) that the plan be adopted by the LIBC."}, {"section_title": "Planning in a Regional Context", "text": "Planning for climate change is an increasingly evident priority for federal, state, local, and tribal governments and agencies. At the national level, the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), which was mandated by the Global Change Research Act (1990), is charged with \"building a knowledge base that informs human responses to climate and global change through coordinated and integrated federal programs of research, education, communication, and decision support (USGCRP 2014).\" Among the responsibilities of the USGCRP is to publish assessments that provide analyses of current and future climate change impacts across the nation; the Third National Climate Assessment (NCA) was published in May 2014. Along with the release of President Barak Obama's Climate Action Plan (June 2013) and Executive Order No. 13653 -Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change (November 2013), circulation of the NCA has bolstered awareness of climate change impacts nationwide. The key messages of these federal efforts are clear: (1) climate change is occurring now, (2) we need to cut carbon pollution, and (3) we need to prepare for the impacts of climate change. Indian Tribes are also providing leadership on climate change action. Among the 20 member tribes of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission (NWIFC) there are already several climate change programs underway. The Swinomish Indian Tribe has a well-developed climate change program, called the Swinomish Climate Change Initiative. Through the initiative, the tribe has published a climate change impact assessment and a climate change adaptation plan, and has started implementing action items recommended in the reports. The Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe has also completed a climate change impacts assessment, and several other tribes are in the process of developing their own assessments. Likewise, adaptation planning is in progress at the Quileute Reservation in La Push, Washington, which is subject to coastal and riverine flooding and tsunamis. In 2012, nearly 800 acres of Olympic National Park forestlands adjacent to the Quileute Reservation were transferred from the National Park Service to the Quileute Nation for the purpose of providing higher ground for community relocation. There is also a diverse range of climate change research being piloted by tribal governments. For instance, the Nooksack Indian Tribe is conducting research on glacier ablation rates in the Nooksack River watershed and the subsequent effect of glacier melt on stream temperature and flow. Meanwhile, the Tulalip Tribes recently commissioned a study to develop baseline carbon budgets in the Snohomish River basin. These are but a few of the many examples of the tribal commitment to climate change planning in the Pacific Northwest. Some local governments have also taken steps to plan for climate change. Notably, Whatcom County and the City of Bellingham have each adopted climate protection plans that recognize the need for action."}, {"section_title": "CCMAP Organization", "text": "This CCMAP is organized into the following sections: \uf0b7 Section 1 is this introductory section. \uf0b7 Section 2 describes the climate, land use, and socioeconomic conditions of the Reservation and the government of the Lummi Nation. \uf0b7 Section 3 summarizes the observed and projected impacts of climate change in the Pacific Northwest. \uf0b7 Section 4 presents a vulnerability assessment of the natural, social, and built systems of the Reservation to climate change impacts. \uf0b7 Section 5 presents climate mitigation and adaptation recommendations for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the Reservation and increasing the resilience of the Reservation to climate change impacts. \uf0b7 Section 6 presents a summary and conclusion. \uf0b7 Section 7 is the list of references cited in this CCMAP.

The Reservation is located along the western border of Whatcom County and at the southern extent of Georgia Strait and the northern extent of Puget Sound. Approximately 38 miles of highly productive marine shoreline surround the Reservation uplands on all but the north and northeast borders. The Reservation includes approximately 12,500 acres of uplands and 7,000 acres of tidelands. The Nooksack River drains a watershed of approximately 786 square miles, flows through the Reservation near the mouth of the river, and discharges to Bellingham Bay (and partially to Lummi Bay during high flows). The Reservation is comprised of a five-mile long peninsula (Lummi Peninsula), which separates Lummi Bay on the west and Bellingham Bay on the east; a northern upland area (Northwest Uplands) and the smaller Sandy Point peninsula that separates Georgia Strait on the west and Lummi Bay on the east; the floodplains and deltas of the Lummi River and the Nooksack River; Portage Island; and associated tidelands ( Figure 2.2). The remainder of this section briefly describes the climate, land use, and socioeconomic conditions of the Reservation, as well as the Lummi Nation's government structure."}, {"section_title": "Climate", "text": "The Pacific Northwest climate and ecology are largely shaped by the interactions that occur between seasonally varying precipitation patterns and the region's mountain ranges. Approximately 75 percent of the regions precipitation occurs in just half the year (October -April) when the Pacific Northwest is on the receiving end of the Pacific storm track. Based on climate data collected at the nearby Bellingham International Airport, the average annual precipitation on the Reservation is approximately 36 inches. On average, November, December, and January are the wettest months; June, July, and August are the driest months. Temperature on the Reservation is relatively mild year round. Temperature data collected at the Bellingham Airport from 1949 -2005 indicate that the warmest months are July and August. During these months the average maximum daily temperature is approximately 71 degrees Fahrenheit ( o F). December and January are the coldest months when the average minimum daily temperatures are about 32 o F. The growing season is \"the portion of the year when soil temperature (measured 20 inches below the surface) is above biological zero (5\u00b0Celsius [C] or 41\u00b0F)\". May through September is the approximate growing season for agricultural crops in the area (Gillies 1998). Wind data for Bellingham indicate that the prevailing wind direction on the Reservation is from the south and southeast with gusts upward of 80 miles per hour. Winds from the west are not as common and generally not as strong (ACOE 1997). Wind roses developed from meteorological data collected at two locations on the Reservation as part of a wind energy development feasibility assessment over the January 2011 through January 2012 period indicate that the wind direction is from the south-southeast or south about 50 percent of the time and from the north or northeast about 15 percent of the time (DNV KEMA 2012). The Reservation experiences a variety of infrequent weather patterns. A typical but infrequent weather pattern is generated from the northeast by cold air masses moving down the Fraser River valley. Strong winds from this pattern, blowing across the Fraser and Nooksack river basins, have caused damage to the residents and businesses of the Reservation (USDA 1992). Another typical but infrequent weather pattern involves continental air masses from the east that bring unusually dry weather that can last a few days or weeks (USDA 1992). During the summer, these air masses bring unusually warm temperatures (mid to upper 90s Fahrenheit). During the winter, these air masses bring unusually cold temperatures (0\u00b0F and colder)."}, {"section_title": "Land Use and Socioeconomic Conditions", "text": "Like most places, land use changes on the Reservation have been associated with changes in vegetation types, decreases in the areas covered by vegetation, changes in natural drainage patterns, and increases in impervious surfaces. With the arrival of Euro-Americans, forested land was logged, cleared, and drained for agriculture development, homes, municipal development, and commercial enterprises. Historic and current land uses in the Reservation watersheds and socioeconomic conditions on the Reservation are described below. Much of the information about historic land uses and socioeconomic conditions comes from the Lummi Nation Comprehensive Environmental Land Use Plan: Background Document (LIBC 1996)."}, {"section_title": "Historical Land Use", "text": "Before the arrival of Euro-Americans, the Lummi People were a fishing, hunting, and gathering society. Based on the accounts of Lummi Elders, early European explorers, and early photographs of the region, before 1850 old-growth forests of massive Douglas fir, western hemlock, Sitka spruce, and western red cedar dominated what was to become the Lummi Indian Reservation. Deciduous trees such as western big leaf maple, black cottonwood, red alder, and western paper birch were also likely present along the rivers, streams, and open areas. Understory vegetation probably included vine maple, Oregon grape, several different willows, ocean spray, salmon berry, thimbleberry, soapberry, and many others. Wetlands, streams, and rivers supported a unique array of plants adapted to wet environments. The marine shoreline was also a unique environment, where only plants adapted to a saltwater-influenced environment thrived. The forces that shaped vegetation patterns in the Northwest before the arrival of Euro-Americans were forest succession, fires, windstorms, ice storms, floods, and traditional use of natural vegetation by the indigenous peoples. Native American uses of vegetation included the gathering of medicinal plants, the use of willows and other shrubs for fishing, and the extensive use of western red cedar trees for many things, including clothing, baskets, buildings, and canoes. Many plants were also sources of food to complement the traditional diet of fish, shellfish, elk, and deer. Native Americans cultivated some of these plants, such as ferns, camas, and wapato, in prairies along the Nooksack River. Similar to most areas in the lower Nooksack River watershed downstream from Everson, conversion of forestland to agricultural land occurred on the Lummi Indian Reservation following the arrival of Euro-Americans. In 1896, approximately 1,222 acres were reportedly under cultivation on the Reservation. Along with clearing the forested land for agriculture, Euro-Americans constructed ditches, drained wetland areas, cleared logjams, diverted the Nooksack River to drain into Bellingham Bay, built a levee that cut off the Lummi River delta from the Nooksack River, and built a seawall along Lummi Bay. These changes in the natural hydrology of the Lummi Reservation changed the distribution and patterns of watercourses and of wetlandand riparian-associated plant communities. Much of the cedar on the Reservation was cut into shingle bolts and shipped to local shingle mills. The old-growth trees on Portage Island were cut down to fuel steamboats traveling the Nooksack River. One or more large fires swept through the Reservation area between 1850 and 1900. These fires destroyed nearly all of the remaining old-growth forests. Since reforestation was not practiced during the early logging period and did not begin until approximately 1980, pioneer tree species, such as alder, willows, and cottonwood, soon replaced the conifer forests and dominated the landscape (Leckman 1990). Historically, the Nooksack River flowed (alternately or simultaneously) to both Lummi and Bellingham bays (effectively making the Lummi Peninsula an \"island\"). Before 1860, the Nooksack River discharged primarily into Lummi Bay by way of the present Lummi River channel, with smaller distributaries flowing into Bellingham Bay (WSDC 1960;Deardorff 1992). In 1860, the mainstem of the river was diverted into what was then a small stream flowing into Bellingham Bay (WSDC 1960). Since that time, considerable effort has been expended to keep the Nooksack River discharging into Bellingham Bay because of the increased commercial value of the river that resulted from its proximity to sawmills along Bellingham Bay (Deardorff 1992). Until the early 1900s, the Nooksack River was also the primary transportation corridor to as far upstream as present day Lynden. The water body remaining in the old channel of the Nooksack River has been called the Lummi River or the Red River (WSDC 1960). In the 1920s, a reclamation project was initiated both to construct a dike/seawall to keep back the saltwater along the shore of Lummi Bay and to construct a levee along the west side of the Nooksack River (Deardorff 1992). This project, which was started in 1926 and completed in 1934, initially resulted in the nearly complete separation of the Lummi River from the Nooksack River. However, when saltwater intrusion onto the newly reclaimed farmlands and damage to the dam at the head of the Lummi River occurred during flooding, the dam was replaced with a dam and spillway structure (Deardorff 1992). This spillway structure was also damaged over the years during high-flow conditions and was replaced in 1951 by a five-foot-diameter culvert that allowed flow from the Nooksack River into the Lummi River (FEMA 2004). Currently a partially collapsed four-foot diameter culvert allows flow to the Lummi River only during relatively high-flow conditions (approximately 9,600 cfs) (Deardorff 1992). Levees were also constructed along the Lummi River to prevent saltwater from Lummi Bay from flowing onto adjacent farmlands during higher tides. The dike and levee construction activities were accompanied by agricultural ditching to drain fields and wetland areas. Based on 1887-88 topographic surveys, Bortleson et al. (1980) estimated that wetlands located landward of the general saltwater shoreline in the lower Lummi River watershed have decreased from approximately 2.0 square miles to 0.1 square miles (approximately 95 percent) over the 1888-1973 period. Between 1920 and 1960 several new public roads providing access to Ferndale and Bellingham as well as a toll ferry to Lummi Island were constructed and led to an increase in development on the Reservation. Since 1960 there has been a significant increase in the total population on the Reservation and the number of tribal members living on the Reservation. The increase in the number of enrolled Lummi tribal members living on the Reservation has been attributed to a number of factors including improved economic conditions within the community, the beginning of tribal self-governance, the increased rate of house construction, the development of a water distribution and a wastewater collection and treatment system, and a renewed sense of Lummi cultural identity."}, {"section_title": "Current Land Use", "text": "Over the last century, the increase in population, the construction of extensive road networks, development of wastewater collection and treatment systems, the construction of the Sandy Point Marina, and several tribal housing projects have fostered a trend towards higher density neighborhoods throughout the Reservation. Several distinct residential neighborhoods now exist, mainly along the shores of the Reservation including Sandy Point, Neptune Beach, Sandy Point Heights, and Gooseberry Point. Higher density residential neighborhoods can also be accessed from the numerous spur roads along Haxton Way and Lummi Shore Road, which are the primary roads along the perimeter of the Lummi Peninsula. A Lummi Nation Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis identified 1,975 addressed structures on the Reservation in 2009. Although increased residential and commercial development has occurred on the Reservation in the last few decades, the majority of the Reservation remains rural. An approximation of the current land cover and land use in the Reservation watersheds is shown in Figure 2.3. This map was derived from the 2006 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) database, Classification of Coastal Washington, which is part of the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) of the NOAA Coastal Services Center (NOAA 2006). The map gives an overview of the extent of forest and agricultural lands, residential areas, and wetlands in these watersheds. The estimated distribution of land cover/land use types within the Reservation boundaries is summarized in Table 2.1. The majority of the forested areas are on the Lummi Peninsula, Portage Island, and the Northwest Uplands. Although there are some conifer groves and Douglas fir plantations, the 2007 inventory of Reservation forests showed that present day forests are largely comprised of deciduous trees, with some mixed deciduous/conifer stands (International Forestry Consultants, Inc. 2007). Wetlands are underrepresented on the C-CAP map, as the remote sensing analysis did not recognize big swathes of forested and scrub-shrub wetlands, but counted them towards forests and scrub-shrub. Based on the 1999 Reservation-wide wetland inventory (LWRD 2000), the percentage of the Reservation land base that is wetland is closer to 40 percent than the 3.46 percent listed in Table 2  The floodplains of the Lummi and Nooksack Rivers are sparsely developed. The most important commercial enterprise in the floodplains is the Silver Reef Hotel, Casino & Spa and the adjacent gas station and mini-mart. This commercial center is located at the intersection of Haxton Way and Slater Road. The floodplains are dominated by agricultural lands and wetlands, both freshwater and estuarine. The tribal governmental offices are mostly located along Kwina Road; the Northwest Indian College (NWIC) is also located along Kwina Road. Based on estimates of land cover in Whatcom County, land cover/use in the Nooksack River watershed is generally dominated by forested areas upstream from the town of Deming and agricultural lands downstream from Deming (Whatcom County 2005). The agricultural lands in the lowlands were largely forested before the arrival of Euro-Americans and had been largely denuded of trees by 1925 (Pierson 1953, as cited in Smelser 1970. Population centers such as Ferndale, Lynden, Everson, and Deming are located adjacent to the Nooksack River."}, {"section_title": "Future Land Use", "text": "Future development on the Reservation is guided by a number of tribal laws (Lummi Nation Code of Laws [LCL]) and associated regulations including:  Figure 2.4 shows the current official zoning map of the Lummi Reservation.

The zoning update incorporated comments from tribal departments and commissions and from public comments received during four community meetings. The Lummi Planning and Public Works Department is developing a Comprehensive Plan for the Lummi Reservation. The plan will show, in general, how land on the Reservation will be used over the next 20 years. The Comprehensive Plan will identify areas that will be developed for residential, commercial, mixed uses, industrial, and agricultural purposes, as well as show areas that require protection (e.g., Special Flood Hazard Areas, wetlands, and aquifer recharge zones). To date, a technical background document (LIBC 1996) has been developed, public opinion surveys conducted, drafts of the Comprehensive Plan and maps developed, and focused planning workshops and meetings with commissions and community groups have occurred.

Corrected by the 2010 undercount rate (4.9 percent), approximately 2,772 American Indians or Alaska Natives are currently living on the Reservation. Population projections from a 2003 study by Northwest Economic Associates suggest that the number of American Indians living on the Reservation would increase from 2,346 persons in 2000 to 3,767 persons in 2020 and to 15,451 persons in 2100. Including the non-Indian population, which was predicted to grow at a slower rate, the Reservation population is estimated to reach 5,800-6,800 persons by 2020. In 2011, the Lummi Enrollment Office reported that there were approximately 4,650 enrolled Lummi tribal members living on-and off-Reservation (Kamkoff 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Socioeconomic Conditions", "text": "Fishing, logging, farming, and other natural resource related work have historically provided most of the jobs for Lummi tribal members. Until the 1974 Boldt Decision, Lummi tribal members were systematically precluded from the profitable salmon fishery in Puget Sound. Once the treaty fishing right was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, commercial fishing and fish processing began to expand on the Reservation resulting in increasing numbers of fishermen, fish processing, and increased overall tribal revenue from the salmon fisheries. The Lummi Nation is the largest fishing tribe in the Puget Sound in terms of pounds of fish landed and number of species fished (NWIFC 2012). However, the recent declines in salmon stocks have dramatically altered the tribal reliance on salmon fishing as an economic mainstay. In 1985, the average Lummi fisherman made $22,796 ($49,000 in 2011 dollars). In 1993, the average income from fishing was only $5,555 ($8,500 in 2011 dollars). During this period, about 30 percent of the tribal work force relied on fishing for their sole source of income (LIBC 1996). In the 10 year period between 1995 and 2005, there was an average of 592 fishing registrations and 126 crabbing registrations each year. During the 2012-2013 harvest management year (July 1 -June 30) there were 404 vessels registered with the Lummi Nation. Over the last 15 years, the crab fishery has provided the largest percentage of the yearly fishery revenue followed by sockeye salmon and manila clams. Since 1993, further reductions in salmon stocks have resulted in closure of some fisheries and a further reduction in tribal fishery incomes (LIBC 1996). During 1999During , 2007During , 2009, and 2013 the sockeye salmon fishery was closed entirely due to low fish runs. The loss or reduction of a fishery increases the importance of the other fisheries to the Lummi economy. Although there are annual variations, 2001 is representative of the most recent 10 years. In 1985, the Lummi Fishing Fleet landed about 15.3 million pounds of finfish and shellfish. In 2001, the combined harvest was about 3.9 million pounds of finfish and shellfish. In addition to catching fish and harvesting shellfish, the Lummi Nation owns and operates three salmon hatchery facilities. These facilities produce millions of young salmon each year and help offset the decline of fish stocks due to loss of natural habitat and historic over-fishing. The tribe also owns an on-Reservation shellfish hatchery, producing approximately 23 million Pacific oyster and manila clam seed for enhancing tribal tidelands and 2.5 million geoduck seed for sale annually. The tribe owns 7,000 acres of tidelands, much of which is suitable for productive shellfish beds (LIBC 1996). All of these tidelands are held in trust by the United States for the exclusive use of the Lummi Nation. The tribal commercial shellfish enterprise and the commercial, subsistence, and ceremonial harvest of shellfish by the Lummi Nation and individual tribal members was severely impacted by the closure of 60 acres of tidelands in 1996 and 120 additional acres in 1997. These closures occurred in Portage Bay and were largely attributed to poor dairy waste management practices in the Nooksack River watershed (DOH 1997). Not considering the multiplier effects on the economy, the lost value of the shellfish products alone was estimated to be approximately $825,000 per year. In response to the 1996 closure, the EPA conducted compliance enforcement inspections of dairy operations in the Nooksack River watershed starting in 1997, the State of Washington passed the 1998 Dairy Nutrient Management Act (RCW 90.64), and dairy farmers developed and implemented nutrient management plans (a.k.a. farm plans). As a result of these reactions and additional compliance inspections by the Washington State Department of Ecology, water quality in the Nooksack River improved. In November 2003, approximately 75 percent of the previously closed shellfish beds in Portage Bay were reopened to commercial harvest. In May 2006, the remaining closed shellfish growing areas were reclassified as \"approved\" for harvest. Although Nooksack River water quality improved dramatically during the 1997 through 2004 period and resulted in the re-opening of the shellfish beds in 2006, deteriorating water quality trends started to become apparent again in 2005. Despite efforts to proactively prevent another shellfish bed closure due to poor water quality, portions of the Portage Bay shellfish beds no longer achieved the National Shellfish Sanitation Program (NSSP) standards during 2014. In order to protect public health, the Lummi Nation voluntarily closed 335 acres of shellfish growing areas to harvest in September 2014. Continuing poor water quality over the growing area resulted in nearly 500 acres of shellfish bed being closed to harvest by the end of December 2014. A Lummi Casino project began in 1983 in an effort to diversify the Reservation economy. The casino operation was upgraded significantly in 1994 with the opening of the Lummi Casino at Fisherman's Cove. The casino flourished initially, employing approximately 400 people, 65 percent of whom were Native American (LIBC 1996). However, competition and changing economic conditions resulted in the closure of the casino on August 26, 1997. With 238 workers losing their jobs, the Lummi unemployment rate grew to approximately 50 percent. A new casino opened in April 2002 at a new location (the corner of Haxton Way and Slater Road) closer to the Interstate 5 highway. The new casino (the Silver Reef Casino) initially was 28,000 square feet and employed approximately 200 people. The casino was expanded in 2004 (Phase II) to a total of 55,000 square feet with the addition of additional gaming space, a restaurant, and a 400 seat pavilion. The casino was expanded again in 2006 (Phase III) to 135,000 square feet with the addition of a restaurant, additional gaming space, a spa and fitness room, and a six floor, 109 room hotel (NEI 2005). Following this expansion, the Silver Reef Casino was renamed the Silver Reef Hotel, Casino & Spa. A smaller expansion (Phase IV) of approximately 9,000 square feet occurred in 2008 to add gaming space and an additional restaurant. The Phase V expansion was additional parking only. The most recent expansion was completed in 2013 (Phase VI) and included the addition of 50,000 square feet of additional gaming area, a new restaurant, theater, and event center. A second hotel tower (Phase VII) was completed in November 2015. In 2005, after the first expansion, the casino employed 382 workers of which 274 were full-time employees and 108 were part-time employees (NEI 2005). In 2007, after the addition of the hotel and spa, the casino employed 500 people (Werner 2007). By 2010, the Silver Reef Hotel, Casino & Spa employed 550 people; following the opening of the Phase VI expansion in 2013 there were 675 employees. The LIBC operates a gas station and mini-mart adjacent to the Silver Reef Hotel, Casino & Spa. Other employment opportunities for Reservation residents exist at the two oil refineries and the aluminum smelter just north of the Reservation and nearby in the communities of Ferndale and Bellingham. In 2004, 40.8 percent (131) of the 321 businesses licensed to operate on the Reservation were owned by enrolled tribal members (NEI 2005). These businesses included fireworks sales, food preparation and retail, wholesale, and trade businesses. In 2009, 249 businesses were licensed to operate on the Reservation according to the LIBC Accounting Department. These businesses range from large employers (Silver Reef Hotel, Casino & Spa) to long established fish buying and processing enterprises, trades, native arts, and food catering. In 2013, the LIBC was the 9 th largest employer in Whatcom County and the Silver Reef Hotel, Casino & Spa was the 14 th largest employer; with all tribal institutions combined, the tribe is the 3 rd largest employer in the county (WWU 2011). Most of the LIBC and Northwest Indian College (NWIC) employees are tribal members. In 2003, native employees made up 70 percent of LIBC staff (55 percent enrolled Lummi tribal members) and 61 percent of NWIC staff (33 percent enrolled Lummi tribal members) (Valz 2003). The LIBC provides community, administrative, education, natural and cultural resources protection, and health services to the tribal population in order to help achieve the tribal economic and social development goals. These goals include job creation for tribal members, income generation to fund community development programs, and diversification and stabilization of the local economy by creating alternatives to fishing. Revenue generation is needed in order for the Lummi Nation to develop economic self-sufficiency. February 2016 In 1993, 56 percent of the 2,500 working-age Lummi tribal members were unemployed, under employed, full-time students, or no longer seeking work (LIBC 1996). Since 1993, the combined effect of the decline in the fishery and the closure of the original casino have had a substantial negative impact on the Lummi economy. The BIA reported that the unemployment rate on the Reservation in 1999 was 21 percent (BIA 1999). Table 2.2 presents the results of a survey of 2,054, over the age of 18, enrolled tribal members conducted by the LIBC Statistics Office in 2003. This survey indicates that 28 percent of adult tribal members were unemployed and up to 14 percent may have been underemployed (part-time, seasonally employed) (LIBC 2003). In 2004, 74.6 percent of enrolled Lummi tribal members in Whatcom County ages 18 through 64 were employed and 15.9 percent were unemployed (NEI 2005).

For example, tribes have the inherent power to form a government, to decide their own membership, the right to regulate property, the right to maintain law and order, and the right to regulate commerce.

This section provides a technical analysis of the evidence of anthropogenic climate change, including a brief overview of the earth's climate system, as well as observed and projected impacts of climate change in the Pacific Northwest (PNW)."}, {"section_title": "Climate 101", "text": "Climate and weather are distinct, but often confused, concepts. While weather describes the dayto-day state of the atmosphere at a given place and time, climate describes the average weather conditions over a period of at least 30 years. As such, weather is inherently chaotic (i.e., it may or may not rain today), whereas climate is inherently predictable (i.e., winters in the Puget Sound region are rainy). However, changes in the earth's climate can and do occur naturally over long periods of time (centuries to millennia). Changes in climate affect not only air temperatures (i.e., global warming), but also sea surface temperatures, sea level, precipitation patterns, storm events, and other physical systems. One reason for the anomalous nature of the current changes in Earth's climate is that these changes are largely the result of anthropogenic emissions of longlived, heat-trapping gasses, called greenhouse gasses (GHGs) into the atmosphere. Examples of GHGs include carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and chloroflurocarbons (CFCs). Fossil fuel burning, land use change (e.g., biomass burning from deforestation), and industrial processes (e.g., cement and fertilizer production) are a few of the many sources of human-generated greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing atmospheric concentrations of GHGs since the industrial era (mid-17 th century) has enhanced the greenhouse effect, the process that mediates the Earth's energy budget. Greenhouse gasses serve as the Earth's blanket, without which the Earth would be too cold to be habitable by humans. Increasing the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere is like using a thicker blanket; the greenhouse effect is enhanced and additional warming occurs. The positive correlation between increasing atmospheric GHG concentrations, specifically CO 2, and increasing surface temperatures over the period of the instrumental record is depicted in Figure 3.1. This figure is taken from the U.S. Global Change Research Program's (USGCRP) Third National Climate Assessment (NCA), which was published in May 2014, with a caption reading as follows: Global annual average temperature (as measured over both land and oceans) has increased by more than 1.5\u00b0F since 1880 (through 2012). Red bars show temperatures above the long-term average, and blue bars indicate temperatures below the long-term average. The black line shows atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration in parts per million (ppm). While there is a clear long-term global warming trend, some years do not show a temperature increase relative to the previous year, and some years show greater changes than others. These yearto-year fluctuations in temperature are due to natural processes, such as the effects of El Ni\u00f1os, La Ni\u00f1as, and volcanic eruptions. Other key findings reported in the 2014 NCA provide a clear summary of the current understanding of global climate change. These findings include: (1) \"human-induced climate change has moved firmly into the present;\" (2) \"Americans are already feeling the effects of increases in some types of extreme weather and sea level rise;\" (3) \"impacts are apparent in every region and in important sectors including health, water, agriculture, energy, and more;\" and (4) \"there are many actions we can take to reduce future climate change and its impacts and to prepare for the impacts we can't avoid.\" , that describe how humans might respond to a changing climate. The \"high\" emissions scenario (RCP 8.5; a.k.a., \"business as usual\") reflects continued increases in GHG emissions over the next century, the \"medium\" emissions scenario (RCP 6.0) reflects gradually increasing GHG concentrations that stabilize near the end of the century, the \"low\" emissions scenario (RCP 4.5) reflects GHG emissions stabilizing mid-century and then falling thereafter, and the \"very low\" emissions scenario (RCP 2.5; a.k.a., \"best case scenario\") reflects aggressive GHG reduction and carbon sequestration efforts. Because each scenario accounts for different amounts of GHG emissions, February 2016 they result in different projected increases in the Earth's surface temperature over time ( Figure  3.2). It is impossible to know which emissions scenario is most likely to occur, so modeling multiple scenarios is important to capture a broad range of potential future conditions. Emission scenarios are periodically updated and some figures in this report contain scenarios from an earlier IPCC report Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES; i.e., from high to low emissions A2, A1B, B1).

For example, rising temperatures are not evenly distributed across the globe or over time. Climate change adaptation activities require an understanding of regional trends, so the remainder of this chapter provides a brief overview of observed and projected climate change impacts that will affect the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region in the coming century. It is important to note that even within the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region, which encompasses Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, there is significant local variability in climate and anticipated climate changes (e.g., western Washington versus eastern Washington). Although this report presents the best available science, all research has inherent limitations and uncertainties. One of the primary limitations of climate change science is that although there is generally high confidence in course-scale regional predictions, predictions specific to relatively small areas such as Whatcom County or the Lummi Indian Reservation (Reservation) are not feasible given the coarse spatial resolution of climate models, model uncertainties (e.g., generally higher level of confidence in temperature simulations than in precipitation simulations), degree of agreement between models, methods used to statistically downscale GCM output, natural climate variability (e.g., PDO, ENSO, anomalous events), and other factors.

Higher temperatures over this time period were associated with lengthening of the frost-free season and an increased frequency of nighttime heat events. Based on the IPCC's \"low\" and \"high\" GHG emission scenarios, warming in the PNW in the 2050s is projected to increase between 4.3\u00b0F and 5.8\u00b0F relative to the 1950-1999 period (CIG 2013).

What was visible during this time period were natural fluctuations in precipitation patterns, which change on a scale of years-to-decades and are affected by natural climate patterns such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Given this high degree of natural variability, model projections of precipitation under future climate scenarios suggest that the PNW will experience only relatively small changes in the amount of annual precipitation.

Similarly, most of Washington's glaciers are in decline, with the greatest losses in average glacier area observed in the south (49% glacier loss at Mt. Adams) and more moderate losses in the north (7% loss in the North Cascades) (CIG 2013). It is understood that glacier area and glacier volume are distinct variables; however, lost area is indicative of lost storage volume. Continued losses in spring snowpack and glacier area are projected under future climate scenarios. For example, spring snowpack across Washington is expected to decline approximately 60 percent by the 2080s compared to the 20 th century average (Ecology 2012). The timing of spring snowmelt is also changing, now occurring earlier in the season. By 2050, spring snowmelt is projected to occur up to 30 days earlier than the 20 th century average (NCA 2014c)."}, {"section_title": "Streamflow", "text": "The Nooksack River, which flows through the Reservation, is considered a transitional or mixed rain-snow watershed, as compared to a rainfall dominant or snowmelt dominant watershed (Hamlet et al. 2013).

The first peak (November -January) coincides with runoff from fall/winter storm events, while the second peak (March -May) coincides with spring snowmelt discharged to the Nooksack River's headwaters in the Cascades. Over time, reductions in spring snowpack, earlier snowmelt, and increased winter rainfall are expected to shift transitional hydrologic regimes toward rainfall dominated hydrologic regimes characterized by a \"single-peak\" hydrograph. In the Nooksack River, this shift is projected to increase winter discharge, decrease summer discharge, and shift the timing of spring peak melt earlier, exacerbating existing problems with winter flood events, summer low flows, and warming water temperatures (Figure 3.3)."}, {"section_title": "Extreme Weather Events", "text": "Another serious consequence of global climate change is observed and expected future increases in the extent, frequency, and/or intensity of extreme weather events.

With more moisture in the atmosphere, precipitation events are more likely to be larger. Supporting evidence is provided by the 2014 NCA, which reported that the amount of precipitation falling in very heavy events (heaviest 1 percent of all daily events) increased by 12 percent in the PNW between 1958 and 2012.

Throughout the 20 th century, sea level rose at a rate of approximately 1.7 mm/yr, but in recent decades (1993-2010) has accelerated to approximately 3.2 mm/yr (IPCC 2013) or nearly double the rate of the earlier period. Continued acceleration of the rate of sea level rise is expected. Based on recent IPCC estimates, global mean sea level by 2100 (relative to the 1986-2005 period) is projected to increase approximately 1.3 ft (likely range 0.9 ft to 1.8 ft) under the \"very low\" emissions scenario (RCP 2.6) and approximately 2.1 ft (likely range 1.5 ft to 2.7 ft) under the \"high\" emissions scenario (RCP 8.5) (Figure 3.4; IPCC 2013). A wider range and generally higher estimates of regional sea level rise are reported by the National Research Council, whose research suggests that mean sea level along the outer coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California may increase between 0.3 and 4.7 ft by 2100 (NRC 2012). Although sea level rise occurs globally, changes are not evenly distributed across the world's oceans. Additionally, regional differences in vertical land movement (e.g., tectonic uplift or subsidence) and surface sediment dynamics (e.g., sediment accretion, shallow subsidence, and erosion) are expected to generate regional variability in realized sea level change. As a result, local change in mean sea level (i.e., relative sea level rise) may significantly depart from changes in global mean sea level. Estimates of vertical land movement near the Lummi Indian Reservation (Reservation) are conflicting, with some research reporting uplift up to 2.0 mm/yr (CIG 2008) and other research reporting subsidence of roughly 2.0 mm/yr (PANGA 2014; Station P440, Station DEA2), suggesting that the impacts of sea level rise may be either ameliorated or exacerbated at the local scale. However, it would be inappropriate to draw any conclusions without also considering surface sediment dynamics, of which there is unfortunately insufficient data to assess the magnitude and direction of these potential changes in the coastal areas on and near the Reservation. It should also be noted that significant changes in sea level result from natural climate patterns (e.g., ENSO may temporarily elevate wintertime sea level by approximately 1 ft) or earthquakes (e.g., 8.0 magnitude earthquakes along the Cascadia subduction zone have resulted in sudden land subsidence of \u22653.3 ft) (CIG 2013(CIG , 2008. Despite these uncertainties, there is a high level of confidence among the scientific community that increases in mean sea level in the Puget Sound will threaten to inundate coastal habitats, increase coastal flooding, accelerate coastal erosion, and increase saltwater intrusion into coastal groundwater systems."}, {"section_title": "Ocean Acidification", "text": "Ocean acidification (OA) is one consequence of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations. When absorbed by the ocean, CO 2 reacts with water to form carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3 ), which then undergoes a series of chemical reactions that reduce pH (i.e., increase hydrogen ion [H + ] concentration) and the availability of carbonate ions (CO 3 2-) (NOAA 2012). As a result, some calcifying organisms (a.k.a., \"calcifiers\"; e.g., oysters, clams, crabs, pteropods, some copepods) are experiencing difficulty forming and increased corrosion of their shells, skeletons, or other hard body parts, which are composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). Not only do higher levels of acidity reduce the growth and survivorship of some calcifiers, but increasing corrosive waters are also expected to reduce food availability for animals that feed on calcifiers and may increase the toxicity of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Since the mid-17 th century, the world's oceans have absorbed approximately 25 percent of human-generated CO 2 emissions (Blue Ribbon Panel 2012). Consequently, ocean pH has declined from 8.2 to 8.1 (pH is measured on a log scale), which equates to an increase in ocean acidity of nearly 30 percent (Blue Ribbon Panel 2012). This is particularly startling considering that the current rate of acidification is occurring nearly 10 times faster than any time in the past 50 million years (Blue Ribbon Panel 2012). By 2100, ocean pH is projected to decline by another 0.1-0.3 pH units (IPCC 2013). Waters of the Washington coast and Puget Sound have and are projected to continue acidifying at a rate consistent with the global average, although locally variable conditions will make some areas prone to higher levels of acidification (CIG 2013). Local conditions that may exacerbate the acidification process include seasonal upwelling of low pH, CO 2 -rich waters along the continental shelf, land-based runoff and discharge of nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorous) and organic carbon, low pH freshwater inputs, and absorption of other acidifying gasses (e.g., nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides) (Blue Ribbon Panel 2012, NOAA 2012).

Accordingly, the purpose of this vulnerability assessment is to evaluate the susceptibility the natural, human, and built systems of the Reservation to climate change. The methodology used in this report loosely follows the assessment process outlined in Preparing for Climate Change: A Guidebook for Local, Regional, and State Governments (Snover et al. 2007), a joint publication of the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group (CIG), King County, Washington, and ICLEI -Local Governments for Sustainability. In the framework developed by Snover et al. (2007), there are two variables that affect vulnerability: (1) the sensitivity of a system and (2) the capacity of a system to adapt. These variables are defined as follows: Sensitivity is the degree to which a natural, human, or built system is directly or indirectly affected by changes in climate conditions (e.g., temperature and precipitation) or specific climate change impacts (e.g., sea level rise, increased water temperature). If systems in a planning area are likely to be affected as a result of a projected climate change, then that system should be considered sensitive to climate change. For instance, a community of coldwater fish at the southern edge of its range is highly sensitive to changes in climate, because even a slight warming may make its habitat unsuitable. In turn, regional economies based on fisheries solely targeting those fish would also be highly sensitive to changes in climate. Adaptive capacity describes the ability of natural, human, or built systems to accommodate changes in climate (including climate variability and climate extremes) with minimal potential damage or cost. As a general rule, systems that have high adaptive capacity are better able to deal with climate change impacts. For instance, agriculture in a given region will have greater adaptive capacity if the farms of that region have a choice of water sources for irrigation (i.e., in the face of water shortage) and the financial ability and training to switch crop types (i.e., if another crop were proven to grow better based on new climate characteristics).  Snover et al. (2007), depicts the relationship between sensitivity and adaptive capacity. If a system has a high sensitivity to climate and a low capacity to adapt to climate change, then this system is considered to have a high level of vulnerability to climate change. Conversely, a system with low sensitivity to climate and a high capacity to adapt to climate change will have a much lower vulnerability to projected climate change impacts. In this analysis, each sector of the natural, human, and built systems of the Reservation was rated for sensitivity and adaptive capacity and then assigned a vulnerability ranking according to the definitions above and the vulnerability matrix below. Ratings were made using the best available science when scientific data were appropriate. However, some key areas of concern, such as cultural resources, cannot be quantified scientifically. As such, some of the vulnerability rankings reflect not only the physical climate change impacts, but also the mission of the Lummi Indian Business Council (LIBC) to preserve, promote, and protect the Lummi Schelangen (\"way of life\") and the cultural and social values of the Lummi Nation. As a result, the vulnerabilities reported here are specific to the Lummi Indian Reservation. Also, the information presented in this analysis is cumulative by design. For example, sea level rise is described in detail in Section 4.2 -Water Resources and Section 4.3 -Coastal Resources.

Surface waters of the Reservation include the Nooksack River, the Lummi River, sloughs, small streams, roadside and agricultural ditches, springs, wetlands, estuaries, and marine waters (Figure 2.2). Groundwater resources of the Reservation are located in underlying aquifers. For the purposes of this vulnerability assessment, the water resources sector is divided into three planning areas: freshwater, groundwater, and wetlands. It is acknowledged that groundwater can also be considered \"freshwater\"for the purposes of this assessment, freshwater refers to nonmarine surface waters. Marine waters are also an important water resource to the Lummi Nation and are address in the subsequent sector on coastal resources. Vulnerability rankings developed for potential climate change impacts to each of these planning areas are provided in  \nAs discussed in Section 4.2 -Water Resources, some of the primary impacts of climate change on water resources are an increased risk of severe flooding during the winter months and reduced instream flows and increased stream temperature during the summer months. Several adaptation goals and strategies addressing these climate change impacts are presented in this section (Table  5.2). Climate-related wetland and groundwater impacts are discussed in Section 5.5.2 and Section 5.5.10 respectively. February 2016 Adaptation Goal A-2: Restore instream flow and maintain suitable stream temperature in the Nooksack River basin. Historic and current human activities that contribute to low instream flow and high stream temperature include deforestation, alterations to channel morphology and geometry, agricultural drainage practices and irrigation, municipal and industrial water uses, and removal of riparian vegetation. Beechie et al. (2012) identify several restoration actions that begin to address existing problems and are likely to remain effective under future climate conditions, including: (1) improving lateral connectivity (e.g., levee removal, reconnection of floodplain features, creation of new floodplain habitats), (2) improving riparian function (e.g., planting trees and other vegetation), and (3) improving vertical connectivity (e.g., reintroducing beaver, removing cattle). Pending legal action to reduce water withdrawals, restoration provides an opportunity to begin making positive change.  1. Continue to pursue a negotiated or litigated settlement to resolve conflicts over water rights allocations in the Nooksack River basin. 2. Undertake climate-conscious riparian and floodplain restoration to decrease existing stressors and ameliorate climate change effects on summer instream flow and temperature."}, {"section_title": "Freshwater", "text": "The Nooksack River watershed (786 square miles) drains most of western Whatcom County and currently flows through the Reservation and discharges into the marine waters of Bellingham Bay near the eastern extent of the Reservation. Historically, the Nooksack River flowed (alternately or simultaneously) to both Lummi and Bellingham bays (effectively making the Lummi Peninsula an \"island\"). Before 1860, the Nooksack River discharged primarily into Lummi Bay by way of the present Lummi River channel (the Lummi River is sometimes called the Red River). By 1860, dike and levee construction, damming, and large woody debris removal effectively diverted the mainstem of the river into what was then a small stream near present day Ferndale that flowed into Bellingham Bay (PSNERP 2012). Since that time, considerable effort has been expended to keep the Nooksack River discharging into Bellingham Bay. These efforts have included constructing levees along the west bank of the Nooksack River and restricting inputs to the Lummi River to relatively high-flow conditions (greater than approximately 9,600 cubic feet per second [cfs]) (Deardorff 1992). Without freshwater input from the Nooksack River, the Lummi River carries storm water runoff from the Ferndale upland, as well as the drainage from a complex network of agricultural ditches in the floodplain. This assessment focuses largely on the impacts of climate change to the Nooksack and Lummi rivers, including changes in streamflow and degraded water quality. The other 15 watersheds that drain the Reservation uplands into Lummi and Bellingham bays, Hale Passage, and the Strait of Georgia will also be affected, though not necessarily to the same extent. For example, these lowland watersheds are relatively small (between approximately 135 -4,100 acres) and rarely generate snowmelt runoff. To begin, future reductions in spring snowpack, earlier snowmelt, and increased winter rainfall are projected to increase winter flows in the Nooksack River, as well as the frequency and magnitude of winter flood events. Results from a hydrologic model simulating future streamflow in the Nooksack River suggest that the magnitude of a historical 10-year flood will have a return interval of 3 years by 2050 (Dickerson-Lange et al. 2013). Similarly, Mantua et al. (2010) report that a historical 20-year flood event on the Nooksack River may occur up to 30 percent more frequently by mid-century. Figure 4.2 was developed by the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group (CIG) as part of the Columbia Basin Climate Change Scenarios Project and also indicates an increasing magnitude and frequency of flooding on the Nooksack River at Ferndale; note that future flood statistics (red and yellow circles in Figure 4.2) are significantly higher than historical flood statistics (blue circles). It goes without saying that larger, more frequent flooding in the future poses significant risk in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) and adjacent areas of the Reservation that are already vulnerable to flooding. During the summer months, decreasing seasonal precipitation is anticipated to cause a reduction in instream flow. Simulations of future summer streamflow indicate that the magnitude of streamflow in the Nooksack River may decline by approximately 25 percent by 2050 (Dickerson-Lange et al. 2013;Mantua et al. 2010). Figure 4.3 was published in the Third National Climate Assessment (2014) and illustrates projected changes across the Pacific Northwest in local runoff and streamflow for the 2040s under the A1B emissions scenario. As depicted in this figure, natural surface water availability during the already dry late summer period is projected to decrease across most of the Northwest; a trend that also holds true in the Nooksack River basin. Lower instream flows can reasonably be expected to exacerbate existing problems in an already over allocated basin where water of adequate quantity is currently not available to the Lummi Nation, the most senior water rights holder in Whatcom County, to support the purposes of the Reservation as a permanent, economically viable homeland or to support a sustainable, harvestable surplus of salmon and shellfish sufficient to support the Lummi Schelangen (\"way of life\"). Furthermore, excessive groundwater withdrawals (discussed in Section 4.2.2 -Groundwater) could further reduce streamflow in this hydraulically connected aquifer-stream system. Commensurate with low flow conditions, stream temperatures during the summer months are also projected to increase. This is illustrated in Figure 4.4 and Figure 4.5 (Mantua et al. 2010), which depict historic versus projected August maximum stream temperature (shaded circles) in Washington State. It is important to note that although stream temperatures in the Nooksack River watershed are likely to increase and become stressful for salmon under certain climate scenarios (e.g., A1B 2080s), simulated stream temperatures are not projected to reach lethal limits by the end of the century. However, it is also important to understand that projected future changes will exacerbate existing problems with elevated stream temperatures in certain reaches (e.g., the South Fork Nooksack River); a factor that may not be well captured in the hydrologic modeling. As a step to restore and maintain the beneficial uses of currently impaired reaches, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington State, Nooksack Indian Tribe, and the Lummi Nation are developing a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) pursuant to the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) to address elevated stream temperature in the South Fork Nooksack River. This assessment is part of the EPA's Climate Change Pilot Project and is laying the framework for inclusion of climate change impacts into TMDL guidelines. One product of the TMDL will be fine-scale projections of future stream temperature in the South Fork, which will help refine our understanding of future stream temperature impacts on salmon and contribute to the development of salmon restoration strategies. In addition, glacier recession may significantly impact stream temperature and hydrology, especially in areas where relatively large proportions of summer instream flows are derived from glacial melt. The timing and severity of these impacts depend on the current contribution of glacial melt to temperature and streamflow, as well as the hydrologic response of glaciers to global warming. As part of the Nooksack Climate Change Project organized by the Nooksack Indian Tribe, research is underway to quantify current conditions of glacier melt and model future changes. Theoretically, there are four phases of glacier recession: (1) enhanced melt and increased discharge to streams (2) peak melt and peak discharge to streams, (3) decreased glacial area and volume and reduced discharge to streams, and (4) complete glacier loss and zero discharge to streams (Frans 2014). Determining where the glaciers that drain into the Nooksack River basin fall on this spectrum will be one outcome of the Nooksack Climate Change Project and will help refine future projections of temperature and streamflow impacts. Finally, flooding and water quality issues may be expected if sediment loads (i.e., suspended and bedload) in the Nooksack River increase significantly. High sediment production and delivery is likely to result from glacial and snowfield retreat, which exposes additional bare ground to erosion, from higher peak streamflows, which enhances bank erosion, and from other sources of climate induced sediment production (e.g., wildfire, landslides). First, increasing bedload sediment deposition (sediment aggradation) decreases flood conveyance (carrying capacity) of river channels and may result in higher flood hazards. Second, higher turbidity degrades water quality and may also increase stream temperature and the transport of absorbed contaminants and nutrients. Projections of future sediment load have not been developed for the Nooksack River. Given the paucity of local data, looking to the Skagit River may help illustrate the scale of potential changes. The Skagit River has the highest mean annual discharge (18,000 cfs) and the highest annual sediment load (2.8 million tons/yr) of all the rivers draining into the Puget Sound (Czuba et al. 2011). It should be noted that there are three hydroelectric dams that trap sediment in the upper Skagit River watershed and that without these impoundments sediment production would likely be higher. Regardless, the annual sediment load in the Skagit River is projected to double by 2080 (Lee et al. in press). The Nooksack River has the second highest annual sediment load in the Puget Sound (1.4 million tons/yr), despite the fact that the river has only the fourth highest mean annual discharge (3,200 cfs) (Czuba et al. 2011). Naturally high sediment production is expected because the Nooksack watershed drains the glaciers on the northern slopes of Mt. Baker. Land use changes (e.g., agriculture, forestry, urbanization) in the watershed over the past 150 years are likely to have altered historical sediment loads. Over the coming February 2016  "}, {"section_title": "Groundwater", "text": "Two (apparently separate) potable groundwater systems occur on the Reservation. One system is located in the northern upland area and is recharged both on-Reservation and from off-Reservation areas to the north; the other system is located in the southern upland area of the Reservation (Lummi Peninsula) and is completely contained within the Reservation boundaries ( Figure 4.6) (LWRD 2011b). The floodplain of the Lummi and Nooksack rivers, which contains a surface aquifer that is saline, separates the two potable water systems (Cline 1974). A third potable water system may exist on Portage Island, but information on the water quality and the potential yield of this system is limited and inconclusive (LWRD 2011b). As a finite resource, groundwater is one of the most important and critical of the Lummi Nation's resources. Over 95 percent of the residential water supply for the Reservation is pumped from local groundwater wells. Most of the existing water supply wells on the Reservation are located within a half mile of marine waters. Progressive saltwater intrusion has already led to the closure of several public water supply wells, and continued vertical and lateral intrusion along some shoreline areas can be expected as sea levels rise. Excessive drawdown due to over pumping of fresh groundwater aquifers may also increase the rate and extent of salinization. Additionally, changes in precipitation patterns and surface water hydrology may alter groundwater recharge (Alexander et al. 2007); however, there is insufficient data available to assess potential climate change impacts to groundwater recharge locally. Because the hydrogeologic conditions on the Reservation vary considerably over short horizontal and vertical distances, the precise locations of the aquifer recharge zones are not definitively known at this time. It is likely that aquifer recharge areas are distributed over the upland areas. However, given the low infiltration potential of the glaciomarine drift that covers much of the Reservation upland, it is also possible that aquifer recharge areas are of limited areal extent and are located primarily in only a few locations around and north of the Reservation. In addition to climate change impacts, groundwater resources are vulnerable to contamination by pollutants introduced on or near the ground surface by human activities (e.g., illegal solid or hazardous waste dumping). Agricultural, residential, municipal, commercial, and industrial land uses increase the potential for groundwater contamination. Future population growth, economic growth, and residential and municipal development on and near the Reservation could further threaten the Lummi Nation's groundwater resources if such activities are not managed effectively. Contamination, saltwater intrusion, and other sources of groundwater degradation could lead to the loss of the primary water supply source for the Reservation because water supply wells are difficult to replace, groundwater contamination is very expensive to treat, and some damages to groundwater caused by contamination may be unmitigable. Lummi  "}, {"section_title": "Wetlands", "text": "The Lummi Nation conducted a Reservation-wide wetland inventory in 1999. The inventory indicated that about 43 percent of the Reservation land area is either wetlands or wetland complexes and that approximately 60 percent of these wetland areas are located in the Nooksack and Lummi river floodplains (Harper 1999;LWRD 2000). Ongoing, GPS-based wetland delineations are further refining the wetland boundaries determined in 1999 (Figure 4.7). Prior to human alteration by Euro-American settlers, the wetlands of the Reservation were likely much more extensive. Beginning in the late 1800s, floodplain and estuarine wetlands were diked, drained, and filled for the purpose of cultivation. Concurrent with agricultural reclamation, some palustrine wetlands found in the Reservation's forested uplands were degraded by hydrologic alterations associated with logging, draining, impounding, and/or road construction. The wetlands of the Reservation provide vital ecosystem goods and services, including storm water attenuation, floodwater storage, water quality enhancement, fish habitat, wildlife habitat, and plants with traditional cultural importance. Protecting and enhancing wetlands is essential to preserving and restoring interdependent fish, shellfish, and wildlife habitats in addition to reducing flood damage. In this section, the potential impacts of climate change on the Reservation's coastal wetlands will be presented first, followed by a discussion of impacts to palustrine wetlands. The Reservation's coastal wetlands (estuaries/deltas) form where fresh water rivers and streams meet the sea and include habitat types such as eelgrass meadows, tidelands, salt marshes, scrubshrub wetlands, and forested wetlands. Coastal wetland losses resulting from relative sea level rise are due to submergence of estuarine habitats and their permanent conversion to open water, as well as subsequent shifts in habitat types as vegetation communities migrate shoreward to keep within optimum depth and salinity tolerances. For example, Zostera marina, an eelgrass species found in Lummi and Portage bays, is adapted to specific elevations within the intertidal range; limited shoreward by desiccation and seaward by light attenuation (Boese et al. 2005, Thom et al. 2008). Accordingly, as sea level rises and light availability falls below Z. marina tolerances, habitats in the lower tidal range will be converted to open water and the persistence of eelgrass communities will require shoreward migration. However, where shoreline dikes/seawalls, natural bluffs, or other barriers exist, such landward movement will be prevented. When biological communities reach barriers to migration, they may be extirpated from the bottom-up, which is termed \"coastal squeeze\". Fortunately, large tracts of estuarine and floodplain wetlands of the Lummi and Nooksack rivers will be protected and functionally improved in the future through the implementation of the Lummi Nation Wetland and Habitat Mitigation Bank and other nearby restoration projects (Figure 4.8). In 2009, the Lummi Nation approved the acquisition of approximately 2,770 acres of wetland habitat for mitigation banking and restoration purposes, these areas will be protected into perpetuity through conservation easements (LIBC Resolution No. 2009-094). The mitigation bank will be developed in phases. The first phase, which encompasses most of the Nooksack River estuary, became operational during 2012. Enhancement activities underway in this area include removing invasive species and planting native species (e.g., willows, conifers). At the Lummi River estuary sites, which have not been developed yet, rehabilitation will focus largely on restoring direct tidal input to areas that have been isolated from tidal hydrology by shoreline dikes and levees. Restoration at these sites will include removing existing tide gates or February 2016 replacing them with self-regulating tide gates, removing portions of existing dikes, and opening remnant sloughs and distributary channels. By implementing this extensive wetland protection and enhancement project, the Lummi Nation has taken an important step to guard against coastal wetland losses due to coastal squeeze. The National Wildlife Federation (NWF) modeled wetland habitat transitions in the Nooksack delta, Lummi Bay, and Bellingham Bay using the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM), which integrates sea level rise data, tidal data, elevation data, and National Wetland Inventory (NWI) data to simulate future changes in habitat composition (Glick 2007). In one model scenario, all existing shoreline dikes were removed. Under such conditions, some wetland habitat types expanded in area (e.g., transitional marsh, salt marsh, tideflats), while other habitats were projected to decrease in area (e.g., tidal swamp, estuarine beach). Although the NWF did not directly simulate habitat transitions following full implementation of the Lummi Nation wetland and habitat mitigation bank, these model results serve as an indicator of the significant shifts in wetland composition that may be expected as a result of sea level rise. Another important consideration is that some estuaries may be capable of surviving sea level rise if the rate of vertical accretion is sufficient to keep pace with the rate of relative sea level rise. This may be feasible in the Nooksack River delta, which was identified as the fastest growing delta relative to its basin size in Puget Sound, with a progradation of approximately one mile over the 1888-1973 period (Bortleson et al. 1980). Consequently, a large area that was once intertidal is now supratidal and new wetlands have formed. However, without a detailed study of sediment dynamics in the Nooksack River delta, it is difficult to accurately project future habitat gains and/or losses. Furthermore, in areas where sedimentation has likely been reduced below historical levels, such as Lummi Bay, sediment elevation loss resulting from shallow sediment subsidence and/or erosion may exacerbate the impacts of eustatic sea level rise. Again, sitespecific research is required to better understand estuarine surface elevation dynamics. The potential impacts of climate change on upland wetlands (e.g., palustrine wetlands on the Lummi Peninsula) are varied and will depend on changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration, surface and/or ground water inflow, and other hydrologic factors that are difficult to accurately forecast. However, if wetland hydroperiods are significantly altered, changes in structure, function, and provision of certain ecosystem goods and services may be anticipated.  "}, {"section_title": "Coastal Resources", "text": "The coastal resources of the Reservation are characterized by the estuaries of the Nooksack and Lummi rivers, which form the interface between marine and freshwater. These coastal areas are important habitat for juvenile and adult salmon as they acclimate to either saline or freshwaters during their seaward and landward/spawning grounds migrations, respectively. Estuaries also serve as habitat for juvenile and adult individuals of many other important aquatic species (LNR 2010). The complex and rich aquatic resources that provide feeding grounds for fish also attract a large variety of wildlife. The estuaries of the Lummi and Nooksack rivers are a part of the Pacific Coast flyway for ducks, geese, swans, and shorebirds. These estuaries are also habitat for peregrine falcon and bald eagle, both formerly listed species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Additionally, the estuarine tidelands (tideflats) located in or near Lummi Bay, Gooseberry Point, the Stommish Grounds, and Portage Bay are rich in resources for tribal ceremonial, subsistence, and commercial shellfish harvest and are integral to the Lummi Schelangen (\"way of life\"). In order to document the existing diversity, abundance, distribution, and habitats of the biological resources that are found on the Reservation tidelands, the Lummi Natural Resources Department (LNR) conducted the Lummi Intertidal Baseline Inventory (LIBI), which documented over 242 separate taxa present on the Reservation tidelands (LNR 2010). The coastal resources sector is divided into three planning areas: shorelines, tidelands, and seawater. Vulnerability rankings developed for potential climate change impacts to each of these planning areas are provided in Table 4.2. \nAs discussed in Section 4.3 -Coastal Resources, some of the primary impacts of climate change on coastal resources are inundation from sea level rise and storm surge, accelerated shoreline erosion, and ocean acidification. Several adaptation goals and strategies addressing these climate change impacts are presented in this section (Table 5.3). Potential adaptation strategies to ameliorate the impact of ocean acidification on shellfish are discussed in Section 5.5.4 -Fish, Wildlife, and Traditional Use Plants. Adaptation Goal B-1: Reduce the risk of property damage from coastal flooding and shoreline erosion. Adaptation Strategies: 1. Continue to assess coastal areas for flooding and erosion risks. There are two basic approaches to shoreline management in the face of climate change: managed retreat or protect in place. Determining which option is appropriate will require an understanding of local risk, as well as a site-specific assessment of the benefits and drawbacks of each approach. 3. Protect coastal buildings and infrastructure through shoreline hardening and/or building elevation and floodproofing. Shoreline hardening (e.g., bulkheads, dikes, riprap, and other engineered shore defense structures) can be damaging to intertidal habitats, erode unarmored shorelines downdrift, and may provide only a short-term option for coastal protection depending on the future rate of sea level rise. However, in some circumstances it may be appropriate to construct or fortify shoreline armoring, such as when there are significant tribal assets at stake that will require time to relocate, when setback levees are constructed to allow the removal of existing shoreline levees, or when approved waterdependant uses are at risk. Buildings may also be elevated or otherwise designed to reduce flood damage. February 2016 4. Encourage soft bank protection, rather than traditional shoreline armoring. Soft coastal engineering (e.g., beach nourishment, planting vegetation, anchoring large woody debris, natural breakwaters) mimics natural shoreline features and can be used to minimize erosion while still maintaining wetland habitat and sediment transport. Soft bank protection can be a viable alternative to shoreline hardening along reaches with low to moderate erosion potential. One successful model for encouraging the use of soft bank protection is the Stewardship Centre for British Colombia's Green Shores Program. Green Shores is a coastal development rating system (similar to the LEED rating system) that provides certification to developers and landowners who utilize planning and design principles credited for maintaining shoreline structure and function. Adaptation Goal B-2: Maintain and enhance coastal wetland habitats. Adaptation Strategies: 1. Facilitate shoreward migration of coastal wetlands though land acquisition and removal of hard shore protection (e.g., bulkheads, dikes, sea walls) or other barriers to tidal flow. Preserving open space for shoreward migration and restoring tidal hydrology are two major goals of the Lummi Nation Wetland and Habitat Mitigation Bank and other current and planned restoration projects. By accommodating for sea level rise and facilitating the inland migration of wetland plants and animals, the Lummi Nation has adopted what is arguably the best adaptation strategy for preserving coastal wetlands in the face of climate change. Continuation and expansion of these programs and other actions that prevent coastal squeeze is highly recommended. 2. Preserve and restore structural complexity and biological diversity when undertaking wetland enhancement activities. Ecological diversity is widely recognized as making habitats more resilient to climate change. By managing for diversity and incorporating climate change projections into restoration planning, land managers will be better able to protect critical estuarine habitats, such as nursery and spawning grounds. A diverse Puget Sound estuary contains a mosaic of wetland habitat types, including eelgrass meadows, tidelands, salt marshes, scrub-shrub wetlands, and forested wetlands, such as were present before Euro-American settlement and subsequent wetland destruction beginning in the late 1800s. 3. Promote and maintain mechanisms for sediment transport and deposition. The goals of this sediment management strategy are twofold. First, if coastal wetlands are to survive in the face of accelerated sea level rise, vertical accretion must be sufficient to pace with increasing sea level. Restoring direct tidal and riverine input to areas that have been isolated from tidal hydrology or are otherwise sediment-starved can reestablish the conditions that promote mineral sediment deposition and organic matter accumulation, thereby enhancing vertical accretion. Second, shoreline sediment transport, also called shoreline drift, has been disrupted in some areas by bluff armoring and the excavation of the entrance channel to the Sandy Point Marina. Bulkheads are installed in efforts to protect upland development from erosion, but effectively starve downdrift beaches of needed feeder bluff sediment and induce alternative patterns in erosion that adversely affect seaward and downdrift habitats. Where identified as appropriate, removing bulkheads entirely or replacing them with soft bank protection may successfully restore and maintain natural sediment transport processes. Adaptation Goal B-3: Reduce local land-based contributions to ocean acidification. Adaptation Strategy: 1. Strengthen pollution reduction actions to reduce nutrient and organic carbon discharge into fresh and marine waters. Sources of excess nutrients and organic carbon include farms and livestock operations (e.g., dairies and beef cattle), urban storm water runoff, wastewater treatment outfalls, and on-site septic systems. Although the magnitude of nutrient and organic carbon impacts to local acidification has not been quantified in this area, the implications of these pollutants are clear (i.e., decreased pH resulting from decomposition of excessive plant and algal biomass) and improved pollution reduction measures need to begin now. There will be multiple benefits to controlling sources of pollution that reduce pH, including a reduction in bacterial contamination and prevention of potential low dissolved oxygen conditions. 1. Continue to assess coastal areas for flooding and erosion risks. 2. Facilitate managed retreat through land acquisition, zoning changes, development restrictions, and/or other regulatory tools as appropriate. 3. Protect coastal buildings and infrastructure through shoreline hardening and/or building elevation and floodproofing. 4. Encourage soft bank protection, rather than traditional shoreline armoring. B-2: Maintain and enhance coastal wetland habitats. 1. Facilitate shoreward migration of coastal wetlands though land acquisition and removal of hard shore protection (e.g., bulkheads, dikes, seawalls) or other barriers to tidal flow. 2. Preserve and restore structural complexity and biological diversity when undertaking wetland enhancement activities. 3. Promote and maintain mechanisms for sediment transport and deposition. B-3: Reduce local landbased contributions to ocean acidification. 1. Strengthen pollution reduction actions to reduce nutrient and organic carbon discharge into fresh and marine waters.

As sea levels rise, these shorelines and adjacent low-lying areas will become increasingly vulnerable to permanent inundation or inundation during high tide, more frequent and intense coastal flooding (from storm surge) and river flooding (from the \"backwater effect\"), and/or accelerated coastal erosion (Figure 4.9).  Concurrent with inundation and coastal flooding, sea level rise will also accelerate bluff and beach erosion. Although erosion is an important natural process that allows shorelines, which are not fixed physical features, to migrate over time, erosion management may be necessary where accelerated erosion threatens to destabilize important infrastructure. In 2007, the Lummi Nation contracted Coastal Geologic Services, Inc. (CGS) to assess the condition of Reservation shorelines (e.g., accretion shoreforms, feeder bluffs, and modified shorelines) and provide recommendations for coastal protection considering existing conditions and future sea level rise. "}, {"section_title": "Tidelands", "text": "There are approximately 7,000 acres of tribally-owned tidelands on the Reservation. Similar to shoreline impacts, relative sea level rise will progressively inundate areas in the lower tidal range and force the shoreward migration of tideland flora and fauna, including some shellfish species. Because ceremonial, subsistence, and commercial shellfish harvest are integral to the Lummi Schelangen (\"way of life\"), this section is included to highlight the importance of taking steps to protect and preserve tideland resources. As a first step, it would be beneficial to quantify the potential changes in suitable shellfish habitat under future sea level rise scenarios. By taking into account the current abundance and distribution of shellfish species of concern, tideland surface elevation (e.g., digital elevation model [DEM]), tideland sediment characteristics (substrate coarseness affects habitat suitability), and other important determinates of shellfish habitat, areas of potential habitat loss and/or gain could be identified and actions taken. For example, shoreline armoring can enhance scour, leading to seaward beach erosion and substrate coarsening (CIG 2009). As such, it may be feasible to remove shoreline armoring in certain areas to increase the viability of current or future shellfish habitat."}, {"section_title": "Seawater", "text": "This section addresses two of the primary impacts of climate change on seawater: (1) increasing acidity (decreasing pH) and (2) increasing surface temperatures. Thermal expansion of the oceans and resultant sea level rise was previously discussed in the context of shoreline impacts and is not included here. Ocean acidification (OA) directly reduces the growth and survival of some calcifying organisms (\"calcifiers\"), such as oysters, clams, mussels, geoduck, crabs, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers, February 2016 with indirect affects transmitted throughout the marine food web. Figure 4.10 depicts the dissolution of a pteropod (swimming snail) shell over 45 days in seawater at pH and carbonate levels projected for 2100 (Blue Ribbon Panel 2012). Under these conditions, calcifiers must expend more energy to build and maintain their shells, skeletons, or other hard body parts, resulting in reduced energy allocation for growth, reproduction, and coping with other environmental stressors (Feely et al. 2014). Although species vary in their sensitivity to OA, organisms with more soluble forms of calcium carbonate in their shells or skeletons (e.g., aragonite), including many juvenile shellfish, are more sensitive than those with less soluble mineral forms of calcium carbonate (Kroeker et al. 2010). Additionally, shellfish larva exposed to OA can exhibit \"carry-over\" effects (e.g., reduced growth rates) into adulthood (Feely et al. 2014). Some shellfish hatcheries (e.g., Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery, Oregon coast; Taylor Shellfish, Puget Sound's Hood Canal) and shellfish growing areas (e.g., Willapa Bay, Washington coast) in the Pacific Northwest have already experienced oyster larvae die-offs as a result of corrosive seawater. As corrosive events in surface waters become more frequent and longer duration, shellfish on tribally-owned tidelands and throughout the Lummi Nation's Usual and Accustomed (U&A) areas will become increasingly vulnerable to OA, placing the Lummi Schelangen and treaty-protected resources at risk. The impacts of OA will be observed across the entire marine food web. For example, decreasing abundance of species at the base of the food web, like the pteropod pictured in Figure 4.10, will have implications for species at higher trophic levels. Similarly, decreasing abundance of predatory and/or keystone species, such as sea urchins (OA disrupts egg fertilization), may significantly impact community structure and function. Furthermore, it bears mention that toxin production in some algal species associated with harmful algal blooms (HABs) is positively correlated with increasing OA (Moore 2008). Ingestion or contact with these toxins can result in paralytic shellfish poisoning, amnesic shellfish poisoning, diarrheic shellfish poisoning, and other poisoning syndromes in humans and other animals. Shellfish harvest areas in Lummi Bay, Portage Bay, and some of the Lummi Nation's U&A areas (e.g., Semiahmoo, Birch Bay, Squalicum Harbor) already face temporary closures during the spring and summer due to toxicity levels that are unsafe for human consumption. Additional or prolonged closure of shellfish beds could further restrict commercial, ceremonial, and subsistence harvests. The consequences of increasing sea surface temperature are also far reaching. Warmer waters may alternatively enhance or reduce the growth, reproduction, and survival of marine organisms depending on their location and physiological tolerances. Similar to the process of shoreward migration in response to relative sea level rise, some marine species are capable of migrating to new areas to stay within their preferred thermal range. This is evidenced by periods of higher than average ocean temperature along the coast of the Pacific Northwest, when warm-water species (e.g., anchovies, sardines) become more abundant (Dalton 2013). It follows that coldwater species will also need to migrate to higher latitudes as temperatures rise. For species that cannot migrate, species abundance and distribution may decline in response to thermal stress. Additionally, warmer waters have been linked with the increasing frequency, duration, and distribution of harmful algal blooms (HABs) (Moore et al. 2008). For example, Alexandrium catenella is a dinoflagellate associated with paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) in the Puget Sound that grows best at temperatures above 13 \u00b0C. As sea surface temperatures increases by 2 \u00b0C, 4 \u00b0C, and 6 \u00b0C, the annual window of opportunity for A. catenella growth is expected to expand beyond the historical average (68 days, shaded region), by 69 days, 127 days, and 191 days respectively (Moore et al. 2008;Figure 4.11). As a result, the closure of shellfish beds may not be restricted to the late summer months (July-August), but may begin sooner and end later depending on toxicity levels.  Forests provide valuable ecosystem goods and services including fish and wildlife habitat, soil stabilization, carbon sequestration, and provision of clean air and clean water. Traditional uses of forest ecosystems by the Lummi People include activities such as gathering cedar (wood and bark), berries, and medicinal plants and hunting large and small game. As the climate changes, the provision of these ecosystem goods and services may be at risk. Warmer and drier summers in the Puget Sound region are generally expected to increase water demand deficits and subsequently alter forest type, increase wildfire activity, and increase the incidence of insect infestation and disease. The potential effects of climate change on the Lummi Nations forest resources, both on and off-Reservation, are discussed below."}, {"section_title": "Forest Resources", "text": "The forest resources sector is divided into three planning areas: forest type, wildfire, and insects and disease.

The LNR Forestry Division is responsible for wildfire prevention (e.g., issues burn bans and burn permits) on the Reservation and shares the responsibility of wildland firefighting with the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and local Whatcom County Fire Districts. It is important that the LNR maintain and improve fire response capabilities not only by continuing with firefighter training and equipment maintenance, but also by obtaining additional funding to address identified program needs. For instance, the MHMP (2010) suggested inventorying alternative firefighting water sources and encouraging the development of additional sources, such as water storage facilities with fire-resistant electrical pump systems in developments outside of fire protection districts that are not connected to community water or hydrant system. 3. Implement forest practices that minimize wildfire risk. Although standard fire prevention measures such as mechanical thinning and prescribed burning are typically ineffective in west-side forests when applied across large geographic areas, targeted application of these measures may be used to reduce the risk of severe wildfire disturbance at finer scales (Dalton et al. 2013). If these forest practices are employed, they should be undertaken in a manner consistent with the goals of promoting climate-resilient ecological management. 1.

In the short-term, vegetation that is \"water-limited\" may experience decreased growth and reproduction and increased disease and mortality (Dalton et al. 2013). For example, decreasing growth is expected for Douglas fir, western red cedar, western hemlock, and Sitka spruce in low elevation forests west of the Cascade Range crest (\"west-side\") as the climate warms (Peterson 2014). Conversely, high elevation west-side forests are typically energy-limited rather than water-limited, and the growth of species such as subalpine fir, mountain hemlock, and lodgepole pine may increase as the growing season lengthens. In the long-term, species that are drought-sensitive, such as western red cedar and Sitka spruce, may be forced to migrate to more climatically suitable areas. In the Pacific Northwest, this species migration typically means moving to higher latitudes, higher elevations, or protected microclimates (i.e., refugial habitats "}, {"section_title": "Wildfire", "text": "Wildfire has been and will continue to be an important factor in shaping forest ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest. Historically, fire regimes in Washington State west of the Cascade Range crest (\"west-side\") are characterized by low frequency (200-500 year return interval) but high severity fires (e.g., stand-replacing fires), although high frequency/low severity fires do still occur (e.g., understory fires) (Rogers et al. 2011). The Reservation has not experienced a standreplacing fire, which occur under rare conditions of drought and high winds, in the past 100 years, but does experience between 1 and 4 small wildfires each year that are typically caused by fireworks or abandoned fire pits (LNR 2011). In this region, warmer and drier summers are expected to decrease fuel moisture, while warmer and wetter winters are expected to promote vegetation growth and consequently increase fuel availability. With more abundant and highly flammable fuels, an increasing annual burn area is anticipated (Dalton et al. 2013). Meanwhile, the earlier onset of spring snowmelt is expected to increase the length of the fire season (Dalton et al. 2013). Although it is difficult to forecast future wildfire activity, the results of one model simulating the response of wildfire in west-side forests under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario suggest that the area burned annually may increase by 150 to 1,000 percent by the 2080s when compared to the 1970-2000 average (Rogers et al. 2011). It should be noted that because of the low annual area burned in west-side forests, the statistical relationships between climate and fire have a high level of uncertainty and less explanatory power compared to eastside models where frequent fire activity provides sufficient data to build predictive relationships (Littell et al. 2010). Regardless, significant consequences will result from changes in wildfire activity. The primary concerns with wildfire activity on the Reservation are protecting human health and safety and preventing property damage. This is of particular concern where residences and workplaces are located in forested areas or along the urban-wildland interface. Fire protection services on the Reservation are provided by Whatcom County Fire District #8 (Marietta Fire District), Fire District #17 (Sandy Point District), and Fire District #7 (Ferndale District). For February 2016 wildland fire suppression, the Lummi Nation has a cooperative agreement with the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR), which allows the state agency to respond to wildfires on the Reservation. The Lummi Natural Resources Department (LNR) also maintains firefighting equipment and current training so that certified staff members are available to respond to and/or assist other first responders with wildfire suppression. If wildfire occurs as the result of timber harvest operations on the Reservation, the purchaser or logging operator is financially and legally responsible for all fire suppression actions necessary to contain wildfires caused by their own activities. To protect the Reservation from wildfires, a burn ban is implemented most years that is usually consistent with the Whatcom County burn ban. The implications of degraded air quality from smoke and particulate pollution that results from wildfires on human health will be discussed in Section 4.6 -Human Health. Finally, other impacts to Reservation residents include property damages and diminished economic opportunity (e.g., harvestable timber units burned). The ecological consequences of climate-driven changes in wildfire activity are also of concern to the Lummi Nation. Unfortunately, the lack of available information on how climate change will affect west-side fire regimes, which includes not only area burned but also fire intensity and impact severity, makes it difficult to accurately forecast how forest ecosystems will respond to changing conditions (e.g., changing structure, function, composition, distribution). If fire regimes change significantly, it is reasonable to expect that impacts from wildfire may overwhelm the gradual shifts in forest structure and function discussed above. As forests change, so too will habitat availability and suitability. Increased wildfire activity will likely favor species that are adapted to post-burn conditions (\"fire-specialists\"; e.g., woodpecker species), while population declines may be expected in species associated with late successional or old-growth forests (e.g., spotted owl, marbled murrelet) (Dalton et al. 2013). This may result in a loss of biodiversity and/or local species extinction. A significant negative consequence of increased burn area is the increased potential for sediment erosion and runoff into freshwater systems. The impacts of increased sedimentation in the Nooksack River watershed are discussed in Section 4.2.1 -Freshwater."}, {"section_title": "Landslides", "text": "Climate change may increase the risk of landslides by affecting several of the factors that influence slope stability (e.g., precipitation, soil moisture, erosion, vegetation coverage). Although most of the Reservation is at no or minimal risk of slope failure (LWRD 2010), there are some areas, particularly along coastal bluffs, that are at significant risk of damage due to landslides. In areas where past landslides occurred along the Lummi Peninsula shoreline (e.g., Lummi Shore Road, West Beach), wave-caused erosion along the base of the bluff, saturated soils from periods of heavy or prolonged rainfall, and/or poor storm water drainage associated with development at the top of the bluff contributed to slope failure. Bluff erosion was previously discussed in the context of sea level rise impacts on coastal resources, but it also bears mention that climate change induced variations in precipitation patterns are also likely to increase landslide risk in already vulnerable areas of the Reservation. In the upper reaches of the Nooksack River watershed where there is more topographic relief, increasing landslide activity due to climate change is also a large concern. Slope stability in these areas will not only be affected by wetter winters, an increasing frequency of heavy rainfall events, and more precipitation falling as rain rather that snow, but also bank undercutting associated with more severe winter flooding and reduced vegetation coverage resulting from wildfire, insect damage, and/or disease."}, {"section_title": "Insects and Diseases", "text": "Climate is an important driver of insect infestation and disease outbreak in forested ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest. Drought stress typically increases host vulnerability by decreasing a tree's capacity to repel attack, while warmer temperatures increase the survival and geographic distribution of some forest insects and diseases. Forest insects and diseases of concern in the western United States include mountain pine beetle, spruce budworm, and Swiss needle cast (Dalton et al. 2013). While most insect and disease problems in Washington State are occurring on the east side of the Cascade Range crest, west-side forests may become increasingly vulnerable over time. Currently, fungus rots and root rots are commonly observed in Reservation forests, but no other significant disease or insect problems have been detected (LNR 2011). If climate-induced insect and disease problems do arise on the Reservation, increased tree mortality can be expected to increase wildfire vulnerability."}, {"section_title": "Fish, Wildlife, and Traditional Use Plants", "text": "The 1855 Treaty of Point Elliot reserves the right of the Lummi People to take fish at the tribe's Usual and Accustomed (U&A) grounds and stations and to hunt and gather on all open and unclaimed lands. Access to a sufficient quantity and quality of these treaty-protected resources is vital to the Lummi Schelangen (\"way of life\"). Commercial, ceremonial, and subsistence finfish and shellfish harvest supports tribal member's livelihoods, preserves cultural practices, and provides sustenance for individuals and families. In fact, the Lummi Nation is the largest fishing tribe in the Salish Sea in terms of pounds of fish landed and number of species fished (NWIFC 2012). The Lummi are known as the \"salmon people\" and, as found by the U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Winans (1905) which ruled on another \"Stevens Treaty\" (an Indian Treaty that is essentially the same as the Treaty of Point Elliot), fishing to Indians is \"not much more necessary than air they breathe.\" Hunting and gathering also support individual and community health and wellness. As Lynn et al. (2013) adeptly describe: \"The indigenous relationship between food and people is intimately tied to the cultural, physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual health of tribal communities. Traditional foods [\u2026] provide not only sustenance, but also cultural connections through storytelling, ceremonies, harvesting, processing, and sharing of food resources.\" This section provides an overview of potential climate change impacts to fish, wildlife, and plant species (food and non-food) that hold significant social, cultural, and economic value to the Lummi Nation. The fish, wildlife, and traditional use plants sector is divided into five planning areas: salmon, forage fish, shellfish, upland wildlife, and plants (terrestrial and aquatic). Vulnerability rankings developed for potential climate change impacts to each of these planning areas are provided in Table 4.4. February 2016 \nAs discussed in Section 4.5 -Fish, Wildlife, and Traditional Use Plants, climate change impacts on salmon, shellfish, and upland plants and wildlife are of particular concern to the Lummi Nation. Several adaptation goals and strategies addressing climate change impacts on these species are presented in this section (Table 5.6). Adaptation Goal D-1: Protect and restore a harvestable surplus of salmon for the Lummi People. Adaptation Strategies: 1. Reduce existing stressors to salmon populations. Existing stressors to salmon populations include habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation; water of insufficient quantity and quality; alteration of historical disturbance regimes (e.g., flood regime, sediment regime); and historical overharvest. Cumulatively, these stressors have caused significant declines in salmon populations and reduced the resilience of salmon to future disturbances, including climate change. It is widely recognized that reducing existing stressors (e.g., preventing and reversing habitat destruction, replacing undersized culverts and other barriers to migration, preventing pollution, restoring instream flows) is necessary for the recovery of Pacific salmon.  Beechie et al. (2012) also evaluated the efficacy of different restoration actions to ameliorate the impacts of climate change and increase salmon resilience in the face of these changes. Their findings indicate that some restoration methods are more likely than others to achieve and sustain multiple benefits for salmon over the long-term, these methods include restoring longitudinal, lateral, and vertical connectivity and restoring stream flow regimes. Table 5.5 identifies restoration actions and their ability to ameliorate climate change effects (Beechie et al. 2012). One of the core principles behind these findings is that increasing habitat diversity serves to increase diversity in salmon, which may increase the resilience of salmon populations to climate change. This conclusion is supported by other researchers, including Wade et al. (2013) who state: \"Steelhead and salmon have evolved for millions of years and have long thrived under changing climatic conditions when provided access to a connected array of varied habitats that support genetic and life history diversity.\" It should be noted that some restoration actions evaluated by Beechie et al. (2012), such as instream rehabilitation (e.g., adding large woody debris, adding spawning gravel, recreating meanders), were determined to have context-dependent effects pertaining to climate change; this does not negate the positive outcomes of such actions on improving ecological conditions (e.g., increasing salmon habitat and production) over the near-term. Adaptation Goal D-2: Protect and restore a harvestable surplus of shellfish for the Lummi People. Adaptation Strategies: 1. Improve water quality in shellfish harvest areas. Degraded water quality can negatively impact shellfish population health and/or make shellfish unsafe for human consumption. For instance, Lummi shellfish beds in portions of Portage Bay were closed to ceremonial, subsistence, and commercial harvest from 1996-2006 (735 total acres affected, includes intertidal and subtidal) and again from September 2014 to the present (496 total acres affected, includes intertidal and subtidal, as of December 31, 2014) after concentrations of fecal coliform bacteria were measured in excess of federal National Shellfish Sanitation Program (NSSP) standards. The 1996-2006 closure was largely attributed to poor dairy waste management practices in the Nooksack River watershed. In response to this closure, federal and state agencies increased compliance inspections and a new state law was enacted that required the development and implementation of nutrient management plans (a.k.a., farm plans) throughout Whatcom County. As a result of these actions, additional water quality monitoring, and improved inter-agency coordination, water quality improved in the Nooksack River and over the shellfish growing area which led to the eventual reopening of the shellfish harvest areas. The current shellfish area downgrade illustrates that increased enforcement and other actions will again be necessary to achieve and sustain federal, state, and Lummi Nation water quality standards. Resources Division (LWRD) implements an ambient water quality monitoring program that samples fresh and marine waters on the Reservation. Continued monitoring and additional monitoring of nutrients will enhance our understanding of local water quality status and trends. 3. Maintain and expand shellfish enhancement on tribal tidelands. The Lummi Bay Shellfish Hatchery is responsible for propagating and restocking tribal tidelands with manila clam seed (20 million seed) and oyster spat (3,000 cultch bags) annually. The hatchery also produces and sells geoduck seed to offset operation costs. These enhancement activities should be continued to support tribal harvest and may be expanded in response to climate change. For example, seeding or transplanting oysters and clams into new areas that are more likely to be successful as sea levels rise (i.e., assisted migration) may maintain opportunities for tribal harvest. Other actions such as enhancing the substrate of shellfish beds may also help maintain tribal shellfish harvesting opportunities."}, {"section_title": "Salmon", "text": "All five species of Pacific salmon (Chinook, sockeye, coho, pink, and chum) and three other salmonid species (steelhead trout, cutthroat trout, and bull trout) are found in the Nooksack River. However, salmon runs today are estimated to be less than ten percent of what they were in the 1850s. Furthermore, the North Fork/Middle Fork Nooksack River spring Chinook salmon and the South Fork Nooksack River spring Chinook salmon have been listed as threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) since 1999. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) identified Puget Sound/Strait of Georgia coho salmon as a species of concern in 1997. Existing stressors to salmon populations include habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation; water of insufficient quantity and quality; alteration of historical disturbance regimes (e.g., flood regime, sediment regime); and historical overharvest. Cumulatively, these stressors have caused significant declines in salmon populations (e.g., abundance, productivity, genetic diversity, life history diversity) and reduced the resilience of salmon to future disturbances. Many of stressors that are negatively affecting salmon today will be exacerbated under future climate scenarios. Given salmon and steelhead's anadromous lifecycle and population-specific life histories, climate change impacts will vary depending on which species, population, and life stage is under consideration (Figure 4.12, Beechie et al. 2012). For example, \"stream-type\" Chinook salmon rear in freshwater habitats for one to two years before migrating to the sea, whereas \"ocean-type\" Chinook migrate to estuarine habitats within a few months of hatching. As a result, stream-type and ocean-type Chinook will be distinctively vulnerable to climate change impacts on freshwater and estuarine habitats given the particulars of their life history strategies (Beechie et al. 2012). A brief introduction to climate change impacts in freshwater, estuarine, and marine environments and the probable consequences to salmon are presented below. Climate change is expected to increase stream temperatures, decrease summer low flows, and increase winter high flows in watersheds like the Nooksack River basin. Warmer stream temperatures can decrease the survival of salmon and other cold-water fish species by increasing thermal stress and the probability of fish kills, creating barriers to migration, altering the timing of migration, reducing habitat connectivity and the availability of cold water refugia, increasing the spread of disease, and favoring native or non-native warm-water fish that may compete with or prey on salmon (Mantua et al. 2010, Beechie et al. 2012. Generally, prolonged exposure to temperatures above approximately 21\u00b0C is lethal to salmon. More precise temperature thresholds that are specific to each species at different life stages are presented in Table 4.5 (Beechie et al. 2012). Some studies have suggested that higher stream productivity resulting from warmer waters may benefit salmon; however, this potential benefit is likely outweighed by the aforementioned negative consequences. Low instream flows during the summer months can create physical barriers to migration, decrease habitat availability, and contribute to increasing stream temperatures. Finally, high stream flows during the winter months can scour redds or clog them with fine sediments and prematurely displace fry downstream (especially in areas without off-channel habitat). In marine and estuarine habitats, salmon may be affected by habitat loss resulting from sea level rise and coastal erosion, increasing sea surface temperatures, and changes in food web structure as a consequence of ocean acidification. Unlike the freshwater life stages, there is relatively scarce information available to assess the marine survival of salmon under current and future climate conditions. One way to try to better understand some of these future climate change impacts is to look at how salmon respond to anomalous conditions that occur from time to time as result of natural variability inherent in the earth's climate system. For example, an unusually warm area of water (a.k.a., \"the Warm Blob\") that was about 2-4 \u00b0C warmer than normal formed and persisted in the northeast Pacific Ocean in 2013-2014 (Bond 2015, OWSC 2015. Although there was no evidence of a direct connection between the Warm Blob and climate change, the Warm Blob did provide some insight as to how a warmer ocean might impact fisheries. The warm waters of the Warm Blob may have been the reason why most of the Fraser River sockeye returned through the Johnstone Strait rather than going around the outside of Vancouver Island and passing through the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the summer of 2014. In a typical run year, sockeye migrate through the Johnstone Strait and the Strait of Juan de Fuca in roughly similar proportions, giving Lummi fishers better access to the migrating salmon. In addition to potential effects on salmon migration routes, there were also concerns about how the Warm Blob might impact zooplankton communities, which could have an impact the diets of salmon. However, as stated by the NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC): \"Major impacts [of the Warm Blob] on commercially important salmonid fisheries will not be known for a year or two but early signs suggest that for some salmon stocks, the warm water was not harmful (NOAA 2015).\" It is also important to note that production at the Lummi Nation's three salmon hatcheries, the Skookum Creek Hatchery, Lummi Bay Hatchery, and Sandy Point Hatchery, which are necessary to maintain a harvestable surplus of salmon for the Lummi People, are likely to be negatively affected by climate change impacts, particularly those related to water quantity and water quality. Hatchery operations require a reliable supply of high quality water to maximize salmon production, and when problems of insufficient water quantity and/or quality arise there can be lasting effects on hatchery programs. For example, Skookum Creek Hatchery staff were forced to develop and implement a contingency plan to reduce juvenile coho salmon production at the facility by 20 percent in 2015 due to a lack of water availability (i.e., low instream flows in Skookum Creek; Washington State Governor declared drought in the Nooksack River basin February 2016 Note that the riverine/estuarine life history phases (white boxes) are shown to scale, but the ocean life history phase (grey box) is not to scale (e.g., Chinook salmon typically spend 2-4 years in the ocean, coho salmon typically spend 1.5 years in the ocean) on April 17, 2015) and associated poor water quality (i.e., high temperature, low dissolved oxygen). As this example demonstrates, the water supply at the Skookum Creek Hatchery is already vulnerable during drought and/or low summer streamflow, both of which are expected to become more frequent with climate change. Similarly, production at the Lummi Bay hatchery would be jeopardized if the water supply and/or water intake system from the Nooksack River at the Marine Drive Bridge were rendered inadequate. It also bears mention that hatcheries are particularly vulnerable to water quality degradation, climate-induced or otherwise, because of the high density rearing conditions under which salmon are raised to meet production goals."}, {"section_title": "Forage Fish", "text": "Forage fish are relatively small fish species that are the prey base for a wide variety of other marine organisms (e.g., salmon, mammals, birds). Forage fish are also harvested for ceremonial, subsistence, and commercial purposes. The primary forage fish species that occur on or near the Reservation include Pacific herring, sandlance, surf smelt, longfin smelt (a.k.a., \"hooligans\"), and anchovy. Accelerated sea level rise may inundate forage fish spawning habitat (herring use eelgrass meadows in Lummi Bay and Portage Bay; sandlance and surf smelt use estuarine beaches along Bellingham Bay, Portage Bay, Hale Passage, and the Strait of Georgia) unless vertical accretion keeps pace with rising sea levels or shoreward migration preserves habitat area."}, {"section_title": "Shellfish", "text": "Commercial, ceremonial, and subsistence shellfish harvest are essential to the Lummi Schelangen (\"way of life\"). Due to the decline in salmon availability, commercial Dungeness crab harvest has provided the largest percentage of annual fishery revenue in the Lummi Nation for at least the past 15 years despite year-to-year variability in catch. Even in 2010 when there was a record Fraser River sockeye run, the landed value of all salmon species combined was $6.3 million while the landed value of Dungeness crab was $4.3 million. Other important commercial shellfish species include sea cucumber, geoduck, spot shrimp, and manila clam. Ceremonial and subsistence harvests often include Dungeness crab, spot shrimp, manila clam, butter clam, and Pacific oyster. To support shellfish harvests, the Lummi Bay Shellfish Hatchery produces Pacific oyster spat and manila clam seed for tribal tideland enhancement, while also producing and selling geoduck seed to partially support operation costs. Climate change impacts on shellfish include decreased growth and survival as a result of ocean acidification, habitat loss as a result of inundation from sea level rise, and thermal stress as a result of warmer sea surface temperatures. Furthermore, the expected increasing incidence and toxicity of harmful algal blooms (HABs) may limit or eliminate the opportunity for harvest of some filter feeding shellfish species. Given the severity of potential climate change impacts, the Pacific Shellfish Institute has instituted a water chemistry monitoring program at the Lummi Bay Shellfish Hatchery. Monitoring equipment is located at one site in the Seapond aquaculture facility and one site within the hatchery. Over the period of record (2011 to present), there has been no detectable change in pH or temperature in waters tested in the Seapond that could be attributed to anthropogenic climate change or that were outside of the range of natural variability (e.g., seasonal change, tidal change) (Suhrbier 2014). Continued monitoring is necessary to further refine the range of current conditions and ensure early detection of potential future problems.

As species are lost from their historical range, the Lummi People may lose access to plants with significant cultural value. Additionally, the timing of important life history events (a.k.a., phenology; e.g., spring bud burst, start of migration) is changing with the climate. For example, a Jamestown S'Klallam tribal member has reported that, in her experience, the optimal time to harvest cedar bark for weaving traditional baskets has shifted to earlier in the spring (Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe 2013).

This section discusses how climate change may affect morbidity (i.e., illness) and mortality (i.e., death) in the Pacific Northwest. It is important to note that the Pacific Northwest is expected to remain a relatively safe place to live, especially when compared to some other regions of the United States and the world. Also, some populations will be more vulnerable to these health impacts than others; at-risk populations generally include the young, the elderly, the sick, and the poor. The human health sector is divided into seven planning areas: heat-related illness, health effects related to extreme weather events, respiratory disease, infectious disease, harmful algal blooms (HABs), food insecurity, and mental health. Vulnerability rankings developed for potential climate change impacts to each of these planning areas are provided in Table 4.6.\nAs discussed in Section 4.6 -Human Health, some of the primary impacts of climate change on human health are an increasing incidence of heat-related illness, injury from extreme weather events, respiratory disease, infectious disease, poisoning from harmful algal blooms, food insecurity, and mental health problems. One adaptation goal and several adaptation strategies addressing these climate change impacts are presented in this section (Table 5.7). Adaptation Goal E-1: Improve community health. resources security, cultural use, education, self determination, and well-being (Donatuto et al. 2014;Swinomish 2010), into community health assessments. The intent of this approach is to broaden the scope of a standard assessment, which is usually focused on \"individual, physiological health,\" to include aspects of \"community-scale, social, cultural, and mental health\" that are also important to individual and tribal wellbeing (Donatuto et al. 2014). 2. Improve and expand healthcare services to meet anticipated increased demand. The aforementioned climate-induced health risks are expected to increase demand for healthcare services, adding additional stress to already overburdened providers. The Lummi Health Clinic provides many health services to Lummi tribal members and other American Indians and Alaska Natives, including medical, dental, mental, and public health services. There is a recognized need to improve and expand these services and the clinic is currently developing or planning several projects to strengthen patient care services for community members (e.g., establishing a Community Medicine Department, increasing the number of exam rooms, increasing the number of providers, providing physical therapy, expanding preventative healthcare services). These and similar improvements are recommended to increase the capacity of the clinic to serve the Lummi People and improve the provision of essential healthcare services. 3. Help individuals prepare for potential climate-related health risks by providing public outreach and education. Increasing public awareness of and preparation for climaterelated health risks is an important step toward reducing the negative health outcomes that may result from climate change. Because climate change is expected to exacerbate existing health problems, targeting already vulnerable populations, such as the sick or elderly, may be particularly effective initial approach. 2.

Heat-related illness includes, from low to high severity, heat rash, heat syncope (fainting), heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke (Dalton et al. 2013). Heat stroke can be life-threatening. Extreme heat events are also associated with increases in heart attacks and strokes and may worsen existing health conditions in individuals with respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, or kidney failure (Dalton et al. 2013). In addition to the vulnerable populations described in the previous section, outdoor workers (e.g., construction workers, fishermen) are particularly susceptible to heat-related illness."}, {"section_title": "Health Effects Related to Extreme Weather Events", "text": "Projected increases in the extent, frequency, and/or intensity of extreme weather events such as storms, floods, and wildfires, will have severe direct and indirect consequences for human health. For example, more intense winter flooding will directly increase the likelihood of injury and drowning, while drinking water contamination, hazardous materials spills, and reduced indoor air quality from mold growth may also affect human health. As another example, larger wildfires pose immediate threats to human safety; meanwhile, exposure to wildfire-generated particulate matter can increase the incidence of respiratory problems such as asthma, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Nation Integrated Solid Waste Management Plan (2014) will reduce pollution from stoves and trash burning. The current and future contributions of heavy industry to air quality on the Reservation cannot be readily assessed, but should not be discounted without implementation of an ambient air quality monitoring program. As introduced previously, wildfire-generated particulate matter is expected to reduce air quality in the future if the area burned by wildfire in the vicinity of the Reservation increases. Another air quality concern has to do with pollen and seasonal allergies. Under future climate conditions, plants are expected to increase pollen production and the growing season is expected to lengthen, both of which may contribute to more severe and longer lasting allergy symptoms (Dalton et al. 2013). In other regions of the United States, ground-level ozone production (i.e., smog) is expected to increase during the summer months as a result of warmer air temperatures and air stagnation; however, this is not anticipated to be a significant problem in the Pacific Northwest, particularly in rural areas such as the Reservation (Dalton et al. 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Infectious Disease", "text": "Climate influences the type, distribution, and transmission of vector-borne, water-borne, and fungal diseases and a changing climate may increase the potential for illness and death resulting from some infectious diseases (CIG 2013). Although not an exhaustive list, several examples are provided below. It is important to note that the risk of a major epidemic in the United States is unlikely given continued maintenance and improvement of existing public health infrastructure (Dalton et al. 2013). First, it is hypothesized that the spread of West Nile virus, a vector-borne disease transmitted by mosquitoes, from New York State in 1999 to Washington State in 2002 was facilitated by warmer than average temperatures over that time period (Dalton et al. 2013). Although the West Nile virus is a potentially dangerous threat to public health, it is important to keep the threat of West Nile virus in perspective: only 47 cases of infection were reported in Washington between 2002 and 2014 and disease activity in the state has been in decline since it peaked in 2009 (DOH 2014). The incidence of other vector-borne disease (e.g., Lyme disease, hantavirus, malaria, dengue) are typically low in the PNW and are not currently considered a high risk (Dalton et al. 2013).

When toxin concentrations reach levels that are unsafe for human consumption, shellfish beds are closed to harvest until the risk abates.

Any reduction in the availability of these foods, whether from climate change (e.g., habitat loss, species range shifts, environmental disturbance) or from other anthropogenic impacts, places the health of Lummi tribal members at risk. The most obvious consequences of food insecurity are the physical and mental symptoms of malnutrition. Sometimes more difficult to trace are the social and cultural impacts, which are important aspects of community health.

It is also recognized that poor mental health can have physical repercussions. As described by Dalton et al.

Vulnerability rankings developed for potential climate change impacts to each of these planning areas are provided in Table 4.7. \nAs discussed in Section 4.7 -Emergency Services, the primary impact of climate change on emergency services is an increasing demand for services in response to environmental and civil emergencies that arise from or are exacerbated by climate change impacts, including extreme weather events, coastal and riverine flooding, and wildfire. One adaptation goal and several adaptation strategies addressing these climate change impacts are presented in this section (Table  5.8). Adaptation Goal F-1: Improve emergency planning and preparedness. Adaptation Strategies: 1. Increase the capacity of the Lummi Nation to respond to climate-related emergencies. The recommendations of this report in regards to emergency services are consistent with those identified in the Lummi Nation Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan (2010). These recommendations include: (1) establish a Lummi Nation Division of Emergency Management within the Lummi Nation Police Department and hire an Emergency Manager, (2) continue to update and implement the Lummi Nation Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan, (3) maintain the Multi-Hazard Mitigation Team, and (4) coordinate hazard planning and emergency response efforts with other appropriate jurisdictions and agencies. Emergency management planners can effectively integrate anticipated climate change impacts into programs designed to address current hazards. 2. Provide public education and outreach to inform residents of potential climate change impacts and ways to prepare for these impacts. Increasing public awareness of climate change impacts empowers individuals to take steps toward protecting themselves and their families in the event of climate-related emergencies. Outreach activities may build on efforts already underway as part of the Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan (2010), such as promoting the establishment and maintenance of 72 hour emergency survival kits, sponsoring Safe Streets Walks to promote community disaster awareness, and providing informational brochures and online resources. 1.

The Police Department also works with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Washington State Patrol, the Whatcom County Sheriff's Department, and other law enforcement agencies as appropriate. For instance, the Police Department has jurisdiction over all members of federally recognized tribes on the Reservation, while the Whatcom County Sheriff's Department has jurisdiction when an offense is committed on the Reservation by a person who is not a member of a federally recognized tribe or if the offense is committed on non-member owned fee land. The FBI investigates major crimes that are committed on trust land or member-owned fee land by members of federally recognized tribes.

Although there are many aspects of cultural resources that are appropriate to share publicly, such as the importance of salmon and shellfish harvest to the Lummi Schelangen (\"way of life\"), there is some information that needs to be kept confidential, such as the location of recorded historical cultural sites. Confidentiality is partly due to traditional Lummi values towards sacred and otherwise meaningful sites, and partly to prevent looting or other disturbance. Where it was appropriate to do so, potential climate change impacts to the Lummi Nation's cultural resources were introduced in previous sections. The purpose of reiterating this information here is to draw attention to the importance of the Lummi Nation's cultural resources and Traditional Cultural Properties (TCPs) and to consolidate this information into a clear and succinct summary of potential climate change impacts; more detailed information can be found in Section 4.2 -Water Resources, Section 4.3 -Coastal Resources, Section 4.4 -Forest Resources, and Section 4.5 -Fish, Wildlife, and Traditional Use Plants. The cultural resources of the Lummi Nation are administered and protected by the Cultural Resources Department in accordance with the Cultural Resources Preservation Code (LCL Title 40). The term \"Cultural Resources\" under LCL Title 40 includes culturally significant sites and is defined as follows: \"Cultural Resources in the traditional view of Lummi includes, but is not limited to, four major category types: language, including traditional named places and Oral History or Tradition; traditional cultural properties; historic sites; and archeological resources. 'Cultural Resources' also means any material remains of past, present, or future human life or activities which are of historic significance, and/or cultural or archeological interest. Such material includes, but is not to be limited to: pottery, basketry, weapons, weapon projectiles; tools, structures or portions of structures, pit houses, rock paintings, rock carvings, intaglios, talus slide depressions, cairns, sea caves, inland caves, graves, human skeletal remains, or any portion or piece thereof, whether or not found in a cultural resource context.\" There are several potential climate change impacts to the cultural resources of the Lummi Nation. To begin, accelerated sea level rise and coastal erosion may lead to the loss of or damage to coastal burial sites and human remains, loss of or damage to other coastal archaeological sites and artifacts, and a decreased accessibility to or availability of traditional use plants and animals (e.g., shellfish harvest areas). Shoreline erosion is already a key concern of the Cultural Resources Department, which currently invests significant staff time to inventory and monitor cultural resources that are degraded or exposed by wave action. In upland areas, an increased area burned by wildfire may lead to the loss of or damage to upland archaeological sites, artifacts, and traditional use plants and animals. Changes in climate are also expected to induce species range shifts, which may lead to the loss of traditional use plants and animals either by local extinction or migration outside of the Lummi Nation's Traditional Territories. Meanwhile, changes in the timing of life history events (i.e., phenology) may subsequently affect the timing of some traditional practices (e.g., western red cedar bark harvest). Salmon and shellfish harvest, which are vital to the Lummi Schelangen (\"way of life\"), will be affected by a range of climate change impacts. In particular, salmon species will be affected by decreasing food and habitat availability (e.g., from ocean acidification and sea level rise, respectively), increasing stream temperatures, and altered streamflow, among others. While impacts to shellfish species will largely stem from ocean acidification, sea level rise, and increasing sea surface temperatures. It is reasonable to expect that unforeseen and/or synergetic climate change impacts can and probably will occur in the future. Additionally, in Lummi culture, everything is interconnected. Impacts on salmon are not independent of impacts on forest resources or impacts on coastal resources or impacts on human health or any other aspect of life; if salmon are impacted by climate change, so too will be everything else. It should also be recognized that cultural resources are irreplaceable and the integrity of cultural resources is extremely delicate. When cultural resources are damaged or destroyed, they cannot be renewed, replanted, relocated, or replicated; when they are gone, they are gone forever. Due to the sensitive nature of cultural resources, specific planning areas are not presented in this report. Generally, the vulnerability ranking for potential climate change impacts to cultural resources is high (Table 4. \nAs discussed in Section 4.8 -Cultural Resources, some of the potential impacts of climate change on cultural resources are damage or loss due to accelerated sea level rise, coastal erosion, wildfire, and/or species range shifts, as well as potential decreases in the abundance and survival of salmon and shellfish. One adaptation goal and two adaptation strategies addressing these climate change impacts are presented in this section (Table 5.8). Adaptation Goal G-1: Preserve and protect the Lummi Nation's cultural resources. 2. Explore the use of Traditional Knowledge (TK) in the context of climate change. One definition of Traditional Knowledge (TK) is that TK is \"a cumulative body of knowledge, practice, and belief, evolving by adaptive processes and handed down through generations by cultural transmission, about the relationship of living beings (including humans) with one another and with their environment (NCA 2014).\" The potential use of TK to inform climate change assessments and adaption planning has recently received significant attention nationally and internationally. Although the potential benefits of applied TK are widely recognized, it is important that any use of TK be managed to ensure proper protection of tribal cultural resources. As summarized by Dalton et al. (2013), \"traditional knowledge can inform tribal and non-tribal understanding of how climate change may impact tribal resources and traditional ways of life. However, its use in climate change initiatives should ensure respect for the values associated with these knowledge systems and protection of sacred knowledge and wisdom, and give tribes decision-making authority over how traditional knowledge is used.\" A recent publication, Guidelines for Considering Traditional Knowledges in Climate Change Initiatives (2014), was developed by tribal and non-tribal participants in the Climate and Traditional Knowledges Workgroup (CTKW) as a framework to guide appropriate use of TK in the context of climate change. This resource may be useful to the Lummi Nation as climate change planning efforts advance. 2.

These efforts include the classification and regulation of land use districts to ensure orderly growth and protection of the political, economic, social, cultural, and physical integrity of the Lummi Nation. Several aspects of land use management were discussed in Section 4.2 -Water Resources, Section 4.3 -Coastal Resources, and Section 4.4 -Forest Resources and will not be reiterated here. Instead, this section provides a brief overview of potential climate change impacts to designated land uses (e.g., residential development, commercial development, mixed use development, agriculture) and land management concerns (e.g., floodplain infrastructure, hazardous materials sites) that have been outside of the scope of previous sections. The land use sector is divided into five planning areas: floodplain infrastructure, residential development, commercial and mixed use development, agriculture, and hazardous materials sites. Vulnerability rankings developed for potential climate change impacts to each of these planning areas are provided in Table 4.9. \nAs discussed in Section 4.9 -Land Use, some of the primary impacts of climate change on land use are reduced effectiveness of existing floodplain infrastructure and increasing property damages to due to flooding, erosion, and wildfire. Adaptation goals and strategies that specifically address flooding were discussed previously in Section 5.5.1 -Water Resources and Section 5.5.2 -Coastal Resources; likewise, wildfire was addressed in Section 5.5.3 -Forest Resources. Because these topics were already covered, this section focuses more broadly on land use planning. One adaptation goal and two strategies addressing land use planning are presented in this section (Table 5.10). February 2016 infrastructure improvements in recent years. For example, a section of Marine Drive prone to flooding was elevated and a self-regulating tide gate installed to provide underflow as part of the Smuggler's Slough Restoration project. This project was completed in 2011 under the direction of the Lummi Natural Resources Department and was the first step in a long-term strategy to alleviate flooding on all flood-prone stretches of Marine Drive. More information on recommended infrastructure upgrades, such as elevating Slater Road and Haxton Way, can be found in the Lummi Nation Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan. 2. Collaborate with Washington State and Whatcom County on public works projects. As described above, both the Lummi Nation and Whatcom County have invested significant resources in road improvements. When opportunities arise and goals align, it may be mutually beneficial for the tribal government, Washington State, and the county to collaborate on public works projects. Teaming up now will help foster good working relationships and benefit projects that arise in the future. "}, {"section_title": "Floodplain Infrastructure", "text": "One of the prevailing challenges to future land use management on the Reservation will likely stem from the projected increase in the frequency and intensity of coastal and riverine flooding. Flooding in riverine systems is a natural occurrence that results when runoff from rain or snowmelt exceeds the carrying capacity of river channels, ditches, drains, reservoirs, and other water bodies. Flooding in coastal areas is a natural occurrence that results when high tides and/or storm-driven waves overtop naturally created storm berms or man-made shore defense works. In order to discuss residential development, commercial development, mixed use development, agriculture, and hazardous materials sites, it is necessary to first understand the condition of existing floodplain infrastructure and basic characteristics of the current flood regime. Of the approximately 12,500 acres of Reservation uplands, nearly 5,400 acres are designated special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) as determined by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The SFHA is the area expected to be covered by floodwaters during the 100-year flood event. The 100-year flood event is the magnitude of flood that has a 1 percent probability of occurrence during any one year. Similarly, a 50-year flood has a 2 percent probability of occurrence during any year and a 5-year event has a probability of 20 percent. The floodplain infrastructure (e.g., dikes, levees, tide gates) on the Reservation was originally intended to protect agricultural lands against frequent, low magnitude floods. In 1988, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) inventoried the lower Nooksack River levee system and determined that the levees of Diking District No. 1 (south of Ferndale) along the west bank of the Nooksack River provided from less than 5-year to up to 10-year flood protection. Since that time, and in particular following large flood events in the 1990s, significant levee improvements along the west bank of this reach have been made. Preliminary model data provided by Whatcom County indicate the majority of levees along the west bank of this reach now provide greater than 100-year protection; however, there are still segments of this reach with lower levels of protection, ranging from less than 5-year protection up to less than 100-year protection. Additional flood control structures on the Reservation include levees along the banks of the Lummi River (less than 5-year protection), bank protection made of rip-rap, seawalls along Lummi Bay (less than 5-year protection), tide gates in the Lummi Bay seawall, and floodgates along Lummi Bay and floodplain sloughs. Flooding under future climate scenarios is expected to reduce the effectiveness of the existing flood protection infrastructure on and near the Reservation.

Existing floodplain infrastructure provides a moderate level of protection to agricultural lands that would otherwise be subject to more frequent coastal flooding. However, as sea levels continue to rise, this infrastructure may be rendered ineffective and maintaining adequate drainage may become increasingly difficult (e.g., storm water runoff historically discharged through tide gates may need to be pumped over dikes). This may be further exacerbated by subsidence of farmland soils as a result of sediment compaction and organic matter decomposition. Although agricultural production on the Reservation is not a regionally significant source of foodstuffs, lost revenue from agricultural leases may be important for individual tribal members."}, {"section_title": "Hazardous Materials Sites", "text": "Hazardous materials are substances that are toxic, corrosive, flammable, and/or explosive. In many instances, hazardous materials have the potential to cause injury to life and/or damage to water and other environmental resources. Potential sources of hazardous pollutants in the immediate vicinity of the Reservation include oil refineries, an aluminum smelter, electrical generation plants, chemical factories, and other facilities. There are numerous industrial facilities in very close proximity to the Lummi Reservation (e.g., Phillips 66 Ferndale refinery, Alcoa-Intalco Works aluminum smelter, BP Cherry Point refinery), as well as three wastewater treatment facilities (i.e., Ferndale, Lynden, and Everson) with outfalls that discharge to the Nooksack River. Transportation of hazardous materials to and from these facilities via the freeway, major roads (e.g., Slater Road), railroads, and oil and fuel pipelines near the Reservation also poses a risk of spills. Many small businesses, such as dry cleaners or auto body paint shops, are also potential sources of contamination. There are also several facilities that store pollutants within the Reservation (e.g., the three Lummi Tribal Sewer and Water District [LTSWD] wastewater treatment plants, in-line chlorinators associated with water supply wells, the Lummi Mini Mart gas station, the Fisherman's Cove gas station, the Sandy Point Marina). The risk of a hazardous material emergency on the Reservation is already expected to increase given the future residential and economic growth on the Reservation, in the Cherry Point Heavy Impact Industrial Zone, and in the area upstream from the Reservation; climate change will heighten this risk.

For instance, when the levee along the western side of the lower Nooksack River fails or is overtopped and floodwaters discharge to both Lummi and Bellingham bays, the Lummi Peninsula can be completely isolated from surrounding mainland areas. This isolation can have a large impact on public health and safety since the only remaining transportation is by boat or helicopter. Although the Lummi February 2016 Nation Police Department and Fire District No. 8 stations are on the Lummi Peninsula, extra support for emergency situations is not available in a timely manner. The road closures also have a large economic impact on the community. Because many employees cannot get to work, this isolation affects tribal government offices, the health clinic, tribal schools, the Northwest Indian College, and other businesses located on the Lummi Peninsula. In addition, many residents of the Lummi Peninsula lose income because they cannot get to work off-Reservation. Residents of other areas on the Reservation, such as the Northwest Uplands, are inconvenienced by road closures due to flooding in the floodplain, but are typically still able to access their homes by road. Under future climate conditions, which are projected to increase the frequency and intensity of riverine and coastal flooding, it is prudent to expect an increasing frequency of road closures in the coming decades unless significant infrastructure improvements (e.g., elevating access roads, constructing 100-year setback levee) are undertaken."}, {"section_title": "Marine Facilities", "text": "The primary marine facilities on the Reservation are located at Gooseberry Point, including the Fisherman's Cove public boat launch and the Whatcom County operated ferry terminal that serves Lummi Island, and the privately-owned Sandy Point Marina located along the Sandy Point peninsula.

The University of Washington (UW) Climate Impacts Group (CIG) sufficiently summarizes the broad array of potential climate change impacts to infrastructure in Washington State, many of which are relevant to utilities on the Reservation (CIG 2013): Climate change is expected to increase the potential for infrastructure damage and service disruptions, and may also lead to higher operating costs and reduced asset life. [\u2026] Impacts that can increase risks to infrastructure include more frequent or more severe flooding, extreme heat, extreme precipitation, storm surge, saltwater intrusion, mudslides, erosion, wildfire, and inundation of low-lying areas. Projected changes in extreme events are more likely to damage infrastructure than are changes in average conditions. The utilities sector is divided into four planning areas: water supply, wastewater collection and treatment, storm water management, and energy supply. Vulnerability rankings developed for potential climate change impacts to each of these planning areas are provided in Table 4.11.\nAs discussed in Section 4.11 -Utilities, there are several impacts of climate change on utilities, ranging from infrastructure damage and service disruptions to higher operating costs and reduced asset life. Several adaptation goals and strategies addressing these climate change impacts are presented in this section (Table 5.12) Adaptation Goal J-1: Protect the potable groundwater systems on and adjacent to the Reservation. Adaptation Strategies: 1. Reduce groundwater withdrawals by implementing voluntary, economic, and/or mandatory water conservation measures. Saltwater intrusion caused by over pumping has already occurred and resulted in the closures of groundwater extraction wells on the Reservation. If excessive drawdown of groundwater continues, the Reservation's water supplies may become more vulnerable to potential contamination resulting from sea level rise. The Lummi Water Conservation Plan (2004) identifies several avenues to reduce water demand and improve water use efficiency that may be implemented or expanded to reach this goal, including: (1) voluntary measures, (2) economic measures, and (3) mandatory measures. Voluntary water conservation measures include providing public education and outreach, installing water efficient fixtures (e.g., low-flow faucets, showerheads, and toilets) and appliances, preventing and fixing water leaks, and landscaping with native plants and drought-tolerant vegetation. Economic water conservation measures are primarily focused on adopting a water rate structure that encourages conservation (e.g., more expensive at certain usage levels and/or time periods). Mandatory water conservation measures authorized pursuant to the Water Resources Protection Code (LCL Title 17) may be exercised during droughts or other water supply emergencies and may include restricting nonessential water uses such as lawn watering, car washing, filling swimming pools, washing sidewalks, and irrigating golf courses. 2. Reevaluate and possibly initiate water reclamation and reuse. Water reclamation and reuse opportunities on the Reservation and at the Lummi Nation Skookum Creek Hatchery were evaluated by the Lummi Water Resources Division in 1998. At that time, water reclamation and reuse was determined to be cost prohibitive, given the expense to monitor reclaimed water, provide additional treatment to the available wastewater, and convey the reclaimed water to places of reuse, as well as the relatively low cost of potable water (LWRD 2004). A reevaluation of the costs and benefits of water reclamation and reuse opportunities on the Reservation may now be warranted. Adaptation Goal J-2: Reduce the risk of damage to or failure of wastewater treatment infrastructure. Adaptation Strategies: 1. Identify wastewater treatment system vulnerabilities, develop site-specific adaptation strategies, and secure funding for improvement or replacement. Sea level rise will likely increase saltwater inflow into the wastewater conveyance system, thereby increasing the volume of wastewater that must be transported and treated, increasing energy use and subsequent treatments cost, and increasing maintenance necessary to replace worn or corroded equipment. Reducing the impacts of sea level rise on critical infrastructure requires a proactive approach that begins with identifying potential problems, developing site-specific adaptation strategies, securing funding for improvement or replacement, and implementing changes over time. For instance, the Lummi Tribal Sewer and Water District (LTSWD) has identified Pump Station No. 5 along Lummi Shore Drive as the station most vulnerable to storm surge and high tides and is now seeking funding for improvements (Anderson 2014). In addition, to mitigate the impacts of prolonged power outages that can result due to more severe storm events, the LTSWD has installed back-up generators for all of their wastewater pump stations along Lummi Shore Road and for other stations along their wastewater collection system. Adaptation Goal J-3: Increase capacity to manage storm water. Adaptation Strategies: 1. Reduce storm water runoff through continued implementation of the Lummi Nation Storm Water Management Program. The goals of the Storm Water Management Program are to (1) minimize the opportunities for storm water to wash pollutants into aquifer recharge zones and resource rich estuaries and tidelands of the Reservation, (2) minimize the downstream impacts of development on storm water quantity and quality, and 32. Property and infrastructure damage will likely result from extreme weather events, especially flooding and wildfire, rather than gradual changes in climate. Planning for extremes will provide high levels of protection and ensure that the community is making climate resilient investments. 3. In the natural system, climate change will exacerbate existing problems. Thus, building climate resilient ecosystems will require a reduction in existing stressors. This will present challenges to already imperiled systems, but also an opportunity to make needed improvements. 4. Whereas climate mitigation is largely about carbon, climate adaptation will largely be about water. The importance of water is ubiquitous across the Reservation's natural, social, and built systems and problems related to water quality and quantity are going to become a more critical issue under future climate conditions."}, {"section_title": "Water Supply", "text": "The potable water supply on the Reservation is provided by the Lummi Tribal Sewer and Water District (LTSWD), non-tribal water associations, and individual or small group domestic wells (Figure 4.14). The LTSWD is the largest and most geographically comprehensive water purveyor, serving approximately 1,100 Reservation residences, as well as municipal and commercial operations, using a network of production wells and supplemental water purchased from the City of Bellingham (LSTWD 2014). There are currently eight non-tribal water associations serving predominantly non-tribal members in densely developed residential areas along the Reservation shorelines. These systems are entirely dependent on wells adjacent to or within the association boundaries and provide service to approximately 850 residences. The non-tribal water associations refused the Lummi Nation's offer in 1990 to become integrated into the LTSWD, which would consist of system upgrades and management for aquifer protections. There are currently about 160 domestic wells that supply water to one or more residential units on the Reservation. Non-potable water systems supply untreated surface water (from the Nooksack River or Skookum Creek) or groundwater to the Lummi Bay Salmon Hatchery, the Skookum Creek Salmon Hatchery (located off-Reservation), and the Sandy Point Salmon Hatchery, respectively. As discussed in Section 4.2.2 -Groundwater, over 95 percent of the residential water supply for the Reservation is pumped from local groundwater wells and contamination of wellheads carries the risk of adversely affecting the health of persons drinking or using water from these supplies. Potential climate change impacts to groundwater include saltwater intrusion and altered aquifer recharge, which may be further exacerbated by stressors unrelated to climate (e.g., overpumping, land use change, hazardous materials contamination). If a sufficient quantity of high quality groundwater is not available, water purchased from the City of Bellingham or other alternative water sources will become increasingly important to serve the needs of the Reservation. In addition to concerns over cost, it is also reasonable to expect that future climate changes may also reduce the availability or quality of alternative water sources. For example, the City of Bellingham, which obtains water from Lake Whatcom has indicated that climate change impacts to the water supply may include an increase in storm water runoff that can flush contaminants and sediments into the lake and an increase in algal blooms that can increase the cost of treatment and the concentration of disinfection byproducts (e.g., trihalomethanes [THMs], haloacetic acids [HAAs]) (COB 2014). It is also important to note that the non-potable water supply to the Lummi Nation's salmon hatchery programs, which are culturally and economically significant to the Lummi Nation and its members, is dependent on both groundwater and surface water. Climate change impacts to surface waters include changes in the quantity and timing of streamflow and increases in stream temperature. There are currently no suitable alternative water sources on or near the Reservation that could be used to support hatchery operations."}, {"section_title": "Wastewater Collection and Treatment", "text": "The Lummi Tribal Sewer and Water District (LTSWD) currently operates and maintains three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and a forested Biosolids Application Site (Figure 4.15).

The Kwina Road WWTP (a.k.a. the Membrane Bioreactor [MBR] WWTP) produces \"Class A\" reclaimed water that is discharged into the ground through a series of underground injection wells or into adjacent wetlands.

These pump stations have been flood-proofed to minimize their susceptibility to flood damage and have been equipped with backup diesel generators to prevent spills in case of power outages (e.g., in the event of windstorms). The most significant climate change impact to wastewater collection and treatment on the Reservation is sea level rise, which may (1) allow saltwater inflow into the conveyance/collection system at pump stations (through the overflow chambers) located in lowlying coastal areas (e.g., Sandy Point area) and (2) increase hydraulic head at the sewage outflows into the Strait of Georgia and Hale Passage. More frequent heavy rain events over the winter months may also increase rainwater inflow and infiltration entering the system seasonally (e.g., seepage into manholes). Additional inflow into the wastewater conveyance system increases the volume of wastewater that must be transported and treated, increases energy use and subsequent treatments cost, and increases maintenance necessary to replace worn or corroded equipment (King County 2012). The LTSWD recently completed several pump station upgrades that accounted for historical high tide levels and then added elevation to provide a margin of safety above historical conditions; however, these stations will not accommodate the 50-to 100-year projections of sea level rise (Anderson 2014). Finally, although flooding or inundation of WWTPs is a concern at many other coastal communities in the Puget Sound, it is not a pressing concern on the Reservation because the LTSWD WWTPs are sited at relatively high elevations (75-160 feet NGVD29) that are outside of the adjacent Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) delineated special flood hazard areas (SFHA) identified on the current Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs). A few of the homes on the Reservation have not yet been connected to the LTSWD sewer system and rely on on-site septic systems for wastewater management. Improperly designed or maintained septic systems may allow floodwater infiltration into the systems or discharge from the systems into floodwaters. These problems exist under current conditions and can be reasonably expected to increase under future climate scenarios that projected increasing coastal and riverine flooding. February 2016 "}, {"section_title": "Storm Water Management", "text": "With the exception of water discharged into Washington State aquatic lands from two wastewater treatment plants, all water that falls onto or passes through the Reservation discharges to resource rich tidelands and/or estuaries of the Lummi Nation or infiltrates into the underlying aquifer system. Under future climate scenarios, storm water infrastructure on the Reservation, including culverts, bridges, tide gates, catch basins, roadside ditches, and agricultural ditches, will be affected by projected changes in the seasonality of precipitation (i.e., drier summers and wetter winters) and an increasing frequency of heavy rainfall events (i.e., >1 inch/day) (CIG 2013). Heavy rainfall during the winter months may generate peak conditions that exceed the designed capacity of storm water infrastructure. If storm water systems are overwhelmed, local flooding, erosion and scour, and debris accumulation can be expected. Storm surge also threatens to overwhelm storm water infrastructure in low-lying coastal areas, a condition that will worsen over time with relative sea level rise. "}, {"section_title": "Energy Supply", "text": "There are several sources of electrical and thermal energy on the Reservation. Puget Sound Energy (PSE) provides electricity to the Reservation through a traditional system of aboveground transmission lines (i.e., the \"grid\"). There are also some small solar energy installations (e.g., photovoltaic) that capture and convert the energy contained in sunlight directly into electricity. For instance, the Environmental Science Building at the Northwest Indian College (NWIC) has a 7.8 kilowatt (KW) photovoltaic system, which not only provides electricity for on-site use but also feeds surplus electricity (i.e., high generation, low demand) back into the grid. Space heating in homes and other buildings on the Reservation typically uses electricity, propane gas (Vander Yacht Propane Inc., Propane Gas Industries), or wood. Natural gas is provided by Cascade Natural Gas (CNG), but utility service is only available to the Silver Reef Hotel, Casino & Spa and the Lummi Mini Mart. The new Tribal Administration Building located along Kwina Road uses a geothermal heat pump to minimize energy use for space heating and cooling. Climate change has the potential to impact energy supply and energy demand, often stemming from extreme weather events. For example, intense storm events may cause power outages or service disruptions when PSE transmission lines are downed or damaged. Backup energy sources (e.g., diesel generators) are available for some, but not all, emergency electricity needs. Another consequence of downed trees and power lines may be delays in propane gas delivery until roads can be cleared and reopened. At the regional scale, changes in the timing and magnitude of streamflow are projected to alter hydropower generation at the federally owned and operated dams on the Colombia and Snake rivers, which are the predominant source of electricity used in the Pacific Northwest. By the 2080s, hydropower production is expected to increase 7-10 percent during the winter months and decrease 18-21 percent during the summer months, resulting in a net reduction of approximately 3 percent (Hamlet et al. 2010). Although global warming is expected to reduce the demand for heating during the winter months, rising air temperatures will also increase the demand for air conditioning during the summer months. With warmer average temperatures and an increasing frequency and intensity of heat waves coinciding with low electricity production, regional \"brownouts\" (i.e., an intentional decrease in electricity supply), subsystem failures, and heat-related illness may become more frequent events.

When these impacts emerge and to what extent projected damages are realized is highly variable and will be shaped by current and future human activities (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions, land use change). Despite these uncertainties, it is important to begin developing climate mitigation and adaptation strategies now, so that efforts to reduce the causes of climate change can be initiated while also preparing for the changes that are likely to occur in the future."}, {"section_title": "Guiding Principles", "text": "As discussed in Section 1.2 -Why the Lummi Nation is Planning for Climate Change, it is necessary that the Lummi Nation take action to minimize the impacts of climate change on the Reservation by developing and implementing climate mitigation and adaptation strategies. The primary purpose of climate preparedness is to make the Lummi Nation resilient to climate change. The UW Climate Impacts Group (CIG 2007) defines a climate resilient community as: \"[\u2026] one that takes proactive steps to prepare for (i.e., reduce the vulnerabilities and risks associated with) projected climate change impacts.\" Preparing for climate change will be an ongoing and dynamic process. As such, it is important to establish a suite of guiding principles that will help direct efforts to build a climate resilient community. The following five guiding principles are recommended based on the Lummi Indian Business Council (LIBC) mission to preserve, protect, and promote the Lummi Schelangen (\"way of life\") and LIBC Resolution No. 2014-084: Guiding Principles to Address Climate Change, as well as suggestions of the CIG and the Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals (ITEP): 1. Increase public awareness of global climate change and projected regional impacts. 2. Contribute to a reduction of the causes of climate change (i.e., reduce greenhouse gas emissions). 3. Increase the technical capacity of the Lummi Nation to prepare for climate change impacts. 4. Increase the adaptive capacity of the natural, social, and built systems of the Reservation. 5. Strengthen intergovernmental and community partnerships that reduce the vulnerability of the Lummi Nation to climate change impacts. Each of these guiding principles is described further in Section 5.3 -General Mitigation and Adaptation Recommendations, where practical approaches for utilizing these principles are discussed."}, {"section_title": "Tools and Selection Criteria", "text": "There are a wide variety of tools that are available to communities undertaking climate mitigation and adaptation. Often cited are regulatory tools, non-regulatory tools, and engineered solutions. For instance, regulatory bodies may set limits on carbon emissions, develop zoning restrictions (e.g., inundation risk zone, wildfire risk zone) and setback requirements, update building code standards, and/or adopt low-impact development standards. Non-regulatory tools include incentives for reducing carbon emissions, land acquisition and open space preservation, incentives for relocation or risk avoidance, penalties (disincentives) for high risk activities, and/or financial assistance (e.g., grants, loans) for at-risk community members. Engineered solutions typically refer to development of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency retrofitting, armoring or fortification of existing structures, retrofitting existing structures (e.g., floodproofing), performing preventative maintenance (e.g., culvert replacement), and/or lossprevention design for new construction. Other tools range from enhanced hazard mitigation planning and emergency preparedness to continued or improved ecological monitoring. There are certain criteria that should be used when selecting a particular mitigation or adaptation tool. Proponents of any given action may ask: Will this be viable under a range of possible future climate scenarios, or is it limited in application? Will this be sustainable over the longterm, or is it a short-term fix? Does this allow flexibility to adjust for changing circumstances, or is it rigid and inflexible? Can this be successfully implemented, or is implementation infeasible (e.g., cost-benefit analysis [includes economic and non-economic costs], time to completion)? Is this action equitable, or does it make impacts worse for certain members of the community, vulnerable populations, or future generations? Will this increase greenhouse gas emissions, thus contributing to the causes of climate change, or will this reduce or prevent emissions? These criteria were adapted from the Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals (ITEP) Climate Change Adaptation Planning workshop materials, the UW Climate Impacts Group's (CIG) publication Preparing for Climate Change: A Guidebook for Local, Regional, and State Governments (Snover 2007), and the Swinomish Climate Change Initiative Climate Adaptation Action Plan (Swinomish 2010). Other criteria may be developed as planning efforts move forward."}, {"section_title": "General Mitigation and Adaptation Recommendations", "text": "The purpose of this section is to present general climate mitigation and adaptation recommendations that directly address the guiding principles outlined above and may be applied to a broad range of activities undertaken by the Lummi Nation to address the impacts of climate change. 1. Provide Community Outreach and Education -It is the duty of the Lummi Nation to provide for the well-being of the community. An integral part of this responsibility is to inform the Lummi People about the projected impacts of climate change on the Reservation and the Lummi Schelangen (\"way of life\"), as well as what the Lummi Nation is planning to do or is already doing to reduce emissions and increase the resilience of the community. Community education and outreach holds multiple benefits for individuals and the community alike. Raising awareness will give the public the opportunity to make preparations for impacts (e.g., extreme weather events) and may February 2016 encourage individuals and families to consider what they can do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., using the results of a household carbon footprint calculator). Secondly, education should also help engender community support for the actions taken by the Lummi Nation to build a climate resilient community. 2. Develop and Update Vulnerability Assessments -Chapter 4 -Vulnerability Assessment serves as the starting point for the ongoing process of identifying and assessing the sensitivity and adaptive capacity of projected climate change impacts on the Lummi Nation's natural, social, and built systems. As more precise information becomes available, impacts are felt, new concerns emerge, or actions are taken, it will be necessary to update the identified vulnerabilities to reflect the current state of conditions. Additionally, it will be beneficial to develop more detailed vulnerability assessments specific to certain sectors (e.g., water resources), areas of concern (e.g., for each species of salmon and shellfish), or entities (e.g., the Lummi Tribal Sewer and Water District). As these efforts evolve and policy makers become more aware of climate impacts, climate change may be incorporated into other plans (a.k.a., \"mainstreaming\") as appropriate. Together, these actions can serves as a significant step toward increasing the technical capacity of the Lummi Nation to prepare for climate change impacts. 3. Designate Priority Planning Areas -Using the information provided by the vulnerability assessment(s), planning areas may be refined and prioritized. There are many ways to determine priorities. One recommended method is to prioritize areas that have both high vulnerability and high risk. Risk is typically assessed based on the consequence of an impact and the probabilities (i.e., likelihood) that an impact will occur. A high risk area would be one of high consequence and high probability of occurrence. Because risk perception and risk tolerance may vary between and among communities, it is important to engage a wide audience of community members, facility managers, scientific experts, and government leaders to determine what level of risk is acceptable. Another recommended method is to find planning areas where multiple objectives can be achieved with a single action. For instance, promoting alternative transportation such as walking or biking to work would both reduce carbon emissions and improve individual health. Once the priority planning areas have been designated, officials can set goals for what they hope to accomplish in each planning area. Goals should be specific and achievable and include methods for measuring program success. 4. Take Action -Priority planning area goals will drive the mitigation and adaptation actions that are undertaken to build a climate resilient community. Options for sector specific actions are provided in the next sections. 5. Build Partnerships -Building partnerships, both within the Lummi community and between the Lummi Nation and federal, state, local, and other tribal governments and agencies, non-profit organizations, and the private sector can help to enhance climate preparedness. For instance, the LIBC has mandated that the Lummi Nation collaborate with the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians (ATNI) and the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) to develop an action plan that addresses the impacts of climate change on tribal governments, cultures, and lifeways (Resolution No. 2014-084)."}, {"section_title": "Mitigation Strategies", "text": "Climate mitigation means taking action to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere, the quantity of which will determine the extent and severity of climate change over the coming decades-to-centuries. Although methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and chloroflurocarbons (CFCs) are also important GHGs, this section focus specifically on carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) because this gas has lead to the largest uptake of energy in the earth's climate system to date (i.e., largest positive radiative forcing; IPCC 2013) and is most relevant to the activities that occur on the Reservation. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is determined by the balance between carbon sources, such as carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning and land use change (e.g., deforestation), and carbon sinks, such as carbon captured and stored (i.e., sequestered) by the oceans, forests, and wetlands. Therefore, effective climate mitigation requires not only reducing emissions from energy production and use, but also maintaining or increasing the capacity of carbon sinks. As part of the Lummi Nation Strategic Energy Plan: 2016-2026, the tribe is exploring options for implementing energy efficiency measures and switching to renewable energy sources where practicable with the goal of reducing carbon emissions from the Reservation. The Lummi Nation has also undertaken actions to preserve and enhance known carbon sinks on and near the Reservation. These actions and other opportunities for action are summarized in Table 5.1 and discussed in the following sections. "}, {"section_title": "Transportation Alternatives", "text": "An analysis of baseline energy use conducted as part of the Lummi Nation Strategic Energy Plan: 2016-2026 indicates that transportation accounted for the largest share of carbon emissions from the Reservation in 2010; an outcome that has not likely changed over the past five years. There are many options for reducing the relatively high carbon footprint associated with transportation. The best way to reduce emissions is to leave the car/truck at home and walk or ride a bike to a destination instead. Although desirable, walking and/or biking will not be a viable option for all individuals and activities and/or for the entire year due to poor weather conditions and short day lengths during the winter months. Another good option that is accessible to most Reservation residents is to use public transportation (e.g., Lummi Transit, Whatcom Transportation Authority [WTA]) or carpooling. The Lummi Nation may choose to further promote alternative transportation through incentives and infrastructure. For instance, employer incentives could take the form of the LIBC encouraging employees to participate in the wellness/fitness program (30 minutes of paid exercise time 3 days per week) to walk or bike to work, allowing employees to telecommute to work, providing reduced health insurance premiums for walking or biking to work, providing a free WTA bus pass, or developing a bike share program (i.e., public bicycle system) on the Reservation. Utilizing non-motorized transportation has many benefits for the environment and human health, but there are also risks associated with a lack of pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. Like many rural areas, more sidewalks, bike lanes, and other transportation system upgrades (e.g., roundabouts) can significantly improve pedestrian safety. The LIBC has invested in such infrastructure improvements in recent years, with projects including the 1.8 mile Haxton Way pedestrian path (completed in 2010), the Kwina Road and Blackhawk Way sidewalks (2011), the Haxton Way/Kwina Road roundabout (2013), and the Haxton Way/Smokehouse Road roundabout (2014). There are plans to install several additional miles of sidewalk in the coming years including projects along Lummi Shore Road (between Scott Road and Kwina Road), along Lummi View Drive/Haxton Way (between Gooseberry Point and Balch Road), and a pedestrian pathway to connect the McKenzie Housing Development to the Lummi Nation School. Even when driving is necessary, there are still ways to limit emissions. For example, the type of vehicle and how it is driven can make a big difference. Individuals planning to buy a new or used car may choose an electric, hybrid, or high fuel economy vehicle to maximize their potential reduction of carbon emissions and fuel cost savings. The LIBC already owns at least one hybrid car and has installed two electric car charging stations at the new Tribal Administration Building. A commitment to purchase hybrid and/or electric vehicles by the LIBC could have a significant impact on transportation sector carbon emissions from the Reservation. Reducing emissions from boats can be achieved by replacing or retrofitting older, inefficient motors with newer and more energy efficient models or parts. In 2013, the Harvest Management Division of the Lummi Natural Resources Department obtained nearly $275,000 in grant funding from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as part of the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (2005) to retrofit diesel engines on commercial fishing vessels. Six Lummiowned vessels were retrofitted in 2013. During 2014, nearly $80,000 in additional funding was awarded by the EPA in support of a similar effort. Other ways to reduce emissions while driving include using fuel efficient driving habits (e.g., slow and smooth starts and stops, maintain a steady speed) and keeping the car well maintained (e.g., replace filters as needs, keep tires properly inflated)."}, {"section_title": "Building-Related Energy Efficiency", "text": "In the homes and businesses on the Reservation, carbon emissions result largely from buildingrelated energy use such as space heating, air conditioning, lighting, appliances, and electronics. While energy used for these purposes is necessary to create a comfortable indoor environment, many buildings use energy inefficiently, which leads to higher energy consumption, higher carbon emissions, and associated higher costs. There are many energy saving measures (e.g., energy efficiency retrofitting, weatherization) that can be applied to existing buildings on the Reservation. These may include adding insulation; preventing air leaks in the building envelope (e.g., weather stripping, caulking) and ducts; replacing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems (e.g., with heat exchange/heat pump furnaces or more efficient furnaces); properly maintaining appliances and electronics and/or buying Energy Star appliances and electronics; installing controls (e.g., programmable thermostats to regulate temperature according to building occupancy and/or time of day, light switches triggered by sensors); and replacing incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) or light emitting diodes (LEDs). In new construction, energy efficiency can be incorporated throughout building design, construction, and use. For instance, the U.S. Green Building Council has established a set of building standards that are intended to promote environmentally-minded development; this program is called Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). Buildings that meet credited performance levels may be LEED Certified (e.g., the Lummi Gateway Center is LEED Silver-Certified). An effective way to determine what can be done to save energy in the home or workplace is to get an energy audit. An energy audit performed by qualified professionals will identify energy saving measures that may be taken and can help owners prioritize energy efficiency projects based on potential carbon emissions reductions, energy and cost savings, and/or project costs. For instance, the Lummi Shellfish Hatchery underwent an energy audit in 2012 through the Whatcom Opportunity Council's Community Energy Challenge. The Opportunity Council is a local non-profit organization that conducts energy audits, vets contractors qualified to complete energy efficiency retrofitting and weatherization, and leverages utility rebates, cash incentives, and other funding sources to subsidize the cost of some energy efficiency projects and lower the costs paid by owners. Assessment results at the hatchery led facility managers to have a new roof and an electric heat pump installed. The new roof has significantly improved building insulation and helped to ensure the maintenance of consistent and appropriate temperature in shellfish rearing tanks. Meanwhile, the electric heat pump, which replaced a propane broiler, cost $50,000 for purchase and installation, but is expected to reduce annual energy costs by $40,000 (Point 2014). One of primary recommendations of the Lummi Nation Strategic Energy Plan: 2016-2026 is to conduct energy audits of tribal facilities and Reservation residences and prioritize the implementation of energy efficiency practices based on the findings of these energy audits. With grant funding received from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Rights Protection Implementation (RPI) Climate Change Fund, the Lummi Natural Resources Department (LNR) has recently developed the Residential Energy Efficiency Pilot Program in pursuit of this February 2016 recommendation. The LNR has contracted the Opportunity Council to complete at least 14 energy audits and upgrades in income-qualified, tribal member owned homes on the Reservation by the end of 2016. Not only will this pilot project create energy savings and carbon emissions reductions for homes on the Reservation, which has clear benefits for climate mitigation, but will also increase community awareness about climate change and local actions that can be taken to minimize the carbon footprint of the Reservation and to create a healthier (e.g., improved indoor air quality) and more comfortable home environment. A future goal of the pilot program is to expand to include commercial and municipal facilities identified in the Strategic Energy Plan as high energy users, including the Silver Reef Hotel, Casino & Spa and the Lummi Nation School."}, {"section_title": "Behavior-Related Energy Efficiency", "text": "Not all climate mitigation activities require a large financial investment; at heart, many mitigation actions are really about personal choices. What we buy, how we manage our waste, and the habits of building occupants can significantly affect our carbon footprint. Simple actions like reducing, reusing, and recycling can help reduce carbon emissions from resource extraction, manufacturing, and disposal. Everyone can likely find ways to reduce consumption and reuse certain products. Recognizing the need to better serve the community, the Lummi Nation has recently adopted the Lummi Indian Reservation Integrated Solid Waste Management Plan (2014). Some key recommendations of this plan are to re-establish a Solid Waste Management Division within the Lummi Nation Planning and Public Works Department and to fully subsidize weekly curbside solid waste and every other week recyclable collection or its equivalent. If this program is fully implemented, individuals will be afforded ample opportunity to recycle. Other important behaviors are the habits of building occupants. Changing the way occupants operate lights, electronics, appliances, heaters, and air conditioning can add up to measurable energy savings. Targeted behaviors for reducing energy consumption include turning off lights in unoccupied rooms or when daylight is sufficient; using energy-saver settings on computers that power down the screen when not in use; connecting electronics to power strips that can be switched off when not in use (some electronics use power even in standby mode, i.e., \"phantom power\"); turning off heating or air conditioning when leaving the building; ensuring that windows are not open when heaters or air conditioning are running; and promoting water conservation. Some of these actions can be automated by installing occupancy-detection sensors for lights and programmable thermostats. There are many individuals on the Reservation who already practice energy efficient behaviors. There are also some opportunities for individuals who are not aware of the actions that may be undertaken to conserve energy to learn more about energy saving measures, a recent opportunity was the Energy Workshop lead by the Opportunity Council on July 31, 2014 in combination with registration for their Energy Assistance Program. Additional opportunities will arise over the course of the Residential Energy Efficiency Pilot Program implementation, when homeowners will be provided information about building-related and behavior-related energy efficiency practices. In the Tribal Administration Building and other recently constructed buildings on the Reservation, occupancy-detection sensors and programmable thermostats are used to automate actions that increase energy conservation. Widespread use of behavior-related energy efficiency practices in the workplace could result in people using them at home."}, {"section_title": "Renewable Energy", "text": "Achieving tribal goals of energy self-sufficiency and reduced emissions requires two complementary components; energy efficiency, which will reduce energy demand, and energy development from renewable energy sources, which will provide energy for use on the Reservation. Currently, the Reservation does not contain any single renewable energy source with the capacity to provide enough energy to meet all community needs. However, attaining a portfolio of different renewable energy sources will make progress towards energy selfsufficiency. In the meantime, energy purchased from renewable sources located off-Reservation could be utilized to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable energy is generated from sources that can be naturally replenished, including hydropower, wind power, solar power, biomass energy, and geothermal energy. Not only does renewable energy production result in little to no carbon emissions (biomass is considered carbon neutral), but the cost of conventional, hydrocarbon-based energy is expected to increase in the future. Under the proper environmental conditions, shifting to renewable energy sources can be both an environmentally sound decision, as well as a cost effective one. For example, the analysis of renewable energy production potential given current clean energy technologies in the Lummi Nation Strategic Energy Plan: 2016-2026 determined that the continued pursuit of photovoltaic (solar) electricity production and geothermal heating and cooling are two viable options for renewable energy production on the Reservation. The Strategic Energy Plan does not recommend further pursuit of wind energy development at this time, unless new technologies or new incentives become available that result in economic and environmental costs that are less than the economic and environmental benefits. This recommendation is based on the results of a two year wind energy development feasibility assessment conducted by the Lummi Natural Resources Department with funding provided by the U.S. Department of Energy. The feasibility study evaluated wind energy potential on the Reservation and the wildlife and noise impacts of wind turbines on the Reservation. The assessment included an analysis of over one year of wind speed and direction data collected from two anemometer towers (each equipped with anemometers at different heights to allow for the calculation of wind shear) located where regional wind maps indicated would be most favorable for wind energy. The final report, Wind Resource and Feasibility Assessment Report for the Lummi Reservation (DNV KEMA 2012) concluded that a wind energy project at all three scales of commonly used turbines (i.e., utility, community, and residential scale) were all not economically viable projects on the Reservation. Recommendations for solar and geothermal energy development are discussed below. Solar energy, the energy contained in sunlight, can be captured by photovoltaic (PV) cells (a.k.a., solar panels) and converted into electricity or captured by a medium contained in solar thermal panels and used for water heating. Although the Pacific Northwest has not been developed for utility-scale solar installations, distributed systems (i.e., systems that are installed on commercial or residential buildings and generate electricity for consumption in those buildings) have proven effective. Indeed, the photovoltaic arrays on the Northwest Indian College's (NWIC) Environmental Science Building and along the Haxton Way pedestrian path (for outdoor lighting) have been operating successfully since 2010. There is a significant opportunity to expand the use of solar energy on the Reservation, particularly at tribal facilities with high demand for electricity and/or water heating that are located in appropriate areas and have available roof space for solar installations. These facilities may include the Silver Reef Hotel, Casino & Spa, the Lummi Nation School, the Tribal Administration Building, the Lummi Bay Salmon Hatchery, the Shellfish Hatchery, the Skookum Creek Hatchery, Lummi Housing Authority residential developments, and the Gateway Center. If grants, incentives, and subsidies are utilized to reduce the initial investment of installation, solar systems offer a viable option to replace or supplement the use of electricity from conventional energy sources. Geothermal energy refers to heat generated from the earth and in the Pacific Northwest is typically captured using geothermal heat pumps (GHPs), which take advantage of the relatively stable year-round ground temperature (approximately 50\u00b0 F) found at depths of 6-10 feet below the ground surface. Geothermal heat pumps (GHPs) consist of a heat exchanger, which is a system of underground pipes (\"loops\") filled with water, and a heat pump. In the winter, when the ground temperature is higher than the air temperature, the ground operates as a heat source and the heat pump circulates warm air for space heating. When the air temperature is higher than the ground temperature during the summer, the ground operates as a heat sink and the heat pump removes heat from the building and provides for space cooling. In addition to space heating and cooling, GHPs can be equipped to supply hot water. The new Tribal Administration Building and the nearby Early Child Learning Center (both completed in 2013) use a geothermal heat pump to support the need for space heating and cooling and has realized significant energy savings per square foot of conditioned indoor space compared to the previous LIBC offices at the West, Central, and East campuses. With continued development on the Reservation, there is a valuable opportunity to utilize geothermal energy in tribal facilities and in new residential developments. Although there substantial upfront cost associated with installing a geothermal heat pump, the payback period is generally 5-10 years. Another option to reduce carbon emissions from energy production and support the development of renewable energy throughout the Pacific Northwest is to purchase \"Green Power.\" Pursuant to Washington State Law (RCW 19.29A.090) electric utilities are mandated to provide customers with the option to voluntarily participate in Green Power programs. In these programs, customers pay additional costs that the utility directs to renewable energy facilities that then supply additional electricity into the grid. Puget Sound Energy (PSE) is the electricity provider on the Reservation and provides Green Power at a rate of $0.0125 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). At this rate, the average household, which uses around 800 kWh monthly, can offset 100 percent of their usage through PSE's Green Power Program for approximately ten additional dollars ($10) each month (PSE 2014). The LIBC may opt to lead by example and commit to purchasing a designated amount of Green Power. For example, the nearby City of Bellingham purchases enough Green Power to offset 100 percent of electricity use in municipal facilities and has been recognized as a leading EPA-certified Green Power Community nationwide (COB 2014). The LIBC used approximately 4,670 MWh of electricity for municipal operations in 2010 at a cost of about $38,000 per month. To offset 100 percent of this electricity use through the purchase of Green Power at current rates would cost an additional $4,900 per month, or about 13 percent more per month."}, {"section_title": "Carbon Storage", "text": "The Lummi Nation promotes biological carbon sequestration through the conservation and/or restoration of forests and wetlands, wherein atmospheric carbon dioxide is captured via photosynthesis and stored as organic matter in vegetation, soils, and sediments. Though carbon storage was not necessarily the primary goal of habitat conservation and restoration, the benefits for climate mitigation are the same nonetheless. Two of the Lummi Nation's largest projects, the Arlecho Creek Conservation Area and the Lummi Nation Wetland and Habitat Mitigation Bank are discussed below; it should also be noted that there are many smaller reforestation and salmon habitat restoration projects (e.g., riparian plantings) that create and maintain terrestrial carbon sinks that will not be addressed here. The Arlecho Creek watershed consists of approximately 2,126 acres of forestland and is located in the headwaters of the South Fork Nooksack River. The forest is comprised of a mix of previously logged forestland, some tracts were harvested as recently as the early 1990s, and intact mid-elevation old-growth forest. The tribe purchased 1,771 acres of the watershed from the Crown Pacific Holding Company in 2002 as a part of efforts to recover lands that hold historical, cultural, and environmental significance to the Lummi people (LNR 2011). Additionally, Arlecho Creek is the main tributary to Skookum Creek, which is the primary water source for the Lummi Nation's Skookum Creek Hatchery and the largest tributary to the South Fork of the Nooksack River. In 2007, the Lummi Nation finalized the sale of a 100-year conservation easement to the Climate Trust of Portland, Oregon for all the carbon offsets available on 1,297 acres of the 1,771 acres held by the tribe. The Climate Trust anticipates that this property will sequester 350,000 metric tons of carbon over the next century. Permitted activities in the Arlecho Creek Conservation Area include low-impact cultural and educational use by Lummi tribal members; forest management practices are limited to those deemed necessary to protect the historical, cultural, and environmental values of the property from threats such as wildfire, insects and disease, and invasive species. Forestlands are not the only habitats that capture and store carbon; wetlands also serve as significant carbon sinks by sequestering carbon in plant biomass and organic-rich soils. A recent study in the Snohomish estuary analyzed the climate benefits of coastal wetland restoration by quantifying the carbon storage potential of restored wetlands and concluded that historically altered Puget Sound estuaries have a high capacity to serve as significant carbon sinks (Crooks et al. 2014). As introduced in Section 4.2.3 -Wetlands, large tracts of estuarine and floodplain wetlands of the Lummi and Nooksack rivers will be protected and functionally improved through the implementation of the Lummi Nation Wetland and Habitat Mitigation Bank and other nearby restoration projects (Figure 4.8). In 2009, the Lummi Nation approved the acquisition of approximately 2,770 acres of wetland habitat for mitigation banking and restoration purposes. Wetland enhancement activities will include replacing or removing tide gates, removing portions of dikes, invasive weed control, and opening remnant sloughs and distributary channels. Restoring direct tidal input to areas that have been isolated from tidal hydrology will reestablish the conditions that allow for accretion of the wetland sediment surface. Accretion, or the vertical accumulation of organic and mineral matter, is the mechanism by which vast stores of carbon may be sequestered in wetland soils. As plant biomass is buried, the persistent low-oxygen (i.e., hydric) soil conditions reduces the decomposition of organic matter, resulting in long-term carbon storage. Alternatively, when wetlands are drained and soils become aerobic, microbial February 2016 respiration can release stored carbon back into the atmosphere. Therefore, implementation of the wetland and habitat mitigation bank will likely reactivate carbon sequestration in soils that were drained in the early 1900s for agricultural reclamation. As carbon markets develop, there may be future opportunities to bank so-called \"Blue Carbon\" credits associated with coastal wetland restoration. In summary, land use management has a direct and significant effect on biological carbon sequestration. It is the recommendation of this report that the Lummi Nation continue to promote land use practices such as forest and wetland conservation and restoration that improve carbon storage."}, {"section_title": "Adaptation Strategies", "text": "Coincident with actions to ensure climate mitigation, the Lummi Nation is also committed to undertake climate adaptation. The primary purpose of climate adaptation is to make the Lummi Nation resilient to climate change. This will require taking proactive steps to prepare for future climate change impacts, a planning process that will be dynamic and ongoing. Some preparedness actions are already underway on the Reservation; others will need to be developed. In this section, adaption goals and strategies for each sector of the Reservation's natural, social, and built systems will be identified. There are three caveats that must be understood to properly interpret the information presented in the remainder of this chapter. First, it should be noted that there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to climate adaptation. A given adaptation option may be the best available strategy in one situation and entirely inappropriate in another. The reader is urged to assess the efficacy of different adaptation options on a case-by-case basis. For this reason, adaptation goals and strategies are not ranked or prioritized. Second, the goals and strategies identified in this assessment are intended to provide a broad range of possible options for climate adaptation, but not every possible option. Key goals were identified based on vulnerability rankings and the specific concerns of the Lummi Nation. It is recognized that new and additional goals and strategies will be required to realize a higher level of climate-preparedness on the Reservation. Lastly, the ideas presented here mark a starting point, not an endpoint. These adaption goals and strategies should be revisited and revised as necessary to reflect new data, changing community concerns, or other factors. There are several instances where similar or overlapping adaptation goals and strategies exist between sectors. In these cases, the reader may be directed to the section where similar information is presented."}, {"section_title": "Explore options for seawater chemistry remediation. The Washington State Blue Ribbon", "text": "Panel on Ocean Acidification (2012) identified two novel actions, phytoremediation and pH buffering, that may be effective in remediating local seawater conditions. Phytoremediation involves using vegetation to remove carbon dioxide from the water column (via photosynthesis), thus locally reducing the impacts of ocean acidification. Phytoremediation techniques suggested by the Blue Ribbon Panel include \"[\u2026] using seaweeds or seagrasses within shellfish hatcheries for better larval survival and growth, coculturing eelgrass and shellfish, using seaweed farming to capture and remove carbon, and harvesting algae from shellfish-growing gear for onshore use as fertilizer.\" The second suggested approach involves spreading properly seasoned shells in shallow waters to buffer corrosive conditions within and atop the seafloor. Although these techniques are still in the exploratory phase, these and other potential methods of remediation may be tested by the Lummi Nation should water quality monitoring indicate sufficient need. Adaptation Goal D-3: Conserve forestland and other upland habitats throughout the Lummi Nation's Traditional Territories. Adaptation Strategies: 1. Advocate for the expansion of protected areas. Safeguarding upland plant and wildlife populations may be accomplished, in part, by expanding protected areas to encompass greater landscape diversity, include climate-resilient refugial habitat, and enhance habitat connectivity. Not only does advocating for conservation help protect the treaty-reserved rights of the Lummi Nation, which include the right to hunt and gather throughout the tribe's Usual and Accustomed (U&A) grounds and stations and traditional territories, but it also helps protect ecosystem function, sustain vulnerable populations, and facilitate species range shifts in the face of climate change. 2. Continue to monitor forest practices and encourage better forest management. The Lummi Natural Resources Department (LNR) works to ensure proper implementation of federal and state laws and agreements (e.g., Washington State's Forests and Fish Law) in forestlands and other upland habitats through review of Forest Practices Application (FPA), Hydraulic Project Approval (HPA), Road Management and Abandonment Plans (RMAPs), and other permitting documents. While monitoring compliance is important, the Lummi Nation also has a role to play in ensuring that regulations and standards are modified as necessary to provide adequate levels of protection under future climate scenarios. 2.

February 2016"}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "The potential impacts of climate change on the Lummi Nation are significant and diverse. These impacts include, but are not limited to, increasing surface temperature, changes in precipitation (i.e., wetter winters, drier summers), changes in the seasonality and magnitude of streamflow (i.e., higher winter flows, earlier spring snowmelt, lower summer flows), increasing extent, frequency, and/or intensity of extreme weather events (e.g., flooding, wildfire, heat waves, drought), and changes in the coastal ocean (i.e., increasing sea surface temperature, sea level rise, ocean acidification). Furthermore, an assessment of the vulnerability (i.e., susceptibility to harm) of the Reservation's natural, social, and built systems to climate change indicates that the majority of planning areas on the Reservation have a high level of vulnerability to climate change impacts. Building a climate resilient community in the face of these impacts will require coordinated and comprehensive climate preparedness planning. Climate preparedness should include implementation of both climate mitigation and climate adaptation strategies. Climate mitigation means taking action to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, the quantity of which will determine the extent and severity of climate change over the coming decades-tocenturies. Although the Reservation accounts for only a relatively minor contribution to global carbon emissions, achieving emissions reduction goals globally will require universal support and participation. Accordingly, the recommendations of this Lummi Nation Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Plan: 2016-2026 (CCMAP) are to undertake action on climate mitigation as soon as practicable. To address climate change impacts that are already occurring and impacts that will unavoidably occur in the future regardless of mitigation efforts, it is also recommended that the Lummi Nation take action on climate adaptation as soon as practicable. Several climate mitigation and adaptation strategies are provided for the natural, built, and social systems on the Reservation. The key recommendations for implementing climate mitigation and adaption actions on the Reservation that will help protect public health and the environment are: 1. Establish and maintain a Climate Preparedness Committee with, at a minimum, one representative from the LIBC, the Natural Resources Department, the Planning and Public Works Department, and the Cultural Resources Department and two representatives from the General Council to provide guidance and oversight in climate mitigation and adaptation planning. Committee membership may be expanded to include additional tribal institutions as is deemed necessary or desirable, for instance the Police Department, the Lummi Tribal Health Center, the Lummi Tribal Sewer and Water District (LTSWD), the Lummi Commercial Company (LCC), the Lummi Housing Authority (LHA), the Northwest Indian College (NWIC), and others may also be considered. 2. Provide community education and outreach to increase awareness of and preparation for climate change impacts and engender community support for climate mitigation and adaption. 3. Focus initial efforts in climate mitigation and adaptation on the following high priority items as determined from the core concepts for strategy development: a. Improve building-, behavior-, and transportation-related energy efficiency. b. Improve emergency preparedness planning and response capabilities. c. Implement flood risk reduction measures. d. Implement wildfire risk reduction measures. e. Reduce existing stressors to salmon populations. f. Improve water quality in shellfish harvest areas. g. Restore and protect instream flow in the Nooksack River basin. h. Protect the potable groundwater systems on and adjacent to the Reservation. 4. Further refine and prioritize climate mitigation and adaptation strategies for implementation based on guidance of the Climate Preparedness Planning Community, community feedback, the recommendations of this report, and other vulnerability assessments as appropriate. 5. Identify and obtain funding to implement selected mitigation and adaptation strategies and determine which tribal entity will be responsible for implementation. 2. Upgrade infrastructure to accommodate or protect against flooding. 3. Continue to pursue land acquisition, building relocation or demolition, and open space preservation in special flood hazard areas. 4. Protect existing development in flood-prone areas.
