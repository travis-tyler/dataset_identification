According to the new guidelines Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves not only dementia's phase but also predementia phase which is asymptomatic and pathological process in the brain is already present. For this reason it is very important to determine the suitability of markers which should be positive before onset of the first symptoms. One of these biomarkers is a structural magnetic resonance imaging with hippocampal volumetric assessment.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of structural brain magnetic resonance imaging with volumetric assessment of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, temporal gyri: superior, medial and inferior, to predict the conversion of MCI to AD.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of brain was performed at the baseline visit in 101 patients diagnosed with MCI. Clinic follow-ups were scheduled after 6.12 and 24 months.\nResults: Amongst 101 patients with MCI, 17 (16.8%) converted into AD within two years of observation. All measured volumes were lower in converters than non-converters.\nDiscriminant analysis was conducted and sensitivity for MCI conversion to AD was 64.7%, specificity 96.4%. 91% of patients were correctly classified (converter or non-converter).\nConclusions: Volumetric measurements may help clinicians to predict MCI conversion to AD but due to low sensitivity it cannot be use separately.

In the past MCI was treated as a transitional state between the physiological aging and dementia. Currently it is a separate diagnosis, although it is considered that MCI is a stage of pathophysiological process of AD [1] . Patients with MCI do not have problems with function in daily life, sometimes they only need minimal aid [2] . Patient diagnosed with MCI can present stable, non-progressive symptoms until the end of his life, but there can also be observed progression of the disease (usually gradual), leading to the development of dementia. It is estimated that the percentage of the conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is about 10-15% per year [3] . Criteria for diagnosis of MCI from 2011 [1] in addition to core clinical criteria distinguish research criteria. The research criteria include an assessment of the biological markers of neurons' injury, namely:\n-markers of b-amyloid (Ab) deposition by assessing the levels of Ab42 in cerebrospinal fluid or PET amyloid imaging -markers of neuronal injury by evaluating the levels of total and phosphorylated tau protein or a reduction in hippocampal volume, or atrophy of the medial temporal lobe in the magnetic resonance imaging, or hypometabolism in FDG-PET, or hypoperfusion in SPECT.\nThese criteria are important because pathophysiological process of AD can last even twenty years before onset of clinical symptoms and MCI is considered as a stage of this pathophysiological processes following the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease. In MCI phase biomarkers should be already positive (both markers of Ab deposition and markers of neuronal injury). A sensitive biomarker will play key role when causative treatment of AD will be found because then it will be possible to treat this disease even before the onset of clinical symptoms.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of structural brain magnetic resonance imaging with volumetric assessment of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, temporal gyri: superior, medial and inferior, to predict the conversion of MCI to AD.\nThe first abnormalities in patients who are at risk of AD are positive markers of deposition of b-amyloid (decreased Ab concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid and/or positive PET amyloid imaging). In this study the marker of neuronal injury was used -structural MRI with volumetric assessment of selected brain structures (inter alia hippocampus, entorhinal cortex) because of good availability of magnetic resonance in Poland (the best of neuroimaging biomarkers) and its noninvasive nature. Furthermore, according to Jack, in the MRI pathological changes are observed as one of the last biomarkers [4] and our patients were not in the preclinical phase -they were diagnosed with MCI. Reduction of the measured volumes was expected in patients who were at risk of conversion to AD."}, {"section_title": "2.", "text": "Material and methods Brain MRI was performed for each of the patients on a 1.5 T Toshiba apparatus in the Department of Radiology of MSW Hospital. Scans were obtained in T2-weighted, FLAIR, DWI images and also thin 3D T1 Alzheimer sequence. Using FreeSurfer software volumes of selected structures were calculated, that is: hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, temporal gyri: superior, medial, inferior and total intracranial volume. Subsequently, the results have been checked by the same radiologist to detect and eliminate possible errors which may arise in the process of segmentation. Each volume (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, temporal gyri: superior, medial, inferior) was divided by the total intracranial volume to normalize results and to make possible comparison between patients and eliminate differences in the brain size (according to Whitwell [6] ). All volumes were multiplied by 1000 in order to facilitate comparison between them."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "17 of the 101 patients diagnosed with MCI converted into AD within two years of observation, namely 16.8% (distribution of diagnosed patients for each visit, Table 1 ). The study population was divided into two subgroups:\n-Subgroup 1 -non-converters, who did not converted into AD (84 patients). -Subgroup 2 -converters, who converted into AD (17 patients).\nn e u r o l o g i a i n e u r o c h i r u r g i a p o l s k a 4 9 ( 2 0 1 5 ) 3 4 9 -3 5 3\nAverage decrease of the volumes in converters compared to non-converters was achieved for all volumetric measurements, Table 2 . The hypothesis of a normal distribution was positively verified for all measurements (the results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Table 3 ). The significance of intergroup differences was obtained for the majority of measurements except: left posterior cingulate gyrus (t = 1.659, p = 0.100), left superior temporal gyrus (t = 1.274, p = 0.206) and right posterior cingulate gyrus (t = 1.202, p = 0.232). The most significant differences between groups were found for: left hippocampus (t = 5.708, p < 0.001), left entorhinal cortex (t = 5.473, p < 0.001), right hippocampus (t = 5.129, p < 0.001), right inferior temporal gyrus (t = 3.803, p < 0.001) and right entorhinal cortex (t = 3.676, p < 0.001), Table 3 .\nDiscriminant analysis was conducted and sensitivity for MCI conversion to AD was 64.7%, specificity 96.4%. 91% of patients were correctly classified (converter or non-converter). Discriminant analysis was also conducted in the modified version with an automatic selection of variables which had the highest discrimination power. The final model took into account only two variables, which provide the best group membership: the volume of the left hippocampus and left entorhinal cortex. Discriminant analysis model using these "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In descriptive statistics presented in Table 2 , average volumes of all structures are smaller in converters comparing to non-converters (according to the preliminary assumptions). However, statistical analysis showed the superiority of some measurements. The highest sensitivity of conversion for single structure was obtained for the left hippocampus (52.9%), right hippocampus (41.2%) and left entorhinal cortex (also 41.2%). Unsuitable measurements for assessing MCI to AD conversion were the volumes of: left and right posterior cingulate gyrus, left and right superior temporal gyrus and right medial temporal gyrus (the sensitivity was 0%). Our results are consistent with the sequence of neuropathological changes described by Braak [7, 8] , where entorhinal cortex and hippocampus are affected as the first by the neuropathological process and subsequently cortex of temporal lobes in stage III and IV. Volumes of superior temporal gyri proved to be unsuitable probably because of their main role in the process of auditory sensation, so their role in cognitive processes is significantly lower. The most of the published studies has evaluated usefulness of hippocampus and entorhinal cortex volumes in the prediction of MCI conversion to AD. Our study also confirms the highest value of these two parameters. Studies which assessed additionally, for example, volume of parahippocampal gyrus, indicated that the use of this parameter did not increase prediction sensitivity for conversion to AD [9, 10] . In our study the use of all measured volumes increased sensitivity from 58.8% (where the volume of the left hippocampus and left entorhinal cortex was used) to 64.7%. Specificity in both cases was 96.4%. Significant differences between the sensitivity and specificity figures resulted from subgroup size difference (17 converters and 84 with stable MCI). In other studies, the percentage of conversion to AD was higher, namely 27-45% [9] [10] [11] . In the few studies [10, 12, 13] [15] analyzed 339 patients with MCI from ADNI database. 18.3% converted into AD per year. Bilateral hippocampal volumes, entorhinal cortex and temporal gyri thickness were significantly reduced in MCI-converters in comparison to the MCI-stable participants which is consistent with our results except for the left superior temporal gyrus (LSTG), Table 3 . In our study the volume of LSTG was not significantly lower, but in Risarcher study the thickness, not volume of temporal gyri was measured. Another study [16] based on ADNI database (Li et al.) covered 293 patients with MCI and the observation period lasted 4 years. To predict conversion from MCI to AD the authors used not only the measured volumes but also demographic, genetic information, cognitive scores, and the results of laboratory tests. They employed a hierarchical interaction model to select the most predictive biosignatures and interactions between all of the parameters to perform correct classification the patients with MCI (converter or nonconverter). The accuracy of classification was almost 75% (the most effective MRI parameters were precuneus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus). Percentage of the correct classification in our study using all volumes was 91% but sensitivity was only 64.7%. Higher correct classification rate in our study was probably due to the large differences between subgroups (17 converters vs. 84 non-converters). In Li's study conversion rate was 45% (132 converters vs. 161 nonconverters), so subgroups were almost equivalent.\nThe study from 2014 [17] presents results using data from both mentioned databases (ADNI and AddNeuroMed) and involved 345 patients with MCI. The authors used ordinal regression model to 1023 baseline structural MRI scans. They modeled all classes simultaneously (in study were also AD patients and control group) and applied multivariate ordinal regression from which they extract a probabilistic prediction of class membership and an index of AD progression -the ORCHID score. Classification accuracy was 70-75% (ADNIAddNeuroMed); sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 72%.\nThis study confirmed results from 2011 [18] in which multivariate classification methods for MRI was used. Data was from AddNeuroMed database. MCI group was 101 patients (like in our study) and 19 patients converted into AD during one year observation. The authors compared correct classification accuracy between visual assessment rating scales, a multivariate MRI classification method (with using regional volume and regional cortical thickness measures, providing 57 variables for multivariate analysis) and manually measured hippocampal volumes. The best accuracy for predicting conversion was for the model with automated regional MRI measures -79% and 68% accuracy was obtained to other two methods. Comparable group size with our study proved that using sophisticated statistical tools can improve the efficiency of the method.\nOur study group requires further observation, because in the following years the proportion of the patients who"}]
