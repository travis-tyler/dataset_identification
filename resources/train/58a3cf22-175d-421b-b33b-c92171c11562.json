Visual analysis had a lower sensitivity (79% vs 85%) but higher specificity (96% vs 90%), respectively, compared with SUVR. The conversion rate was 15.2% within a mean of 1.6 years, and a positive [ 18 F] florbetapir baseline scan was associated with a 6.91-fold (SUVR) or 11.38-fold (visual) greater hazard for AD conversion, which changed only modestly after covariate adjustment for apolipoprotein \u03b54, concurrent fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET scan, and baseline cognitive status.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Visual and SUVR A\u03b2 PET analysis may be equivalently used to determine A\u03b2 status for individuals with MCI participating in clinical trials, and both approaches add significant value for clinical course prognostication."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "I ncreased brain \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) seen with positron emission tomography (PET) and decreased A\u03b21-42 measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) allow in vivo detection of A\u03b2, with substantial agreement. [1] [2] [3] [4] These biomarkers have therefore been proposed as indicators of Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology, aiding the selection and monitoring of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or prodromal AD in clinical trials. 5, 6 In MCI, A\u03b2 load assessment may be additionally useful for prognostication since A\u03b2 PET positivity predicts a higher risk of cognitive decline and AD conversion. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] With the exception of a few studies of relatively small samples, 7, 13, 16 most MCI studies evaluating the prognostic value of A\u03b2 PET 8, 9, 11, 14, 17 and the agreement between A\u03b2 PET with A\u03b2 CSF markers [2] [3] [4] have used semiquantitative image assessments of standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs). Although visual A\u03b2 PET rating is relatively simple and is the standard in clinical practice, there is a lack of knowledge about its significance for prognostication in large MCI cohorts and its agreement with CSF A\u03b21-42 data and more quantitative PET measures. In terms of participant selection for clinical trials, further research is needed to evaluate whether MCI due to AD could be equivalently identified by visual PET ratings.\nThe goals of our study were to investigate the concordance between visual and quantitative A\u03b2 PET analysis and evaluate how each of those image assessments agrees with CSF A\u03b21-42 data in MCI. We further aimed to examine the effect of visual and quantitative image categorization as A\u03b2 PET negative or positive to predict longitudinal cognitive function and AD conversion risk. Our methodologic design intentionally corresponds to the setting of large clinical trials including a large MCI sample derived from various sites or centers using different PET scanners and performing A\u03b2 imaging with florbetapir F 18 [ 18 F], a tracer approved for clinical use by the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Our analysis was performed on participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a multisite study supported by the National Institutes of Health, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations, with a goal of using multimodal imaging, CSF, and cognitive measurements in elderly controls as well as patients with MCI or AD to standardize and validate biomarkers in AD clinical trials.

Furthermore, both visual and quantitative A\u03b2 PET assessment performed similarly in predicting longitudinal cognitive function and MCI to AD conversion.\nConcordance between visual and quantitative image analysis was lower than that reported in a study 26 that included patients with AD. Similarly, acquisition of data in a single center, as opposed to this multicenter study, appears to result in a higher concordance between qualitative and SUVR measures (\u03ba values up to 0.96). 13, 26 In addition to its multicenter approach, our study differs from previous MCI investigations that compared visual and quantitative PET analysis by (1) the use of [ ; (2) the inclusion of individuals with EMCI; (3) the application of a less conservative SUVR threshold 13 ; and (4) the examination of a much larger and likely more heterogeneous MCI sample. 7, 13, 26, 27 All of those aspects may have contributed to the somewhat lower concordance between visual readings and SUVRs in the present study.\nIn contrast, our interrater reliability (\u03ba = 0.92) was somewhat higher than that in another visual MCI PET study (\u03ba = 0.46-0.86). 7 However, this very high interreader reliability was generated from a subsample of cases that already agreed between visual (reader 1) and SUVR analysis; therefore, it is likely to be biased toward higher concordance. When including all 125 cases rated by both readers (as described in the Methods section), interrater reliability was somewhat lower but still substantial (\u03ba = 0.76). Because the subsample of 125 cases read by rater 2 specifically included the 53 participants with discordant qualitative (reader 1) and quantitative data, corresponding interrater agreement was biased toward lower concordance.\nTo have an objective, independent criterion, we considered CSF as a reference standard and found that visual readings resulted in lower sensitivity and higher specificity compared with SUVR analysis. The use of CSF as an external reference allowed us to compare visual and SUVR analysis with a third measure. Addition of this measure does not suggest that CSF A\u03b2 should be considered as the reference standard or that our approach refers to general recommendations, especially since CSF and PET A\u03b2 represent different aspects of cerebral A\u03b2 pathology. 28, 29 In fact, it has been proposed that CSF A\u03b2 reduction indicates earlier stages of abnormality and increased A\u03b2 PET retention reflects later stages of cerebral A\u03b2 and AD pathology. 30 In terms of its high specificity but slightly lower sensitivity, visual analysis may be useful for selection of individuals with MCI for participation in intervention trials aiming to avoid the treatment of true-negatives. Compared with SUVRs, visual readings may be less useful for clinical trials aiming to capture as many A\u03b2-positive cases as possible, especially those at very early A\u03b2 stages (eg, EMCI). Continuous SUVR measures Amyloid-positive baseline PET predicted approximately 4-fold to 9-fold higher conversion risk even after adjustment for positive APOE \u03b54 carrier status, an abnormal concurrent FDG-PET scan, and 1-score worsening of a lower baseline ADAS-cog score. An A\u03b2-positive PET scan thus adds considerable predictive value even in the presence of genetic and cognitive status, as well as in the absence of additional biomarkers. Moreover, our data emphasize that the frequency of A\u03b2 positivity and conversion rates increase with severity of cognitive symptoms. 11 Depending on the method used for A\u03b2 load assessment, we found that 40.6% to 59.5% and 63.4% to 72.2% of EMCI and LMCI cases, respectively, were A\u03b2 positive and that 5.5% and 32.4% of participants with EMCI and LMCI, respectively, converted to AD within 1.5 years. In general, all results were comparable between the qualitative and quantitative analyses."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Our findings suggest that visual readings and SUVRs are equivalent in their assignment of negative or positive A\u03b2 status in MCI. Even including genetic, cognitive, and FDG status, qualitative and quantitative PET analysis adds significant value for clinical course prognostication. Our data thus support the applicability of a simpler case inclusion algorithm that may facilitate case selection in trials evaluating MCI due to AD."}]
