[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Graduate students can receive grants in the form of fellowships from the federal government, states, institutions, and private organizations including their employers and may take out federal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans and Direct PLUS Loans, if eligible. In addition, graduate students may receive research and teaching assistantships from their institution or other sources. As described in appendix A, Title IV programs consist of Pell Grants, Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans, Direct PLUS Loans to graduate students and parents of dependent undergraduates, Perkins Loans, federal work-study, and several smaller grant programs. Eligibility for federal need-based aid is largely determined by the student's family income, which is defined differently for dependent and independent students. Roughly half of undergraduate students are considered dependent for financial aid purposes. Undergraduate students are deemed dependent if they are under age 24, are not married, do not have dependents, are not veterans or on active military duty, are not orphans or wards of the court, and are not homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. (Federal law also allows financial aid administrators to exercise professional judgment to reclassify individual students as independent in exceptional cases.) Graduate students are treated as independent regardless of age and other characteristics. For dependent students, financial need is primarily calculated using their parents' income. For independent students, financial need is based on their own income and, for married students, also on their spouse's income. Due to these differences in how income is calculated and other factors affecting eligibility for student aid, estimates for dependent and independent students are presented separately in this report. Because financial need is calculated based on prior year income, this report shows aid estimates within 2010 income ranges. Another aspect of financial aid eligibility is whether students attend a postsecondary institution full time for the full academic year. Full-time attendance is usually defined as enrolling for 12 or more credits for undergraduate students and 9 or more credits for graduate students. Full academic year attendance is defined as 9 months or longer. Students who enroll less than full time or for less than a full year have lower limits on the amount of aid they can receive, and students must enroll at least half time to receive federal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans and to use federal Pell Grants to offset living expenses (beyond tuition and fees, books and materials, and transportation)."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION 3", "text": "Appendix A provides a glossary of variables used in this publication and their definitions. Additional details about Title IV programs are available in the 2011-12 Federal Student Aid Handbook, available at http://ifap.ed.gov/ifap/index.jsp. Appendix B provides details about the methods and procedures used for NPSAS:12. It contains information on data sources, sample design, imputation, weighting, and quality of estimates. Appendix C contains revised tables for NPSAS:08. NPSAS:08 data have been reweighted to align with weighting procedures used in NPSAS:12. When the weights for NPSAS:08 were originally calculated, they were based on 12-month enrollment counts from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) for the 2006-07 academic year, the most current file available at the time. Due to improvements in processing time and changes in procedures, NPSAS:12 weights are based on current (i.e., 2011-12), rather than prior year, 12-month enrollment counts. With this release of NPSAS:12, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is concurrently releasing revised NPSAS:08 data based on weights that reflect 12-month enrollment for 2007-08 for the purpose of comparability. Appendix C provides updated estimates based on the reweighted NPSAS:08 data."}, {"section_title": "Selected Findings", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Types of financial aid received by undergraduates in 2011-12 (tables 1 and 2):", "text": "\u2022 Seventy-one percent of all undergraduates received some type of financial aid.

NPSAS:12 features a nationally representative sample of both aided and nonaided students in postsecondary education institutions in the United States. The sample is made up of undergraduate and graduate students. These students attended all types and levels of postsecondary institutions that were eligible to distribute student aid authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, including public and private institutions, for-profit and nonprofit institutions, less-than-2-year institutions, 2-year institutions, and 4-year colleges and universities. The U.S. Department of Education's (ED's) National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) first implemented NPSAS during the 1986-87 academic year to meet the need for national-level data about financial aid issues. Since then, NCES has conducted NPSAS every 3 to 4 years, with the most recent implementation during the 2011-12 academic year. NPSAS also serves as the base-year data collection for two longitudinal studies-the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS) and the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B)-in alternating cycles. NPSAS:12 is the base year for BPS:12/17, which plans to follow a cohort of 2011-12 first-time beginning postsecondary students (FTBs) in 2014 and then again in 2017.

All five of the U.S. Service academies were excluded because of their unique funding/tuition base: U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, and U.S. Air Force Academy. APPENDIX B-NPSAS:12 TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY"}, {"section_title": "B-3", "text": "The above institution eligibility conditions were consistent with all previous NPSAS administrations with three exceptions: Title IV participation, inclusion of correspondence schools, and exclusion of Puerto Rico. The requirement that an institution be eligible to distribute federal Title IV aid was implemented beginning with NPSAS:2000. Institutions that offered only correspondence courses, provided these same institutions were also eligible to distribute federal Title IV student aid, were first included in NPSAS:04. Institutions in Puerto Rico were not originally included in NPSAS in 1987 but were subsequently added to administrations of NPSAS between 1993 and 2008. Although Puerto Rican institutions enroll only about 1 percent each of undergraduate and graduate students nationally, unique aid, enrollment, and demographic patterns distinguish it from institutions in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a result, students enrolled at these institutions tend to skew national estimates for Hispanic students not enrolled in institutions located in Puerto Rico. Because of this concern, and because estimates have never been representative for Puerto Rico, these institutions were not included in the 2012 administration of NPSAS. The NPSAS:12 target population consisted of all eligible students enrolled at any time between July 1, 2011, and June 30, 2012, in eligible postsecondary institutions in the United States who were \u2022 enrolled in \u2022 an academic program; \u2022 at least one course for credit that could be applied toward fulfilling the requirements for an academic degree; \u2022 exclusively noncredit remedial coursework but determined by the institution to be in a program of study eligible for Title IV aid; or \u2022 an occupational or vocational program that required at least 3 months or 300 clock hours of instruction to receive a degree, certificate, or other formal award; \u2022 not currently enrolled in high school; and \u2022 not solely enrolled in a General Educational Development (GED) or another high school completion program. The above student eligibility criteria were consistent with all previous NPSAS administrations except that, in 2012, NCES clarified that students enrolled exclusively in noncredit remedial coursework were eligible to participate in NPSAS so long as the institution had determined they were in a program of study eligible for Title IV aid. The NPSAS:12 full-scale institution sampling frame was constructed prior to the study's field test (conducted during the 2010-11 financial aid year) from the IPEDS:2008-09 Institutional Characteristics (IC), 12-Month and Fall Enrollment, and Completions files. For the small number B-4 APPENDIX B-NPSAS:12 TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY of institutions on the frame that had missing enrollment information, the data were imputed using the latest IPEDS imputation procedures to guarantee complete data for the frame. Because the original sample of 1,670 institutions was drawn from the IPEDS:2008-09 IC file, the institution sample was freshened in order to add newly eligible institutions to the sample and produce a sample that was representative of institutions eligible in the 2011-12 academic year. To do this, the IPEDS:2009-10 IC, 12-Month and Fall Enrollment, and Completions files were used to create an updated sampling frame of current NPSAS-eligible institutions. This frame was then compared with the original frame, and 387 new or newly eligible institutions were identified. These 387 institutions were included in the freshening sampling frame. Twenty institutions were selected and added to the sample during the freshening process, resulting in a total of 1,690 sampled institutions. Four of these 1,690 institutions had become ineligible and were identified while contacting institutions rather than through the freshening process. Table B-1 shows the number of institutions that were sampled, the number of eligible institutions, and the number and unweighted and weighted percentages of eligible institutions providing enrollment lists, by institution characteristic. APPENDIX B-NPSAS:12 TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY B-5 Each sampled institution verified as NPSAS-eligible was asked to provide a list of all students who satisfied all eligibility conditions. The NPSAS:12 student sample of 128,120 (as shown in table B-2) included two subgroups who were intentionally sampled at rates higher than their natural occurrence within the population to improve data quality. One subgroup included undergraduates enrolled in all types of for-profit institutions. In 2009-10, students in for-profit institutions received about 24 percent 2 of disbursed federal aid while constituting about 11 percent 3 of the student population. For this subgroup, students in for-profit institutions and in the three undergraduate student strata listed below were oversampled. The other subgroup included FTB undergraduates enrolled in certificate programs at all types of institutions, who have important early labor market experiences that can only be explored in BPS with a sufficiently large starting sample. The first stratum below was added for this second subgroup, but the sampling rates for this stratum accounted for oversampling of these two subgroups. Eleven student sampling strata were identified for NPSAS:12. Unlike prior NPSAS administrations, NPSAS:12 included additional stratification at the graduate student level to improve the quality of estimates for students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs. The resulting strata were \u2022 FTB undergraduate students enrolled in certificate programs; \u2022 other FTB undergraduate students; \u2022 other undergraduate students; 4 \u2022 master's degree students in STEM programs; \u2022 master's degree students in education and business programs; \u2022 master's degree students in other programs; \u2022 doctor's degree -research/scholarship and doctor's degree -other students in STEM programs; \u2022 doctor's degree -research/scholarship and doctor's degree -other students in education and business programs; \u2022 doctor's degree -research/scholarship and doctor's degree -other students in other programs; \u2022 doctor's degree -professional practice students; 5 and \u2022 other graduate students. 6 APPENDIX B-NPSAS:12 TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY"}, {"section_title": "B-7", "text": "As student lists were received from institutions, students were sampled by means of stratified systematic sampling with predetermined sampling rates that varied by student stratum.

A summary of all the weight components, including the probabilities of selection and adjustments, is presented in table B-3. The student analysis weight, WTA000, is the product of the weight components in table B-3.  In contrast to NPSAS:08, student poststratification adjustment procedures were revised in NPSAS:12 to use current year (i.e., 2011-12 for NPSAS:12), rather than prior-year, 12-month enrollment totals. In August 2013, NCES revised the weights accompanying NPSAS:08 to use 2007-08, rather than 2006-07, 12-month enrollment totals. These revised weights provide better estimates in sectors where significant enrollment shifts occurred between 2006-07 and 2007-08. This improvement has the greatest effect on estimates for students enrolled in the private for-profit sector, where these enrollment shifts resulted in inflated estimates of the incidence of certain types of financial aid.

As shown in table B-1, about 1,480 of the 1,690 eligible sample institutions were respondents (88 percent unweighted and 87 percent weighted). The institution weighted response rate is below 85 percent for 5 of the 10 types of institutions: \u2022 public less-than-2-year; \u2022 public 2-year; \u2022 private nonprofit less-than-4-year; \u2022 private for-profit less-than-2-year; and \u2022 private for-profit 2-year. The weighted response rates, by type of institution, range from 78 percent for private nonprofit less-than-4-year institutions and private for-profit 2-year institutions to 92 percent for public 4-year non-doctorate-granting institutions. A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted overall and for each institutional sector, regardless of response rate, because all sectors are included in the nonresponse weight adjustments. The nonresponse bias was estimated for variables known for most respondents and nonrespondents, and some variables were added that were not included in the nonresponse weight adjustment. There are extensive data available for all institutions from IPEDS, and the following variables were used for the nonresponse bias analysis: 9 9 For the continuous variables, categories were formed based on quartiles. \u2022 percentage of students receiving federal grant aid; \u2022 percentage of students receiving state/local grant aid; \u2022 percentage of students receiving institutional grant aid; \u2022 percentage of students receiving student loan aid; \u2022 average net price among students receiving grant or scholarship aid; \u2022 percentage of students enrolled: Hispanic; \u2022 percentage of students enrolled: Asian or Pacific Islander; \u2022 percentage of students enrolled: Black, non-Hispanic; \u2022 total undergraduate enrollment; \u2022 male undergraduate enrollment; \u2022 female undergraduate enrollment; \u2022 total graduate enrollment; \u2022 male graduate enrollment; \u2022 female graduate enrollment; \u2022 percentage of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who received any grant aid; \u2022 graduation rate of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates within 150 percent of normal time to completion; \u2022 public institution tuition and fees as percentage of core revenues; \u2022 private institution tuition and fees as percentage of core revenues; \u2022 public institution instructional expenses per FTE enrollment; and \u2022 private institution instructional expenses per FTE enrollment. First, for the institution-level variables listed above, the nonresponse bias was estimated by comparing base weighted respondents to both nonrespondents and the full sample and tested to determine if it significantly differed from zero at the 5 percent level. The two comparisons yield identical bias estimates but not always the same significance testing results. Second, nonresponse adjustments were computed to significantly reduce or eliminate nonresponse bias for key variables included in the models. Third, using base weights adjusted for nonresponse, bias was re-estimated and statistical tests were performed to check for any remaining significant nonresponse bias. Finally, to better understand the effect of poststratification on efforts to reduce nonresponse bias, two additional sets of estimates were created. The first, the difference in respondent means before and after poststratification, represents the effect of poststratification on nonresponse adjustments. The second, the difference in base weighted full sample means and the poststratified respondent means, represents the cumulative effect of all weighting and adjustment steps. As shown in table B-4, the institution nonresponse weighting adjustment eliminated some, but not all, significant bias on the observable characteristics (estimates for sectors with fewer than 30 institutions excluded). Before weighting, the percentage of variable categories that were significantly biased ranged from 0 percent for four institutional sectors to 14.6 percent for public 4-year doctorate-granting institutions. After the nonresponse weight adjustment, the percentage of variable APPENDIX B-NPSAS:12 TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY B-13 categories that remained significantly biased ranged from 0 percent overall and for three institutional sectors to 15.6 percent for private for-profit 4-year institutions. In four of the five sectors with remaining significant bias (ranging from -10.6 to 5.1), the bias remained in one or two categories of the variables percentage of students receiving state/local grant aid, percentage of students receiving institutional grant aid, or percentage of Hispanic students enrolled. In the private for-profit 4-year sector, the bias (ranging from -2.5 to 5.1) remained in one or two categories of the variables percentage of students receiving student loan aid, total and female undergraduate enrollment, graduation rate, and tuition and fees. As shown in table B-5, the mean and median absolute differences between means for respondents before and after poststratification adjustment ranged from zero for private for-profit less-than-2-year institutions to 1.9 and 1.8, respectively, for private for-profit 2-year institutions (estimates for sectors with fewer than 30 institutions excluded). The mean and median absolute differences between means for the full sample and respondents after poststratification adjustment ranged from 0.5 and 0.4, respectively, for public 4-year non-doctorate-granting institutions to 6.5 to 4.7, respectively, for private for-profit less-than-2-year institutions.

The percentage of variable categories that remained significantly biased after the nonresponse weight adjustment ranged from 5.2 percent for students in private for-profit 2-year institutions to 28.1 percent for students in private for-profit less-than-2-year institutions. Overall, significant bias remained in one category of the variable tuition and fees; two categories of federal aid status, major, and degree program; and three categories of class level. Significant bias was -5.1 and 5.1 for the federal aid status categories and ranged from -0.6 to 0.5 for the other variables. For each sector, all variables had remaining significant bias for at least one category, except for CPS record available and instructional expense. Bias for federal aid status was significant for one or two categories in nine of the ten sectors and ranged from -8.6 to 8.7. Major had one to five categories with significant bias in five sectors, and degree program and class level had one or two categories with significant bias in six and five sectors, respectively. The remaining variables had one to four categories with significant bias in one or two sectors. Significant remaining bias for variables other than federal aid status ranged from -3.3 to 1.3, with the majority between -1.0 and 1.0.

The mean and median absolute differences between means for the full sample and respondents after poststratification adjustment ranged from 0.6 and 0.3, respectively, for students in public 4-year doctorate-granting institutions to 7.9 and 3.4, respectively, for students in private for-profit less-than-2-year institutions. Finally, an additional nonresponse bias analysis was conducted in which interview respondents and interview nonrespondents were compared, following the same procedures outlined above. As shown in table B-6, the nonresponse weighting adjustment eliminated some, but not all, student interview significant bias. Before weighting, the percentage of variable categories that were significantly biased on the basis of t-tests ranged from 14.5 percent for students in private nonprofit less-than-4-year institutions to 76.4 percent overall. Because study members, not interview respondents, are the unit of analysis in NPSAS:12, only a study member weight was created. As a result, nonresponse bias analyses after weight adjustments could not be computed. More information about remaining nonresponse bias after the nonresponse weight adjustment and the poststratification adjustment is available in tables B-6 and B-7, respectively. B-20 APPENDIX B-NPSAS:12 TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY Respondents before poststratification adjustment are weighted using the base weight, adjusted for multiplicity, unknown eligibility, and nonresponse. Respondents after poststratification adjustment are weighted using the base weight, adjusted for multiplicity, unknown eligibility, nonresponse, and poststratification. 2 Full sample is weighted using the base weight, adjusted for multiplicity and unknown eligibility. Respondents after poststratification adjustment are weighted using the base weight, adjusted for multiplicity, unknown eligibility, nonresponse, and poststratification. NOTE: Variable categories with fewer than 30 nonrespondents were suppressed for calculations in this "}, {"section_title": "Bias Analysis: Item-Level", "text": "NCES Statistical Standard 4-4-3A states: \"For an item with a low total response rate, respondents and nonrespondents can be compared on sampling frame and/or questionnaire variables for which data on respondents and nonrespondents are available. Base weights must be used in such analysis. Comparison items should have very high response rates. This approach may be limited to the extent that items available for respondents and nonrespondents may not be related to the low response rate item being analyzed\" (U.S. Department of Education 2003). Moreover, NCES Statistical Standard 1-3-5 states: \"Item response rates (RRI) are calculated as the ratio of the number of respondents for whom an in-scope response was obtained (I x for item x) to the number of respondents who are asked to answer that item. The number asked to answer an item is the number of unit level respondents (I) minus the number of respondents with a valid skip item for item x (V x ). When an abbreviated questionnaire is used to convert refusals, the eliminated questions are treated as item nonresponse. . . . In the case of constructed variables, the numerator includes cases that have available data for the full set of items required to construct the variable, and the denominator includes all respondents eligible to respond to all items in the constructed variable\" (U.S. Department of Education 2003). The item response rate is calculated as: A student was defined to be an item respondent for an analytic variable if that student had data for that variable from any source, including logical imputation. Item nonrespondents for analytic variables were study members who did not have data for that variable from any source. As shown in table B-8, the weighted item response rates for items used in this First Look Report for all students ranged from 46 percent to 100 percent. The weighted item response rates by type of institution ranged from 36 percent to 100 percent. The primary sources for the components of the composite variables for total grant amount (TOTGRT) and total student loan amount (TOTLOAN) were federal databases and data obtained from institutional student records. However, there were some types of aid that were often disbursed directly to students and not through the institutional financial offices. These included employer tuition reimbursements (EMPLYAMT), a component of total grants, and private loans (PRIVLOAN), a component of total loans. The primary source for these two components was the student interview. If the student did not complete an interview and the institutional records for that student did not contain any employer aid or private loans for the student, these two variables were set to missing and statistically or logically imputed, and the imputed values were used to construct the composites TOTGRT and TOTLOAN, which were the major components of the total aid variable TOTAID.    The replicate weights were produced using a methodology combining approaches developed by Flyer (1987) and Kott (1988). The NPSAS application of the method incorporated the finite population correction factor at the first stage only, following the methodology proposed by Chromy (1979)."}, {"section_title": "Cautions for Analysts", "text": "This section outlines key issues for analysts to consider when using NPSAS data, particularly when comparing different NPSAS administrations over time."}, {"section_title": "Comparison With Prior NPSAS Administrations", "text": "There have been eight NPSAS administrations covering the academic years ending in 1987, 1990, 1993, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012(NPSAS:87, NPSAS:90, NPSAS:93, NPSAS:96, NPSAS:2000. For the most part, the results are comparable, but there are several important differences across studies that limit comparisons over time. Puerto Rico. All administrations except NPSAS:87 and NPSAS:12 sampled institutions in Puerto Rico. There are approximately 80 institutions in Puerto Rico enrolling about 1 percent each of undergraduate and graduate students nationally. In NPSAS:08, students attending institutions in Puerto Rico made up about 10 percent of Hispanic students nationally. Analysts wishing to compare other NPSAS administrations to NPSAS:87 and NPSAS:12 or who are interested in national estimates for Hispanic students may filter on COMPTO87 to exclude Puerto Rico. Graduate programs. NPSAS:12 reflects changes to the classification of graduate degree programs. In NPSAS:08 and earlier surveys, graduate programs were classified as \"master's degree,\" \"doctor's degree,\" and \"first-professional degree.\" Some graduate students were also enrolled in a post-baccalaureate or post-master's certificate program or were not enrolled in any degree program. In NPSAS:12, the \"doctor's degree\" category was replaced with \"doctor's degree -research/scholarship,\" \"doctor's degree -professional practice,\" and \"doctor's degree -other,\" and the \"first-professional degree\" category was eliminated. Most of the graduate degrees formerly classified as \"firstprofessional degree\" were reclassified as \"doctor's degree -professional practice,\" but graduate degrees in Theology such as M.Div. and M.H.L./Rav were reclassified as \"master's degrees.\" The current graduate program categories are described in the entry for GRADDEG in appendix A. Title IV eligibility. Starting with NPSAS:2000, samples were limited to institutions participating in federal Title IV student aid programs. In the earlier surveys (NPSAS:87,NPSAS:90,NPSAS:93,and NPSAS:96), about 1 percent of undergraduate students, mainly concentrated in private for-profit less-than-2-year institutions, attended institutions that were not eligible for APPENDIX B-NPSAS:12 TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY"}, {"section_title": "B-25", "text": "Title IV aid. Analysts wishing to exclude students from institutions that were not eligible for Title IV may filter on T4ELIG in these earlier administrations. Community colleges. Over the past two decades, community colleges in many states began conferring a limited number of bachelor's degrees in selected fields. These institutions were reclassified from public 2-year institutions to public 4-year institutions in the IPEDS data used to determine institution types in NPSAS, even if most of the institutions' programs were below the bachelor's degree level. Analysts seeking an alternative classification of institutions that takes into consideration the proportion of bachelor's degrees awarded and is consistent across NPSAS:04, NPSAS:08, and NPSAS:12 should consider using the 2000 Carnegie Classification (CC2000). Estimates from imputed versus unimputed data. Starting with NPSAS:04, missing values were imputed for all, rather than a selected subset, of variables. Analysts should use caution when comparing estimates based on imputed data with estimates based on unimputed data. Distributions of imputed and unimputed variables are not directly comparable because imputed variables have no missing values, and imputation may appreciably change the distribution of valid values for variables with a substantial proportion of missing data. Fall enrollment. Starting with NPSAS:90, all NPSAS samples have been based on 12-month enrollment, which is higher than fall enrollment commonly reported by IPEDS because those who enroll only in spring, summer, or winter terms are included in the 12-month total. This is particularly true at less-than-4-year and private for-profit institutions where a substantial proportion of students may enroll throughout the year, and not necessarily during the fall. The NPSAS:87 sample was based on fall 1986 enrollment. Analysts wishing to compare NPSAS:87 results with those from subsequent administrations can filter on COMPTO87 in the later NPSAS administrations."}, {"section_title": "Students Attending Multiple Institutions", "text": "About 4 percent of undergraduate students and 4 percent of graduate students attended more than one institution during the 2011-12 academic year, concurrently or sequentially. These students may have attended institutions of differing types (public 4-year non-doctorate-granting, public 4-year doctorate-granting, and so forth) and may have had varying attendance patterns (full-time/full-year or other) at different institutions.
