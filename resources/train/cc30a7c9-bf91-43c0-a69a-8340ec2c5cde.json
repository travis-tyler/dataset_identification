Myers, Bruce Coffland, Lawrence R. Handley, and Thomas Mace lengths up to about 2 m also observable (Tyler-Walter, 2004). A canopy height similar to the leaf lengths can be found depending on the intertidal locations, environments, and water column properties. Eelgrass may distribute in patches, fringe beds, or in large meadows that provide vital ecological functions ranging from substrate stabilization to providing a nursery and refuge for a high diversity of animals and plants (Phillips, 1972). The health status of eelgrass beds may also serve as a water quality indicator for coastal ecosystems (Dennison et al., 1993). Given the high ecological importance of eelgrass beds and their reduction in distribution and abundance through shoreline development (Short and Burdick, 1996;Moore et al., 1996), maintaining an inventory of this important resource is crucial to assessing and developing mitigation plans to offset future natural and unnatural losses. Remote sensing has been used as a tool for mapping wetlands (e.g., National Wetlands Inventory Program) and coastal habitats (e.g., The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program, or C-CAP) for decades. Guidelines were established in C-CAP to use various remotely sensed data, such as natural color and color infrared aerial photography and multispectral imagery, for developing estuarine habitat maps in coastal regions (Dobson et al., 1999;Ferguson and Wood, 1990). Aerial photography has almost become the standard for most coastal wetland mapping (Ferguson and Wood, 1990;Ferguson et al., 1993;Pasqualini et al., 2001;Handley et al., 2004), because it can provide detailed spatial resolution (sub-meter resolution) for intertidal and even shallow water vegetation interpretation with a relatively strong spectral response in the visible wavelengths. However, aerial photography is usually not radiometrically corrected, and it has limited spectral resolution. Therefore, it is difficult to use a digital image classification procedure to quantify the distribution and abundance of eelgrass beds from digitally scanned aerial photographs, partly because of limited spectral resolution and partly because of the need for nonlinear calibration of exposures between and within each photograph frame. Consequently, most aerial photography has been used for mapping eelgrass only through a manual photointerpretation process. However, an experienced wetland expert with aerial photointerpretation skills is required to provide acceptable results in the photointerpreta-tion process. It can also be a time-consuming and laborintensive process (Mumby et al., 1999). Recent advances in satellite technology have offered great potential for eelgrass mapping, particularly the successful launching of the Ikonos satellite in late-1999 and the QuickBird satellite in late-2001. These satellites carry multispectral sensors with high spatial resolution, ranging from a few meters to sub-meter. Unfortunately, acquisition of satellite images for submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) mapping may not coincide with optimal conditions such as: (a) maximum low tide time window when the maximum area of vegetation is exposed to sunlight; (b) sediment brightness in the tidelands and under water where brighter background tends to have better delineation with SAV; and (c) water turbidity and depth where/when clearer and shallower water may produce more accurate results. Although the satellites (e.g., Ikonos) can be programmed at different view angles to increase the target acquisition opportunities, the time within maximum low tide window is still limited, especially in very cloudy coastal environments. The medium spatial resolution satellite sensors, such as Landsat Themaptic Mapper (TM) and SPOT multispectral sensor (e.g., SPOT XS), may offer some opportunities for mapping the changes at a regional scales in coastal wetlands with a relatively longer term historical image database and cost-effective approach (Ferguson and Korfmacher, 1997;Mumby et al., 1999;Mumby and Edwards, 2002). However, the medium spatial resolution (e.g., 30 m Landsat Thematic Mapper and 20 m SPOT High-Resolution Visible multispectral sensor) can hamper the actual use of the satellite images for mapping eelgrass beds or other SAV at a local scale if the eelgrass beds are in small patches (e.g., a few meters in diameter). In a recent study of detailed coral reef mapping, Lubin et al. (2001) used a coupled atmosphere-ocean discrete ordinates radiative transfer model to predict that satellite sensors, such as Landsat TM and Ikonos, may be adversely affected by the atmospheric Rayleigh scattering in the blue bands. Mumby and Edwards (2002) also demonstrated the weakness of satellite sensors (e.g., Landsat TM and Ikonos) over the airborne multispectral scanners (e.g., CASI) in their seagrass and coral reef mapping. Given all the pros and cons of currently available satellite sensors and aerial photography, we hypothesized that airborne multispectral sensors may be used very efficiently for mapping eelgrass at a local and/or regional scales. Airborne multispectral sensors can offer adequate spectral and spatial resolution with optimum control and flexibility to select maximum low tide time windows and minimum cloud cover for image acquisition and digital classification, and may provide a cost-effective, time-saving and consistent approach for mapping a relatively large area compared to conventional aerial photointepretation (Mumby et al., 1999;Mumby and Edwards, 2002). A few studies carried out in the Pacific Northwest have been conducted to validate the airborne multispectral sensors approach. In Tillamook Bay, Oregon, Strittholt and Frost (1996) used a 1 m resolution and three-band multispectral airborne imaging system to determine abundance and distribution of eelgrass. Their overall 80 percent accuracy for a digital image classification method with field verification indicated that airborne multispectral imagery may be a cost-effective approach for mapping eelgrass habitats. In a similar study, Ritter and Lanzer (1997) used a more advanced multispectral airborne sensor, the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI), to map nearshore vegetation in Washington State's Puget Sound. The CASI system in this study was configured in 11 bands ranging from visible to near-infrared spectral wavelengths with a 4 m spatial resolution. A classification accuracy assessment was performed using 164 field points of data to verify a classified image map derived from the CASI interpretation. Based on their confusion matrix analysis, producer (a measure of possibility of a class labeled into the same class as it appeared in the field) and user (a measure of possibility of a class labeled into the same class as it determined in the image classification process) accuracies for eelgrass class were 81.7 percent and 90.5 percent, respectively. A series of digital geographic information system (GIS) vector layers with various scales also was created in this project and served as important baseline information for coastal resources managers and decision-makers. More studies of seagrass mapping using high-resolution multispectral scanners were conducted in different parts of the coastal regions, such as in the tropical Western Atlantic (Mumby et al., 1997), over the Roscoff coastal zone of Brittany, France (Bajjouk et al., 1996;Bajjouk et al., 1998), and in the Turks and Caicos Islands of British West Indies (Mumby and Edwards, 2002). The results of these studies seem to suggest that the multispectral scanners are superior in overall accuracy and spectral and spatial resolution compared to the satellite sensors (e.g., Landsat TM, SPOT XS, and Ikonos). Given the capabilities and flexibility of airborne multispectral sensors, this study was intended to further demonstrate that an airborne multispectral scanner with 12 relatively broad bands ranging from visible, near-infrared and mid-infrared to thermal wavelengths at a 5 m spatial resolution, may offer efficiencies in mapping eelgrass beds and delineating coastal wetlands at a local scale, as well as providing comparable accuracies to traditional airphoto interpretation. Therefore, this investigation evaluated a multi-step eelgrass image classification of airborne multispectral scanner data collected over part of the Northern Puget Sound, Washington, using a conventional airphoto interpretation."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Airborne Image Acquisition and Data Preparation", "text": "We conducted this study in the Northern Puget Sound of the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community (SITC) reservation (48\u00b024\u0408 N, 122\u00b033\u0408 W), about 80 km north of Seattle, Washington (Figure 1). There are approximately 650 hectares of tidelands within the study area, about 90 percent of all tidelands on the SITC reservation. This project was part of a joint U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) -U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) effort to use advanced monitoring technology to protect the environment. A Daedalus 1268 multispectral scanner available from the Airborne Sensor Facility of the NASA Ames Research Center (Moffet Field, California) was used for this study. (Traditionally, this scanner is called the Airborne Thematic Mapper Simulator, as the Landsat TM bands can be synthesized from the higher resolution airborne data.) The 12 band sensor can be mounted either in a low altitude (flying at about 1.8 km altitude, such as KingAir Beechcraft B200 or Cessna Citation) aircraft to acquire multispectral scanner images at high spatial resolution (approximately 5 m) or in a high altitude (flying at about 20 km altitude, such as ER-2) aircraft to acquire medium (approximately 25 m) spatial resolution images. Total field of view from the sensor is 42.5 degrees. The 12 spectral bands cover a spectral range from visible, nearinfrared and mid-infrared to thermal wavelengths. Bands 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 11 (or 12) of the scanner have the same band wavelength as Landsat 4 or 5 Thematic Mapper bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 6 (thermal) ( Table 1). Additionally, four more bands in the sensor can provide more spectral information than the Landsat Thematic Mapper. The airborne multispectral scanner data were acquired on 30 July 2000 during a near maximum low tide time window (about \u03ea0.9 m MLLW) over an altitude of 1.8 km at a nadir pixel size of 5 m. This timing was selected to maximize the amount of SAV that would be exposed without water cover and to minimize water depth over the remaining beds. A total of four flight lines in a north and south direction covered the intertidal and upland areas of the SITC reservation. A Wild RC-10 camera also was mounted in the airplane to acquire high spatial resolution color infrared (CIR) aerial photographs. Both the airborne scanner imagery and CIR photography were acquired under cloud-free conditions with a few areas of sun glint over the southern part of the study area visible in the CIR photography. Post-flight calibration was carried out with all in-flight recorded calibration parameters. The airborne multispectral scanner image data sets for all flight lines were in excellent condition. In preparing the georeferenced base map, the CIR photographs were digitally scanned, and a professional photogrammetric engineering company created 1-foot spatial resolution Digital Orthophoto Quads (DOQ) to cover most of the SITC reservation. The horizontal and vertical accuracies of the DOQ were evaluated at \u03ee1.5 m (\u03ee5 ft) and \u03ee0.6 m (\u03ee2 ft) RMSE, respectively. All DOQ frames (created in the Washington State Plane projection coordinate system) were re-projected and re-sampled into the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection coordinate system with a 2 m spatial resolution. Finally, all DOQ frames were mosaicked together to create a DOQ base map layer for georeferencing the airborne scanner images acquired simultaneously."}, {"section_title": "Field Survey", "text": "In the month prior to the 30 July 2000 aerial mapping by NASA, field teams made up of personnel from the EPA Region 10 and from the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community established 11 ground control points from intertidal areas to the uplands in the study area. The control points were subsequently used to orthorectify the aerial photographs. In addition, the field teams also set up 21 SAV baseline stations, where composition and density of SAV were recorded and used to field verify interpretation and classification of the aerial photographs and airborne scanner imagery, respectively. The control point markers in intertidal or wetland areas were made of 0.8 m (30 inches) wide white butcher paper fixed to the substrate, and those on the uplands were located on blacktop pavements and painted white. The control point markers were either \"X\" or \"L\" shaped, the letters were at least 3 m (10 feet) long and each stripe was at least 0.6 m (2 feet) wide. A hand-held Trimble GeoExplorer \u00ae Global Positioning System (GPS) unit was used to record locations for the center of the \"Xs\" and the junction of the two legs of the \"Ls\". The recorded GPS files were post-processed using differential corrections to control the accuracy within \u03ee3 m. The composition and density of SAV beds were measured in 0.25 m 2 quadrats at the 21 baseline stations. Each 0.25 m 2 quadrat was divided by monofilament into 25 subunits measuring 10 cm \u03eb 10 cm. The field teams recorded the distribution and abundance of eelgrass (Zostera marina and Zostera japonica) and other SAV (Ulva spp., Fucus spp., Enteromorpha spp., and several unidentified species of red and brown algae) using point-intercept frequencies of occurrence (Young et al., 1998). Field personnel also sketched and photographed the eelgrass beds at each baseline station for additional information about eelgrass density measurement and its spatial extent of eelgrass nearby. This information was used to help photointerpretation and training pixel selection later. Plate 1 shows an example of an eelgrass density photograph taken over a 0.25 m 2 quadrat for station M3. The GPS position of the center of the eelgrass baseline station was also recorded and differentially corrected. The results of this part of the survey can be found in Table 2. The eelgrass beds were designated as north (N), middle (M), southwest (SW), or east (E), indicating their locations in the study area. The north beds surveyed were north of Kiket Island on the east side of Similk Bay, the middle beds extended south side of Kiket Island to Snee-Oosh Beach, the southwest and largest beds were southwest of Snee-Oosh Beach and north of the southern end of the Swinomish Channel, and the east beds were located in the Swinomish Channel (Plate 2)."}, {"section_title": "Image Processing and Analysis", "text": "To demonstrate and evaluate the procedure, one flight line covering more than 90 percent of the SAV in the study area was selected for the image analysis and processing. Ten of the 12 bands (excluding the two thermal bands) were used in the image classification. A simple tangential distortion correction algorithm was used to reposition each pixel along the scanline. The off-nadir pixels in each scanline were re-sampled based on the scanner's view angles between two adjacent pixels using a nearest neighbor approach to preserve the spectral response of each scanline. However, the geometric distortion caused by the Thermal airplane motion (roll, yaw, and pitch) and one-dimensional relief displacement was not geometrically corrected in the simple tangential distortion correction process. Because of the relatively stable flight conditions during the image acquisition and small topographic variation (approximately 3 to 5 m relief in the intertidal areas) of the study area, we used a non-parametric georeferencing approach. However, a first-order polynomial function for georeferencing the entire flight line could not achieve the spatial accuracy required for this study. Instead, we minimized the geometric effects with a stepwise 2-degree polynomial approach. First, we identified a total of 157 ground control points within the selected airborne scanner flight line and the DOQ base map layer through image matching. Then, we subdivided the entire flight line covering the study area into four segments with about 1,000 scanlines each. We built a 2-degree polynomial function for each segment and individually warped the scanner images into the DOQ base map coordinate system (UTM, WGS84, Zone 12) with a 5 m spatial resolution. Finally, we mosaicked all four segments of the warped images together to cover the study area. Errors for each segment image were controlled within \u03ee5 m or about one pixel RMSE of the warped segment images. Plate 2. Location of the baseline stations overlaid on the digital ortho-photo quads (DOQ). Plate 1. An example of eelgrass density measurement photograph taken at station number 3 in the middle section of eelgrass beds (M3) in the study area. (2) not measured; (3) stations E4-E5 were small patches that were incompletely surveyed. Delineating eelgrass beds in intertidal areas is an extremely complicated process because spectral signals of uplands (or non-tidal wetlands), water columns, sediments, rocks, algae, and other submerged aquatic vegetation types intend to mix and/or intersperse with spectral signal of eelgrass beds within an imagery. For example, eelgrass can be detected in shallow water with a light sediment background better than in deeper water with a dark sediment background. In addition, the spatial resolution of the image can play an important part in eelgrass bed delineation because of patchy/sparse distribution and variable abundance (density) of eelgrass beds. How ever, it should be noted that the pixel spatial resolution of the airborne multispectral scanner depends upon the flight altitude and is adjustable. In order to delineate the spectral variation in the intertidal areas, we elected to use a \"double elimination\" stepwise approach and consider one distinct spectral class at a time to extract eelgrass beds and other classes. The first step in this \"double elimination\" approach was to examine the spectral responses present in the entire flight line and the field survey information to define the number of classes that could be identified at the 5-meter spatial scale. Using an unsupervised classification (ISODATA method) for the entire flight line, we determined that some targets in the uplands and in the intertidal lands were spectrally similar in the multispectral scanner data. For example, the dark (shaded) forest areas in the uplands were confused with the dark signature of the eelgrass beds in the shallow water. Once we noticed these differences, we decided to mask the upland areas from the eelgrass beds classification. The intertidal areas and the water areas were defined by digitizing a polygon (area of interest) on the airborne image, thus eliminating the uplands. In some cases, salt marsh also was confused with the upland vegetation. However, use of contrast stretched multispectral imagery and high spatial resolution CIR aerial photography allowed us visually separate salt marsh areas from the uplands. After masking out the upland areas, the unsupervised classification (ISODATA method) was reapplied to the intertidal and water areas of the image to identify 25 classes. Our wetland expert and field survey personnel carefully Plate 3. The study area eelgrass classification result overlaid on the false color composites of airborne multispectral scanner image and a zoom-in classification map for details. examined the classification map and the field survey information. Finally, with this preliminary process, we were able to roughly label five classes from the 25 ISODATA classes in the intertidal areas at the 5-meter resolution ( Table 3). The second step in the \"double elimination\" approach was to eliminate water areas where seagrass and other SAV were no longer detectable by the airborne sensor during the time of image acquisition. We used an unsupervised classification method to define the boundary between the intertidal and the water areas. We also used a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) image derived from near-infrared and red bands to identify areas of SAV in the deeper water. These boundaries marked the intertidal regions for further image processing. The third step was to mask out the \"bare earth\" class where no SAV were detectable. We used the NDVI image again to extract the \"bare earth\" class from the image. Therefore, the only classes requiring image classification procedures were the eelgrass (sparse and dense), other SAV, and salt marsh classes as defined in Table 3. The fourth step was to develop the training classes from field baseline survey information. Because of the limited spatial extent of each baseline station (0.25 m 2 quadrat each), we had to locate the pixels in and nearby each selected baseline station with the field photographs and sketches from the baseline stations using image analysis software. From these areas of the image, a sufficient sample size (at least 35 pixels) was extracted for each training class using the pixel region growth tool in the image analysis software. Training pixels for each class also were verified in the DOQ aerial photographs (1-foot resolution) with photointerpretation. The fifth step was to evaluate the spectral separability of training classes. Each training class pair was controlled at a maximum separability value from 1.8 to 2.0, using the Jeffries-Matusita transformed divergence measure (Jensen, 1986). Using the separability of the training classes as a measure of uniqueness, we maximized the statistical differences between training sets in the classification stage. The sixth step was to perform a supervised classification with a maximum likelihood classifier for the study area with the classes listed in Table 3, except \"bare earth.\" The seventh and final step was to refine the classified image by adjusting classification rule images using different thresholds, especially for dense and sparse eelgrass classes. The finalized classification was combined with the \"bare earth\" class. A total of 2.8 percent of the pixels were unclassified, most of which were in small patches identified as wood debris, logs, tree shadows, or other SAV mixed with salt marsh close to the upland edge within the wetland boundary. Therefore, we assigned the unclassified pixels into a \"salt marsh/mixed\" class in the final classification image. Plate 3 shows all classes overlaid (except \"bare earth\") on the false color composite of the airborne scanner image. We summarized the \"double-elimination\" stepwise approach in a flowchart shown in Figure 2."}, {"section_title": "Accuracy Analysis", "text": "We choose a photointerpretation approach rather than a field survey method to verify the image classification. This is largely because of cost and time constraints and the limitation of a narrow maximum low tide time window for a field validation. We first used a stratified random point sampling approach to generate 295 points over the classified image. A minimum of 30 points was selected for each class to guarantee a 90 percent confidence interval for accuracy, as suggested by Congalton (1991) and others (Senseman et al., 1995;Jensen, 1986;Fitzpatrick-Lins, 1981;van Genderen and Lock, 1977). After generating 295 points, we used each point to define the center of a 2 \u03eb 2 pixel window. The window size of 10 \u03eb 10 m (5 m per pixel) was chosen mainly because the geometric accuracy of the scanner data was estimated at \u03ee5 m. We overlaid 295 accuracy point windows on the classified image to extract class value for each point with a majority rule within the 10 \u03eb 10 m area (or the 2 \u03eb 2 pixel window). The field survey personnel and other experts with extensive wetland experience independently conducted the photointerpretation of each accuracy point window overlaid on the DOQ base map (2 m pixel resolution). The CIR photographs (1-foot resolution) of the study area also were used to assist the interpretation process for verification of each class. The vegetation of each 10 \u03eb 10 m area was interpreted and classified based on the proportion of the area covered by each class and a visible estimate of eelgrass area. The area coverage by the DOQ was smaller than the total area of the airborne scanner classified image. Therefore, Figure 2. Flowchart for the \"double-elimination\" stepwise approach. "}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Mapping Accuracy Evaluation The final confusion matrix for the overall accuracy assessment is shown in Table 4. We archived an overall accuracy of 92 percent for mapping eelgrass in this study with 0.92 Kappa Coefficient. We must point out that we obtained the overall accuracy of 92 percent after lumping unclassified (2.8 percent) pixels into the \"salt marsh\" class as \"salt marsh/mixed.\" Two of the 34 point areas photointerpreted as the eelgrass sparse class were misclassified as the bare earth class; while 3 of the 34 point areas photointerpreted as the eelgrass sparse class were categorized as the eelgrass dense (Table 4). We believe that the brightness of the sediments, the difference in spatial resolution between the scanner image and the DOQ CIR aerial photographs, and possible georeferencing accuracy may have caused the uncertainty of boundaries among these three classes. We further evaluated producer and user accuracy for each individual class and found that the producer accuracy for eelgrass sparse (76.5 percent) and user accuracy for other SAV (77.1 percent) were relatively low (Table 5). Some uncertainty between eelgrass and other SAV may exist because of spectral (mostly mixing of background brightness) and spatial limitations in the data and in the classification procedures. However, a 95 percent of producer accuracy for \"eelgrass dense\" class was impressive for eelgrass mapping. The results seem to be in agreement with the early study carried out by Ritter and Lanzer (1997) in the same region with a CASI scanner. In addition, Mumby and Edwards (2002) concluded an 89 percent of overall accuracy over a coarse habitat area (including coral, macroalgae, seagrass, and sand habitats) in the Turks and Caicos Islands of British West Indies using a similar CASI scanner. They also compared the CASI sensor with Landsat TM and Ikonos satellite sensors, which yielded an overall accuracy of 73 percent and 68 percent, respectively. Ferguson and Korfmacher (1997) reported a similar overall accuracy of 72.6 percent for Landsat TM in their study carried in the coastal region of North Carolina. Results from previous studies and this study suggest that the advantage of spectral and spatial resolution of multispectral scanners can play an important part for eelgrass mapping. Despite of some confusing within eelgrass classes (dense and sparse), results from this study indicate that the use of airborne multispectral scanner data for eelgrass mapping can be practical and useful even though there may be some room for further improvement by refining and developing a more accurate, cost saving, and efficient procedure."}, {"section_title": "Implementation for Coastal Ecosystem Mapping", "text": "Eelgrass, Zostera marina, is one of the best-understood marine benthic plants, both in terms of life history and as a bioindicator (Berry et al., 2003). Therefore, monitoring the health of eelgrass beds is an indirect measure of the many ecological functions performed by these biologically rich areas. Natural fluctuations in eelgrass abundance are important to understand in order to accurately access humaninduced changes and to prevent or minimize them in the future. Our high-resolution survey accurately mapped the intertidal eelgrass beds as they occurred in July 2000. Most of the subtidal beds were also mapped as the leaves of plants in this area were floating on the surface during the approximately \u03ea0.9 m (\u03ea3 feet) MLLW tide that occurred in our study area on 30 July 2000. Dive surveys in the Similk Bay conducted in a previous study (Washington Department of Natural Resources, 1996) found that the eelgrass beds only extended down to a water depth of approximately \u03ea1.5 m (5 feet) MLLW. By surface inspections of the Skagit Bay beds in this study, we found that most of the beds were much shallower than the maximum depth (\u03ea8.8 m or \u03ea29 feet MLLW) reported by Berry et al. (2003) for eelgrass beds in Puget Sound. Future surveys using a similar remote sensing technology at a water depth of near MLLW should give a clear indication of the changes, if any, in eelgrass distribution and abundance. If significant changes have occurred, further investigations would be needed to evaluate those chemical and physical stressors that may be responsible for those changes. Tribal, state, and federal agencies are vitally interested in the health of shoreline resources that support many fish and invertebrate species of subsistence, recreational, or commercial value. An example of these concerns is the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife policy of \"no-net-loss\" of eelgrass beds (Fresh, 1994). Intergovernmental coordination and actions would likely be required in the event that the distribution and abundance of eelgrass beds in our study area were significantly reduced. The present eelgrass survey would serve as the baseline from which changes could be assessed."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion and Remarks", "text": "This study has demonstrated that high-resolution airborne multispectral scanner data can be valuable and useful for mapping eelgrass beds at local and regional scales. The overall accuracy of 92 percent using the airborne multispectral scanner in this study seems to agree with previous studies carried out in the same region (Strittholt and Frost, 1996;Ritter and Lanzer, 1997) and other locations (Bajjouk et al., 1996;Mumby et al., 1997  Overall accuracy = 92.3%, Kappa Coefficient 0.92 Note: (1) indicates that the producer accuracies in the parentheses."}, {"section_title": "2002", "text": "). An excellent producer accuracy of 95 percent was obtained for eelgrass dense class. The relatively low producer accuracy of 76.5 percent for eelgrass sparse class needs to be further improved. Some uncertainty of mixing spectral response between eelgrass sparse and other SAV may be related to the variation of sediment background brightness, spectral and spatial resolution of the imagery. Development of improved classification procedures and a better sensor technology, such as hyperspectral scanners, may be further studied specifically for eelgrass mapping. Some technical advantages of using the airborne multispectral scanner can be summarized as: (a) flexible acquisition time that can be scheduled at or near maximum low-tide time windows to reduce water column effect and to minimize cloud cover; (b) relatively high spatial and spectral resolution for local scale mapping; and (c) the use of more automated image classification procedures rather than the time-consuming field survey approach. We also suggest that acquisition of airborne multispectral scanner imagery at and near maximum low tide time windows can optimize the detection and delineation of eelgrass beds in relatively deeper water.
