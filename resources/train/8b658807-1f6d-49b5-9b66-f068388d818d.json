[{"section_title": "", "text": "Percentage of non-U.S. citizen doctorate recipients with definite plans to remain in the United States after graduation, by visa status for selected years, 1974-1994 1 INTRODUCTION Summary Report 1994 is the 28th in a series of reports on research doctorates awarded by U.S. colleges and universities. Like its predecessors, this report presents trends in doctorate production in the United States, describing the general demographic characteristics of doctorate recipients and the seven broad fields in which they earned their degrees. Each of the seven broad fields consists of several \"major\" fields biological sciences is a major field within the broad field of life sciences, and psychology is a major field within the broad field of social sciences). The doctorate recipients themselves report their field of study and are counted accordingly. For a list of the fields discussed in this report, see the inside back cover and the specialties list in Appendix D. (Note: These field groupings may differ from those used by federal sponsors of the survey.) The front section of Summary Report 1994 presents brief narratives of key survey findings, accompanied by figures showing selected trend data. The numbers and percentages from which the figures were drawn are provided in a set of tables following the front section: relevant tables are referenced at the bottom of the figures. The front section also includes major findings from data presented in tables but not in figures. Although similar in content to last year's report, Summary Report 1994 presents additional data on citizenship, offers more sophisticated analyses of differences among demographic groups, and uses months as well as years to calculate medians. Supplementary tables on 1994 doctorate recipients are displayed in Appendix A. and trend data on the 1984-1994 Ph.D. cohorts are presented in Appendix B. Appendix C provides technical notes that include nonresponse rates and other information related to tables and figures in the body of the report. Appendix D contains a copy of the survey questionnaire. Additional information is available from the Doctorate Records Project upon request. For a cost. the Project offers tables on the baccalaureate origins of Ph.D.s by major field of doctorate and tables on the doctoral 'specialties of Ph.D.s by citizenship. race/ethnicity, and gender. Customized tables can also be prepared at cost. For more information, please contact: Item response rates have shown a parallel improvement since 1990a natural consequence of the increase in the overall self-report rate, as well as a result of format revisions to the questionnaire and follow-ups for missing information. In 1990, new follow-up procedures were implemented to increase coverage of several variables: birth year, gender, race/ethnicity, citizenship status, country of citizenship, baccalaureate year and institution, and postgraduation plans. Response rates for these variables have since improvedespecially for citizenship and race/ethnicity, resulting in an increase in the re, orted numbers of minority Ph.D.s. The data for a given year are updated the following year with any responses received after survey closure. Postsurvey adjustment was most significant for 1990 and 1991 Ph.D.s, with the largest impact on the number of blacks. For both of these years, the total number of black Ph.D.s increased by about 7.5 percent in the year after survey closure. The survey cycle was then extended to allow receipt of more follow-up information before closure, resulting in much smaller postsurvey adjustments for both 1992 and 1993 data (a 1.4 percent increase in black Ph.D.s for 1992 and only a 0.2 percent increase for 1993). The same is expected for 1994 data. Adjustments to data are presented in reports subsequent to the initial report for a survey. Updates for 1992 appeared in Summary Report 1993, and those for 1993 are included in this year's report (see Appendix Tabli B-2 for adjustments to racial/ethnic data). The data for 1994 will likewise be subject to further revision, but as for the last two years, adjustments are expected to be minimal. Updates to 1994 data will be presented in next year's report. In using SED data, the reader should keep in mind that numerical trends are affected by fluctuations in response rates. Increasing or decreasing numbers in a citizenship or racial/ethnic group reflect to some degree any change in both overall survey response and item response. 3EST C,C,PY AVAILABLE"}, {"section_title": "TRENDS IN DOCTORATE RECIPIENTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Selected Demographic Characteristics", "text": "The number of new Ph.D.s increased to an all-time high of 41,011 in 1994. This record continues the upward trend in doctoral attainment that started in 1986 after a period of stagnation during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The doctorates awarded in 1994 were granted by 372 colleges and universities in the United States and Puerto Rico. \"Ph.D.\" is used throughout this report to refer not just to the Doctor of Philosophy degreeand recipients of this degreebut also to any of the other doctoral degrees covered by the survey. Over 88 percent of the degrees earned in 1994 actually were the Doctor of Philosophy. More than two-thirds of the remaining degrees were Ed.D.s or other doctorates in education. A full list of included degrees can be found inside the back cover. Women once again earned a record number of Ph.D.s (15,806 in 1994), while men still fell short of their record number of doctorates in 1972 (25,205 in 1994 compared to 27,754 in 1972). While the number of male Ph.D.s in 1994 roughly doubled from 12,764 in 1964, the number of female Ph.D.s in 1994 increased more than ten-fold from 1,561 in 1964. Women's representation jumped from 11 percent in 1964 to an all-time high of 39 percent in 1994. 1969 1974 1979 1984 1989 1994 Year See Tables 1 and 2, page 21. SOURCE: National Research Council, Survey of Earned Doctorates."}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "Selected Demographic Characteristics U.S. citizens earned over two-thirds of the doctorates awarded to those with known citizenship in 1994. (See Appendix Table B-2, page 75.) The 27,105 doctorates awarded to U.S. citizens is the highest such number since 1976 (27,269) and continues a recovery that began in 1988. Nevertheless, the share of doctorates awarded to non-U.S. citizens has increased steadily over the last 30 years, rising from less than 14 perceht (1,931 Ph.D.$) in 1964 to almost 33 percent (13,134 Ph.D.$) in 1994. In 1994, non-U.S. citizen Ph.D.s on temporary visas outnumbered those on permanent visas by about two-and-a-half to one: 9,393 compared to 3,741. Temporary residents earned 23 percent of all Ph.D.s; permanent residents earned 9 percent. In 1993, the temporary-to-permanent ratio was four to one. (Note: Temporary residents are nonimmigrants who are granted visas for a specified temporary period. Permanent residents are immigrants who are granted permanent legal U.S. residence.) For the second consecutive year, the number of doctorates earned by temporary residents declined: from 9,921 Ph.D.s in 1993 to 9,323 Ph.D.s in 1994. The 23 percent share of Ph.D.s earned by temporary residents in 1994 is down from 26 percent in 1993, but is still much higher than their 10 percent share of Ph.D.s in 1964. Permanent residents surged from less than six percent of Ph.D.s in 1993 to over nine percent of Ph.D.s in 1994. Their 3,741 degrees in 1994 shattered 1993's record high of 2,254. (See Appendix Table 3-2, page 78.) The four-to-one ratio of temporary to permanent residents' doctorates in 1993 would have been unchanged in 1994 but for citizens of the People's Republic of China (PRC). (See Table 4, page 23.) This can be explained by particular consequences of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, an event widely reported to have given many temporary residents from the PRC the incentive to try to become eligible for permanent visas. The ratio of the numbers of doctorates earned by temporary and permanent residents began to change among PRC citizens in 1991. The change among PRC citizens, almost imperceptible at first, was large enough by 1993 to cause the first decline in 15 years in the number of doctorates earned by temporary residents overall. This process was then accelerated by the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992, which made thousands of' PRC citizens in the U.S. eligible to apply for permanent residency on July 1, 1993. Since this happened to be the date defined by this survey as the beginning of the 1994 academic year, the effect of this law on the 1994 figures was dramatic. Citizens of the People's Republic of China accounted for over a fifth (21 percent) of all non-U.S. Ph.D. recipients in 1994. (See Table 5, page 23.) Another third originated from three other Asian countries: Taiwan (12 percent), the Republic of Korea (II percent), and India (10 percent). Among the leading countries of origin of non-U.S. Ph.D. recipients, Japan rose from tenth place in 1993 to seventh in 1994, accounting for almost two percent of' non-ll.S. doctorates. Lebanon entered the top 30, replacing the Netherlands.  See technical notes in Appendix C for rates of nonresponse to the question on citizenship status.

However, women remained substantially outnumbered in the fields of life sciences (42 percent of Ph.D.$), physical sciences (20 percent), and engineering (II percent). Although women Ph.D.s increased in every broad field over the last 30 years, men experienced major declines after the early 1970s in social sciences, humanities, and education. While men's numbers in social sciences have stabilized in recent years, and their numbers in humanities have slowly risen, their decline in the field of education has continued.

SOURCE: National Research Council, Survey of Eartvd Doctorates. As in the previous three years. university funding (mostly via teaching and research assistantships) was the primary source of graduate school support for the majority of 1994 Ph.D.s (52 percent). (See Table 12, page 30.) Another 36 percent of Ph.D.s were primarily supported by personal resources (own earnings; family contributions: loans) and the remaining 12 percent by other resources (federal or state governments; nonfederal competitive fellowships; businesses/employers). The type of primary support varied greatly by field. University sources were most common in the physical and life sciences and in engineering (reported by well over half of recipients). Personal resources were easily the most typical in education (reported by 79 percent of recipients). Male Ph.D. recipients were primarily supported by their university; female Ph.D. recipients relied primarily on pe-sonal resources. Over two-thirds of non-U.S. citizens reported university support as their primary source of financing, whereas U.S. citizens were somewhat more apt to be supported by personal than by university resources. In most U.S. racial/ethnic groups, the largest proportion of Ph.D.s also indicated personal funds as their primary source of financial support; however, university funding was the chief means of support for more than half of Asian Americans. These differences were due in large part to the field concentrations of the various demographic groups. Even within most fields, however, university funding was more likely to be the primary means of support for Asian Americans than it was for Black and Hispanic Americans.  Almost half (47 percent) of all Ph.D.s in 1994 reported debt related to their combined undergraduate and graduate education. The majority of those with debt reported ov., ing more than $10,000. Doctorate recipients in engineering were the least likely to have incurred educational debt (38 percent), while those in social sciences were the most likely (62 percent). Indebted social scientists also owed the most money: over three-fifths of social science Ph.D.s with lebt owed more than $10,000, and over one-fifth owed more than $30.000. In contrast, nore than half of the indebted Ph.D.s in both the life sciences and the physical sciences owed $10,000 or less. (See Table 13, page 31.) Men and women reported debt in equal proportions and had about the same levels of debt. Non-U.S. citizens were much less likely to have incurred debt than U.S. citizens. the majority of whom were indebted. Temporary residents were more likely than permanent residents to report debt and to report a very high level of debt (Table 14. page 31); this is surprising in that temporary residents rely less than permanent residents on personal sources of support, the category that includes loans (Table 12. page 30). Hispanic Americans were the most likely of U.S. racial/ethnic groups to have educational debt. Black Americans were the most likely to report the hilzhest le% el of debt. (See Table 14, page 31.)  "}, {"section_title": "Postgraduation Plans", "text": "The proportion of Ph.D.s reporting definite postgraduation commitments declined from about two-thirds in the 1970s and 1980s to about three-fifths in 1994. (See \"Definite commitments,\" page 87.) Of those Ph.D.s in 1994 who did report having definite postgraduation commitments, 71 percent planned to be employed while 29 percent planned postdoctoral study. (Postdoctoral appointments are considered to be study rather than employment in this report.) The proportion of new Ph.D.s with postdoctoral study plans has steadily increased since 1974, when only 15 percent planned further study. (See Table  15, page 32.) Doctorate recipients in education and professional/other fields were the most likely to have work plans (96 percent), followed closely by Ph.D.s in the humanities (93 percent). Study plans were by far most common in the iife sciences (64 percent). The majority of Ph.D.s in every major demographic group planned to work rather than pursue further study after grad...Ition. However, women were even more inclined towards employment than were men, and U.S. citizens were even more apt to work than were foreign citizens. A significant proportion of permanent visa-holders (45 percent) planned to continue their studies. Among the aggregate of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, blacks had the largest proportion with work plans (about 83 percent), and Asians had the largest proportion with study plans (49 percent). (See Table 16, page 33.) These patterns are explained mainlyand for blacks and women, entirelyby the fields in which these different groups tend to earn degrees.   See technical notes in Appendix C for rates of nonresponse to the applicable questions and for further explanation of postgraduation plans. SOURCE: National Research Council, Survey of Earned Doctorates.\nOf those who reported definite postdoctoral commitments in 1994, permanent residents were much more likely than temporary residents to plan to remain in the United States immediately after graduation (90 percent versus 52 percent). However, the proportion of temporary resident Ph.D.s planning to stay was higher in 1994 than in 1974 (34 percent). Among permanent residents, the percentage of Ph.D.s reporting plans to stay in the United States was about the same as twenty years ago. (See Table 17, page 34.) Postdoctoral study was planned by over half of the temporary residents who intended to remain in the United States, while permanent residents who intended to remain in the United States were more apt to work than to study.

In 1994, as in earlier years, academe was the primary employer of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who had definite commitments for employment in the United States after graduation. However, the proportion of Ph.D.s intending to work in academe was smaller than 20 years ago (52 percent in 1994 versus 62 ty:xcent in 1974). (See Table 19. page 36.) Plans for employment in industry (including self-employment) increased from 13 percent of Ph.D.s in 1974 to 20 percent of Ph.D.s in 1994. \"Other\" employment sectors (namely K-12 schools and nonprofit organizations) showed almost as great an increase as industry, from 13 percent in 1974 to 19 percent in 1994. The sector of planned employment varied by field. In 1914, academic employment plans were most predominant in the humanities (85 percent) and professional/other fields (73 percent). Industry was most frequently reported among engineers (61 percent) and physical scientists (47 percent). Academic employment plans were more prevalent among women than men (59 percent versus 47 percent), and the proportion of men in industry (26 percent) was more than twice that of women. The majority of Ph.D.s in every racial/ethnic group but Asians reported plans to work in academe. Asians favored industry (49 percent) over acaciemic employment (38 percent). (See Table 20, page 37.)

Therefore, differences in response rates from year to year can produce numerical fluctuations that are unrelated to real trends. Although response to the SED has been 95 to 98 percent in most years, it declined to 92 percent during the 1980s. In an effort to improve the response rate, the survey methodology was modified in the years after 1989. Response has risen as hoped, stabilizing around 95 percent during the last four years (1991 to 1994). (Note: These percentages represent self-report rates, i.e., the proportion of questionnaires completed by doctorate recipients. While survey forms containing partial information filled in by either the doctoral institution or staff of the National Research Council are not included in these rates, tables in this report incorporate the available data from these forms.) The self-report rate for 1994 may increase slightly in the next year if additional questionnaires are received from doctorate recipients. See page 82 in Appendix C for a table giving survey response rates from 1964 to 1994. Item response rates have shown a parallel improvement since 1990a natural consequence of the increase in the overall self-report rate, as well as a result of format revisions to the questionnaire and follow-ups for missing information. In 1990, new follow-up procedures were implemented to increase coverage of several variables: birth year, gender, race/ethnicity, citizenship status, country of citizenship, baccalaureate year and institution, and postgraduation plans. Response rates for these variables have since improvedespecially for citizenship and race/ethnicity, resulting in an increase in the reported numbers of minority Ph.D.s. The data for a given year are updated the following year with any responses received after survey closure. Postsurvey adjustment was most significant for 1990 and 1991 Ph.D.s, with the largest impact on the number of blacks. For both of these years, the total number of black Ph.D.s increased by about 7.5 percent in the year after survey closure. The survey cycle was then extended to allow receipt of more follow-up information before closure, resulting in much smaller postsurvey adjustments for both 1992 and 1993 data (a 1.4 percent increase in black Ph.D.s for 1992 and only a 0.2 percent increase for 1993). The same is expected for 1994 data. Adjustments to data are presented in reports subsequent to the initial report for a survey. Updates for 1992 appeared in Summary Report 1993, and those for 1993 are included in this year's report (see Appendix Table B-2 for adjustments to racial/ethnic data). The data for 1994 will likewise be subject to further revision, but as fa: the last two years, adjustments are expected to be minimal. Updates to 1994 data will be presented in next year's report. In using SED data, the reader should keep in mind that numerical trends are affected by fluctuations in response rates. Increasing or deci easing numbers in a citizenship or racial/ethnic group reflect to some degree any change in both overall survey response and item response. TABLE A-1 and TABLE A-2: Tables A-I and A-2 display data for the most recent year by subfield of doctorate. The subfields correspond to the fields on the questionnaire's Specialties List located at the back of this report. Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). See inside the back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in these tables. The \"general\" field categoriese.g., \"chemistry, general\"include individuals who either received the doctorate in the general subject area or did not indicate a particular specialty field. The \"othcr\" field categoriese.g., \"chemistry, other\"include individuals whose specified doctoral discipline was not among the specialty fields.  from the most recent year; the other two tables present the same data by gender. Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the SED. See inside the back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in these tables; see the questionnaire's Specialties List at the back of the report for the names and codes of the subfields included. Terms requiring definition are as follows:"}, {"section_title": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE", "text": "Percentage with Master's: The percentage of doctorate recipients in a field who received a master's degree in any field before earning the doctorate. Median Age at Doctorate: One-half received the doctorate at or before this age. A recipient's age is obtained by subtracting the month/year of birth from the month/year of doctorate. (See note at bottom of page.) Median Time Lapse: \"Total Time\" refers to the total calendar time elapsed between the month/year of baccalaureate and the month/year of doctorate; \"Registered Time\" refers to the actual time in attendance at colleges and universities between receipt of the baccalaureate and the doctorate. Enrollment includes years of attendance not related to a recipient's doctoral program."}, {"section_title": "NOTE about medians:", "text": "The method of computing medians has been revised. Beginning with Summary Report 1994, months (of birth, baccalaureate, and doctorate) are included in the calculations whenever available; if months are missing, only years are used in the calculations. Medians presented in all earlier reports were based only on years. Some medians would be the same regardless of the method of computation, but the new method generally computes slightly difterent results than are obtained by the old method. While differences are small (usually one-or two-tenths of a year), the reader should consider these differences when comparing medians presented in this report with those in earlier reports. Postgraduation Plans: Each year's doctorate recipients provide information on postgraduation employment or study plans in response to items 20-24 on the survey form. Since the questionnaire is filled out around the time the doctorate is awarded, a recipient's plans are subject to change. However, comparisons with the longitudinal Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) have shown SED data to be a reasonable indicator of actual employment status in the year following the doctorate, although results vary by sector. (The SDR, also conducted by the National Research Council, is a follow-up employment survey of a sample of doctorate recipients in science, engineering, and humanities fields.) For a comparison of the immediate postgraduation plans of Ph.D.s in the 1992 SED with their employment status in the 1993 SDR, see the following table; refer to the footnote on page 86 in Appendix C for additional information on Ph.D.s who reported definite commitments at the time they completed the SED questionnaire. * Because of the 9-22 month gap between SED graduation dates and SDR reference date, the percentage of Ph.D.s reporting postdoctoral appointments in both the 1992 SED and the 1993 SDR is understandably lower than the comparisons for the employment sectors. It is likely that many postdoctoral appointments were completed before the 1993 SDR reference date. In Table A-3, the postgraduation plans of doctorate recipients are grouped as follows: \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\" (fellowship, research associateship, traineeship, other), \"Planned Employment After Doctorate\" (educational institution, industry, etc.), and \"Postdoctoral Plans Unknown.\" These categories include recipients who were still negotiating or seeking positions at the time of survey completion, as well as those whose plans were definite. The sum of these lines equals 100 percent for each column, with allowance for rounding: for example, 55.7 percent of all chemists had postdoctoral study plans, 37.7 percent planned to be employed, and 6.6 percent did not report their postgraduation plans, totaling 100 percent. The study and employment rows are further subdivided. The data on study plans show that 26.1 percent of all chemists planned to pursue postdoctoral fellowships; 28.2 percent, research associateships; 0.4 percent, traineeships; and 1.0 percent, some other form of postdoctoral study. These percentages sum to 55.7 percent, the proportion of chemists who reported plans for postdoctoral study. The employment row is similarly subdivided by type of employer. The percentages for these rows add to 37.7 percentthe proportion of chemistry Ph.D.s who planned employment. The category for educational institutions includes elementary and secondary schools as well as colleges and universities, and the category for government includes military service. The four lines of data beginning with \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" distinguish between individuals who had definite postgraduation plans at the time of survey completion (item 20: \"Am returning to, or continuing in, predoctoral employment\" or \"Have signed contract or made definite commitment\") and those who were still seeking employment or postdoctoral study (item 20: \"Am negotiating with one or more specific organizations,\" \"Am seeking position but have no specific prospects,\" or \"Other\"). These four lines, when added to the prior line. \"Postdoctoral Plans Unknown,\" total 100 percent with allowance for rounding. The two lines \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" and \"Seeking Postdoctoral Study\" add to give the percentage for \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\"; the two lines \"Definite Employment\" and \"Seeking Employment\" add to give the percentage for \"Planned Employment After Doctorate.\" Percentages showing the distribution of doctorate recipients by postdoctoral work activity and region of employment are based only on the number of recipients who had definite employment commitments at the time they completed the questionnaire. These percentages exclude recipients who planned postdoctoral study (as described above) and recipients who were still seeking employment at the time they completed the questionnaire. (Note that the rows on specific postdoctoral study and employment plans discussed earlier include individuals whose plans were not definite). Revisions to the questionnaire format beginning in 1990 appear to have resulted in higher rates of nonresponse to the item on work activity in recent years (11.9 percent in 1994 compared to only 6.2 percent in 1989). However, nonresponse has dropped since 1993, when the rate was 15.1 percent.  Tables A-3 and A-5. Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the SED. See inside the back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in these tables; refer to the questionnaire's Specialties List at the back of the report for the names and codes of the subfields included. See the notice on page 41 for important information on changes in response rates and their impact on time-series data. The racial/ethnic question has undergone several revisions over the years. In 1977, it was modified to correspond to a standard question format recommended by the Federal Interagency Committee on Education and adopted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for use in federally sponsored surveys; an explanation of the effect of these changes is detailed on page 13 of Summary Report 1977. (Note: Changes in the OMB guidelines prompted the moving of persons having origins in the Indian subcontinent from the white category to the Asian category.) In 1980, the item was further revised in two ways: (1) the Hispanic category was subdivided into Puerto Rican, Mexican American, and other Hispanic to provide more detail for users of the racial/ethnic data, and (2) respondents were asked to check only one racial category. (Before 1980, doctorate recipients could check more than one category to indicate their race.) The item was modified again in 1982 to separate the questions on race and ethnicity. Since then, respondents have been asked to first check one of the four racial group categories (American Indian, Asian, black, or white) and then indicate whether or not they are Hispanic In Table A-4. Ph.D.s who reported Hispanic heritage, regardless of racial designation, are included in one of three Hispanic groups: Puerto Rican. Mexican American, or other iiispanic. The remaining survey respondents are then counted in the respective racial groups. (Note: Doctorate recipients who checked the category \"American Indian or Alaskan Native\" are identified as Native American in this report.) medians has been revised. Beginning with Summary Report 1994, months (of birth, baccalaureate, and doctorate) are included in the calculations whenever available: if months are missing, only years are used in the calculations. Medians presented in all earlier reports were based only on years. Some medians would be the same regardless of the method of computation, but the new method generally computes slightly cirri 'rent results than are obtained by the old method. While differences are small (usually one-or two-tenths of a year), the reader should consider these differences when comparing medians presented in this report with those in earlier reports. See note on Table A-3 Jiir definitions. In the section on \"Graduate School Support,\" a recipient counts in more than one category if support was received from multiple sources. Because a student counts once for each of his/her sources of support, the vertical percentages sum to more than 100 percent. See the explanatory note on Appendix Table A-5 for further detail. (Data on the primary source of support for doctorate recipients are presented in the body of the report.) The other sections of Table A-4 correspond to many of those in Appendix Table A-3. The reader is referred to the explanatory note on Table A-3 for additional   information. TABLE A-5: Table A-5 displays data reported in item 17 on sources of financial support received during graduate school, by broad field and gender of recipient.

A recipient counts in more than one category in Table A5 if support was received from multiple sources. Bccause a student counts once for each of his/her sources of support, the vertical percentages sum to more than 100 percent. (Data on the primary source of support for doctorate recipients are presented in the body of the report.) Beginning with Summary Report 1990, federal research assistantships (RAs) have been aggregated with university RAs and shown under \"University Research Assistant\" in this table. (Focus groups of doctoral candidates have indicated uncertainty as to the source of their RA funding; it is therefore likely that some RAs have incorrectly identified support provided by the federal government as university rather than federal.) The reader is advised not to compare sources of support data presented in the 1990-1994 Summary Reports with data in earlier reports because percentages appear higher for university and lower for federal support in tables where all RAs are aggregated as \"University Research Assistants.\" The data in Table A-5 should be interpreted as follows: 169 male doctorate recipients in the physical sciences in 1994 reported financial support from federal Appendix A 47 fellowships or traineeships during graduate school. This number is 3.3 percent of the male physical sciences Ph.D.s who answered the question on sources of support, and 14.6 percent of all males in any field who reported federal fellowship or traineeship support.

Therefore, differences in response rates from year to year can produce numerical fluctuations that are unrelated to real trends. Although response to the SED has been 95 to 98 percent in most years. it declined to 92 percent during the 1980s. In an effort to improve the response rate, the survey methodology was modified in the years after 1989. Response has risen as hoped, stabilizing around 95 percent durine, the last four years (1991 to 1994). (Note: These percentages represent self: report rates, i.e.. the proportion of questionnaires completed by doctorate recipients. While survey forms containing partial information filled in by either the doctoral institution or staff of the National Research Council are not included in these rates. tables in this report incorporate the available data from these forms.) The sell-report rate for 1994 may increase slightly in the next year if additional questionnaires are received from doctorate recipients. See page 82 in Appendix C for a table giving survey response rates from 1964 to 1994. Item response rates have shown a parallel improvement since 1990a natural consequence of the increase in the overall self-report rate, as well as a result of format revisions to the questionnaire and follow-ups for missing information. In 1990, new follow-up procedures were implemented to increase coverage of several variables: birth year, gender, race/ethnicity, citizenship status, country of citizenship, baccalaureate year and institution, and postgraduation plans. Response rates for these variables have since improvedespecially for citizenship and race/ethnicity, resulting in an increase in the reported numbers of minority Ph.D.s. The data for a given year are updated the following year with any responses received after survey closure. Postsurvey adjustment was most significant for 1990 and 1991 Ph.D.s, with the largest impact on the number of blacks. For both of these years, the total number of black Ph.D.s increased by about 7.5 percent in the year after survey closure. The survey cycle was then extended to allow receipt of more follow-up information before closure, resulting in much smaller postsurvey adjustments for both 1992 and 1993 data (a 1.4 percent increase in black PhD.s for 1992 and only a 0.2 percent increase for 1993). The same is expected for 1994 data. Adjustments to data are presented in reports subsequent to the initial report for a survey. Updates for 1992 appeared in Summary Report 1993, and those for 1993 are included in this year's report (see Appendix Table B-2 for adjustments to racial/ethnic data). The data for 1994 will likewise be subject to further revision, but as for the last two years, adjustments are expected to be minimal. Updates to 1994 data will be presented in next year's report. ln using SED data, the reader should keep in mind that numerical trends are affected by fluctuations in response rates. Increasing or decreasing numbers in a citizenship or racial/ethnic group reflect to some degree any change in both overall survey response and item response.
