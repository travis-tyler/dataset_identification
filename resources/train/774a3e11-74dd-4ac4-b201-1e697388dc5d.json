[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered to one of 10 key diseases leading to death in humans. AD is considered the main cause of brain degeneration, and will lead to dementia. It is beneficial for affected patients to be diagnosed with the disease at an early stage so that efforts to manage the patient can begin as soon as possible. Most existing protocols diagnose AD by way of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, because the size of the images produced is large, existing techniques that employ MRI technology are expensive and time-consuming to perform. With this in mind, in the current study, AD is predicted instead by the use of a support vector machine (SVM) method based on gene-coding protein sequence information. In our proposed method, the frequency of two consecutive amino acids is used to describe the sequence information. The accuracy of the proposed method for identifying AD is 85.7%, which is demonstrated by the obtained experimental results. The experimental results also show that the sequence information of gene-coding proteins can be used to predict AD."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Prior research has shown that there were more than 26.6 million people with AD worldwide in 2010 [1] . It has been predicted that there will soon be a further significant increase in prevalence: specifically, it is expected that there will be 70 million people with AD in 2030 and more than 115 million people with AD in 2050, respectively. In other words, in 2050, one in 85 people are expected to have AD. Unfortunately, to date, there is no treatment in existence that can cure AD. During disease progression, the neurons of AD patients are destroyed gradually, resulting in the loss of cognitive ability and ultimately death. Thus, it is important to identify AD, an age-related disease [2] , as early as possible so as to manage the advancement of the condition.\nMost existing diagnosis methods focus on identifying AD by way of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI method is based on neuroimaging data, for the reason that the imaging data can reflect the structure of brain. Using this technique, the results of classification accuracy are encouraging. However, MRI scans are expensive and the time required for scanning is significant because of the would be beneficial to find other options for AD identification. Several researches proved that coding genes/noncoding RNAs/proteins were related to diseases, including AD [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Other investigations [12] have shown that protein structure is related to AD. The gene coding is related to Alzheimer's disease [37] [38] [39] . Different from previous work, in the present study, AD is predicted based on protein information. The information of every sequence is represented by a 400-dimension vector, and each dimension represents the frequency of two consecutive amino acids. The flow chart of AD identification is shown in Figure 1 . First, the data are selected by using the CD-HIT method to remove the most similar sequences. In this step, the input are the proteins related with AD, and the output are selected proteins. Second, the features are extracted from the selected sequences. Each sequence is represented by a 400-dimension (400D) vector. In the third step, the data are classified by a support vector machine method. The input are the feature vectors, and the output are peptides with labels. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first effort to identify AD by protein sequence information without the use of MRI. Moreover, a dataset including AD and non-AD samples was created in this work. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy for AD prediction is 85.7%.

Moreover, most existing works use AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database [40] , which is based on MRI. Existing methods also use MRI information for classification, which is different from our method. Thus, it is difficult to compare the performance evaluation of our proposed method with the performance of existing methods. The performance of our method is shown in Table 1 . As noted in the table, the method was evaluated according to accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, Mathew coefficient (MCC), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The accuracy of the proposed method was 85.7%, which means that the more than 85% of AD and non-AD samples were able to be classified correctly using the method in question. F-measure is based on precision and recall. The recall of our method was 0.857, and the result shows that 85.7% of AD samples in the dataset could be identified in the experiment.

The labeled samples are trained based on the goal of maximizing the margin between the classes. Since SVM performs better than some the-state-of-art supervised learning methods, SVM is widely used in classification problems.

SVM was used to identify AD in our work.\nThe principles of SVM were introduced in Chou and Cai [60, 61] , and more details are provided in Cristianini [62] . Above all, the key idea of SVM is that two groups are separated with a maximum margin by building a hyperplane. The objective function of SVM is described in Equation (2), as follows:\nIn Equation (2), the input variable x (i) is mapped into a high dimensional feature space by the kernel function \u03d5(\u00b7). Radial kernel function (RBF) is used in the experiment. RBF is used widely because of its effectiveness and efficiency. Equation (2) can be transferred to optimize Equation (3), as follows:\nwhere n is the number of training samples. The condition (y i (w T \u03d5(x i ) + b) \u2265 1) should be satisfied in Equation (3), which means that the samples must be classified correctly by the optimized hyperplane. However, the problem of overfitting will be caused. Soft SVM is proposed to tackle the problem. The objective function is refined into Equation (4), as follows:\nwhere \u03b4 i is the slack variable and C is the penalty parameter.

To overcome this limitation, we extracted the occurrence frequency of the combination of two consecutive amino acids, such as AR (A and R representing the amino acids).
