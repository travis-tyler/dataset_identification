[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Academic achievement gaps between high-and low-income students born in the 1990s were much larger than among cohorts born two decades earlier. Racial/ethnic achievement gaps declined during the same period. To determine whether these two trends have continued in more recent cohorts, we examine trends in several dimensions of school readiness, including academic achievement, self-control, externalizing behavior, and a measure of students' \"approaches to learning\" for cohorts born from the early 1990s to the mid-2000s. We use data from nationally-representative samples of kindergarteners (ages 5-6) in 1998 (n=20,220), 2006 (n=6,600), and 2010 (n=16,980) to estimate trends in racial/ethnic and income school readiness gaps. We find that readiness gaps narrowed modestly from 1998-2010, particularly between high-and low-income students and between white and Hispanic students.

E. Lee & Burkham, 2002; Reardon, 2011) .\nThese academic achievement disparities are not immutable social facts, however. Indeed, they have changed substantially in the last few decades. The white-black and white-Hispanic achievement gaps were considerably larger in the 1970s than they are today; these gaps narrowed sharply in the 1970s and 1980s, before plateauing through much of the 1990s, and then beginning to narrow again in the last 15 years (National Center for Education Statistics, 2013; Reardon et al., 2015) . The income achievement gap, in contrast, was considerably smaller in the 1970s than it is today, but grew by roughly 40% between cohorts born in the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s (Reardon, 2011) . The causes of these changes are not well understood.\nIn this paper we provide new evidence on very recent trends in these achievement gaps. In particular, we use newly available data to describe the trends in the magnitude of racial/ethnic and income gaps in math and reading skills among students entering kindergarten from the fall of 1998 to the fall of 2010. We focus on income-related gaps rather than gaps related to parental education, occupation, or more general socioeconomic status for comparability with the earlier income academic achievement gap trends reported by Reardon (2011) . We also describe trends in racial/ethnic and income gaps in students' self-control, approaches to learning, and externalizing behavior. Because almost all other TRENDS IN SCHOOL READINESS GAPS 4 evidence on trends in academic achievement gaps is based on math and reading tests given to students in grades 3-12, and because there has been little emphasis on income disparities in children's behavioral school readiness, our analyses fill several important lacunae in the literature. Moreover, they indicate whether the trends among birth cohorts from the 1970s to 1990s in the income academic achievement gap documented by Reardon (2011) have persisted among more recent cohorts. Finally, they may help us to better understand the sources of the continuing decline in elementary school racial/ethnic achievement gaps. It is important to note, however, that our analyses here are fundamentally descriptive, not explanatory; we are able to identify patterns of change (and stability) in school readiness gaps, but we do not attempt here to present definitive explanations for these patterns."}, {"section_title": "Recent Trends in Academic Achievement Gaps", "text": "White-black and white-Hispanic academic achievement gaps have been declining for the last decade or more. Over the past 15 years, the gaps in 4 th grade math and reading skills, as measured by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), have narrowed by roughly 0.10-0.20 standard deviations, depending on the subject, group, and data source (see Figure 1 ). Similar patterns are evident in 8 th grade (Reardon et al., 2015) . Nonetheless, although it is clear that racial/ethnic achievement gaps have narrowed in 4 th and 8 th grade, it is not clear to what extent this is because gaps are smaller when children arrive in kindergarten, or because the gaps now change differently during the early elementary grades. The former would suggest the causes of the declines in grade 4-8 racial/ethnic gaps cannot be found in changes in opportunities provided by the K-12 educational system; the latter would suggest they might be.\nAt the same time, the academic achievement gap between children from high-and low-income families widened considerably-by about 40%-between cohorts born in the 1970s and the 1990s (Reardon, 2011) . Reardon argues that because the income achievement gap does not appear to grow during the schooling years, the reasons for its increase must be found in trends over time in the size of TRENDS IN SCHOOL READINESS GAPS 5 achievement gaps at kindergarten entry. It is unclear if the income achievement gap at kindergarten entry has changed in the last decade, however. The most recent cohorts in Reardon's data were born in 1992/93 and 2001 (entering kindergarten in 1998 and 2006/07, respectively) . The sampling design for these two cohorts were not strictly comparable, however, making estimation of the trend in the income achievement gap for cohorts born after the early 1990s difficult. Newly available data, however, provide a nationally-representative sample from the kindergarten class of 2010 (who were mostly born in 2004/05) that is quite comparable to the 1998 kindergarten sample. These data will provide information on whether the income achievement gap has continued to grow in recent cohorts."}, {"section_title": "Behavioral School Readiness", "text": "Cognitive skills have played a dominant role in research on educational and social inequality as early academic skills are thought to provide a foundation to support ongoing engagement in learning throughout schooling (Magnuson, Duncan, Lee, & Metzger, 2016) . Cognitive skills at kindergarten entry are strong and consistent predictors of later academic achievement (G. J. Duncan et al., 2007) and predict adult earnings (Chetty et al., 2011 ). Yet studies have also highlighted the importance of other behavioral domains of school readiness for later academic achievement, such as self-control, attention, and externalizing behaviors (G. J. Duncan et al., 2007; Jones, Greenberg, & Crowley, 2015; Turney & McLanahan, 2015) . Children who lack the self-control and attentional processes necessary to focus on educational material tend to exhibit challenges learning and engaging with classroom activities (Blair, 2002) . Consistent evidence finds that the ability to control and sustain attention predicts academic achievement during elementary school, after controlling for children's academic ability (Claessens & Dowsett, 2014; G. J. Duncan et al., 2007 ).\nChildren's externalizing behavior problems are also thought to affect individual learning and school engagement, yet empirical support for this is mixed. Some studies find a strong relation between the two (Burt & Roisman, 2010; Turney & McLanahan, 2015) while others find a weak or null association TRENDS IN SCHOOL READINESS GAPS 6 (Claessens, Duncan, & Engel, 2009; G. J. Duncan et al., 2007) . It remains unclear whether disruptive behavior leads to reduced academic achievement or whether failures in academic achievement may contribute to escalations in externalizing behavior problems (Burt & Roisman, 2010; Claessens & Dowsett, 2014) .\nIn contrast to the extensive literature examining racial/ethnic and, more recently, income achievement gaps, few studies have examined gaps in behavioral skills. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study birth cohort (ECLS-B) at age four, Waldfogel and Washbrook (2011) found that children in the poorest income quintile scored on average at the 55 th percentile of the distribution while the wealthiest income quintile scored on average at the 44 th percentile on measures of hyperactivity (where higher scores indicate greater incidence of problem behavior). Similar income differences were found on a measure of conduct problems. Using data from the Early Childhood\nLongitudinal Study kindergarten cohort from 1998 (ECLS-K 1998), Duncan and Magnuson (2011) report white-black kindergarten gaps in externalizing behavior that are roughly the same as the gaps between children from families of high and low socioeconomic status (SES) (0.31 and 0.26 standard deviations, respectively), while white-Hispanic gaps are non-existent (see also Magnuson & Duncan, 2005) . Further, black-white and SES gaps in attention and engagement are also substantial at kindergarten entry (0.36 and 0.63 standard deviations, respectively).\nThese studies do not provide evidence about the trends in income and behavioral skills gaps. By comparing cohorts of first-time kindergarteners in 1998 and 2010, this study describes recent trends in income and racial/ethnic gaps in both academic and behavioral indicators of school readiness. An understanding of the trends in gaps in measures of self-control, approaches to learning, and externalizing behavior problems, in addition to academic achievement provides a more complete picture of children's school readiness gaps. Moreover, the behavioral school readiness gap trends may help to explain why academic achievement gaps changed over the same cohorts. There are a number of reasons to suspect that racial/ethnic and income school readiness gaps might have changed from 1998 to 2010, including changes in the income distribution (including changes in racial income disparities), changes in parental investments in children, changes in residential segregation, changes in preschool enrollment patterns, and changes in social policies that affect children.\nWe consider the potential impact of these on school readiness gaps here.\nIncome inequality grew moderately from the 1990s through 2010. Among families with children, the ratio of the 90 th percentile of the income distribution to the 10 th percentile grew from an average of Racial/ethnic disparities in family income narrowed sharply in the 1990s before growing somewhat in the 2000s (Monnat, Raffalovich, & Tsao, 2012) . The black-white difference in child poverty rates declined from 29 to 24 percentage points between 1993-1998 and 2005-2010 ; the Hispanic-white difference declined from 27 to 20 percentage points during the same period 1 These changes in income distribution patterns may have led to changes in income and racial/ethnic school readiness gaps, possibly through the operation of a \"virtuous cycle\" in which declining inequality in one generation leads to more equal educational outcomes in the next (Long, Kelly, & Gamoran, 2012) . Family income has been shown to affect children's cognitive abilities and social-emotional competence (Dahl & Lochner, 2012; G. J. Duncan, Morris, & Rodrigues, 2011) ; as a result, rising income inequality may lead to growing income-related disparities in children's cognitive and socialemotional development. The narrowing racial/ethnic differences in child poverty, conversely, may have led to narrowing racial/ethnic gaps in school readiness.\nThese effects of family income on children likely operate through family contexts and parental behaviors (Gershoff, Aber, Raver, & Lennon, 2007) . With increased income, parents may invest money and time into their children to provide educational and developmental \"inputs\" that influence children's developmental outcomes (Becker, 2009) . In fact, along with an increase in income inequality, the period from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s saw a substantial increase in average parental spending on children, with the largest increases coming from increased spending on both young children (ages 0-5) and college-age children. Data from the nationally-representative Consumer Expenditure Surveys show that high-income families increased their spending on children over this time period by 27%, compared to a 12% increase among low-income families (G. J. Duncan & Murnane, 2011; Kornrich & Furstenberg, 2013) , with higher-income families spending more money on child care and cognitive enrichment activities and resources (Kaushal, Magnuson, & Waldfogel, 2011) .\nThe amount of time that parents spent with their children also grew from 1994-2008, but the increase was much greater among college-educated parents than those without a college degree, according to data from the nationally-representative American Time Use Surveys (Guryan, Hurst, & Kearney, 2008; Ramey & Ramey, 2010 Both of these increased disparities may be a result of growing income inequality; higher incomes provide families with more disposable income to invest in children, and may also provide greater opportunity for parents to spend time with their children. Together this body of evidence provides an additional reason to suspect there may have been an increase in the income gap in school readiness at kindergarten entry.\nA second factor that may affect school readiness gaps is residential segregation. Economic residential segregation grew from 1990-2009 (Bischoff & Reardon, 2014) . Given the positive association between neighborhood conditions and children's cognitive development and educational outcomes (Brooks-Gunn, Duncan, & Aber, 1997; G. J. Duncan, Brooks Gunn, & Klebanov, 1994; Klebanov, BrooksGunn, McCarton, & McCormick, 1998; Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn, 2000) , and between physical/psychosocial stressors and children's self-regulatory difficulties (Evans & English, 2002; McCoy, 2013; McCoy & Raver, 2014) , increasing economic segregation might have led to increasing income disparities in kindergarten readiness. New evidence from a randomized housing voucher program is consistent with this, showing that living in a high-poverty neighborhood as a young child negatively affects children's long-term educational outcomes (Chetty, Hendren, & Katz, 2015) .\nAlthough income segregation grew from 1990-2009, racial/ethnic segregation declined from 1990-2010 (B. A. Lee, Iceland, & Farrell, 2014) . Moreover, the average poverty rate in the neighborhoods of black and Hispanic households declined by 2-3 percentage points from 1990-2009, while the average TRENDS IN SCHOOL READINESS GAPS 10 poverty rate in white households' neighborhoods increased slightly (Logan, 2011) . This modest reduction in racial/ethnic disparities in exposure to neighborhood poverty may have led to smaller racial/ethnic kindergarten readiness gaps.\nAnother factor that may have affected income and race/ethnic gaps in school readiness is the increasing availability (and perhaps quality) of preschool programs. Historically, white and higher-income children are more likely to attend preschool than non-white and lower-income children (Magnuson & Duncan, 2014; Magnuson, Meyers, & Waldfogel, 2007) . Although preschool enrollment has increased for both high-and low-income children, the increase has been greater for low-income children, narrowing the income enrollment gap since the early 1990s (Magnuson & Duncan, 2014; Magnuson & Waldfogel, 2015) . Magnuson and colleagues (2007) argue that the increase in enrollment rates and the decline in the enrollment gap between high-and low-income children is largely due to increases in public funding for preschool programs over this time period. The increased enrollment of children from low-income families in preschool programs may have led to a reduction in the school-readiness gaps at kindergarten entry.\nThe Hispanic-white gap in preschool enrollment also narrowed over the last two decades, again because Hispanic enrollment rates rose much more rapidly than white enrollment rates. Black and white enrollment rates have been roughly equal, and rising at the same rate, since the 1970s (Magnuson & Waldfogel, 2015) . The narrowing Hispanic-white preschool enrollment gaps might suggest that the corresponding school readiness gap has narrowed as well. Moreover, given the evidence that preschool programs increase school readiness more for low-income and minority children than higher-income children (likely because, in the absence of preschool, higher-income children may have better access to developmentally-stimulating experiences than low-income students) (Bassok, 2010; Magnuson, Meyers, Ruhm, & Waldfogel, 2004) , overall increases in preschool enrollment rates may reduce school readiness gaps, even if there were no narrowing of the enrollment rate gap.\nA final reason to think that income school readiness gaps may have narrowed in the last decade is (http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/childrens-health-coverage-medicaid-chip-and-the-aca/.\nRetrieved December 21, 2014.). The evidence on whether the expansion of health care coverage for lowto middle-income children during this time period improved health outcomes is mixed, though it does show the expansion reduced child hospitalization and mortality (see Howell & Kenney, 2012) . Limited research on the effects of health insurance expansion on educational outcomes showed that eligibility at birth was related to increased reading scores in 4 th and 8 th grade (Levine & Schanzenbach, 2009) , while expansions when children were already in school improved long-run educational outcomes, such as high school completion (Cohodes, Grossman, Kleiner, & Lovenheim, 2014) . Given this early evidence, one might expect increased health care coverage to lead to improvements in a range of developmental outcomes. If that is the case, then the expansion of publicly funded children's health insurance since 1997 may have led to narrowed income school readiness gaps (and possibly to narrowed racial/ethnic gaps as well, given that the families impacted by the CHIP expansion are disproportionately black and Hispanic). This is far from an exhaustive list of factors that might influence racial/ethnic and income gaps school readiness gaps, but it does suggest that it is not clear whether one should expect the school readiness gaps to have widened or narrowed between 1998 and 2010. To investigate if and how these gaps have changed in that time period, we examine data from several nationally representative samples of kindergarten students in 1998 to 2010. Using these data, we measure both income and racial/ethnic gaps in children's academic and behavioral skills at kindergarten entry. multi-method and multi-informant, providing measures of children's academic skills, behavior, and early school experiences. We describe the studies' key features below; various technical reports provide more detail on their design and measures (Snow et al., 2009; Tourangeau et al., 2001; Tourangeau et al., 2013 )."}, {"section_title": "TRENDS IN SCHOOL READINESS GAPS", "text": "\n14 Duncan & De Avila, 1998) . If children passed this screener, they received the full direct child assessment in English. Children who did not pass were administered a reduced version of the direct assessments. In the event that a child spoke Spanish, he or she was administered an alternate form of the language screener, the Spanish version of the OLDS. If the student passed, he or she was administered a Spanishtranslated form of the mathematics assessment. Regardless of their native language, children not meeting the English proficiency threshold were not administered the reading assessment.\nIn the ECLS-K 2010, all children, regardless of home language, were administered the language screener as the first component of the direct cognitive assessment. The screener consisted of two tasks from the preLAS 2000 (S. Duncan & De Avila, 1998) . All children also received the first section of the reading assessment referred to as the English Basic Reading Skills (EBRS) section regardless of their home language or performance on the preLAS tasks. The reading assessment ended after this first section if a child's home language was not English and he or she did not score at least 16 (out of 20) points on the combined preLAS and EBRS assessments. Spanish speakers who did not pass were administered a short reading assessment in Spanish (Spanish Basic Reading Skills), as well as a translated mathematics assessment. Those children whose home language was neither English nor Spanish and did not pass the preLAS and EBRS were not administered any of the remaining cognitive assessments after the EBRS.\nThe ECLS-B used Spanish translations of measures for Spanish-speakers who did not pass an English fluency screening measure. A Spanish preLAS was given to assess the language skills of nonEnglish speakers who spoke Spanish. A translated mathematics assessment was administered as well as a Spanish Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Dunn & Dunn, 1997) .\nEven though the studies excluded some children from the assessments, we imputed all children's outcome scores using the method described below to make maximum use of the data. Nonetheless, we do not report trends in white-Hispanic reading gaps because differences in screening procedures render comparisons between the surveys invalid. Imputed scores for students not administered the reading TRENDS IN SCHOOL READINESS GAPS 15 assessment are used in the computation of the income reading gaps, but the results are robust to the exclusion of these students as well. Because all Spanish-speaking students were administered the math test in all three studies, we do report white-Hispanic math gap trends.\nReading achievement. Direct child assessments in reading used in all studies measured basic reading skills such as print familiarity, letter recognition, beginning and ending sounds, rhyming sounds, word recognition, and receptive vocabulary. Reading comprehension items targeted initial understanding, developing interpretation, personal reflection, and demonstrating critical stance.\nMathematics achievement. Direct child assessments in mathematics used in all studies measured conceptual knowledge, procedural knowledge, and problem solving through items related to number sense, number properties, operations, geometry and spatial sense, data analysis, statistics, probability, patterns, algebra, and functions.\nSelf-control. The self-control scale used in the ECLS-K studies is drawn from the Social Rating Scale, a measure adapted from the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS; Gresham & Elliott, 1990) , and includes items that assess children's ability to control their behavior. Four items completed by teachers via self-administered surveys assessed children's ability to respect the property rights of others, control their tempers, accept peer ideas for group activities, and respond appropriately to pressure from peers.\nFive items reported by parents via computer-assisted interviews included both positive and negatively worded behaviors, such as \"the frequency with which a child fights, argues, throws tantrums, or gets angry.\" All items were rated on a 1 to 4 scale from \"never\" to \"very often.\"\nApproaches to learning. The approaches to learning scale used in the ECLS-K studies is also drawn from the Social Rating Scale (Gresham & Elliott, 1990) . This scale measured behaviors that affect children's ability to benefit from the learning environment. Teachers rated six items on children's attentiveness, task persistence, eagerness to learn, learning independence, flexibility, and organization.\nParents rated six items on how often children showed eagerness to learn, interest in a variety of things, TRENDS IN SCHOOL READINESS GAPS 16 creativity, persistence, concentration, and responsibility. All items were rated on a 1 to 4 scale from \"never\" to \"very often\". While the approaches to learning scales were the same across the ECLS-K studies, teachers answered one extra item in the ECLS-K 2010 because an item on whether the child \"follows classroom routines\" was added to the scale in the first-grade round of ECLS-K 1998.\nExternalizing behavior. The externalizing behavior scale was only asked of teachers in the ECLS-K studies and is designed to assess children's acting out behaviors. It too was drawn from the Social Rating\nScale (Gresham & Elliott, 1990) . Five items rate the frequency with which a child argues, fights, gets angry, acts impulsively, and disturbs ongoing activities. All items were rated on a 1 to 4 scale from \"never\"\nto \"very often.\"\nBecause the self-control, approaches to learning, and externalizing behavior measures are comparable in the ECLS-K studies, we can examine trends in behavioral gaps at kindergarten entry.\nNonetheless, since they are reported by parents and teachers, these scales are not standardized in the way that task-based measures are, and so may include reference bias. Parents in different communities may assess their children's behaviors differently, using relative comparisons to evaluate children's behavior (Miller, 1995) and may have different norms about school readiness. We therefore include parent-reported outcomes in our set of measures only because they yield information on changes in parents' relative perceptions of school readiness; we do not think they should be interpreted as providing definitive evidence of changes in school behavioral readiness.\nFor this reason, we emphasize the teacher-reported behavioral measures over parent-reported outcomes in this study. Yet even teacher reports may also suffer from reference bias if teachers assess children's readiness relative to their schoolmates rather than against national norms. Indeed, Bassok and colleagues (2016) find that kindergarten teachers in schools enrolling high proportions of non-white or poor students are more like to say that children should know their alphabet and have formal math and reading instruction before kindergarten, and should be able to read in kindergarten. Moreover, teachers' TRENDS IN SCHOOL READINESS GAPS 17 school readiness expectations increased from 1998-2010. These differential expectations of school readiness will upwardly bias teacher-reported estimates of readiness gaps and will downwardly bias estimates of trends in children's readiness levels. But the trends in the readiness gaps-which is our focus here-will only be biased if teachers' readiness expectations change differently between 1998 and 2010 in high-and low-poverty or high-and low-minority enrollment schools. Bassok and colleagues (2016) find no consistent evidence of such differential changes. Nonetheless, because of the potential for other differential changes in factors affecting teachers' reports of children's kindergarten readiness, we suggest that readers interpret the trends based on these measures with caution.\nIncome and race. Children's primary race/ethnicity and household income were reported by parents during the parent interviews in each study. In each of the datasets, we classified children as\nHispanic if their parents indicated they were Hispanic, regardless of how parents reported their race.\nChildren not classified as Hispanic were classified as white, black, Asian, or \"other\"-a category that included a small percentage of children whose parents reported multiple racial categories. In the ECLS-B, this restriction was straightforward since parents reported on the year children entered kindergarten. We dropped children who were not enrolled in school in 2006 or 2007, who entered straight into first grade, or who were homeschooled (n= 350).\nWe also dropped cases for whom race or gender information was missing. We dropped 80\nchildren from the 1998 cohort (missing race: n= 70; missing gender: n= less than 10), and 150 from the 2010 cohort (missing race: n= 80; missing gender: n= 70). In the ECLS-B, we dropped fewer than 50 missing cases for race and none for gender.\nThese restrictions resulted in a final sample size of 20,220 children (of an original sample of 21,400) in the ECLS-K 1998; 16,980 children (of an original sample of 18,170) in the ECLS-K 2010; and 6,600 children (of 10,700 in the original sample, 7,000 of whom who remained in the study at kindergarten entry) in the ECLS-B. We use the ECLS-B post-stratification weights to adjust for sample attrition. Nonetheless, the attrition in ECLS-B makes the estimates from that study less certain than those from the ECLS-K studies, which have no sample attrition because the samples were drawn in fall of kindergarten.\nMultiple imputation. Multiple imputation was conducted using the -mi-commands in Stata 13.0, using chained equations and 20 iterations. The imputation model for all three studies used a regression model that included child age, gender, race, income, and a socioeconomic status (SES) composite included in the datasets. The imputation models also included all the math, reading, and behavioral Computing school readiness gaps. Although the assessments in the three studies were designed to measure the same domains and used many of the same items, the tests were scaled differently. We therefore standardize the readiness measures within each wave of each study before computing school readiness gaps in each study and wave.\nTo standardize the outcome scores within each study and wave, we fit, for each outcome variable , the regression model , ~ 0, , using the appropriate sample weights. This yields an estimate of the age-adjusted variance in the outcome scores, , and an estimated residual, \u0302 , for each child. Dividing the residual by the root mean squared error yields the age-adjusted standardized outcome score for each child * \u0302 . By construction, the * 's have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 when weighted by the appropriate child-level sample weight. For ECLS-K 1998, we used the child weight at kindergarten spring when standardizing both the fall and spring scores because children not assessed in fall do not have sample weights in fall. For ECLS-K 2010, we used the only available child-level weight-the spring kindergarten weight. The ECLS-B calculations applied the first time kindergartener weight to account for whether children entered kindergarten in 2006 or 2007.\nTo compute income gaps in school readiness, we estimate the difference in average scores between children at the 90 th and 10 th percentiles of the family income distribution, using the method TRENDS IN SCHOOL READINESS GAPS 20 described by Reardon (2011) . This \"90/10 income achievement gap\" measure is conceptually very similar to estimating the difference in average scores between children in the 1 st and 5 th income quintiles.\nBecause income is reported categorically in two of the studies (in categories that do not correspond neatly to income quintiles), we cannot identify each child's income quintile and so cannot readily compute the between-quintile difference in average scores. The 90/10 income achievement gap can, however, be estimated accurately from ordered income data using the cubic regression method described by Reardon (2011) . We also compute the 50/10 and 90/50 income gaps for each readiness measure.\nTo compute the racial/ethnic school readiness gaps, we regress the standardized outcome score where is the reliability of the instrument and is the reliability of the gap (income or race). We use 0.86 for income reliability (Marquis, Marquis, & Polich, 1986; Reardon, 2011) and 1 for race reliability (assuming race is measured without error). For we use instrument reliabilities as reported in TRENDS IN SCHOOL READINESS GAPS 21 the ECLS technical reports (Snow et al., 2009; Tourangeau et al., 2001; Tourangeau et al., 2013) . Table 1 provides information regarding the reliability of the instruments used in each of the studies. This reliability disattenuation yields estimates of the true gaps (and scales their standard errors appropriately), and eliminates any bias in the trend that may arise from differential reliability of the tests. because of concerns that the ECLS-B sampling design was not similar enough to the ECLS-K designs to allow for strict comparability. We do however, report the gaps in all three waves below."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "To a great extent, the measures used in the ECLS-K studies draw from similar domains to allow for comparison of the characteristics and experiences of these two cohorts who were in kindergarten more than a decade apart. Because the kindergarten data collection of the ECLS-K 2010 and of the ECLS-B were designed to be comparable to that of the ECLS-K 1998, much of the content, measures, and data collection procedures of the three studies were the same or similar. Direct child assessments and items from the teacher and parent surveys were often used or modified directly from ECLS-K 1998. It is not possible, unfortunately, to use the ECLS studies to measures changes in absolute levels of academic and behavioral skills from 1998 to 2010, because the child assessments and survey scales were not scaled the same way in the three studies. Instead, we standardize the scores within each study and compute school readiness gaps in these standardized scales. The gaps are therefore measured relative to the population standard deviation of the measures at each point in time.\nEarly Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K 1998).

These are relatively small changes but are not trivial in comparison to the size of the gaps in 1998, which were 0.63 and 0.39 standard deviations, respectively.\nThe change in the math gap is marginally significant (p=0.08). Given the size of the standard errors of the estimates (0.035 and 0.029, respectively), the 95% confidence intervals for the estimated changes are relatively wide. In short, the estimates are too imprecise to tell us much about whether the trend is flat or TRENDS IN SCHOOL READINESS GAPS 22 declining, though it is clear that the gaps are not increasing at any meaningful rate.\nSecond, note that the teacher-reported measures of white-black gaps in self-control and approaches to learning show substantial declines. On both measures, the gaps declined by roughly 30% ( .05). The white-black gap in externalizing behavior was unchanged from 1998 to 2010.\n3 Table 3 reports the white-Hispanic school readiness gaps in kindergarten fall. Here, note that the estimated gap in math skills declined by roughly 0.11 standard deviations from 1998 to 2010 ( .05), about a 14% reduction from the 1998 gap of 0.78 standard deviations. Table 3 does not include estimates of the white-Hispanic reading gap from the ECLS-K 1998 or the ECLS-B studies, given the differences in the reading test screening criteria in those studies. As a result, we cannot estimate the trend in the whiteHispanic school readiness gap from these data.\nAs with the white-black gaps, the white-Hispanic gaps in teacher-reported measures of selfcontrol and approaches to learning narrowed substantially (approximately a 40-50% reduction from 1998 to 2010). Only the change in the gap in the approaches to learning measure is statistically significant ( .05), however. There was no significant white-Hispanic gap in externalizing behavior in either 1998 or 2010, and hence, no significant change in the gap."}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "Trends in Income School Readiness Gaps Table 2 ; available on request) show a very different pattern: the white-black gaps are smaller (in some cases not significantly different than zero) and the changes are not statistically significant. The trends based on parent reports should be interpreted with the most caution, however, as parents likely differ widely in how they rate their children's school readiness. 4 The parent measures of self-control and approaches to learning (not shown in Table 3 ; available on request) indicate a very different pattern: in both cases the estimated gaps widened from 1998 to 2010; the increase in the parent-reported gap in self-control is statistically significant ( .05). As above, we put less credence in these parent-reported measures, given the many potential confounding factors that may affect how parents rate their own children's school readiness.\n.001) in reading from 1998-2010. These correspond to reductions of 10% and 17%, respectively. In contrast to the race/ethnicity gaps, we find a significant increase from 1998 to 2010 in teacher-reported externalizing behaviors by 0.09 standard deviations ( .05). None of the other teacher-or parentreported school readiness gap measures showed a significant change from 1998 to 2010. Table 5 decomposes the changes in the math and reading income achievement gaps in kindergarten fall into components representing a) the gap between children from low-and middleincome families (the \"50/10 income achievement gap\" and b) the gap between children from middle-and high-income families (the \"90/50 income achievement gap\"). Reardon (2011) showed that the increases in the 90/10 income achievement gaps in reading and math were driven largely by changes in the 90/50 income achievement gap. The point estimates here suggest that at least some of the reduction in the 90/10 math gap is attributable to a reduction in the 90/50 gap ( .10); the estimates are too imprecise to indicate how much of the reduction is due to changes in the 50/10 gap, however. In contrast, the point estimates indicate that at least some of the reduction in the 90/10 reading gap is due to a decrease in the 50/10 gap ( .05); the estimates are too imprecise to determine how much of the reduction is due to changes in the 90/50 gap."}, {"section_title": "Changes in Math and Reading Gaps from Fall to Spring of Kindergarten", "text": "In both the 1998 and 2010 ECLS-K studies, children were assessed in math and reading skills in both the fall and spring of their kindergarten year. The two assessments allow us to determine whether achievement gaps narrow or widen during the kindergarten year, and whether these patterns changed between the two cohorts. Although this analysis does not directly bear on the issue of school readiness gaps, we include it because it indicates whether the changes in school readiness gaps persist through the kindergarten year. Figure 2 illustrates the gaps in fall and spring of kindergarten for both the 1998 and 2010 cohorts (detailed estimates are in Appendix Table A1 ).\nIt is clear from Figure 2 that there is no evidence that the change in racial/ethnic or income TRENDS IN SCHOOL READINESS GAPS 24 achievement gaps from fall to spring of kindergarten year was different for the 2010 cohort than for the 1998 cohort. The 90/10 income achievement gaps in both math and reading narrowed from fall to spring by 0.10-0.14 standard deviations in both cohorts (the narrowing income achievement gap in kindergarten in the 1998 cohort has been described elsewhere; see Reardon, 2011; Reardon et al., 2015) . The difference between cohorts in the fall-spring change in gaps was small and not statistically significant (see Table A1 ).\nThe estimated white-black gaps in math and reading increase very slightly (0.06 to 0.08 standard deviations) from fall to spring, but these increases are not statistically significant, and do not differ between cohorts. The white-Hispanic gap in math declined from fall to spring of kindergarten by 0.07 standard deviations in the 1998 cohort and by 0.12 standard deviations in the 2010 cohort; the difference between the two cohorts in the rate of decline was not statistically significant. In sum, Figure 2 shows that the reduction in school readiness gaps evident between the 1998 and 2010 cohorts appears to have persisted through the end of kindergarten."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Data from three large, nationally representative samples of kindergarten students indicate that on standardized tests, income and-to some extent-racial/ethnic school readiness gaps in school readiness have narrowed over the last dozen years (see Figure 3 for summary of these trends). The declines in income gaps and in white-Hispanic gaps in academic skills at kindergarten entry are moderately large and statistically significant; the estimated declines in white-black math and reading gaps are somewhat smaller, and are not statistically significant in reading and are only marginally significant in math. The evidence regarding trends in gaps in other measures of school readiness are less clear.\nRacial/ethnic gaps in teacher-reported measures of self-control and approaches to learning declined by 30-50%, while the income gap in teacher-reported externalizing behavior increased by 9%.\nHow meaningful are these changes? The income achievement gaps in kindergarten entry math and reading declined at the rate of 0.008 and 0.014 standard deviations per year, respectively, over the 1998-2010 period. To put this in context, Reardon (2011) found that the 90/10 income achievement gap grew by roughly 0.020 standard deviations per year among cohorts born in the mid-1970s to those born in the early 1990s. So the rate of decline in the kindergarten readiness 90/10 income gaps appears to be somewhere between 40 and 70% as rapid as the rate of increase in the gap in the prior two decades.\nLooked at this way, the rate of decline from 1998 to 2010 is not trivial. Nonetheless, the gaps were roughly 1.25 standard deviations in 1998; at the rates the gaps declined in the last 12 years, it will take another 60-110 years for them to be completely eliminated. The rate of decline in the white-Hispanic and white-black math gaps are similar in magnitude.\nIt is also useful to compare the trends in the income and racial/ethnic gaps at kindergarten entry to the trends in the same gaps as the children progress through school. Our analyses show that the trends persist through kindergarten. Moreover, the NAEP data reported in Figure 1 suggest that the racial/ethnic achievement gaps trends we observe at kindergarten entry persist through fourth grade. Figure 1 shows that white-black and white-Hispanic math and reading fourth-grade (or age 9) gaps declined by roughly 0.15 standard deviations between the cohorts born in 1993 and 2005, corresponding to a rate of decline of about 0.012 standard deviations per year, similar to the rate of change of the white-Hispanic kindergarten entry gap and 50% larger than the rate of change of the white-black kindergarten entry gaps. That is, the achievement gaps in 4 th grade declined at roughly the same rate as, or moderately faster than, the kindergarten entry gaps. This suggests that the primary source of the reduction in TRENDS IN SCHOOL READINESS GAPS 26 racial/ethnic achievement gaps in 4 th grade (evident in Figure 1 ) is a reduction in school readiness gaps, not a reduction in the rate at which gaps change between kindergarten and fourth grade. The finding that the racial/ethnic gaps change at the same rate during kindergarten in the 2010 and 1998 cohorts provides some corroborating support for this conclusion. Nonetheless, this conclusion should be understood as tentative, however, given the considerable uncertainty in the estimated rates of change of the kindergarten entry gaps. Fortunately, both the ECLS-K 1998 and 2010 studies will have followed students through elementary school; once the grades 1-5 data from the 2010 cohort are available, it will be possible to test more rigorously whether racial/ethnic and income achievement gaps develop similarly as children progress through school in the 1998 and 2010 kindergarten cohorts.\nIn some ways, the findings here are surprising, particularly the declines in the income gap in academic school readiness. Given the sharp increase in the income achievement gap in the prior two decades (Reardon, 2011) , as well as the continued increases in income inequality, income segregation, and income gaps in parental investments in children (Bischoff & Reardon, 2014; G. J. Duncan & Murnane, 2011; Kornrich & Furstenberg, 2013; Piketty & Saez, 2013; Ramey & Ramey, 2010) , one might have suspected that the income gap in school readiness would have grown as well. But the data here indicate the opposite; it has declined.\nThe most obvious candidate explanation for this decline is perhaps the changes in preschool enrollment patterns over this time period. Both the income gap and the white-Hispanic gap in preschool enrollment rates declined since the early 1990s; the white-black gap in preschool enrollment was unchanged over the same period (Magnuson & Duncan, 2014; Magnuson & Waldfogel, 2015) . These trends are consistent with our finding here that the income and white-Hispanic school readiness gaps declined significantly, while the white-black gap declined less (and not at a rate distinguishable from zero at conventional levels of significance). Of course, the correlation of preschool enrollment gap trends and school readiness gap trends does not prove the first caused the second, but it does suggest that further TRENDS IN SCHOOL READINESS GAPS 27 investigation of preschool enrollment trends as a possible primary cause of the narrowing readiness gaps would be informative. We have also suggested above that increases in child health insurance rates among the near-poor may have played a role in these improvements. Another category of explanation might be cultural changes in parenting practices that have increased low-income children's exposure to cognitively stimulating activities at home. An investigation of these possible causes is beyond the scope of this paper, however.\nThe decline in academic school readiness gaps is a positive trend from an equity perspective. It is not clear, however, to what extent the gaps have narrowed because of improvements in school readiness among low-income and black and Hispanic children, or due to declines in readiness among higher-income and white children. It would be hard to consider it an improvement if readiness gaps have narrowed because of lowered readiness among high-income and white children and stagnant readiness among lowincome and minority children. At present, the ECLS-K data do not enable us to compare absolute levels of readiness, because the 1998 and 2010 assessments are not scaled similarly; such a comparison will be possible, however, when NCES releases equated versions of the scores.\nUntil then, several pieces of evidence lead us to suspect that readiness gaps have narrowed because of more rapid gains in readiness among low-income and non-white students rather than because of decline or stagnation of high-income and white students' readiness. A number of factors associated with school readiness-including preschool enrollment, parental spending on children, parental time spent with children, and child health insurance-have increased for all racial/ethnic groups and among children from all family income levels; many of them have increased more rapidly for minority and lowincome children than for others (Kornrich & Furstenberg, 2013; Magnuson & Duncan, 2014; Magnuson & Waldfogel, 2015; Ramey & Ramey, 2010) . These trends would suggest increases in absolute levels of school readiness; there is nothing in these trends to suggest declines in readiness among any subgroup.\nFourth-grade NAEP data also provide a hint of what the trends in school readiness levels might TRENDS IN SCHOOL READINESS GAPS 28 be. NAEP data indicate that the narrowing of the white-black and white-Hispanic gaps evident in Figure 1 is not due to any decline in white students' test scores. Indeed, average NAEP scores have increased since the 1990s among white, black, and Hispanic students, but they have increased faster among black and Hispanic students than among white students (Hemphill et al., 2011; Vanneman et al., 2009) . In other words, the declines in racial/ethnic achievement gaps in 4 th grade are not the result of declines or stagnation in white students' scores. Although NAEP does not collect detailed information on family income, average scores for both poor (free-lunch eligible) students and non-poor students have increased in the last two decades, suggesting that any narrowing of the income achievement gap is likewise not the result of declining scores among high-income students.\nIn sum, it appears that despite widening income inequality, increasing income segregation, and growing disparities in parental spending on children, disparities in school readiness narrowed from 1998 to 2010. This was likely due to relatively rapid increases in overall school readiness levels among poor and Hispanic children, coupled with less rapid increases in readiness among higher-income and white children, though this remains to be confirmed once the appropriate data become available. It will be important for future research to identify the forces that have led to these improvements in school readiness and reductions in readiness gaps, so that they may be sustained.
