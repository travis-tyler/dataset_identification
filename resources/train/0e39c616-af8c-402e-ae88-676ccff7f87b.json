[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "We provide in this document a survey on the main open-resources for addressing the Covid-19 pandemic from a data science point of view. Since the number of institutions and research teams working nowadays against the virus is growing at a very fast pace, it is impossible to provide an exhaustive list of all the meaningful open-data providers. At a global world scope, it is easier to identify the relevant open-data resources. However, the enumeration of the regional institutions providing local information is so extensive that we address it specifically only for some countries (like China, Italy, Spain, and the U.S, among others). We focus on the variables that have an effect on the evolution and control of the disease at a global and regional scale. That is, we do not cover in this document the data specifically related to medical treatments, vaccines, etc. We do provide open resources for the number of hospitalized cases, intensive care units (ICU) cases, number of tests,etc. These variables are very relevant to monitor the evolution of the pandemic and also to evaluate the actions taken by the decision-makers.\nWith this document, we try to make accessible many significant open-data resources on Covid-19 for the scientific community. In many situations, identifying adequate sources is difficult, especially for non-expert data scientists. For example, the GitHub repository contains many meaningful data-sets of global and regional scope, but it might be challenging to discover them without adequate guidance. Besides, the reliability of the data source provider can be a concern. Therefore, this paper is aimed at providing a big picture of the available data source providers for analyzing Covid-19 propagation. We have tried to find stable and reliable resources so that the utility of this paper endures in time.\nThe paper is organized as follows. We first analyze in Section 2 the different variables that have a significant effect on the evolution and control of the epidemic (demographics, mobility, weather conditions, government measures, etc.). The opportunities that open data resources on Covid-19 offer to fight the pandemic are highlighted, from a data-driven perspective, in Section 3. Different limitations and inaccuracies of the currently available sources, along with the difficulties encountered when using them in a data-science context are discussed in Section 4. The most relevant open data institutions at a global scale, addressing the Covid-19 pandemic, are enumerated in Section 5. More functionally, in Section 6, we identify open source communities that facilitate access to the required data. In Section 7 we identify open-data sets related to specific Covid-19 variables at a global and regional scale. The open access to auxiliary variables of interest to model specific aspects of the pandemic, like seasonal behaviour or local mortality rate is described in Section 8. The open e-learning on Covid-19 is illustrated by means of some examples in Section 9. We finish the paper with a section of conclusions."}, {"section_title": "Covid-19", "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), technically known as SARS-CoV-2, is an infectious disease that was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the 201920 coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.\nThe virus is mainly spread during close contact and by small droplets produced when those infected cough, sneeze or talk. These small droplets may also be produced during breathing; however, they rapidly fall to the ground or surfaces and are not generally spread through the air over large distances. People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their face. Although animals can be infected with Covid-19, there is not any evidence to suggest the transmission of the virus from them to human beings.\nThe virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours such as plastic and stainless steel [44] . It is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease [4] . The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to 14 days.\nRecommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, social distancing (maintaining physical distance from others, especially from those with symptoms), covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or inner elbow and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers. On 29 January, the WHO provided some guidelines on the use of masks [22] . Nevertheless, recommendations for mask use by the general public vary. In addition, the use of plastic gloves has also been recommended. Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for Covid-19. Management involves treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation and experimental measures."}, {"section_title": "Covid-19 cases in the world", "text": "To monitor the spread of Covid-19, the different regional institutions are measuring the number of confirmed cases, deaths, recovered, hospitalized cases, intensive unit care (IUC) cases, etc. Because of the incubation period, all these variables are related with the number of infected cases in a delayed way. The main objective is to calculate the basic reproductive number R 0 of the well-known Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. Several works have calculated R 0 for some outbreaks of specific locations. The estimated values are ranging from 2 to 3 [29] . However, only limited data have been used in the majority of works. Achieving an accurate model of the reproduction of the virus is a challenging task, which involves many variables. Unfortunately, the open data sets available nowadays are locally collected, imprecise with different criteria (lack of standardization on data collection), inconsistent data models and incomplete.\nOne of the limitations of the data sets is that only cases confirmed by a laboratory test are included in them. The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab. The infection can also be diagnosed from a combination of symptoms, risk factors and a chest CT scan showing features of pneumonia. Thus, the infected cases without a positive laboratory test are not considered confirmed cases, on a general basis, in the time-series data available in the different open-source repositories. The same problem can be encountered when analyzing death cases. In many situations, only the ones that were previously confirmed by a laboratory test are included in the data sets.\nThere are relevant variables that are not properly measured. For example, the fraction of infected non-asymptomatic cases in a given population can be only estimated by means of massive tests, which are rarely being done because of lack of resources. Some exceptions are the massive tests done in small towns (for example in the north of Italy) in which the tests indicated that the fraction of asymptomatic cases in the population could be significant (comparable or even larger than the symptomatic cases). Therefore, asymptomatic cases play an important role in virus transmission [4] . Furthermore, important inaccuracies have been reported on the use of fast tests. It is an important issue since their massive usage can improve the counting of real cases.\nThe above limitations on the available data-sets have to be taken into consideration in any data-driven method to model or forecast the future spread of the pandemic."}, {"section_title": "Covid-19 mortality", "text": "Being able to predict the number of patients that will develop life-threatening symptoms is important since the disease frequently requires hospitalisation (and even Intensive Care Unit admission) and challenges the healthcare system capacity [20] . One of the most important ways to measure the burden of Covid-19 is mortality. The probability of dying when getting infected depends on different factors [49] , [36] , [26] :\n\u2022 Demographics [35] : Age, gender, prevalence of diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, etc.\n\u2022 Health System [26] : Availability of artificial respiration equipment, intensive care units, specialized medical surveillance and treatment, etc.\nOn the one hand, several studies have reported a higher level of mortality for older people [35] and even more aggravated in men. Thus, protection strategies should be focused on more vulnerable age and gender groups.\nOn the other hand, the capacity of each regional Health System to cope with the pandemic is time-varying. Most of the countries that had already suffered in a severe way the pandemic had their hospitals and physicians overwhelmed by the numbers of critical cases (e.g. Italy, Spain, the U.S.) [10] . The main objective in the control of the disease is to prevent the saturation or overload of the health system because it will be directly translated into a significant increase in mortality."}, {"section_title": "Seasonal behaviour of Covid-19", "text": "Many respiratory viruses have a seasonality because lower temperature and lower humidity help facilitate the transmission of the virus. There is no clear evidence that Covid-19 is going to behave seasonally, reducing its transmission in summer. In the summer season in the Southern hemisphere, in some regions of South America and Australia, significant Covid-19 outbreaks have been already reported. In [41] the authors show that in March 2020, the areas with significant community transmission of Covid-19 had distribution roughly along the 30-50 N corridor at consistently similar weather patterns consisting of average temperatures of 5-11C, combined with low specific (3-6 g/kg) and absolute humidity (4-7 g/m3). In [45] , the authors study the relationship between temperature, humidity and the transmission rate of Covid-19. They used data collected from all the cities in China with more than 100 cases. The authors use a lineal regression framework as a model. Results indicate that one-degree Celsius increase in temperature and one per cent increase in relative humidity lower R 0 by 0.0225 and 0.0158, respectively. The authors developed a web application 1 , where R 0 values for major worldwide cities can be obtained from temperature and humidity."}, {"section_title": "Actions to control Covid-19 pandemic", "text": "For the control community, the different confinement strategies that can be implemented by a government clearly constitute control inputs to the system [3] . Public health and social measures to slow or stop the spread of Covid-19 are being implemented, with different intensities, worldwide.\nHowever, these are not the unique actions that a government can undertake in order to control the pandemic. For example, forcing the population to wear masks or scarves, and plastic gloves might have an inhibitory effect on the spread of the virus [13] and has not a significant impact on the economy (provided masks are produced at large scale).\nFrom a control point of view, the objective is twofold. On the one hand, it is important to assess the effectiveness of the different measures against the spread of the virus. On the other hand, actions should be planned in advance in order to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on the health system, the economy and society.\nIt is not simple to determine the effect of the possible anti-measures to be undertaken by the regional governments. This is not a simple task for several reasons: (i) several inhibitory actions are generally implemented simultaneously. Therefore, it cannot be evaluated which one has more impact, ii) the efficacy of the anti-measures depends on a number of factors, like demographics and weather conditions of the specific region under consideration, iii) the available data is, in many situations, imprecise and incomplete. The difficulties in predicting the effects of the Covid-19 anti-measures on the regional evolution of disease is one side of the problem. Another one is the inherent time-delay system nature of the dynamics of the disease. The effects of the undertaken measures are observed only weeks later. Another issue is the level of fulfilment of the confinement measures found in each country."}, {"section_title": "Social distancing", "text": "Following the emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its spread outside of China, Europe is now experiencing large epidemics. In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most recently, wide-scale social distancing including local and national lockdowns. In [9] , authors use a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model to attempt to infer the impact of these interventions across 11 European countries. They assume that changes in the reproductive number a measure of transmission -are an immediate response to these interventions being implemented rather than broader gradual changes in behaviour. In particular, this model estimates these changes by calculating backwards from the deaths observed over time to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for the time lag between infection and death.\nOne of the key assumptions of the model is that each intervention has the same effect on the reproduction number R 0 across countries and over time. This allows leveraging a greater amount of data across Europe to estimate these effects. It also means that these results are driven strongly by the data from countries with more advanced epidemics, and earlier interventions, such as Italy and Spain. The main conclusion of this research was that it is critical that the current interventions remain in place and trends in cases and deaths are closely monitored in the coming days and weeks to provide reassurance that transmission of SARS-Cov-2 is slowing.\nMany governments around the world closed the educational institutions in an attempt to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, impacting over 91% of the worlds student population [42] .\nAnother important aspect has been tackled by the New York Times: how income affects peoples abilities to stay home and practice social distancing [43] . Wealthier people not only have more job security and benefits but also may be better able to avoid becoming sick."}, {"section_title": "Mobility measures", "text": "The authors in [46] use the Baidu Mobility Index, measured by the total number of outside travels per day divided by the resident population, to find that reducing the number of outings can effectively decrease the new-onset cases; a 1% decline in the outing number will reduce about 1% of the new-onset-cases growth rate in 7 days (one serial interval). A first quantitative assessment of the impact of the Italian Government on the mobility and the spatial proximity of Italians, through the analysis of a large-scale dataset on de-identified, geo-located smartphone users can be found in [37] .\nTechnology can play an important role to obtain mobility measures [34] . Nowadays, everyone has a mobile phone equipped with a number of sensors, including GPS, that are able to collect data about people mobility. Furthermore, the Internet and mobile phone operators can use their telecommunications towers to gather mobility patterns. Of course, citizen privacy is an issue that has to be taken into consideration for data anonymization."}, {"section_title": "Massive tests", "text": "The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed is important because non-diagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the infection than diagnosed ones, since the latter are typically isolated, and can explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the seriousness of the epidemic phenomenon [20] ."}, {"section_title": "Data driven ways to fight the pandemic", "text": "Currently, the majority of data available on Covid-19 is used for describing the pandemic in terms of reports and visualizations 2 . Although these techniques are useful to highlight the magnitude of the crisis, they are not enough for mitigating the problem. Also, these are insufficient for decision-makers to anticipate the response to the virus propagation and evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented actions. For this reason, it is obvious that more efficient approaches are needed rapidly to i) model and forecast the spread and the consequences of the pandemic and ii) evaluate mitigation approaches that have been carried out. Data-driven models, see for example [20] , [21] , can be such solution [48] , [15] . Many data-based techniques can be applied. Nevertheless, regression models, as in [6] , are the main tools for forecasting the effect of Covid-19, ranging from classical machine learning approaches like linear regression [38] and Gaussian processes [16] to sophisticated models based on neuronal networks [11] . Variable screening can also help to detect the parameters that impact more on the propagation of the virus. These techniques require sufficient and high-quality data to provide a good estimation. Depending on the model used, the quantity of data can vary notably from hundreds to millions of samples. Moreover, a wide variety of data is necessary for accomplishing a good model of a complex system like the Covid-19 pandemic. Data from different disciplines is required, which hinders the data collection task. We highlight three pillars of data-driven approaches for fighting Covid-19: i) informative variables for developing an accurate model, ii) objectives of the model: characterizing Covid-19 pandemic, epidemic models and forecasting, etc. and iii) its use for efficient decision making.\n\u2022 Wish-list of variables: the list of variables is large since many aspects should be taken into consideration to develop accurate models. The considered variables can be divided into different categories according to their discipline 3 .\n-Covid-19 variables: regional time series of the number of confirmed cases, suspicious cases, deaths, recovered, number of tests, hospitalized cases, ICU cases, isolated positive cases, etc. When possible, the data should be divided per gender, age range, etc.\n-Geographic variables: Locations of Covid-19 variables. The locations can be obtained from names (i.e. countries, cities. etc.) and/or GPS coordinates: longitude and latitude.\n-Demographic variables: Population and density of population by location. These variables are required for normalization of the rest of the variables. Also, the age structure of the population, the prevalence of secondary health conditions related to higher Covid-19 mortality, etc.\n-Health system variables: Total number of ICU beds, number of doctors and nurses, personal protective equipment (PPE), respirators, number and types of tests.\n-Government measures: Social distancing, movement restrictions, lockdowns, etc.\n-Weather variables: Temperature, relative humidity, radiation, among others.\n-Contamination variables: Air pollution, i.e. fine particulate matter P M 2.5 .\n\u2022 The use of data in epidemic and forecasting models: By using the aforementioned variables, different models can be developed to anticipate the response to the propagation of Covid-19. Examples of forecasting analysis:\n-Estimation of the infected population.\n-Forecast of impact in health-system.\n-Assessing the impact in terms of mortality. 3 The following list can be incomplete since other disciplines and variables can also be included.\n-Analysis of seasonal behaviour.\n\u2022 Decision making: The final objective of the data-driven models is developing useful tools for helping governments and institutions to anticipate the response to the Covid-19 propagation and evaluate their actions.\n-Assessing the effectiveness of the measures.\n-Planing ahead government actions."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and challenges raised by the available data", "text": "There exist different issues that can hinder the use of open data to address the challenges raised by the Covid-19 pandemic:"}, {"section_title": "Variety", "text": "The different sources and variables required to undertake a given analysis is often addressed assembling several data sets into a single one. Although the increased quantity of data sources presents new opportunities, working with such a variety of data reinforces the validity challenges [31] . Another issue is that the sources of data are coming from a wide range of disciplines that can be familiar with very different formats and data representation. For instance, some available APIs to get data on Covid-19 provide JSON files. This format is widely used in computer science in web applications. However, for instance, mathematicians or epidemiologists cannot be familiar with such format."}, {"section_title": "Time-varying nature", "text": "The needs of the outbreak require immediate response, which translates in obtaining the latest information available. This raises some important challenges. For example, government measures are changing rapidly. Often information is outdated by the time it has been identified. The number of countries implementing or amending measures increases daily [2] . The daily availability of the data can be an issue for working with multiple data sources simultaneously."}, {"section_title": "Confirmed cases is not a reliable metric", "text": "The World Health Organization defines, in its global Covid-19 surveillance document, a confirmed case as a person with laboratory confirmation of Covid-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. At the outbreak of the pandemic, the access to massive tests was very limited, and often, only a reduced fraction of the hospitalized cases were tested at a laboratory level. Furthermore, very few data sets provide information about the number of suspected cases. Even under the hypothesis that everyone with minor symptoms is tested, this would only provide an estimate of the symptomatic cases of the disease. The study of the fraction of asymptomatic cases is an active field of research (e.g. [30] ) not only because it is key to the estimation of the total number of infected cases, but because it plays a fundamental role in the spread of the virus."}, {"section_title": "Mortality rate is difficult to estimate", "text": "During the most severe periods of the virus spread in a country, the number of death cases reported by the administration differs in many situations considerably from the real one because only the deaths with previous laboratory confirmation of the disease are included. Thus, the study of national death registers suggests that there are notably and unexpected increases in death rates according to the historical numbers. For instance in New York City, it has been reported 5330 more deaths than expected in the last month 4 , only 3350 of these can be accounted for Covid-19 reasons. These figures suggest that there exist undercounting on the real number of deaths. Another example can found in Spain, where the \"Sistema de Monitorizacin de la Mortalidad diaria (MoMo) 5 system registers the total number of deaths under any circumstances. The last report on April 7th indicates an increase of more than 50% of unexpected deaths in the last month. Such increment is even more significant in men, where it reaches more than 60%.\nThe mortality rates are much more difficult to estimate since the estimates are often based on the number of deaths relative to the number of confirmed cases of infection, which can be a small fraction of the real ones [5] . Consequently, mortality rates comparisons between countries make compulsory the implementation of correcting factors based on the estimation of Covid-19 infected cases and deaths non registered by the respective administrations.\nAlso, when considering the increase of mortality due to saturation of the health care system, one has to take into consideration the fact that the patients who die on any given day were infected much earlier, and thus the denominator of the mortality rate should be the total number of patients infected at the same time as those who died [5] .\nAnother important parameter to evaluate mortality is to have stratified data according to age groups. However, such information is not provided by the majority of data sources."}, {"section_title": "Not availability of individual case data", "text": "In order to better understand the disease, and improve the models and strategies to fight Covid-19, every case should be tracked with its own timeline. That is, for each case, relevant information about when symptoms appeared, medical treatments, evolution, degree of isolation, etc. should be available on a country-wide level. This data should be published anonymously, with a de-identification process to prevent personal identity from being revealed. The data, and the time corresponding to the change of each individual, should be published by an official source in a structured way, at least, with daily frequency. This is the opinion of many experts and members of the open-source community 6 .\nAn effort of obtaining individual case data can be found in [33] . The authors carried out a survey of 24 questions related to the impact of Covid-19 (Covid19Impact) on citizens in Spain 7 . The survey was responded to by 146.728 participants over a period of fewer than two days (44 hours). The questions were about social contact behaviour, financial impact, working situation and health status. The results of the survey show the negative impact of Covid-19 on the life of citizens. It is a clear example of how the collaboration of the citizens can be relevant to gather information on the effects of Covid-19. A similar work in UK can be found in [27] , where the authors created the e Real World Worry Dataset of 5,000 texts 8 . The data analysis suggests that people in the UK worry about their family and the economic situation."}, {"section_title": "Changing and non-uniform criteria", "text": "Since the governments are continuously adjusting their response to the virus, it is not unusual to find out abrupt changes in the trend of a time series because a new methodology has been implemented. For example, on 12th February, a sudden spike in new cases in China with Covid19 (15.152 new cases) was due to changed diagnosis method: a combination of SARSCoV2 nucleic acid test and clinical Covid19 features [47] .\nAnother relevant issue is that regions in the same country may provide data under the same label, but with a different meaning. A good example is the number of UIC cases; there might be regions reporting the accumulative number of confirmed cases that required these units, and others the number of UIC units used by Covid-19 patients. Something similar happens with the number of laboratory tests. Sometimes they refer to the total number of tests carried out and sometimes to the number of individuals that were tested (in many situations, the sources do not describe accurately the meaning of the counts)."}, {"section_title": "Changing data-base structure and locations", "text": "The open-data sources on Covid-19 are constantly improving.
