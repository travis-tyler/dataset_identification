Current disease trends in the US, Europe and other regions suggest that the incidence and prevalence of these conditions will increase in the near future due to aging of the world population and the increased prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and its components, thereby placing even greater burdens on finite resources. Prostate cancer is an important growing health problem, presenting a challenge to urologists, radiologists and pathologists. Currently many men are identified as having early prostate cancer through www.jmscr.igmpublication.org Impact Factor (SJIF): 6.379 Index Copernicus Value: 71.58 ISSN (e)-2347-176x ISSN (p) 2455-0450 DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.18535/jmscr/v6i6.33 the use of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening. Prostate was believed to be a lobular structure for many years. Prior to 1906, when Home described the middle lobe, prostate was considered to be composed of only 2 lateral lobes. Later the existence of 5 prostatic lobes was proposed-2 lateral lobes, an anterior lobe, posterior lobe & middle lobe based on its embryonic findings. The prostate gland is topic of discussion now a days due to its late postnatal adult growth changes, enlarged due to benign nodular hyperplasia, and the male health effects of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is the second most common malignant tumor in western males and anatomically involves the prostate peripheral zone [1] .\nBerry et al reported the prevalence of BPH is about 8% during the fourth decade, but it reaches 50% in the fifth decade and 75% in the eighth decade. Now a days it is become easier to diagnose prostatic disease by many ways which include DRE (Digital rectal examination of prostate), estimation of serum PSA levels, Prostatic biopsy & histopathological examination of prostate specimen. [2] The prevalence of BPH rises markedly with age. Autopsy studies have observed a histological prevalence of 8%, 50% and 80% in the 4th, 6th and 9th decades of life, respectively [3] . Multiple observational studies from Europe, the US and Asia have demonstrated older age to be a risk factor for BPH onset and clinical progression by several different metrics [4] . Prostate volume also increases with age, with data from the Krimpen and Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) cohorts suggesting a prostate growth rate of 2.0% to 2.5% per year in older men [5, 6] . Current estimates are that the number of individuals 80 years and older in the US will rise from 9.3 million in 2000 to 19.5 million in 2030, an increase of over 100% [7] . With the exclusion of non-melanomatous skin malignancy, prostate cancer is the second most prevalent cancer in men globally. The International Agency for Research on Cancer reported that Carcinoma prostate accounted for 14% of cancers diagnosed in men and over 900, 000 cases were diagnosed throughout the world in 2008 alone. It is the most common type of cancer in men in the United States, with 186,000 new cases in 2008 and 28,600 deaths [8] .\nTo prevent an equal rise in mortality, early detection of prostate cancer will become essential, as will the detection of premalignant lesions such as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia is now considered to be the most important precursor of prostate cancer and can only be diagnosed by thorough histopathological examination of prostatic tissue along with serum PSA levels estimation.

Fixation-It is commonly done by formalin. The formalin is commercially available as saturated solution of formaldehyde gas in water. For fixation of tissue, a 10% solution is used which is prepared by dissolving 10 ml of commercially available formalin in 90 ml of water. It takes 6-8 hours for fixation at room tempreture. The amount of fixative required is 15-20 times the volume of the specimen. Dehydration-This is a process in which water from the cells & tissue is removed so that this space is subsequently taken up by wax. It is carried out by passing the tissue through a series of ascending grades of alcohol: 70%, 80%, 95% & absolute alcohol. Clearing-This is the process in which alcohol from tissue & cells is removed & is replaced by a fluid in which wax is soluble & it also makes the tissue transparent. Xylene is used for this purpose. Impregnation-This is the process in which empty spaces in the tissue & cells after removal of water are taken up by paraffin wax. This hardens the tissue which helps in tissue cutting. Impregnation is done in molten paraffin wax which has the melting point of 56 0 C (54-56 0C ). Now a days all above processes of fixation, dehydration, clearing & impregnation are carried out in a special equipment which is known as automatic tissue processor (histokinet). The tissue processor has 12-16 glass jars for formalin, ascending grades of alcohol, xylene & thermostatically controlled two paraffin wax baths to keep paraffin wax in molten state. Tissue moves automatically by hydraulic mechanism from one jar to another after fixed time schedule and the whole process 16-22 hours."}, {"section_title": "Embedding & Blocking", "text": "Embedding of tissue is done in molten wax.

Cut the section by operating the microtome manually after adjusting the thickness at 5-Sections are picked from the knife with the help of a forceps. These are made to float in a water bath which is kept at temperature of 40-45 0 C i.e slightly below the melting point of wax. This removes folds in section.\nFrom water bath sections are picked on a clean glass slide coated with egg albumin. The glass slide is placed in an oven maintained at a temperature of 56 0 C for 20-30 minutes for proper drying & better adhesion.

In view of high degree of association of HGPIN with prostatic carcinoma, it is suggested that these HGPIN patients need close follow-up, observations and investigations to rule out existence of carcinoma, especially in the peripheral zone. [ [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] In the present study, 38/150 cases (25.3%) showing prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score of 2-4 (well differentiated), 5-6 (moderately differentiated), 7(moderately to poorly differentiated), 8-10 (poorly differentiated) were noted in 39.4%, 21.0%, 8.0% and 31.6% cases respectively. The various studies done by Mwakyoma and Mabandi showed 5.3%, 61.1% and 33.6% cases had Gleason score of 2-4, 5-7 and 8-10 respectively; Divrik et al observed 9.7%, 76.7% and 13.6% cases having Gleason score of 2-4, 5-7 and 8-10 respectively. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] The results for the cases with Gleason scoring between 8-10 i.e poorly differentiated tumours are comparable to other studies. Thus, the present study shows more number of cases with gleason's score 2-4. This may be because of regular screening, follow up & early treatment of patients coming with symptoms of prostatic pathology in our institute. Thus, low grade malignancies are treated well in time & are not allowed to progress to higher grades. [13] [23] [24] We found that the distribution of adenocarcinoma prostate cases in relation to PSA values as 0%, 0%, 13 [27] [28] [29] [30] Therefore, In view of increasing trend of the occurrence of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions of the prostate in the elderly, the current study aims at evaluating the histomorphological features of prostate specimens with its correlation to serum PSA levels. Evaluation of serum total PSA levels in patients having complaints of prostatism helps in estimating the extent of disease, this also incidates the level of prostate involvement & extraprostatic extension even before other invasive procedure like biopsy is done. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a kallikrein like serine protease produced exclusively by the epithelial cells of the prostate. Although increased PSA levels have been found to be closely associated with prostate cancer, there can be different reasons for an elevated PSA level, including benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis, prostatic trauma, and prostatic infarction.
