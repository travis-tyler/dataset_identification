Stationarity, the idea that natural systems fluctuate within an unchanging envelope of variability, is a foundational concept that permeates training and practice in water-resource engineering (Milly 2007) The old paradigm was that engineers designed coastal infrastructure using a fixed average return period under assumptions of stationarity. Engineers treated uncertainty about the future by increasing design capacity by using factors of safety. Practice in the late 20 th century using probabilistic methods applied for designing coastal structures generally assumed that extreme events are stationary.  Designs for existing built coastal infrastructure which were made under assumptions of stationarity may now been inadequate for present and future conditions due the recognition of the impact of non-stationarity on designs base on a fixed return period. Many studies in the past decades have shown that hydrological records exhibit some type of non-stationarity. Human intervention in river basins (e.g., urbanization), the effect of low-frequency climatic variability (e.g., Pacific Decadal Oscillation), and climate change due to increased greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere have been suggested to be the leading causes of changes in the hydrologic cycle of river basins in addition to changes in the magnitude and frequency of extreme floods and extreme sea levels (Salas 2013)."}, {"section_title": "LIST OF TABLES", "text": "Understanding and recognition of the impact of global sea level rise and climate change design variables such as water level due to non-stationarity represents a paradigm shift in coastal engineering.

Consequently, sea-level extremes will change accordingly. However, the projections of the future sea-levels are highly uncertain, which have led coastal engineering specialists to suggest scenario-based approaches for mean sea-level increase (NRC 1987; USACE 2011a; Obeysekera and Park 2013)."}, {"section_title": "The Role of Preparedness and Resilience in Vulnerability Assessments", "text": "President Barak Obama issued an executive order (EO) (Order 13653 2013) meant to prepare the United States for the impacts of climate change.

This literature review compared vulnerability assessments reviewed to the four key elements of the proposed framework. The criteria for the comparison by framework element follows: 1 Scenarios -Does the reviewed vulnerability assessment include scenarios or scenario based analysis. 2 Common Tidal, Geodetic Vertical Datum Reference-Does the vulnerability assessment explicitly insure that a common reference or adjustment between tidal and geodetic vertical datums is exists. 3 Total Water Levels -Does the vulnerability assessment utilize analysis of extreme water level events, or utilize total water level models to define coastal forcing. 4 Performance -Does the vulnerability assessment explicitly attempt to account for performance changes caused by global sea level rise?   The research goal is to define and categorize technical approaches and methods needed to develop the four primary elements of the CPRR framework. Performance is defined and tracked over time until a performance \"threshold\" is reached. Repeating the process under additional scenarios representing the range of plausible global sea level rise impacts provides a bounded estimate of when design performance will be negatively impacted or lost over time. A CPRR analysis may utilize a tiered approach which begins using a simple elevation model in which performance is recognized as the static design or as-built elevation compared to a time series of a projected critical coastal water level based on a return level or some other key metric. Using a distribution of possible values for analysis in both the coastal water level and infrastructure definitions will provide additional precision in computing performance thresholds. Because much of the coastal infrastructure in the United States was designed and constructed 50 to 100 years ago, the performance analysis period in CPRR may span 150 to 200 years when past and future performance is considered."}, {"section_title": "Datum Adjustment", "text": "A common vertical reference datum is necessary to convert the dynamic local tidal datum to a static, geodetic datum to account for non-stationarity in historical coastal forcing assumptions used to develop designs and to accurately assess performance over time. Accounting for past and future vertical datum adjustments and applying appropriate uncertainty to the adjustments is a key first step in a vulnerability assessment using the CPRR framework. In the United States, the current terrestrial vertical datum is NAVD88. Perhaps the most critical foundation for a performance based assessment of coastal infrastructure is an understanding of the vertical datum in use at the time of design and construction, and the datum corrections (if any) made to coastal water levels used to support the design. In the United States, prior to the mid-1970s, the vertical datum used for many USACE "}, {"section_title": "Figure 4 -Conceptual schematic depicting key relationships between tidal and geodetic datums", "text": "Sea level changes affecting coastal water levels are measured by tide gauges referenced to tidal datums. Tidal datums define a static mean sea level reference to the geodetic vertical datum NAVD88 or NGVD29 based on the current National Tidal Datum Epoch (NTDE). NTDE's are roughly 18 to 19 years and correspond to an 18.6-year astronomical cycle. In areas with high rates of vertical land movement impacting sea levels, such as Alaska and Louisiana, tidal datums are revised in 5-year cycles. The CPRR is developed with the current NAVD88 vertical datum for vulnerability assessments made in the continental United States. The CPRR may be applied internationally using the same principles, changing the reference to the local geodetic datum. The CPRR framework utilizes a simplifying assumption that the current vertical, geodetic datum in use, NAVD88 is static, and incorporates adjustments from the current tidal datum and older geodetic datum, NGVD29 to place coastal water levels adjusted for non-stationarity and existing coastal infrastructure elevations on the same baseline."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Water Levels", "text": "The key processes which impact design and performance of coastal infrastructure are tides, winds, precipitation and waves. Several researchers have described a component based or \"Total Water Level\" (TWL) approach (Ruggerio et al. 2001), (Serafin and Ruggerio 2014), and . Since the TWL model components are process based, it is often used to design coastal infrastructure.   Existing condition TWL's may be modified and projected for the entire range of possible future rates of RSLR, represented a scenario describing a global sea level rise prediction. The methods for this adjustment and a discussion of scenarios is follows in section 3.3. The local RSLC rate is applied to the equations developed for various scenarios and projected from the datum base year of 1992. This procedure sets the start year for the three USACE scenarios at the datum base year 1992, and insures that the datum adjustment to NAVD88 is not over or under adjusted. Existing condition TWL's adjusted from the local tidal datum to NAVD88 reflect the datum base year of 1992 since the datum adjustment from the floating tidal datum to the static geodetic datum is reflected in the average shift of mean sea level over the 19-year tidal epoch. TWL's are adjusted for RSLC using the assumption of linear superposition, that is, a time-based increment of elevation change is added or subtracted to the static TWL. The dynamic TWL components are added to the revised static TWL. In some cases, the adjustment in the static TWL may result in a transition from a depth-limited condition for dynamic TWL, causing an abrupt change in the dynamic TWL or a non-linear shift. Thus, transitions in TWL's should be evaluated for significant elevation changes. More complex interactions with local topography and bathymetry may cause non-linear effects and additional calculation to account for the nonlinear combinations."}, {"section_title": "Methodology, Total Water Level Model", "text": "TWL's may be categorized in probabilistic terms as annual exceedance probability (AEP) water levels, adjusted to the year 1992. In practical terms, as sea level increases with time, AEP will change as well. An AEP 10% 1992 datum base year TWL elevation will increase in frequency of occurrence as sea level increases. Thus, TWL AEPs adjusted for future SLC represent dynamic return periods with respect to the datum base year elevation and the scenario projection. This concept has implications for design performance assessment and future vulnerability.   The detrended data set represents a stationary data set to which one or more statistical models may be fit as described in step 5. Table 2 lists common statistical models which may be used. Best practices for developing extreme water level probability using tide gauge or other coastal water level records are presented in (Arns, et.al. 2013).  The GEV model is most commonly used to develop extreme value statistics from coastal water levels from observed tide gauge data. These data are assumed to be SWL and may have to adjusted by adding dynamic TWL components for some vulnerability assessments."}, {"section_title": "Scenario Projections", "text": "Vulnerability assessments of existing coastal infrastructure rely on application of the most current science to prediction of changes induced by global sea level change and climate change. At this time, there is no consensus prediction of the magnitude of global sea level change with in the proposed assessment time frame of 100 years. Figure 9 shows the range of global sea level rise projections, 1987 to 2013 (NRC 1987), (IPCC 2001), (IPCC 2007), (Rahmstorf 2007), (Horton 2008), (Pfeffer 2008), (Vermeer and Rahnstorf 2009), (Jevrejeva et al. 2010). The range of overall global sea level rise future projections is large, including the range within individual projections, suggesting that assigning probabilities to any one projection would not be useful. The range of estimates since 1987 confirm the paradigm shift from the recent past of stationarity or non-stationarity with predictable changes to a wider range of uncertainty requiring a shift in evaluation techniques for vulnerability assessments. In fact, prematurely down-selecting to one future or assigning probabilities a priori to any of these projections could result in inaccurate vulnerability assessments of coastal infrastructure. The CPRR framework recommends that a scenario based approach be utilized to make coastal vulnerability assessments. The use of scenarios to make vulnerability assessments is supported by the following points (Pietrowsky 2011); 1. Scenarios are appropriate when uncertainties are large, the consequences are significant, and outcomes cannot be bounded. 2. Sea level change (and more broadly, broader climate change) meets the first and last of these three conditions. For the second condition, sensitivity analysis may be used to determine the potential consequence of sea-level change, and the sensitivity test guides our scope of study and the rigor of the scenario analysis. The CPRR framework supports a tiered analysis approach, utilizing application of parametric, non-parametric, and reliability analysis techniques to adjust estimates of coastal water levels, design or existing performance within the constraints of a scenario. Additional analysis within the framework components may add precision a vulnerability assessment, and more importantly offer valuable information such as rates of performance loss under the range of global sea level rise scenarios analyzed. Global sea level rise scenarios are related to global climate scenarios. Climate scenarios are plausible representations of the future that are consistent with assumptions about future emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants and with our understanding of the effect of increased atmospheric concentrations of these gases on global climate. A range of scenarios can be used to identify the sensitivity of an exposure unit to climate change and to help policy makers decide on appropriate policy responses. It is important to emphasize that, unlike weather forecasts, climate scenarios are not predictions (Carter 2007). The choice of climate scenarios and related non-climatic scenarios is important because it can influence the outcome of a coastal infrastructure vulnerability assessment 100 years into the future. Extreme scenarios can produce extreme impacts; moderate scenarios may produce more modest effects (Smith and Hulme 1998). It follows that the selection of scenarios can also be controversial, unless the fundamental uncertainties inherent in future projections are properly addressed in the impact analysis (Carter 2007). When evaluating results of a vulnerability assessment developed with the CPRR framework, conceptually, the scenario based analysis informs the potential timing, so that question comes down \"when, not it \"performance will be impacted. Carter (2007), provides definitions and guidelines for commonly used terms used in developing coastal water level data for analyses ( Figure 10)."}, {"section_title": "Figure 10 --Diagram describing types of information with corresponding uncertainty against level of detail", "text": "Projection. The term \"projection\" is used in two senses in the climate change literature. In general usage, a projection can be regarded as any description of the future and the pathway leading to it. However, a more specific interpretation has been attached to the term \"climate projection\" by the IPCC when referring to model-derived estimates of future climate. Forecast/Prediction. When a projection is designated \"most likely\" it becomes a forecast or prediction. A forecast is often obtained using physically-based models, possibly a set of these, outputs of which can enable some level of confidence to be attached to projections. Scenario. A scenario is a coherent, internally consistent and plausible description of a possible future state of the world (IPCC 1994). It is not a forecast; rather, each scenario is one alternative image of how the future can unfold. A projection may serve as the raw material for a scenario, but scenarios often require additional information (e.g., about baseline conditions). A set of scenarios is often adopted to reflect the range of uncertainty in projections. Other terms that have been used as synonyms for scenario are \"characterization\", \"storyline\" and \"construction\". The use of multiple scenarios is recommended for vulnerability assessments of coastal infrastructure in the CPRR framework. Baseline/Reference. The baseline (or reference) is any datum against which change is measured. It might be a \"current baseline\", in which case it represents observable, present-day conditions. It might also be a \"future baseline\", which is a projected future set of conditions excluding the driving factor of interest. Alternative interpretations of the reference conditions can give rise to multiple baselines.

The TWL model is used to describe the dominant processes and frequency of occurrence which controls infrastructure performance being investigated. Table 4 shows a list of common processes with frequency of occurrence. Frequency of occurrence under RSLC is variable since the base condition is changing. To assess performance using an elevation-time performance model, several pieces of information must be developed for the infrastructure being assessed. 1. Define the critical design elevation based on a static (geodetic) elevation 2. Performance criteria based on original design 3. Performance criteria based on current design or existing condition The critical elevation is defined as the elevation at which performance is measured. In the lowest tier of analysis, it may be defined as the elevation at which a water level crosses a structural elevation threshold, such as a levee crest or top dike. Performance may be tied to the water level crossing which is a significant if not a damaging event. Critical elevations are often tied to specific physical processes for which the infrastructure is designed to perform against coastal forcing defined by water levels. Typically, an elevation based metric will be defined as a limit state or performance/non-performance metric, such that a water level exceeding the critical elevation is defined as non-performance. This elevation may be defined as the crest of a coastal levee, or some elevation above or below the crest at which will trigger a process which represents a condition at which the design fails or does not perform. For example, a water level elevation above the crest of a coastal dike which meets and exceeds the defined critical elevation when combined with a duration may represent an overtopping flow rate which is exceeds design standards causing a process such as erosion which can lead to failure. Similarly, a water level which meets and exceeds a defined critical elevation which is below the coastal dike crest may trigger a different process leading to non-performance or failure such as seepage or flow transmission through the dike. In practice, a coastal structure may have one or more critical elevations which are tied to specific processes which are triggered by water levels meeting or exceeding those critical elevations. Figure 11 shows two performance metrics for an armored coastal structure. Rear side or back slope erosion performance is measured by overtopping rate, which would be a CPRR analysis which is based on a process -overtopping rate. While it is possible to convert the critical or non-performing overtopping rate to an elevation, since the performance metric is based on a flow rate, it is clearer to present the performance analysis using function based parameter such as flow rate. The second performance metric in Figure 11, armor stability, would be a CPRR analysis which is based on an on an elevation based performance threshold. In this case, the critical water level metric is wave height at the structure.

A reliability based time series is created for one or more scenarios and performance may be assessed."}, {"section_title": "Figure 13-Example function-based performance model for an 1800 cfs pump station", "text": "Performance thresholds for reliability are based on risk tolerance. Typically, satisfactory performance is defined as 0.5 which means that loading and forcing are equal. Applying reliability is a significant refinement of the lower level assessment allowing parametric and non-parametric uncertainty to be applied. Reliability is computed for each time step with RSLC applied to the coastal water level being assessed. A benefit of using a reliability-based model is that it provides an improved performance window estimate as well as how fast performance declines as it nears a defined reliability threshold. Performance of existing coastal infrastructure is defined using a limit state approach borrowed from reliability engineering which defines unsatisfactory performance. Kamphuis, (Kamphuis 2010) describes a probabilistic design technique defined by: where R is the resistance or strength of the structure, S is the design load (typically related to a AEP water level), and is the factor of safety (Reeve 2006, 2009, Kamphuis 2010.. Failure is a binary or step function, when > the probability of failure is 0, when < , the probability of failure is 1. The Limit State Equation, is an expression which grossly represents the design equation, defines the failure function as: Where G is called the failure function. When G > 0, the design condition fails or does not perform. Using this basic model, we can use it to define performance with G representing the performance variable. The CPRR framework uses the term non-performance instead of failure. One of the goals of a CPRR analysis is to assess infrastructure performance across a wide range of plausible futures and define performance thresholds for one or more scenarios which define a time window, allowing for a planned intervention in the future before a nonperformance condition leads to failure. Performance in the CPRR framework is represented using this equation,  The CPRR framework is designed to assess performance using increasing levels of detail in a tiered approach. Owing to the large variety, and complexity of coastal infrastructure types and subcomponents, the CPRR framework utilizes three performance models: The two performance categories may be analyzed in greater detail by applying parametric uncertainty to key design elements in reliability analysis. Refinement of the performance function will cause the performance threshold estimate to adjust and add precision to the CPRR analysis. Many coastal structure designs are based on physical model tests which have produced empirical performance ranges for design elements. These performance ranges may be incorporated into the performance function using parametric distributions. The highest level of analysis converts the two performance categories to a reliability function. There are several advantages of using reliability in a CPRR analysis: 1. The reliability function uses the same basic load-resistance model, with uncertainty defined on both sides of the equation. 2. Reliability analysis may be conducted at additional levels of detail, including stochastic simulation of both load and resistance elements. 3. Reliability is a better metric for evaluating risk and vulnerability (Read and Vogel 2015) than the traditional return period concept which is not well suited to non-stationarity. Applying  The seawall supports major infrastructure such as roadways, buildings and underground mass transit systems by providing a raised elevation which provides protection from tidal driven water levels in San Francisco Bay (Figure 16). The NOAA tide gauge network around San Francisco Bay (Figure 17) has been in existence for many years and provides key information needed to develop a CPRR analysis, measured water level data and concurrent astronomical tidal predictions which support the total water level approach used in the CPRR. The tide gauge network also provides a tidal datum along with conversion to the geodetic datum NAVD88.

To remove the bias due to RSLC, the observed data set is converted to a stationary data set by detrending the data using the RSLC trend developed from the long term linear regression of mean sea level data. The trend of the monthly peak water level data is slightly higher; the mean sea level trend is used because the tidal datum correction to the geodetic datum (NAVD88) is based on mean sea level. For monthly data records, the formula to adjust observed water levels is given by: where y t is the adjustment factor in feet for a water level at time t and is added to data before June 1992, the midpoint of the current NTDE (1983)(1984)(1985)(1986)(1987)(1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001) and subtracted from data after June 1992. The datum adjustment procedure in the CPRR assumes that tidal datum elevations also represent the midpoint of the NTDE, so data adjustments in the Coastal Water Level step of the CPRR are also tied to the same date. Therefore, the observed data record form NOAA 9414290 is detrended to the year 1992, so that the data set corresponds to the tidal datum adjustment to NAVD88. This enables future RSLC projections in the Scenario Projections step to be made from a concurrent starting point accounting for the tidal datum adjustment. This is important since the observed data record includes the astronomical tidal range which is part of the tidal datum. An example detrending adjustment for NOAA tide gage 9414290 is presented below: Observed monthly peak water level for August 1897 = 5.78 feet NAVD88, t = 1897.667 Detrending adjustment factor: 1897.667 [(1992.5  From a practical perspective, this conversion also shows the impact of relative sea level change on historical water levels, a water level of 5.78 feet in 1897 is equivalent to 6.48 feet in 1992 terms and even higher in 2017 terms (6.48 + 0.16 = 6.64 feet), with the addition of RSLC from 1992-2017 at the RSLC rate of 1.96 mm/year. The impact of the detrending adjustment is shown in Figure 24. The histograms in Figure 24 representing the observed data and detrended data show a shift to the right representing higher elevations created by adding the detrending adjustment to the observed data. Detrending the observed record enables the impact of RSLC to be reflected in storms which occurred many years ago. Detrending removes bias due to RSLC and allows the observed dataset to be made stationary and adjusted to the datum base year of 1992. Detrending adjustments are necessary to correct for observed RSLC in the record and assure an accurate tidal to geodetic adjustment. A simplistic data adjustment based on the difference between MHHW levels was used to transfer the observed record of monthly peaks from NOAA 9414290 which are at or above MHHW to the San Francisco Waterfront area represented by the NOAA 9414317.

Two AEP water levels determined from extreme value statistical analysis from section 4.3 are selected for evaluation, a 10 and 100-year AEP. These specific water levels will be projected into the future as a time series representing each scenario. The point where time series for each scenario crosses the elevation defining the specific infrastructure element is a performance threshold representing a specific time in the future.       The information developed for the reliability-based performance model uses the same basic information as the elevation-based performance model. The analysis follows these steps: 1. Define limit state for reliability analysis. Performance for initial flooding of the Ferry Building is defined as annual exceedance of water levels at elevation 9.5 feet NAVD. Water levels will be based on the cumulative distribution function of the annual peak water level series developed at the Pier 22 and \u00bd tidal datum. 2. The reliability analysis is developed by assigning uncertainty to significant and critical infrastructure performance elevation(s). Performance elevations with uncertainty are assumed to be normally distributed. 3. Create performance function using 1992 water levels.  The general performance equation adapted to the CPRR framework is given as: where G = Performance in feet, R = Resistance (static infrastructure elevation) in feet, S = Load Probability of failure or non-performance without uncertainty is found using the cumulative probability distribution point (CDF) equivalent to where the GEV function defining the water levels is equal to one of the SWL elevations defining the limit states for the infrastructure functions, 9.5 or 11.00 feet NAVD88 respectively.

Construction of the SHB started in May 1965 and was completed in January 1969. The project consists of three elements. The first, a barrier at the east branch of Stamford Harbor, is composed of a 2,850-ft-long earth fill dike with stone slope protection. It has an elevation of 17 feet 1962 mean sea level (MSL). A 90-ft-wide opening is provided for navigation, and a pump station discharges interior drainage (Morang 2007). The project is designed so that closures of the navigation gate will keep coastal tidal flooding from impacting the inner harbor. The navigation gate is opened during low tide to allow any high water that has collected in the harbor due to precipitation, runoff, and/or storm water to drain.  The second element is a barrier that provides protection at the west branch of the harbor. This barrier, which has an elevation of 17 feet, is composed of a 1,350-foot-long concrete wall; 2,950 feet of earth fill dike with stone slope protection and a pumping station. The third element provides protection at Westcott Cove. This barrier is a 4,400-foot earth fill dike with stone slope protection having a maximum elevation of 19 feet. It also has two pumping stations.

The analysis will follow the same basic steps in the CPRR framework shown in   When examining SHB project documents produced prior to 1976, it is assumed that the reference to \"msl\" was in relation to the 1929 vertical datum (not a local tidal datum). In this sense, \"msl\" is equivalent to NGVD29 prior to 1976. It is also noted that prior to 1976, local tidal datums such as mean high water (MHW) were often referenced to the vertical datum of \"msl\". Using the current documentation (post 1976), the term \"msl\" can introduce ambiguity as \"msl\" is often assumed to represent mean sea level based on a local tidal datum; not the vertical datum of NGVD29 which represented a static geodetic datum.      The tide is diurnal at Stamford Harbor meaning two high tides or two low tides are possible in a 24-hour period. Therefore, two gate closure operations are possible within a 24hour period. Because the long-term water level record is at a daily time step, the functional modeling of future gate closures will use a daily time step and assume a single closure in a daily time step. Since the primary goal of CPRR analysis is to locate performance thresholds, the assumption of one closure per day will be an accurate estimate for threshold targets which are determined by operational factors and cost of operation. Continuous gauge records at SHB are available starting in 2001. To estimate daily peak water levels at SHB prior to 2001 the data adjustment technique used in the San Francisco Waterfront Elevation CPRR in Chapter 4 was utilized to adjust daily peak water levels from the NOAA gauge at Bridgeport, CT (NOAA 8467150). The adjustment is based on the ratio between MHHW at the Bridgeport, CT (NOAA 8467150) tide gauge and MHHW to the Stanford Harbor, CT (NOAA 8469198), the ratio is given by an amplification factor, A: Water levels prior to 2001 were adjusted by 0.3 feet to complete the record of daily maximums at Stamford, 0.3 feet was added as a general adjustment to the Bridgeport data based on the estimate developed with equation 6.1. Additional data on water levels above 5.9 feet was available from the SHB operational records, so the bulk adjustment was used on Bridgeport water levels between MHHW and 5.6 feet NAVD88. A functional analysis of gate closure operations requires a more refined application of the statistical model approach used for a performing water level based on annual peak water levels. For the gate closure function, the daily ocean side peak water level governs the gate closure decision. The long term operational record shows a high degree of variability on daily peak water levels which trigger gate operation in monthly, seasonal, and interannual time scales. This variability is reflected in the long-term operational record by water year in Figure 51. While the variability is significant year to year, the record does not show a clear increase in NGC from RSLR.  Figure 53 shows the workflow for application of RSLC scenarios.

A 1200-acre catchment drains into the East Branch Harbor and the interior drainage for the catchment relies on storage provided by the harbor at water levels below 5.9 feet NAVD88. Interior drainage of the 1200-acre catchment is augmented by a combination of pump capacity and harbor storage which are part of the SHB project.  Qualitatively, NGC will increase with increasing RSLR. Development of a function based CPRR of NGC will provide insight on how current operations will be impacted by the magnitude and rate of RSLR at the SHB. The number of NGC per water year since the project opened has been highly variable over a year to year basis, and even seasonally.

When the simulation model results are rounded to an integer result, agreement is slightly improved with 251 NGC over the twenty-year period with an average of 11.95 per year. Table 19 presents the validation results by water year. The model was run using simulated water levels and not the actual time series incorporating the low or observed RSLR rate at SHB.

New coastal infrastructure plans, and designs will recognize the paradigm shift in assumptions from hydrologic stationarity to non-stationarity in coastal water levels and adjust. As we transition into the new paradigm, there is a significant knowledge gap which must address built coastal infrastructure vulnerability based on the realization that the underlying design assumptions may be invalid at present or in the near future as the impacts of global sea level rise continue. Restating the research objectives from Section 1.2, the primary conclusions of the work completed to date are: \u2022 Define a framework to assess vulnerability. The framework should be applicable to a wide range of coastal infrastructure types and geographic areas. The CPRR framework to assess vulnerability of coastal infrastructure was presented in Section 3.0, with the following major elements: (1) datum adjustment, (2) coastal water levels, (3) scenario projections, and (4) performance thresholds. The four elements are applied in order, and vulnerability is defined by the determination of performance thresholds. Performance thresholds are defined by the intersection of coastal water level time series, and performance models based on elevation, function or reliability are projected 100 years into the future. \u2022 Develop methodologies to execute the framework. The methodologies should account for the impact of non-stationarity in past and future water levels for the design and performance of existing coastal infrastructure. Methodologies and workflows were developed and are associated with each of the four framework elements.   reliability-based performance model was applied to address overall reliability of long term navigation access in and out of East Branch Harbor. Both case studies were in different geographic locations, demonstrating the utility and repeatability of the framework and recommended methods. The major framework elements and associated methods were shown to be adaptable to a wide range of project types.
