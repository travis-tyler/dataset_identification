[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "COVID-19 is a disease cause by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was identified in Wuhan city, in the Hubei province of China in December 2019 (Chen et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) . The virus is spread between people via small droplets produce by talking, sneezing and coughing. The disease was declared a global pandemic by the World health organization (WHO) on March 11th, 2020. While a large proportion of the cases results in mild symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigues, loss of smell and taste, as well as shortness of breath, some cases progress into more acute respiratory symptoms such as pneumonia, multiple-organ failure, septic shock and blood clots. These more severe symptoms can lead to death and are likely to be precipitated by a cytokine storm after infection and multiplication of the virus in humans. Indeed, recent data indicate that the levels of IL-6 correlate with respiratory and organ failures (Gubernatorova et al., 2020) . So far, the estimated death rate of SARS-CoV-2 is above 1.3%, which is more than 10 times higher than the death rate of seasonal influenza (Abdollahi et al., 2020) . Older patients and patients who have serious underlying medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and asthma are at higher risk for severe disease outcomes . A clear understanding of the genetics and molecular mechanisms controlling severe illness remains to be determined. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus, closely related to SARS-CoV-1, which caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused MERS in 2012. Positive-strand RNA viruses are a large fraction of known viruses including common pathogens such as rhinoviruses that cause common colds, as well as dengue virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), West Nile virus. The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was released in early January on the open access virological website (http://virological.org/) (Zhou et al., 2020) . Its genome is ~29.8 kb and possesses 14 open reading frames (ORFs), encoding 27 proteins (Wu et al., 2020a) . The genome contains four structural proteins: spike (S) glycoprotein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. The E and M proteins form the viral envelope, while the N protein binds to the virus's RNA genome. The spike glycoprotein is a key surface protein that interacts with cell surface receptor, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (Ace2) mediating entrance of the virus into host cells (Zhu et al., 2018) . In addition to its dependence on the binding of S to Ace2, cell entry also requires priming of S by the host serine protease, transmembrane serine protease 2 (Tmprss2). Tmprss2 proteolytically processes S, promoting membrane fusion, cell invasion and viral uptake (Heurich et al., 2014; Hoffmann et al., 2020) . Blocking viral entry by targeting S/Ace2 interaction or Tmprss2-mediated priming may constitute an effective treatment strategy for COVID-19. The non-structural proteins, which include the main viral protease (nsp5 or M pro ) and RNA polymerase (nsp12), regulate virus replication and assembly. They are expressed as two long polypeptides, pp1a and pp1ab, which are proteolytically processed by M pro .\nThe key role of M pro in viral replication makes it a good therapeutic target as well. A third group of proteins are described as accessory proteins. This group is the least understood, but its members are thought to counteract host innate immunity (Kim et al., 2020, Cell 181, 914-921) (Fig. 1A) .\nThere is currently no treatment or vaccine available to prevent or treat COVID-19 (Baden and Rubin, 2020; Lurie et al., 2020) (https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19update-daily-roundup-june- . While the FDA has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the 65-year-old antimalarial drug, hydroxychloroquine, COVID-19 treatment based on early results from clinical trial in China and France Gautret et al., 2020a; Gautret et al., 2020b; Million et al., 2020) , more recent results reported that hydroxychloroquine does not decrease viral replication, pneumonia or hospital mortality, and may in fact increase cardiac arrest in patients infected with COVID-19 Rosenberg et al., 2020) . The accuracy of the statistical analyses in these studies raised serious concerns in the scientific community. More accurate data are needed to reach a conclusion about the effect of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients. In another recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the antiviral remdesivir, an unapproved drug that was originally developed to fight Ebola, seemed to improve patients with severe breathing problems (Beigel et al., 2020) and has also recently been granted EUA by the FDA. Repurposing drugs that are designed to treat other diseases is one of the quickest ways to find therapeutics to control the current pandemic. Such drugs have already been tested for toxicity issues and can be granted EUA by the FDA to help doctors to treat COVID-19 patients.\nAnother efficient way to attack the virus is to use drug cocktails to target multiple enzymes/pathways used by the virus. Combination therapy has the advantage of being less likely to select for treatmentresistant viral mutants. Such a strategy has been successfully used to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human-immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. In the case of HCV, the treatment, Enpclusa, combines sofosbuvir, which inhibits the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B), and velpatasvir, a defective substrate that inhibits NS5A. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) against HIV combines drugs from different drug classes to target disparate aspects of the HIV replication cycle. These drug classes include nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, fusion inhibitors, CCR5 antagonists, post-attachment inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors. One example from HIV-AIDS literature is the randomized comparison of 4 groups of patients comparing monotherapy to combination therapies: zidovudine (ZDV) monotherapy; ZDV zidovudine and didanosine; ZDV plus zalcitabine; or didanosine monotherapy. This randomized trial showed positive results when ZDT was combined with didanosine or zalcitabine, and for didanosine compared to ZDT monotherapy in raising CD4 counts greater than 50% (Hammer et al., 1996) . Combination therapy has become standard of care initial treatment in other infectious diseases such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and failure to cure with monotherapy and requires multidrug therapy (MDT) (Collaborative Group for the Meta-Analysis of Individual Patient Data in et al., 2018) . Similar MDT is also found effective in hepatitis C virus infection using glecaprevir and pibrentasivr combination therapies which lead to sustained virological response rates as far out as 12 weeks' post-treatment (Wang et al., 2019) .\nWe propose an effective combination therapy for COVID-19 could target the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle at multiple levels to synergistically inhibit viral spread and dissemination. Using a computational pipeline that aimed to expeditiously identify lead compounds against COVID-19, we combined compound library preparation, molecular modeling, and structure simulations to generate an ensemble of conformations and increase high quality docking outcomes against two essential SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and their host protein interactions; S/Ace2, Tmprss2, Cathepsin L and K, and M pro that are known to control both viral binding, entry and virus replication (Fig. 1A) . Our in silico approach (Fig.  1B) , which will most likely lead into experimental virus screening, structural characterization of binding interactions by X-ray crystallography, and compound safety profiling. Virtual screening (VS) is a rational driven controller for identification of new hits from compound libraries (Willett, 2006) using either ligandbased (LBvs) or structure-based (SBvs) virtual screening (Dror et al., 2004) . LBvs tactics use structural and biological data of known active compounds to select favorable candidates with biological activity from experiments (Jahn et al., 2009; Maldonado et al., 2006) . SBvs approaches, on the other hand, examine quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), clustering, pharmacophore and 3D shape matching (Villoutreix et al., 2007) . The utility of VS is evident in the growth of our knowledge base of new compounds and existing drugs as well as the expansion of our structural databases. SBvs is generally the preferred approach when access to the target 3D-information derived from NMR, X-ray crystallography or homology models (Jahn et al., 2009; Maldonado et al., 2006) is possible. Molecular docking (docking) is the most common SBvs approach used today (Bottegoni et al., 2009; Corbeil et al., 2012; Fernandez-Recio et al., 2005; Friesner et al., 2006; McGann, 2012; Morris et al., 2009 ) and searches for the ideal position and orientation (called \"pose\") of the small molecule within a target's binding site, which gives a score for the pose. When including knowledge of experimentally known compounds (\"actives\") from a 3D target, LBvs and SBvs can be combined to increase likelihood of obtaining new actives from searches (Kruger and Evers, 2010) .\nHit identification in VS also requires careful selection of the methods used based on the goal of the project (e.g. compound databases and libraries can be either proprietary, commercial or public) (Bender, 2010) . ZINC is one such large public database often used in VS (Irwin and Shoichet, 2005) , which contains millions of compounds. By contrast, other libraries have structure-activity relationships (SAR) databases (Scior et al., 2007) that integrate information about compound interactions with their known targets. DrugBank, Chem-Space are other attractive sources of compounds for drug repurposing (or repositioning) (Ashburn and Thor, 2004; Duenas-Gonzalez et al., 2008; O'Connor and Roth, 2005) (Wishart et al., 2008) , and maintain drug diversity that is useful for scaffold development (Gozalbes et al., 2008; Schreiber, 2000) .\nAdvances in computing power have increased utility of in silico screening capabilities and balanced the need for accuracy with virtual high-throughput screening approximations and assumptions (Anthony, 2009; Lee et al., 2008; McGaughey et al., 2007; Plewczynski et al., 2009) , while recent techniques have improved accuracy without sacrificing CPU time (Caulfield and Devkota, 2012; Caulfield et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2014; MacKerell et al., 1998; Phillips et al., 2005) (Fig. 1B) . Further innovations in docking methods have improved the exactness of empirical docking equations (Corbeil et al., 2012; Fernandez-Recio et al., 2005; Friesner et al., 2006; Kalid et al., 2012; Kruger and Evers, 2010; McGann, 2012) . Accuracy is improved by incorporating molecular flexibility with simulations (Caulfield, 2012; Caulfield et al., 2019; Caulfield and Medina-Franco, 2011; Caulfield et al., 2011; Caulfield et al., 2014; Kayode et al., 2016) , thus capturing conformational information on structural changes that directly impact compound docking results."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "To target the COVID19 problem on multiple fronts (e.g. Ace2:S protein, Tmprss2, M pro , and Cathepsin L and K), as well as improve our screening accuracy using our selected repurposing libraries and new chemical entity libraries (ZINC database), we implemented a novel method that integrates protein flexibility/shape, adaptive biasing algorithms, machine learning from drug data, and final Z-score matrix weighting to our drug modeling. We matched all FDA compounds with our realistic (X-ray derived) protein structures over a dynamic range of protein conformations with accelerated dynamics using our algorithms, such as Maxwell's demon molecular dynamics (MdMD); this approach combines docking with simulations for exploration of both ligand and protein flexibility (Caulfield, 2012; Caulfield et al., 2019; Caulfield and Devkota, 2012; Caulfield and Medina-Franco, 2011; Caulfield et al., 2014; Kayode et al., 2016; von Roemeling et al., 2018) . We then refined the drug-target interface our specific leaderlike hit compounds using the quantum mechanics (QM)-based scoring within our MdMD matrix (Caulfield, 2012) to make our go/no-go assessment, which is particularly useful with NCEs and de novo compound design (DCDs). The protocol for library, structural modeling, dynamics, refinement, and hit identification as part of a pipeline is given (Fig. 1B) ."}, {"section_title": "I. Modeling and Simulations for Improved Docking Outcome", "text": "To improve our docking outcome, we constructed x-ray structure-based models of Ace2 bound to Sprotein, M pro , and Tmprss2 in our molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) and virtual screening (Fig.  1B,S1 ). As S-protein interfaces with Ace2 at a distinct region from the active site ( Fig. S1A-D) , inhibition of the binding site by ligands may disrupt the Ace2/S-protein interaction. Canonical inhibitors of Ace2 bind at the active site where angiotensin interacts, whereas drugs directed at the structural region for S-protein binding are not overlapping with the binding site. The modulation of Ace2/S-protein interaction by canonical Ace2 inhibitors is likely allosteric and suboptimal. Therefore, directly targeting the interface of the interaction should increase efficacy of the approach and block COVID viral binding, precluding entry (Fig. S1) . Additional investigation into the glycosylation sites of the S-protein demonstrated that the Ace2 binding site is mostly unaffected by these additions (Fig. S2) .\nA. S-protein:Ace2 interaction (protein-protein inhibitor, PPI) requires dynamics to reveal binding site To get the optimal interface for drug screening, we used our grid searching algorithms, as well as site mapping and protein-protein docking, to examine the protein-protein interactions surface using MDS ( Fig. 2-3 ,S1) (Bhachoo and Beuming, 2017; Caulfield and Devkota, 2012; Caulfield et al., 2011; Caulfield and Harvey, 2007; Fernandez-Recio et al., 2005; Kozakov et al., 2006) . The protein-protein inhibitor (PPI) interaction complex did not identify any immediate binding site on the surface of the PPI interfaces. Nevertheless, a small pore around one single beta-sheet in the center of the PPI interaction area could be exploited as a weak point that may perturb the interface equilibrium. Using UniProt, which contains information about a number of confirmed mutations, we determined the relative potencies of PPI binding residues, identifying those that would likely affect the integrity of the complex (Fig. 2) . Residues K353 and Y41, which interact with D155 at the center of the PPI, are likely stabilizing its surface, potentially forming a useful \"hot spot\" for targeted druggability ( Fig. 2-3,S2) .\nTo check whether this is true and to understand how Ace2:S-protein cooperation functions, we performed two MD simulations, one with and one without the mutation of Y41A. This mutation causes strict inability to form the S-protein:Ace2 complex. Analysis of the trajectory of the wild-type protein, which possessed an intact complex, revealed the three most stable conformations of the \"hot spot\" region with expanded pores inside the triangle of residues K353, D155, Y41. Since it is impossible to determine which of these three conformations is the most stable, we ran three high-throughput screenings based on the donor-acceptor atoms and hydrophobic areas of the region. We then performed three MD simulations with top pose ligands. As demonstrated in Figure 3K , ligands failed binding within 10 ns, while docked ligands became leaders, as determined by energetic stability, during MD and interaction energy values (electrostatic -red, Van der Waals -blue) ( Fig. 3J/L) ."}, {"section_title": "B. Identification of predicted inhibitors to interrupt S-protein:Ace2 PPI via docking", "text": "To identify inhibitors of the S-protein:Ace2 interaction via docking, we used the best scoring compounds obtained after combination of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, which feeds into the pipeline for constraint-based screening. The high-throughput screening (HTS) of a PPI library did not produce any results, since the PPI binding sites were weakly identified shallow regions (Fig. 2,4A -D,S1). Compounds that made good insertion into the sites situated between Ace2 and S-protein were able to perturb the association of S-protein with Ace2 via steric hindrance of S-protein association (Fig.  3) . From the MDS, we detected compounds that decreased energy of stability between the Ace2:Sprotein complex, which is desired in an inhibitor of protein-protein interaction. As a whole, this approach identified a deep and narrow binding site to disturb the S-protein interaction with Ace2 (Fig. 3,4A-D) .\nC. Tmprss2 and M pro modeling requires dynamics to reveal optimal inhibitor binding To optimize the binding site of our inhibitors, we constructed a full-length (zymogen) model of Tmprss2 (epitheliasinogen), as well as a mature version of the protease (epitheliasin), as described in our method section ( Fig. 4E-G) . The mature protease model was used for MDS studies to generate a reference dynamical profile that can be used to assist in silico screening of Tmprss2 inhibitors. A control experiment was also completed with the uncleaved (non-catalytic) form of Tmprss2 to demonstrate the pocket's instability and poor ligand binding capacity ( Fig. S3 ) (Ko et al., 2015; Lucas et al., 2014; Wilson et al., 2005) . A full-length model of monomeric M pro was also constructed, as well as a homodimer ( Fig. 4H-K,S1 ). The structure derived from PDB code 6Y2F with its ligand was used for a consensus virtual screen . In addition, we used the dimer to generate a reference dynamical profile to assist with in silico screening and study its interdomain behavior."}, {"section_title": "D. Tmprss2 inhibitors identified", "text": "We acquired the dimer protein sequence from the UniProt database. BLAST search showed the highest identification values against factor XI, prothrombin, kallikrein proteases (~41-42%). However, we focused on ligands that could be active against active form of Tmprss2 protein. Thus, we found the ligand:\n(2s)-1-[(2r)-2-(Benzylsulfonylamino)-5-Guanidino-Pentanoyl]-N-[(4-Carbamimidoylphenyl)methyl]pyrrolidine-2-Carboxamide, contained within the ChemblDB repository (CHEMBL1229259) and active against Tmprss2, prothrombin, and Factor XI. Likewise, another docked model was recovered with macrocyclic ligand (CHEMBL3699198), called: Ethyl14-[[(E)-3- [5-chloro-2-(tetrazol-1-yl) phenyl]prop-2-enoyl]amino] -5-(methoxycarbonylamino)-17-oxo-8,16 diazatricyclo[13.3.1.02,7] nonadeca-1(18),2(7), 3,5,15(19) -pentaene-9-carboxylate. We launched several molecular dynamics simulations (up to 75 ns of duration) to understand the interaction with the target protein-binding site. Figure S3 shows the initial and stable/final states of our various models ( Fig. 4E-G) . The MD analysis provided useful results for selecting the appropriate model. After 15 ns MD, the putative binding site collapsed (Fig. S3,4E-G) . Although the active form of thrombin was used for Tmprss2 modeling, as a negative control we also examined the region with prothrombin-based binding site for completeness of the docking study (Fig. S3) . The overlay of the average homology model structure from MD and structure 3F68 (PDB code) was used as a template to compare protein-ligand interaction map and assign docking constraints (Baum et al., 2009) . Two optimal inhibitors for Tmprss2 were selected for demonstration purpose in Figure 5 . We also modeled Cathepsins L and K for preliminary work, since these can be implicated in late-endosomal entry of the virus (Fig. S4 )."}, {"section_title": "E. M pro inhibitors identified", "text": "For the viral main proteinase, M pro , a key enzyme for coronavirus replication (SARS-CoV-2), and a potential target for anti-SARS drug development, several peptidomimetics synthetized in early 2012 against SARS-CoV-1 proteases were identified as selective. There is a high degree of sequence identity between the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 M pro . This means that SARS-focused ligands could form similar interaction map with M pro protein and offers good launching points for 3D-QSAR/Machine Learning-drive based drug design for future iterations. To perform the virtual screening, protein structure was taken from the PDB code 7BQY complex and significant attention was paid to the interaction between the crystallized ligand from the complex and protein-binding site (Jin et al., 2020) (Fig. 6) . As the binding site is quite large (Fig. 6A) we used a set of additional crystal structures (PDB code 6Y2F and fragment-like compounds from https://www.diamond.ac.uk/) to narrow the source of possible conformations. The binding of the compounds inserted into this region demonstrated a very canonic and recurring interacting motif, represented with \u03b1-Keto amide group flanked with aliphatic or saturated rings. We then performed molecular dynamics of 75 ns for the ligand-free dimer structure of the M pro to evaluate and \"catch\" the most flexible elements of the binding site. Our simulation revealed that the extended binding pocket was not very stable, unlike its individual sub-pocket, which contains active cysteine (C145) residue (Fig. 6B,6C) . We began our molecular docking after assigning several combinations of constraints that should define specific interactions with the protein-binding site. We performed several high-throughput screening procedures using the same set of features in different combinations of constraints by partial matching algorithm ( Fig. 6D-E) . We then ranged docking scores and compared obtained conformations inside the binding site with the co-crystalized ligands from 7BQY, 6Y2F structures to select the most potent compounds."}, {"section_title": "II. Analysis of Identified Compounds", "text": "By disrupting the SARS-CoV-2 viral process in three different critical routes: Binding, Entry, and Replication with our virtual screening approaches against dynamic structures, we were able to identify 350 compounds (Dataset S1) and compile data reflecting physiochemical and chemoinformatic properties. An exemplar top hit from each target is summarized for docking score in Table 1 . To classify the compounds and their chemical space, we completed various regression, K-means analyses and fingerprint measurements, and provide further details about their structures and properties, including commonly evaluated traits: MW, HBA, HBD, docking score, Rule of Three (Jorgensen), Rule of Five (Lipinksi), logP o/w , and logS (Dataset S2). We focused on new compound searches. The MW for these initial screening compounds ranges from large fragment (~250 Da) to mature drug sized molecules (~500 Da) with only 10 of the 310 top scoring compounds being over 500 Da in size and the smallest fragment-based compound measured 178 Da. Overall the docking scores were very good with median around -7 kcal/mol using the Glide XP calculations. We also generated a list of most commonly related drugs and discuss some of our best hits to known and clinical trial drugs (Dataset S3). The general process for pruning the >30 million total chemical fragments and compounds from commercially available compounds for the initial round of virtual screening is described (Fig. 1B) , which reduces the primary large set to 3 million per conformation of target. As an example, when examining some prototype compounds from our selected dataset of >300 NCEs screened from >10 million total compounds, we find the predicted interactions between drug and protein ( Table S2 ) have some common binding modalities. When looking at the dynamical data for the drugs binding to the protein-protein site on Ace2, we find the RMSD, RMSF, and H-bond occupancy evidence strong binding capability, as calculated from three separate simulations of Ace2 with different ligands, referred to as 300, 392, and 488 ( Fig. 4,S1) . These observations can be applied to generate constraints for additional virtual screening to improve the performance at higher throughput. Based on these results, ligand 392 reduced the overall RMSD and per residue RMSF, while maintaining strong hydrogen bonds, as demonstrated by its greater occupancy during the simulation (Table S1 ). This information, particularly H-bond occupancy and modulation of interface residue RMSFs, can be used in conjunction with docking and other data to profile the compounds more thoroughly (Fig. 4) . In some cases, where constraints were utilized, the docking score underrepresents the compound and testing is needed to get important single-point data to clarify actives from non-actives, as well as determine the real IC50s for the selected active compounds. We will enrich our dataset with the top compounds for future rounds of parallel chemical screening and eventual de novo chemical design for novel chemical entities.

In order to accelerate drug discovery, translation and human application, a design funnel using high-powered artificial intelligence is needed to screen millions of compounds against macromolecular mechanistic targets against the virus. At the back end of this funnel 40 drug candidates emerged, many of which may represent repurposing candidates for use in humans due to known safety and tolerability profiles. However, the approach with the highest probability of overall clinical therapeutic success may be not a single drug therapy for this viral RNA disease but rather a multi-pronged drug approach gleaned from decades of HIV-AIDS epidemic research. A multidrug approach for HIV has improved survival, markedly reduced viral loads, and vastly improved management of the disease by preventing AIDS end-stage fatal complications. We therefore suggest that a multifaceted drug approach for SARS-Cov-2 may prove superior by attacking 3 viral entry and replication cycle sites simultaneously: Ace2 receptor docking site and entry, Tmprss2 endosomal packaging, and M Pro viral replication. Multiple drug targets for each of the 3 sites also allow permutations and optimization for combinatorial success."}, {"section_title": "Comparison of FDA compounds identified from other recent screening", "text": "A recent study that screened commercially available >10,000 clinical-staged and FDA-approved small molecules against SARS-CoV-2 in a cell-based assay (Riva et al., 2020) identified interesting compounds for alternative targets that complement our results. These FDA approved compounds included MDL-28170, a selective Cathepsin B inhibitor; VBY-825, a non-specific Cathepsin B, L, S, V inhibitor; Apilimod, an inhibitor of production of the interleukins IL-12 and IL-23; Z-LVG-CHN2, a tripeptide derivative inhibitor for cysteine proteinases; ONO 5334, a selective Cathepsin K inhibitor; and SL-11128, a polyamine analogs designed against E. cuniculi, a antimicrobial agents used as an adjuvant treatment for opportunistic AIDS-associated infections. Overall these compounds are Cathepsin-centric or antibiotic in nature, with little to no effect on our intended targets (Tmprss2, Ace2, M Pro ). Additional top hits identified by Riva et al. include: AMG-2674, an AMGEN compound inhibitor of TRPV-1 (Vanilloid Receptor); SB-616234-A that possesses high affinity for human 5-HT1B receptors; SDZ 62-434 that strongly inhibited various inflammatory responses induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or function-activating antibody to CD29; Hafangchin A (also called \"Tetrandrine\"), a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid, which acts as a calcium channel blocker; Elopiprazole an antipsychotic drug of the phenylpiperazine class (antagonist at dopamine D2 and D3 receptors and an agonist at serotonin1A receptors) that was never marketed; YH-1238, which inhibits dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) enzyme prolonging the action of the incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP); KW-8232, an anti-osteoporotic agent that can reduce the biosynthesis of PGE2; Astemizole, an antihistamine; N-tert-butyl Isoquine (also called \"GSK369796\"), an antimalarial drug candidate; and Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral medication developed by the biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences. Again, none of these compounds were geared toward targeting Tmprss2 or Mpro, and are also not specific to Ace2. While the lack of overlap may be surprising, results generated by Riva and colleagues are not in opposition to our findings and both approaches can complement each other. Most importantly, these approved FDA compounds can be combined with our set of identified NCE (310 compounds) that have been demonstrated to have low toxicity issues based on our chemoinformatics filtering (Fig. 1B) . All NCE compounds identified were chemical moieties that do not overlap any FDA drugs. Altogether, the data presented here complements previously generated data and should help prioritize and rapidly identify safe treatments for COVID-19.

These large human data provide both a clinically significant and scientifically innovative window of opportunity to test 40 compounds on the multidrug platform, and, in conjunction, observe longitudinal human survival outcomes of COVID-19 patients on these drugs for comparative effectiveness within established and ongoing patient registries. An emerging example of this important parallel is Ace2 pathway drugs (Ace inhibitors [AceI] and angiotensin receptor blocking drugs [ARB]), which are increasingly observed in humans with COVID-19 to be associated with improved survival advantage (Jarcho et al., 2020; Mancia et al., 2020; Mehta et al., 2020; Patel and Verma, 2020; Vaduganathan et al., 2020) . However, there is a scientific knowledge gap within human registries data regarding a scientifically robust and testable translational platform to test mechanistic effects of these different molecular compounds. Therefore, creation of a \"pandemic platform\" using newer technology of compound AI drug throughput screening combined with animal multi-drug screening models creates an early Phase I/II safety, tolerability and early efficacy platform which is rapidly needed to expedite bedside human use for COVID-19 pandemic, and as a platform that can be used in future pandemics."}, {"section_title": "NCE set of compounds", "text": "A flurry of activity to identify compounds for SARS CoV-2 targets has been underway by academic labs globally.

Since these structures were all used in downstream computational studies, a uniform structural preparation was implemented. The full-length structures are comprised of all residues and side chains. We added missing atoms in rotamers and de-clashed atoms, added missing residues for chain continuity, and removed extraneous molecules/atoms (e.g. artifacts of crystallography or alternative conformations of residues were removed (keeping the highest occupancy)), and the Bfactors were set to isotropic. The PDBePISA server was used to data mine the interface between Ace2 and S-protein (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007) . Surface interactions data is provided (Supplemental). Calculations on molecular dynamics trajectories including RMSD, RMSF, and H-bonds were performed using VMD and internal tools thereof (RMSD trajectory tool and Tk Console). Prior to calculations, the backbone (CONC\u03b1) atoms of each frame of the trajectories were aligned to the first frame as a reference, to remove the effect of random rotation/translation. After alignment, the per residue average of RMSF or RMSD per frame in \u00c5 across the entire MDS trajectory is given. For the Ace2-ligand simulations, the number of hydrogen bonds between the protein and ligand were recorded for each frame, and the occupancy of each specific H-bond is defined as the percentage of frames the bond is present. RMSD, RMSF, and H-bond data were plotted in 2D format in Excel. The RMSF was also appended to the beta column of the PDB and heat-mapped to the structure using a custom Tcl/Tk script and PyMOL.

Three the most stable conformations of the binding site were chosen for the docking studies. All received docking poses from each docking study were evaluated based on the docking scores, interaction diagrams and solvent exposure.

The majority of glycosylation sites are not on the RBD (Fig. S2) , the glycosylation site that is actually present on the RBD, N343, is not in 3D proximity to the binding interface.\nRecently, a variant of the S-protein, D614G, was identified to possess enhanced transmissibility and resistance to contemporary interventions and this site is not present on the RBD. Neither the glycosylation sites, nor the enhanced transmissibility variant D614G, are within the 3D proximity to the drug binding site for our targeted protein-protein interface disrupting therapeutics for Ace2. 3-methyl-7-{2-methyl-3-[(1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3,4tetrazol-5-yl) sulfanyl]propyl}-8-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-purine-2,6-dione ACE2 -7.596339 [ (2-chloro-1-benzofuran-3-yl) rac-(3R,4S)-1-[ (3-cyclopentyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5yl) methyl]-4- (1-methyl-1H-imidazol-5-yl) 2-(decahydroisoquinolin-2-yl)-N- (2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-1,3-benzodiazol-5-yl) "}]
