[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Due to the complexity of medical images, traditional medical image classi cation methods have been unable to meet actual application needs. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning theory has provided a technical approach for solving medical image classi cation tasks. However, deep learning has the following problems in medical image classi cation. First, it is impossible to construct a deep learning model hierarchy for medical image properties; second, the network initialization weights of deep learning models are not well optimized. erefore, this paper starts from the perspective of network optimization and improves the nonlinear modeling ability of the network through optimization methods. A new network weight initialization method is proposed, which alleviates the problem that existing deep learning model initialization is limited by the type of the nonlinear unit adopted and increases the potential of the neural network to handle di erent visual tasks. Moreover, through an indepth study of the multicolumn convolutional neural network framework, this paper nds that the number of features and the convolution kernel size at di erent levels of the convolutional neural network are di erent. In contrast, the proposed method can construct di erent convolutional neural network models that adapt better to the characteristics of the medical images of interest and thus can better train the resulting heterogeneous multicolumn convolutional neural networks. Finally, using the adaptive sliding window fusion mechanism proposed in this paper, both methods jointly complete the classi cation task of medical images. Based on the above ideas, this paper proposes a medical classi cation algorithm based on a weight initialization/sliding window fusion for multilevel convolutional neural networks. e methods proposed in this study were applied to breast mass, brain tumor tissue, and medical image database classi cation experiments. e results show that the proposed method not only achieves a higher average accuracy than that of traditional machine learning and other deep learning methods but also is more stable and more robust."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "With the rapid development of computer and medical imaging, medical imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can noninvasively re ect the physiological state of tissues and organs in the human body. ese techniques have gradually become indispensable tools in medical research, clinical diagnosis, and surgical planning [1] [2] [3] . While these new technologies have advanced medical theory and practice, they have also raised new issues; for example, doctors now need to classify diagnostic results. Automatic image classi cation techniques can understand the image content to a certain extent; for example, they can e ectively identify lesion areas in medical images and assist doctors in carrying out e cient diagnoses [3, 4] . However, many types of medical images exist, and distinguishing the categorical information in these medical images often requires di erent processing and analysis methods [5] [6] [7] . At present, medical image classi cation is mostly based on pattern recognition methods, in which a classi cation model is trained to identify and distinguish medical images. Medical image classification can generally be divided into supervised classification methods and unsupervised classification methods [8] [9] [10] .\nSupervised classification means that the processed samples are labeled in advance; the classification model is trained using the labeled image features, and the classification categories are usually prespecified. Supervised classification methods mainly include the K-nearest neighbor algorithm [11] , Bayesian models [12] , logistic regression [13] , neural networks [14] , and support vector machines [15] . Among these methods, medical image classification methods based on neural networks tend to perform the best [16] [17] [18] [19] . Abbass [20] proposed a neural network based on the Pareto differential evolution algorithm to classify breast cancer on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database (WBCD) that obtained a better classification performance than those of traditional neural networks. Karabatak and Ince [21] used association rules for dimension reduction, reducing nine features to four, and then classified them using an artificial neural network (ANN). e accuracy of 2-fold cross-validation on breast cancer in the WBCD reached 90%. However, this kind of method cannot adaptively match the characteristic information in the medical images themselves, which leads to large classification effect differences on different medical images.\nUnsupervised classification methods automatically distinguish different categories based on the similarities between samples without requiring prelabeled samples. Unsupervised learning is essentially a clustering process. e typical unsupervised methods include K-means clustering [22] , fuzzy C-means clustering [23] , and principal component analysis (PCA) [24] . To solve the problem that lesion contours cannot be accurately found in MRI images, in 2010, Juan proposed a color conversion segmentation algorithm with a K-means clustering technique that added a color-based segmentation operation [22] . is method achieved a higher accuracy but with a poorer segmentation effect than the fuzzy segmentation algorithm for MRI data proposed by Zhang and Chen in 2004 [23] . In 2012, Singh and Kaur proposed a PCA-based method to automatically classify MRI and natural images. eir experiments showed that the classification accuracy reached 91% [24] . Although this method is relatively simple to implement, it has achieved certain effects in image recognition and classification applications. However, the classification effect of this kind of method has great differences when classifying and recognizing different medical images, and it cannot adaptively classify and recognize medical images based on their characteristics.\nIn recent years, medical image classification research based on deep learning has once again attracted scholarly attention. Deep learning [25] is an organic combination of supervised and unsupervised methods. It primarily relies on unsupervised learning to train deep neural networks and then fine tunes them through supervised learning methods [26] [27] [28] [29] . In the early stages of deep neural network development, medical image recognition focused on unsupervised pretraining methods, such as stacked autoencoders (SAEs) and restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). For example, in 2013, Brosch and Tam [30] used a deep belief network to classify neuroimages. Plis et al. [31] used a deep belief network and an SAE to determine whether brain-based MRI can be used to diagnose whether a patient has Alzheimer's disease. Cheng et al. [32] used an SAE for the intelligent identification of breast ultrasound lesions no nodules; the performance of this method was significantly improved, compared with those of conventional methods. Kallenberg et al. [33] used convolutional SAEs to extract features from unlabeled breast cancer X-ray images. e main difference between convolutional SAEs and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is the use of SAEs for pretraining [34] [35] [36] [37] . For such tasks, it is often necessary to combine local information about the appearance of the lesion with global context information about the location of the lesion to determine a more precise classification [37, 38] . Such requirements are difficult to achieve through common deep learning architectures. Other researchers have tried to solve this problem using multinetwork branching architecture. For example, in 2015, Shen et al. [39] constructed three CNNs and connected their outputs to form the final feature vector. In 2016, Kawahara and Hamarneh [40] attempted to classify skin lesions using multibranch CNNs, each of which worked on a different image resolution. In 2017, Esteva et al. [7] used 129450 clinical image datasets to train CNN models. e results showed that the classification level of skin cancer by the CNNs reached those of dermatologists. In 2018, Bidart et al. [41] designed a method to perform automatic localization of breast cancer tissue sections using fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs). e breast cancer tissue sections were divided into three types: lymphocytes, benign epithelial cells, and malignant epithelial cells, and the classification accuracy rate reached 94.6%. In summary, deep learning models have been widely applied to various medical image classification tasks. However, medical images are not the same as natural images. us, constructing a CNN that achieves a better performance than other intelligent classification methods while considering the specific characteristics of medical images is a difficult problem. Moreover, because the network depth affects the nonlinear modeling ability of the CNN, improper initialization will cause the deep network to have difficulty converging, and no good initialization method exists. To address this issue, this paper first improves the nonlinear modeling ability of the network from the network optimization perspective; then, it improves the generalizability of the solution after the convergence domain has been improved. Furthermore, a new network weight initialization method is proposed.\nis method alleviates the problem that the initialization theory of existing deep learning is limited by the type of nonlinear unit; it provides more choice for the structural design of deep networks and increases the potential of neural networks to handle different visual tasks. In addition, to make full use of the characteristics of medical images, this paper studies the 2 Complexity framework of multicolumn CNNs and constructs CNN models with different structures that can better adapt to the characteristics of the medical images of interest. en, different CNN models are trained on the same dataset. Finally, the trained heterogeneous, multicolumn CNN is combined with an adaptive sliding window fusion mechanism proposed in this paper; this combination completes the medical image classification task. Based on the above ideas, this paper proposes a medical classification algorithm based on weight initialization/sliding window fusion for multilevel CNNs. Section 2 of this paper mainly presents the weight initialization algorithm based on the deep learning model proposed in this paper. Section 3 systematically describes the sliding window fusion CNN model proposed in this paper. Section 4 introduces a medical classification algorithm based on weight initialization and multilevel CNN sliding window fusion. Section 5 analyzes the proposed medical image classification algorithm and compares it with mainstream medical image classification algorithms. Finally, Section 6 summarizes and discusses the full text."}, {"section_title": "Deep Learning Model Weight Initialization", "text": "Method-Based Adaptive Taylor e problem of classifying medical images is essentially one of the identifying features after their extraction. Although shallow networks can implement complex nonlinear transformations that convert input to output in a system, high computational complexity is required to achieve nonlinear representation capabilities similar to those of deep networks. erefore, under the condition of corresponding increase in computational complexity, increasing network depth is the most reliable method to solve medical image classification problems. However, optimizing deep networks is a difficult problem in deep learning, especially given the exploding gradient problem caused by improper initialization. Of the existing methods, the Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) method has good convergence and generalizability, but its disadvantage is that it is limited to a specific network type. In view of this shortcoming, this section proposes a new initialization method that aims to improve the convergence and generalization ability of the model through optimization techniques. e initialization method proposed in this paper combines the advantages of the above two methods to avoid their shortcomings, and it is essentially an extension of the MSRA method. erefore, this section is divided into two parts: an introduction to the MSRA method and a description of the proposed method."}, {"section_title": "MSRA Method.", "text": "For the ith convolutional layer, an output pixel y i can be expressed as in [42] :\nwhere y i is a random variable and w i and x i are mutually independent random vectors (vectors are shown in bold). e offset term b i is initialized with zeros. b i is expressed as the offset term of the ith convolutional layer. e following formula gives the relationship between the variance of y i\u2212 1 and the variance of y i :\nVar\nVar\nwhere k i represents the convolution kernel size, c i is the number of channels input by the convolutional layer, and w i and x i are independent random variables.

By improving the attracting domain to improve the generalization performance of the solution after convergence, a new method of network weight initialization is proposed. is method alleviates the problem that the initialization theory of existing deep learning is limited by the type, and it increases the potential of the neural network to address different visual tasks. Moreover, this paper constructs a CNN model with a variety of structures that better adapt to the characteristics of the medical images of interest. e different CNN models are trained on the same dataset, and finally, the trained heterogeneous multicolumn CNN is combined with the adaptive sliding window fusion mechanism proposed in this paper. Together, they accomplish the task of classifying medical images.\ne results of the brain tumor tissue classification experiments show that the proposed method has the highest average accuracy, reaching 95.71%. On the image block classification task involving MRI samples of 12 patients with brain tumors, the proposed model's advantages were clearly shown on samples 2, 11, and 12, which are more difficult to classify than the other samples. is experiment shows that the method proposed in this paper has good stability and robustness while greatly improving the classification accuracy.\ne results of the medical database classification experiments show that the classification algorithm proposed in this paper achieves the best classification results for the TCIA-CT database and for the images in the OASIS-MRI database that are the most difficult to classify. e proposed method is not only superior to traditional machine learning algorithms but also improves other deep learning models. e results of brain-based self-built medical database classification experiments show that the proposed method has the highest accuracy rate of 95.1% on the brain medical database constructed on the basis of ADNI database.
