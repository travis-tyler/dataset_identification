[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Foredunes provide the first line of defense for coastal communities against overwash and inundation during storms. To this end, a tall dune is often considered ideal for mitigating storm impacts as its height is less likely to be exceeded by the storm-induced total water level (TWL) (Biel et al., 2017;Sallenger, 2000;Seabloom et al., 2013;35 Stockdon et al., 2006). Considering that wave runup is most likely to impact the dune face (i.e., collision; Sallenger, 2000)-which is more likely to affect the width of the dune rather than the height-is the most temporally common impact regime during a storm (Brodie et al., 2019;Stockdon et al., 2007), the width of the dune is an important predictor of how much erosion a dune might experience during a storm. While dune height change is an important metric to consider when measuring storm impacts (e.g., Long et al., 2014), other measures of dune erosion, such as 40 volume loss (e.g., Dur\u00e1n et al., 2016;Larson et al., 2004), may better describe the overall change in morphology by accounting for changes in height as well as width ( Figure 1). Understanding how the relative value of height divided by width, or aspect ratio, in foredune morphology will affect storm-induced erosion and impacts to coastal communities is important, especially because pre-storm dune shape is affected by both environmental and anthropogenic processes. 45 Dunes form as a result of biophysical feedbacks between aeolian sediment transport and vegetation growth (Duran and Moore, 2013;Hesp, 2002;Houser et al., 2015;Maun, 1998;Stallins and Parker, 2003). The cross-shore position and height of the dune are controlled by the distance between the shoreline and the seaward limit of vegetation, with larger distances typically being associated with the formation of taller dunes (Duran and Moore, 2013;Hesp, 2002). While vegetation zonation controls the positioning and height of the dune, the dominant plant species can 50 influence overall dune shape (e.g., Biel et al., 2019;Hacker et al., 2012;Woodhouse et al., 1977;Zarnetske et al., 2010Zarnetske et al., , 2012. Dune grasses that tend to grow more horizontally than vertically will form dunes that are shorter and wider, and vice-versa. For example, Hacker et al. (2012) found that dunes in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) formed in the presence of Ammophila arenaria were typically taller and narrower than dunes formed in the presence of https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-2020-79 Preprint. Discussion started: 10 November 2020 c Author(s) 2020. CC BY 4.0 License. their respective dune morphologies reflect that difference. As a result, coastal foredunes in the PNW where A. breviligulata is dominant may be exposed to a greater risk of overtopping (Seabloom et al., 2013). In a study of east coast dune grass species (A. breviligula and Uniola paniculata), Woodhouse (1977) found that dunes formed in the presence of A. breviligulata were shorter and wider than those formed in the presence of U. paniculata under similar environmental conditions; a result confirmed by the recent work of Hacker et al. (2019) and Jay et al. (in review). 60 In addition to natural controls on dune growth and dune shape, human modifications to the beach and dune system typically involve constructing a new foredune, or fortifying the existing foredune to make it more resistant to erosion (e.g., Elko et al., 2016;Nordstrom et al., 2000;Nordstrom & Jackson, 2013), often through the use of sand fencing (e.g., Anthony et al., 2007;Charbonneau & Wnek, 2016;Jackson & Nordstrom, 2018;Miller et al., 2001). In a study on the geomorphic effects of sand fencing, Itzkin et al. (2020) demonstrated that foredunes are lower in 65 elevation in areas where sand fences are constructed but that the dune system is substantially wider than foredunes in areas without sand fences. Other management decisions, such as allowing vehicles to drive on beaches and beach raking, can also bring forth tradeoffs between dune growth and coastal protection (Defeo et al., 2009) . In a study on the effects of dune grass removal to restore Western snowy plover habitats in the PNW, Biel et al (2017) used XBeach (Roelvink et al., 2009) to explore dune erosion and found that where beachgrasses were removed, dunes maintained a 70 lower elevation and were predicted to be more vulnerable to erosion compared to foredunes where beachgrasses were not removed and grew to a stable elevation. Beach nourishment may also be used to widen the beach (and decrease its slope), limiting wave impacts to the dune and stimulating dune growth (e.g., Cohn et al., 2019;van Puijenbroek et al., 2017;Ruggiero et al., 2001Ruggiero et al., , 2004. The main goal of the work presented here was to assess how foredunes of varying aspect ratios aspect ratio 75 (i.e., low and wide to tall and narrow foredunes) are eroded as a function of storm duration and total water level (TWL). We used the numerical model XBeach (Roelvink et al., 2009), which is a process-based numerical model that simulates the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics in the nearshore over storm time scales as well as sediment transport and morphologic changes to the dune and has been well validated for simulating dune response to storms (e.g., Cohn et al., 2019;McCall et al., 2010;Vousdoukas, Ferreira, Almeida, & Pacheco, 2012) to address the 80 following questions. (1) How does storm duration affect volumetric dune erosion as a function of foredune aspect ratio? (2) How do variations in storm TWL affect volumetric dune erosion as a function of foredune aspect ratio? 3https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-2020-79 Preprint.

The height of the reference dune was increased (decreased) in 20% intervals as: where Hf is the post-stretch dune height, Hr is the height of the reference dune, and stretch is a multiple of 20 between -60 and 60. Every increase (decrease) in dune height is paired with a decrease (increase) in dune width such that: 115 where Wf is the post-stretch dune width, Wr is the reference dune width. This method of simultaneously modifying dune height and width allowed for dune volume to be conserved (and therefore essentially held constant across simulations) and resulted in a suite of beach profiles with aspect ratios (i.e., dune height divided by dune width) ranging from 0.02 to 0.27 and dune volumes between 50.6 and 53.5 m 3 /m. 120 We adjusted the position of the dune on the profile to create four different cross-shore configurations: 1) dune toe (Dlow) positions aligned, 2) dune crest (Dhigh) positions aligned, 3) dune heel (Dheel) positions aligned, and 4) dune toe (Dlow) positions aligned with a sand-fenced dune seaward of it (Figure 2A-D). Simulations with the Dlow position aligned ensured that all dunes share the same beach morphology, thereby controlling for the effects of beach slope on wave runup (i.e., Stockdon et al., 2006). Simulations with the Dhigh positions aligned may be more representative of a 125 more natural setting in which wider beaches are backed by taller dunes. Simulations with Dheel positions aligned may be more representative of a managed shoreline, where the dunes are widened seaward and thus share a common heel position regardless of dune height. In both the Dhigh and Dheel aligned scenarios, the beach width increases proportionally to the aspect ratio of the dune. The fourth configuration ( Figure 2D) represents a dune complex that arises when sand fences are placed on managed shorelines. The fenced profiles consist of the dune profiles in which 130 the Dlow position was aligned (Figure 2A) and the addition of a gaussian curve on the seaward side of the dune to represent a typical fenced dune shape (Itzkin et al., 2020). To demonstrate that the synthetic dunes are consistent with observed morphologies, and that it is reasonable to hold the volume constant for a dune while modifying its aspect ratio, we compared the aspect ratios and volumes of the synthetic dune profiles with those of LiDAR-derived dune profiles from Bogue Banks measured between 1997 135 and 2016 ( Figure 3). The aspect ratios of dunes on Bogue Banks range up to approximately 1.08 and 89.4% of all profiles fall within the range of aspect ratios of our synthetic profiles. While all of the lidar data is extracted in locations where dunes are present, the lowest aspect ratios explored in this study are essentially flat, representing conditions in https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-2020-79 Preprint.

Dune volumes on Bogue Banks range up to 350 m 3 /m with the modelled value representing the 80 th percentile. Given the relatively weak relationship between dune volume and dune aspect ratio (with the aspect 140 ratios used in this study having a wide range of associated volumes; Figure 3), maintaining a relatively constant dune volume while varying the dune aspect ratio in our model simulations is reasonable."}, {"section_title": "Synthetic Storm Hydrographs", "text": "We created a set of synthetic storms for use in the model simulations by using Hurricane Matthew as a reference storm and then increasing its duration by up to 48 hours ( Figure 4). Hurricane Matthew moved northward 145 along the North Carolina coast on the afternoon of October 8, 2016, generating approximately 1 m of storm surge and significant wave heights (Hs) of approximately. 7.5 m. To capture the full spin up, peak, and relaxation of the storm, we used wave (Hs, Tp, Direction) and tide data for October 7-10, 2016, from the nearest NOAA National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy (41159; Onslow Bay, NC; depth = 30.5 m) and NOAA tide gauge (Station CLKN7; Beaufort, NC). We used linear wave theory to transform the wave parameters to the 30.5 m depth contour to account for shoaling 150 and refraction with the transformed wave data used as input for XBeach. To represent a longer duration storm than the base storm, we used the Hurricane Matthew storm time series to identify a 12-hour window centered on the timing of peak storm surge. We then interpolated all hydrodynamics (i.e., Hs, Tp, direction, and SWL) within this temporal window onto a +12hr, +18hr, +24hr, +36hr, and +48hr temporal \"grid,\" effectively increasing the storm's duration by up to two days. We held constant the spin up (rising hydrograph) 155 and relaxation (falling hydrograph) of the storm for all simulations. For all storm durations, we created a version in which the surge is unmodified (1.0x), decreased by 50% (0.5x), and increased by 50% (1.5x). In total, this yielded 18 different synthetic storms (Figure 4). The duration of our synthetic storms varied from 73 hr to 122 hr, and the surge in our synthetic storms varied from ~0.5 m to ~1.25 m. This compares favorably to other storms that have recently affected the North Carolina coast, 160 including Tropical Storm Joaquin (duration ~144 hours) and Hurricane Florence (Duration ~48 hours) ( Figure 5). Water levels during Tropical Storm Joaquin were elevated for 6 days, which is comparable to the total duration of the +48 hr storm time series. Peak surge during Hurricane Florence was ~1.6 m, a similar order of magnitude to the maximum storm surge we used in the synthetic time series."}, {"section_title": "Foredune Erosion Simulations 165", "text": "https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-2020-79 Preprint.

We ran XBeach (version 1.23.5465) in 1D-hydrostatic mode with the break parameter set to roelvink_daly and the gamma parameter set to 0.52 to better capture the effect of swash processes on the reflective beach profiles (Roelvink et al., 2018) and all other parameters left to their default setting.

Within each experiment, we factorially simulated all combinations of dune aspect ratios and storm durations, which resulted in a total of 504 simulations (12 experiments with 42 simulations per experiment). We note that all dune erosion experienced during the simulations occurred in the collision regime (Sallenger, 2000), unless stated otherwise. Further, fenced profiles do not contain any structural reinforcement from a fence being present that might limit how the dunes are eroded; although the fenced dune itself limits erosion of the natural dune behind it, the authors are unaware of any studies showing an effect on dune erosion during a storm from the fence itself."}, {"section_title": "Modelling Results 180", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Erosion on Synthetic Dunes", "text": "Overall, our simulations for dunes without fences showed that losses in foredune volume were greater with higher storm surges, longer storm durations, or when dunes are located closer to the shoreline (represented by the dune toes-aligned scenarios; Figure 7).

For example, for the longest storms (+48 hr) with a moderate intensity, high aspect ratio dunes experienced complete erosion from extended scarping until the dune 195 collapsed ( Figure 7E).

As surge intensity increased (0.5x to 1.5x surge scenarios), volume loss from the high-aspect ratio dunes increased by up to ~20 m 3 /m (~38%) while volume loss from the low-aspect ratio dunes increased by up to ~30 m 3 /m (~58%) ( Figure 7B,F, J).

Overall, the trends in erosion from fenced scenarios showed a systematic decline in erosion of up to 50% compared to the unfenced scenarios. In addition to sand volume lost from the dune, we calculated the overwash volume as the difference in sand volume behind the dune after the storm. Differences in overwash volume between the fenced and unfenced scenarios are only relevant when overwash/inundation are experienced. Thus, under low storm intensity scenarios, overwash 225 volume is zero. For moderate intensity storms, only the unfenced natural dunes experienced inundation, resulting in a positive difference in overwash volume between the fenced and unfenced simulations ( Figure 8A). For the most intense storms up to ~50 m 3 /m more overwash volume is experienced by the dunes without fences ( Figure 8B)."}, {"section_title": "Beach Width Effects on Dune Erosion", "text": "Given that wave runup and erosion during a storm is lower for wider, more gently sloping beaches (i.e., 230 Ruggiero, Holman, & Beach, 2004;Stockdon et al., 2006;Straub et al., 2020), we were interested in analyzing the separate effects of beach width on dune erosion (Figure 9). In particular, for dunes in which dune toes are aligned, beach width would be held constant for all aspect ratios and thus would not affect the outcome for erosion. However, because crest and heel aligned dunes can vary in their beach morphology depending on aspect ratio, this difference leads to wider beaches and might explain decreased erosion for high aspect ratio dunes. We also note that because the 235 dune toe elevation is consistent across simulations, the beach width is inversely related to the beach slope in our simulations. In all the simulations, regardless of dune configuration, there was a significant decrease in the amount of erosion as the width of the beach increased (Figure 9). For example, for any given beach width, the dune volume loss was similar in both the crests-aligned and heels-aligned scenarios despite the variability in dune morphology. 240 Additionally, the sensitivity of the dune to decreases in storm duration was inversely proportional to the beach width such that dunes fronted by wide beaches were noticeably less sensitive to increases in storm duration than dunes fronted by narrow beaches (Figure 9). This same trend was observed when analyzing increases in storm intensity; the increase in dune volume loss as surge elevation increased is much less in the cases of wider beaches (Figure 9). All of the dunes that were completely inundated ( Figure 7) were fronted by narrow beaches during long, intense storms 245 (Figure 9)."}, {"section_title": "Simulation Comparisons with Field Surveys", "text": "https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-2020-79 Preprint.

We compared our model results to the observational field surveys that were conducted along Bogue Banks, NC, before (2017) and after (2018) Hurricane Florence. The field data showed a weak relationship between dune aspect ratio and erosion (sand volume loss). However, similar to model results for the toes-aligned (constant beach 250 width) dune configurations, those profiles with a lower aspect ratio dune experienced similar or even less erosion than high aspect ratio dunes with the same beach width (i.e., at a beach width of 40 m in Fig. 10). A strong trend is seen with respect to the beach width, in which erosion significantly decreased with increasing beach width, regardless of aspect ratio (Figure 10). Foredunes with beach widths greater than 40 m all experienced dune growth between 2017-2018 despite the effects of Hurricane Florence during this period ( Figure 10). Although the model does not simulate 255 aeolian transport induced dune growth, we note that in simulations with low to moderate surge (0.5x-1.0x), sand volume loss decreased to zero or near-zero for beach widths greater than 40m (Figure 9, heels-aligned)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Effects of Aspect Ratio on Dune Erosion", "text": "The storm impact scale for barrier islands described by Sallenger (2000) relates the elevation of the dune 260 crest and dune toe to TWL as a means of categorizing impacts within the four possible wave impact regimes: swash, collision, overwash, and inundation. Each wave impact regime has a corresponding mode of beach and dune erosion associated with it from none (swash) to potentially complete loss of the dune (inundation). A key implication of this wave impact scale is that a taller dune should provide better protection from storms as it is less likely to be overtopped. Previous studies (e.g., Brodie et al., 2019;Stockdon et al., 2007) have suggested that collision is the most common, 265 but temporary, wave impact regime experienced by foredunes. Collision occurs when the total water level impacts the face of the dune, causing scarping and dune retreat. This suggests that a dune which is more resistant to the effects of collision may offer the greatest degree of protection so long as it is not overtopped, especially given that the dune will likely be experiencing collision for a longer time under longer duration storm events. When controlling for the beach width (i.e., the dune toes-aligned scenario), we find that the lower aspect ratio dunes 270 eroded less than the higher aspect ratio dunes when both are in the collision regime. The high aspect ratio dunes are more likely to collapse when scarped because of avalanching as the dune face slope approaches an angle of repose, this also explains the accretion at the dune toe for the high aspect ratio dunes that weren't completely eroded through (Palmsten and Splinter, 2016). Using a Bayesian Network Biel et al. (2019) found that the dune face slope is a strong predictor of vertical dune erosion for similar reasons, demonstrating the importance of storm duration and the effects https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-2020-79 Preprint.

Although the high aspect ratio dunes are more equipped to prevent overwash, there is the potential for them to be completely eroded during the longest storms due to persistent scarping, undercutting, and avalanching. In contrast, low aspect ratio dunes can withstand long duration storms as long as the surge is not high enough in elevation to cause overwash. While the height of the dune may be an appropriate predictor for overwash, the overall aspect ratio may better describe how dunes will erode with 280 respect to storm duration and intensity."}, {"section_title": "Sand Fences and Beach Nourishment on Foredune Erosion", "text": "We assessed the effects of sand fencing on the mitigation of dune erosion by comparing the results of the fenced and unfenced simulations. We found that the small dune formed by fencing can significantly decrease dune erosion by providing a barrier that must be eroded away before the dune itself is impacted. In our simulations, the 285 fenced dune was not eroded through until ~60 hrs into the storm, which prevented the dune behind it from experiencing the peak of the storm (Figure 4). The foredune behind the fenced dune was only inundated during the longest and most intense storms, as opposed to the dunes without fences, which experienced inundation during the moderate (1.0x surge) intensity storms (Figure 7). The key dynamic in this case (regardless of actual storm duration), was that the fenced dune was sufficiently high to protect the natural dune until the peak of the storm had passed. The foredune 290 behind a fenced dune is not impacted until the fenced dune is eroded away, making the aspect ratio of the foredune secondary to the morphology of the fenced dune in providing protection to back-barrier environments. Charbonneau and Wnek (2016) demonstrated that fenced dunes can reform quickly (on the order of months) meaning that not only do sand fences effectively prevent storm-induced erosion, but it is possible for them to facilitate recovery-of the fenced dune prior to the next storm if the frequency of storm impacts is sufficiently low, and assuming the fences are 295 still present following the storm or are re-built. Additionally, dunes built by sand fences may be paired with vegetation planting to assist in sand trapping efficiency and dune stabilization (Bossard and Nicolae Lerma, 2020; Nordstrom and Jackson, 2013). We also considered the effect of beach nourishment by varying beach width for the dune crest-aligned and dune heels-aligned scenarios. For a given dune aspect ratio, the only difference between the toes-aligned, crests-300 aligned, and heels-aligned simulations was the beach width, which increased from the dune toes to dune heels-aligned simulations. Beach nourishment appears, from model results, to have a greater impact on preventing dune erosion than any action that could be taken to alter the aspect ratio of the dune. XBeach simulations with the dune crests and heels-https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-2020-79 Preprint. Discussion started: 10 November 2020 c Author(s) 2020. CC BY 4.0 License. aligned have a variable beach width that is proportional to the dune aspect ratio. For a given dune aspect ratio and wave duration and intensity, the only difference between the simulations is the increase in beach width (toes-aligned 305 < heels-aligned). By increasing the width of the beach, the slope of the beach (\u03b2f) is decreased, which lowers incident band swash (e.g., Ruggiero et al., 2004) and total wave runup (Stockdon et al., 2006), reducing the likelihood of dune erosion. We see this effect in our results, which show up to a 100% reduction in dune erosion between the toes and heels-aligned simulations (Figure 7). The strong inverse relationship between beach width and dune erosion (Figures 9 and 10) suggests that regardless of the aspect ratio of a foredune, widening the beach can be sufficient for preventing 310 overwash during most storms and will be a more effective strategy for increasing coastal protection than re-building the dune or installing sand fences. It is important to recognize that although management initiatives such as widening beaches and building dunes with particular aspect ratios can be effective at mitigating erosion, they have long-term effects that are worth considering. Even though this study considers individual storm events, the difference in erosion due to overwash for 315 the fenced and unfenced dunes (Figure 8) have clear implications for barrier island vulnerability. Overwash facilitates barrier rollover, a necessary process for the island to maintain subaerial exposure as sea level rises (e.g., Leatherman, 1979;Moore et al., 2010;Lorenzo-Trueba & Ashton, 2014;Rogers et al., 2015). The large decrease in overwash volume in our fenced simulations suggests that rollover may be inhibited in managed locations, thereby increasing the likelihood of eventual barrier drowning (e.g., Magliocca et al., 2011;Rogers et al., 2015). 320"}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this study we analyzed how coastal foredunes erode as a function of their aspect ratio, whether they have fencing, and the width of their beaches as a result of beach nourishment. We find that low aspect ratio (lower and wider) dunes are more resistant to erosion from increased storm duration than high aspect ratio (taller and narrower) dunes, although high aspect ratio dunes offer greater protection against more intense storms. For low aspect ratio 325 dunes we typically observe complete erosion of the dune through inundation (Sallenger, 2000) during long duration storms with a high surge, whereas the high aspect ratio dunes are completely eroded away through persistent scarping during the longest storm events until the dune is low enough to be overtopped. In addition, dunes built by sand fences reduced the amount of erosion experienced by the foredune behind the fenced dune because they create a barrier that must first be eroded or overtopped. Although modifying the dune aspect ratio does alter the amount of erosion https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-2020-79 Preprint. Discussion started: 10 November 2020 c Author(s) 2020. CC BY 4.0 License. experienced as storm characteristics vary, we find that the greatest protective service in all instances is offered by a wide beach; a finding that also supported by existing foredunes in the field. The configuration that would offer the greatest protection from erosion and inundation would be a tall, wide foredune fronted by a wide beach with a fenced dune. Given the challenges of achieving such a foredune morphology in the face of rising sea level and within resource limitations (i.e., sand availability, cost, etc.), our findings suggest 335 that the greatest increase in protective service can be achieved by widening beaches, regardless of the frontal dune morphology. Although our work demonstrates that widening a beaches through nourishment may provide more protection from flooding in the short-term than artificially constructed dunes, it is costly and may be infeasible over the long-term in the face of sea level rise and shoreline erosion, thus managed retreat may be a more viable for strategy for widen beaches (e.g., Cutler et al., 2020;Gibbs, 2016). Further, dune building initiatives, such as the emplacement 340 of sand fences, that increase the width of the dune, likely offer the greatest protection against longer storms. Though wider dunes do not necessarily decrease the likelihood of overwash, given that wave collision is a common and frequent mode of dune erosion (e.g., Brodie et al., 2019), a wider dune does provide protection from the most commonly experienced mode of erosion. Though potentially beneficial in the short-term, widening beaches and reducing overwash through the emplacement of tall dunes can also have negative long-term consequences because 345 they reduce overwash flux, which is essential for barrier islands to maintain elevation as sea level continues to rise (i.e., Lorenzo-Trueba & Ashton, 2014;Magliocca et al., 2011;Rogers et al., 2015). Ultimately, pairing wide dunes and wide beaches to provide protection from the most common storm scenarios may balance the need for protection from most storms, but this must be considered against a longer-term need for the island to rollover and maintain a subaerial surface via overwash processes lest it risk drowning. 350"}, {"section_title": "Data Availability", "text": "The data analyzed in this submission are available at Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4059885"}, {"section_title": "Author Contribution", "text": "MI designed and performed the model simulations, RGB assisted with model setup.
