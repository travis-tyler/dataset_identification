[{"section_title": "", "text": "geographic information system (GIS) tools as a method to inform politicians, newspaper reporters, citizens' groups, and government agencies about schools and tax wealth, suburban topology, segregation, fiscal inequality, and sprawl. These topics represent a partial list of issues that might be studied with GIS approaches. Geospatial methods are rapidly advancing as computing has made it possible to conduct very complex analytical modeling of social dynamics.\nFor the present chapter, geospatial refers to geographic space that includes location, distance, and the relative position of things on the earth's surface. Geospatial perspective calls for the addition of a geographic lens that focuses on place and space as important contextual variables. A geospatial view increases our understanding of education, health, and other social variables by framing research in the context of neighborhoods, communities, and regions. The most widely used method for developing geospatial perspective is through the use of a GIS, which will be discussed in greater detail in following sections. In short, a GIS uses specialized software that integrates spatial data (e.g., geo-referenced coordinates such as latitude and longitude) and nonspatial data to produce geographic maps. Familiar examples include television weather forecasts that display maps generated through GIS.\nElsewhere, Tate (2008) and Tate and Hogrebe (2011) argued that the use of GIS as part of visual political literacy projects would inform the collective cognition of communities and support civic engagement. Their concern was that for too long social analyses in education have ignored how communities come to learn and understand their problems. More specifically, many studies of academic performance and attainment fail to consider geography and community context (Tate, 2008) . William Julius Wilson (1998) reasoned that geographic factors such as neighborhood and community had largely been ignored in the prominent paradigm of individual-level analysis of narrowly defined educational outcomes. Wilson posited that the individualistic framework is not typically conceived in a fashion that accounts for the influence of relational, organizational, and collective actions that influence the social formation of inequality. Included among these actions and processes are institutional factors that affect mobility and opportunity: the nature and quality of schools; patterns of residential segregation and social isolation in highly concentrated poor communities; explicit forms of employment discrimination and other pathways to upper mobility; financial markets; government policies concerning taxation, service, investment, and redistribution; and private sector decisions related to the location and mobility of industries and related services. Wilson's position suggests the need for a visual political literacy project-one that captures how schooling inequality and outcomes are greatly shaped by the ecological context and the geography of opportunity. We use the term visual political literacy project here to describe a research approach that builds on the psychological and political potential of geospatial methodology, as applied to problem spaces in education, health, and human development-where the central aim is to link the visual products to discussions of the geography of opportunity (Tate, 2008) .\nWhy is a visual political literacy project important to matters related to the geography of opportunity? First, the cognitive science literature describes how from childhood through adulthood, images, illustrations, and graphic representations support learning as well as reading (Kulhavy, Stock, & Kealy, 1993) . Learning and retention are not the only benefits of visual modeling. Schwartz and Heiser (2006) argued that spatial representations capitalize on the perceptual system by enforcing and enabling spatial computations. The perceptual system is directly related to our argument for a visual political literacy project. Perception provides specialized abilities to more easily grasp the structure of complex arrangements in visual models. According to Learning to Think Spatially (National Research Council [NRC], 2006) , GIS software products support this ability as the technology has the functionality to (a) spatialize data sets by providing spatial data structures and coding systems for nonspatial data, (b) visualize various stages of an analysis while also providing multiple forms of representation at each stage, and (c) execute operations that manipulate the structural relations of data sets. The ability to spatialize data sets influences the development of spatial thinking, whereas the capacity to visualize multiple representations is fundamental to the process of spatial thinking, as is the capacity to manipulate structural relations. The cognitive science literature related to visual representations suggests that GIS tools (described in greater detail later) might help inform our understanding of geospatial arrangements associated with education, health, and human development.\nA second reason for developing a visual political literacy project is that maps and related representations have informed civic debates about regional development issues. Orfield (2002) captured the ability of GIS tools to produce maps that engaged multiple groups (e.g., planners, politicians, educators, and university faculty) on matters related to regional development and politics. He argued for the need to create the most accurate and complete visual representations of a region as possible. For Orfield, GIS was more than just a planning tool; it was part of a theory of community development. GIS has a number of identities-planning tool, community engagement instrument, historical archive, and scientific approach (Gordon, 2008; Schuurman, 2004) . The visual political literacy project embraces GIS, as the goal of the project is to bring a scientific approach to regional planning, as well as to community development and engagement, where geography of opportunity is a central concern. We view the visual political literacy project as an attempt to develop a social science that matters to local communities. Flyvbjerg (2001) captures our aim:\n[W]e must effectively communicate the results to fellow citizens. If we do this, we may successfully transform social science from what is fast becoming a sterile academic activity, which is undertaken mostly for its own sake and in increasing isolation from a society on which it has little effect and from which it gets little appreciation. We may transform social science to an activity done in public for the public, sometimes to clarify, sometimes to intervene, sometimes to generate new perspectives, and always to serve as eyes and ears in our ongoing efforts at understanding the present and deliberating about the future. We may, in short, arrive at a social science that matters. (p. 166) Using geospatial perspective as a foundation for the visual political literacy project is an approach in line with Soja (2010) , who advocates using a spatial perspective in addition to historical and social explanations as a means to understand and act on inequalities that exist in our communities-action designed to bring about \"spatial justice.\" He recognizes that emphasizing spatial perspective is an unconventional yet powerful approach:\nFor to a public as well as to an academic audience, emphasizing the affective or explanatory power of space is relatively unfamiliar and for some quite controversial. Most social scientists not surprisingly emphasize a sociological and historical rather than geographical perspective. Primary attention is given to social processes and social consciousness as they develop overtime in comparison to what might be called spatial processes, spatial consciousness, and spatial development. (p. 4) Soja (2010) further emphasized how spatial thinking can facilitate change and the public good by not only enriching our understanding of almost any subject but also adding to our practical knowledge and capacity to implement effective solutions to challenging social problems.\nThe purpose of this review is twofold. The first purpose of this chapter is to describe how GIS methods have evolved and are used to create spatial perspective and understanding. We will describe important features of the technology, while highlighting the potential of the tool for scholarship in education, health, developmental science, and human services. The second purpose of the chapter is to provide a selected review of research where GIS methodology has been integral to bringing new insights to questions and problems in education and health. The focus will be on the built and social environments. The built environment is constructed-for example, housing, transportation systems, and civic and commercial buildings. The social environment consists of groups, relations, and societies within which people live. We see this review as part of an effort to take seriously the social disparities associated with emerging geopolitical ecologies as outlined by Massey and others (e.g., Briggs, 2005; Gordon, 2008; Morris & Monroe, 2009; Patillo, 2007; Soja, 2010) . Although a great deal of the chapter is an explication of GIS methodology as part of a review of selected education and health studies, we encourage the reader to think about how the technology informs the exploration of educational and social disparities, informs public understanding of these issues, and supports the pursuit of civic action that would be able to ameliorate some of these problems."}, {"section_title": "ADDING GEOSPATIAL PERSPECTIVE: METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES AND CONSIDERATIONS", "text": "Geospatial perspective brings a powerful visual dimension to data in the form of maps that facilitate communication and discourse among various stakeholders. By locating data in the context of place, issues become more familiar and understandable to those who may not have experience in data analysis. This section describes GIS, the primary tool for generating maps and spatial analysis. It defines three practical approaches or ways of thinking about how GIS is used by educators and those in the social sciences. Next, GIS is discussed in terms of analyzing data from descriptive, quantitative, and qualitative approaches. Finally, a mixed methods approach called \"participatory GIS\" (PGIS) is described that emphasizes public participation and discourse about social outcomes, which are important to local communities and the public good."}, {"section_title": "Overview of Geographic Information Systems", "text": "Education data can be given geospatial perspective because they contain information about schools and districts located within neighborhoods, communities, and different areas of metropolitan regions. Adding geospatial perspective to data involves identifying the physical location of \"where\" variables occur in geographic context. When data are associated with geographic coordinates for entities such as schools or census block groups, spatial perspective emerges from mapping the location and distance information.\nToday, geospatial perspective is most commonly created using a GIS to generate maps. GISs incorporate a variety of technologies and processes for collecting, analyzing, interpreting, communicating, and using geospatial data (Elwood & Cope, 2009; Maantay & Ziegler, 2006; NRC, 2006) . GIS is based on the philosophy that location is important because variables and their relationships can vary by place and the space between them. The three basic components to a GIS are geography, information, and systems.\nGeography typically refers to physical features such as mountains and valleys, hydrology (e.g., rivers and lakes), and ecology (e.g., vegetation and wildlife). Features can also be man-made entities such as buildings, neighborhoods, cities, streets, and political boundaries. Nonspatial variables can be associated with physical features, thus giving them a spatial dimension. For example, data related to achievement, student and teacher characteristics, and school climate are generally treated as \"nonspatial,\" but since they can be associated with a place, they have an intrinsic geographic and spatial component. In fact, almost any behavior, characteristic, or activity can be tied to a location with geographic reference points, such as demographics, income, and voting patterns.\nGIS uses information stored in database tables to generate spatial maps. These database tables consist of columns of \"attributes\" or variables that define the rows that represent each spatial entity (feature) on the map. For example, each row in an attribute table might refer to one specific census block group (polygon). In another attribute table, each row might represent a different school (point). The columns that contain the attribute data include information about spatial characteristics as well as nonspatial variables that can be associated with the spatial entity (e.g., block group polygon or point location). For example, columns 1 and 2 might contain spatial information such as area and perimeter for each polygon, whereas column 6 has attribute data for median household income for the block group polygons. In another table consisting of point data (e.g., school locations), some columns would contain coordinates for the points, whereas others might have nonspatial attributes such as enrollment and test scores. There can be multiple attribute tables that are combined by the GIS as layers in a map.\nGISs are systems on two levels. First, the software integrates and manages the multiple file types that are required to work seamlessly in producing a map. There are files for geographic projection, geometric shapes, and attribute tables, as well as files for indexing and metadata. The GIS coordinates the operation of these files so that they work together as a system. The second reference to \"system\" is from a broader perspective in that the GIS can be a comprehensive management tool that integrates computer software, hardware, data, and GIS users. For example, school districts can use GIS to coordinate enrollment projections with the reconfiguration of attendance zones, which in turn leads to planning transportation and bus routes (Sadahiro, Tominaga, & Sadahiro, 2006) . In addition, the district could use GIS to assist in building/facilities operation and maintenance as well as evaluating and planning for future building/facility requirements. To see how GIS can be used as a school district comprehensive planning and management tool, see http://www.schoolsiteonline .com."}, {"section_title": "Practical Approaches to GIS", "text": "For this review, approaches to GIS in education can be described in three broad categories. First is the use of GIS desktop software to manage data and generate maps. The second category involves GIS Internet applications, and the third deals with GIS applications in the K-12 curricula. Desktop GIS software on a local computer allows the user to control all the aspects of a GIS project from gathering and inputting data to analyzing data and generating spatial maps. The great flexibility that desktop GIS applications afford comes with a learning curve for the user. In addition to learning the software and geographic concepts, the user has to discover where to acquire relevant data for the topic and how to format it for use in the GIS software. There are many resources available to assist in learning GIS software (e.g., http://www.esri .com), but the user has to make a time investment to become proficient. In the case where the data of interest are readily available in proper format for use within the GIS software, then learning to generate maps is relatively easy. Given the learning curve and time involved with data acquisition and management, the desktop GIS software approach to presenting data spatially is mostly limited to those with access to GIS resources. However, many 4-year and community college campuses provide opportunities to learn and use GIS software.\nThe second category of GIS is the Internet website application with the primary purpose of displaying data in a spatial format (Cartwright, 2008; Jones & Purves, 2008) . The GIS Internet applications are usually centered on a common theme such as census, education, health, or crime data. The GIS websites are designed by programmers to make the interface as user-friendly as possible. In this way, users do not need any special training to be able to generate maps. They simply select variables from menus, and the interactive program automatically displays the map. Typically in this situation, maps are used for descriptive purposes to visualize location and relationships between variables, whereas actual spatial and statistical analysis is limited.\nThe interactive website approach has the potential for displaying data in a visual and spatial format to the greatest number of people. Popular websites demonstrate the visual power of displaying data in a geospatial format. (See Google Earth at http:// earth.google.com, ArcGIS at http://www.arcgis.com, education data at http://nces .ed.gov, and census data at http://www.census.gov and http://socialexplorer.com.)\nIt is the accessibility and user-friendliness of these types of websites that offer significant potential in displaying social issues and outcomes in a powerful visual format to citizens and society. Visualization in geographic space of data related to social issues and outcomes can assist in understanding that facilitates public discourse and provides the basis for a visual political literacy project (see discussion on PGIS below). For example, an interactive website for St. Louis, Missouri, area schools and districts (http://maps.wustl.edu/cistl) provides a way for teachers, parents, and community leaders to easily produce maps from more than 3,500 demographic, achievement, and school-related variables. Showing student performance or teacher characteristics for schools in geographic space to a group of teachers and administrators immediately generates discussion on a variety of topics from multiple perspectives.\nGIS for the K-12 curricula is the third category in which GIS has important implications. GIS has two essential applications in the teaching-learning process. First, GIS can play a significant role in developing spatial thinking. Spatial thinking involves cognitive skills that can be taught and have broad ramifications across many subject areas, especially in the math, science, engineering, and technology fields (NRC, 2006; Sinton & Bednarz, 2007) . Just as with writing skills, spatial reasoning skills need to be taught, applied, and reinforced throughout the curriculum. GIS has the power to develop spatial reasoning by requiring the learner to think using the concepts of place and space. In addition, geographic maps have been shown to increase the recall of related text material (Kulhavy et al., 1993) .\nSecond, GIS provides a powerful platform for many types of learning (Kerski, 2008) . Below are some of the points listed in the 2006 NRC report as to how GIS reinforces teaching and learning:\n\u2022 GIS can facilitate the process of scientific problem formulation and solution, and therefore, it exemplifies many of the ideals of discovery-based, student-centered inquiry.\n\u2022 GIS can be useful in solving problems in a wide range of real-world contexts. It can succeed as a tool for both scientific research and problem solving. Consequently, it provides a link between science and policy. At the most general level, science is interested in principles and laws that are true everywhere, independent of geographic context. Policy, on the other hand, often takes such principles and puts them back in specific geographic contexts in order to predict the outcomes of proposed developments or to achieve better management of resources. In the K-12 context, the link between science and policy is exemplified in GIS community projects.\n\u2022 GIS has the potential to facilitate learning across a range of school subjects and to enhance interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary learning.\n\u2022 GIS can provide a rich, generative, inviting, and challenging problem-solving environment. It can empower students to address significant issues with the same tools that professionals use to address issues in their work.\n\u2022 GIS has the potential to accommodate and be accessible to the full range of learners, including the visually impaired. It is rigorous enough to challenge gifted students and accessible enough to reach many students who have difficulty learning in traditional ways.\n\u2022 GIS can be used effectively in a variety of educational settings. This tool can be infused throughout the curriculum or used in traditional subject-based curricula. It can be employed in all grades. In addition, it enables a range of modes of use (e.g., individual and stand-alone, collaborative and networked).\n(p. 218)\nThese points clearly describe the benefit of teaching GIS in schools as a means of developing problem solving skills related to complex issues in real-world contexts. Using GIS for problem solving and research requires information to be synthesized into an understandable visual format that can be readily used to generate discourse on important community and real-world issues related to the public good. Students who can solve problems by integrating multiple sources of data into a visual presentation with GIS mapping learn a valuable way of describing social outcomes and engaging in public discourse and policy analysis. In essence, these are the skills needed for the development of, and engagement in, a visual political literacy project."}, {"section_title": "GIS as a Method for Describing Data", "text": "Education data encompass many types of variables on students, teachers, schools, districts, neighborhoods, and communities. Data are usually summarized and described across groups by calculating statistics such as means and standard deviations to give global scores for the group \"average\" and how much they \"vary\" from the mean. In addition, the entire distribution can be displayed in a frequency distribution or histogram. There are a variety of statistical techniques to detect patterns, relationships, and differences in data that typically result in a single numerical value. For example, the correlation coefficient r describes the relationship between two variables in a value ranging from \u22121 to +1. These descriptive statistics are familiar to every researcher. They \"describe\" the data in single, global measures. Descriptive statistics such as these attempt to summarize a table of numbers that is too visually complex to readily comprehend (Lund, 2007) .\nBy creating maps with GIS, data are given additional meaning through the dimension of geospatial perspective. Nonspatial variables such as test scores can be associated with a location and placed in the context where they occur (i.e., a school building). This spatial framework provided by the map shows where variable values are in relationship to each other in the meaningful context of neighborhoods and communities (Lund & Sinton, 2007) . The abstract values become comprehensible as their relationships are made visible through real-world geospatial representation in maps. Instead of portraying a distribution of data with one global value (i.e., mean), all data values are used to create a geospatial display.\nThe power of GIS as a creative descriptive tool that transforms data into maps is extensive. The process of describing data through geospatial visualization can be accomplished in GIS by showing one variable on a map or through combining multiple variables into layers that summarize complex relationships. The base map or background can be a variable layer such as polygons for school district boundaries that are filled in with colors associated variable values such as the percentage of students receiving free or reduced-price lunches (FRLs). Alternatively, the background map could be a digital satellite image of the landscape with school district boundary lines superimposed as the top layer or a layer of census block groups (see Figure  1A-1C) .\nGIS desktop software provides many tools that allow the user to construct maps using a host of options to display the location, quantity, density, and spatial relationships among variables. In addition, the user has many options in selecting map characteristics such as symbology, colors themes, patterns, and interval sizes (Kimerling, Buckley, Muehrcke, & Muehrcke, 2009; Mitchell, 1999) . GIS website applications are almost always descriptive in nature and offer the user more limited options in determining map characteristics than the desktop software. Whether the software is on the desktop or Internet, GIS makes mapping and creating geospatial perspective a dynamic process by allowing quick changes and multiple views of the data.\nEven without sophisticated analyses, descriptive maps can provide keen insights into the data. Relationships become visible that may lead to hypothesis testing and problem solving. The classic example of mapping data to solve a problem is Dr. John Snow's study of the cholera outbreaks in London around the 1840s (Koch & Denike, 2010; Snow, 1855) . Being a medical doctor, Dr. Snow used his knowledge of epidemiology to study possible causes of the cholera, which he suspected was harbored in contaminated water supplies. It was not until he plotted on a map the location and numbers of cholera deaths in London's neighborhoods that it became clear that the highest concentration of deaths was near the Broad Street pump (see Figure 2) . Subsequent investigation of the source for the Broad Street pump revealed that the water was coming from a downstream part of the Thames that was polluted with sewage. Removal of the handle on the Broad Street pump resulted in a sharp reduction in the cholera deaths. The concentration of the deaths on the map near the Broad Street pump supported Dr. Snow's hypothesis of cholera transmission by water and provided strong visual evidence about the cause of the problem.\nMore recent examples of how geospatial perspective through maps can serve as a visual framework for discussions related to policies and social outcomes are from the works of Orfield (2002) and Gordon (2008) . Orfield (2002) provides a series of maps, which display patterns of diversity and segregation across large U.S. metropolitan areas. The resulting \"metropatterns\" of key social outcomes are used to generate an agenda for public discourse about reforms that focus on policies related to taxes, land use, and governance. To achieve \"metropolicy\" reforms, Orfield uses additional maps to highlight the location and importance of \"swing\" districts, which have a high percentage of voters in both political parties. The case for \"metropolitics\" and policy agenda reform is significantly bolstered when a visual perspective is given to the segregation and fiscal data by placing that data in their geographic context and spatial location within the metro area. Gordon (2008) used the descriptive power of maps to demonstrate how racial segregation and economic inequality were created over decades in metropolitan St. Louis, Missouri. By mapping the many small, independent municipalities that developed their own taxation, zoning ordinances, and real estate restrictions, Gordon was able to demonstrate the negative effects of fragmented local governance. In using GIS to generate more than 60 geospatial maps related to demographic, income, fiscal, and real estate variables, he was able to show how policies developed to sustain "}, {"section_title": "GIS and Quantitative Analysis", "text": "The process of associating data with location and generating maps provides the visual framework for seeing relationships among variables because of their physical proximity. These visual relationships, which become apparent when shown on maps, provide an aid to understanding the data and for generating hypotheses. However, the descriptive nature of visual inspection with maps does have limitations in defining more complex and less obvious relationships.\nSuppose that schools were mapped for a metro area showing the percentage of students who scored proficient or advanced on the state's yearly high-stakes test. A pattern of clustering or dispersion could probably be observed through visual inspection of the map. But what if a clear pattern of clusters did not emerge? Or how do we know if an observed cluster is not likely because of chance? There are spatial statistics that compare the observed locations of schools with a hypothetical random spatial distribution. To the extent that the observed distribution of schools differs from a random distribution, there may be significant clustering of schools that have high or low percentages of students scoring proficient or advanced. Mitchell (2005) provides a comprehensible introduction to spatial statistics such as the mean center and variance of geographical entities (or features; e.g., schools).\nAnother category of spatial statistics attempts to identify the overall, global pattern of how the features themselves (e.g., location of schools) are distributed across a geographic area. For example, the \"nearest neighbor index\" calculates the average distance between feature locations. The \"observed\" mean distance is divided by the \"expected\" mean distance to produce the nearest neighborhood index. The index can be tested statistically to determine whether the pattern of feature locations represents a significant overall clustered, dispersed, or random pattern. Tate (2008) used the nearest neighborhood index to determine whether biotechnology companies in the St. Louis, Missouri, metropolitan area were clustered and found that these organizations were indeed located in close proximity, and the clustering pattern was estimated to be nonrandom. The clustering of the biotechnology industry across the region demonstrated the importance of geography as a factor in matters of access to quality educational resources, employment options, housing, transportation, and other social infrastructure (see also Gordon, 2008) .\nAlthough global patterns for feature locations can be found, patterns of clustering or dispersion can be calculated as well for feature values (e.g., school student-teacher ratio). Clustering of feature values tends to occur because entities (i.e., schools) nearer to each other are more alike than those farther apart. If student-teacher ratios are more similar in schools that are in close proximity, then the overall pattern for these ratios will show clustering. For example, schools in wealthier districts may tend to have lower student-teacher ratios than schools in poorer districts. A spatial statistical test such as Moran's I test for global clustering is in essence a test for spatial autocorrelation (Anselin, 2005; Fortin & Dale, 2009; Jacquez, 2008; Mitchell, 2005) . The presence of spatial autocorrelation (i.e., data are correlated because of spatial proximity) may indicate that the data points are not independent, a necessary assumption for many traditional statistical tests (Charlton, 2008; Fortin & Dale, 2009; Fotheringham, Brunsdon, & Charlton, 2002) .\nIn addition to finding global patterns of clustering for locations and their values, local patterns of clustering can also be identified (Anselin, 1995 (Anselin, , 2005 Jacquez, 2008; Mitchell, 2005) . Local clustering methods attempt to describe variation by determining if a feature (e.g., school) is surrounded by features with similar high or low values. When there is significant local clustering, high values are surrounded by high values and low values by low values. For example, schools with a high percentage of students receiving FRLs may tend to cluster in a district and neighboring districts, whereas schools with a low percentage of FRL students may cluster together. Statistics such as local Moran's I show for each feature its similarity to surrounding features.\nWhen data are geographically clustered, they are likely to exhibit spatial autocorrelation indicating the presence of spatial dependence. Traditional regression models assume that the data for the outcome variables are uncorrelated, and so using these methods with spatially dependent data leads to the violation of this assumption. Several methods have been developed to account for spatial dependence leading to correlated outcome data. The first approach uses spatial regression models that attempt to account for spatial dependence by taking into account the correlation among data that are in close proximity (Anselin, 2009; Ward & Gleditsch, 2008) . Spatial regression models can use a spatially lagged dependent variable as a covariate when it is assumed that the dependent y values directly influence each other. If it is assumed that there are unidentified variables in the local context that account for the correlation among the dependent y values, then the spatial error model is used. This model postulates that the spatial components of the errors are correlated for clustered observations (Ward & Gleditsch, 2008) .\nThe second approach of geographically weighted regression (GWR) weights a data point according to its proximity to a specific location by a spatial kerning process. The weighting of data points is not constant across observations but varies by location across a region. Data points closer to the specific location are weighted more heavily than farther points. GWR better reflects geographically clustered data as a continuous spatial process whose variation can be represented on a map (Fischer & Getis, 2010; Fotheringham, 2009; Fotheringham et al., 2002) . GWR not only recognizes spatial dependence in clustered data but also shows that variable relationships may differ by location. For example, high-achieving school districts have clusters of high performing schools; likewise, low-achieving districts have clusters of low-performing schools. These clusters of high-and low-performing schools indicate spatial dependence for schools within districts resulting in correlation among school performance based on location. It is possible that variable relationships such as time spent on homework with academic performance are not the same across districts. This variation in relationships by location is referred to as \"spatial heterogeneity\" or \"nonstationarity,\" and GWR is able to incorporate these local spatial relationships in the analysis approach (Fotheringham, 2009; Fotheringham et al., 2002) . Allowing variable relationships to change by location is similar to the concept of accounting for different levels or contexts in multilevel modeling. However, multilevel modeling deals with discrete units whereas many phenomena are spatially continuous and do not start and stop at artificial boundary lines. GWR allows relationships to change in a gradual and continuous manner across geographic space."}, {"section_title": "Qualitative and Participatory GIS", "text": "During the development of GIS in recent years and in conjunction with the evolution of desktop computers, most of the attention has focused on the gathering, storing, and the analyzing of data along with map generation using increasingly sophisticated software and hardware. The emphasis has been on applying GIS as a quantitative tool in defining and solving problems that are strongly linked to geography and spatial context. GIS has been used extensively as a management and logistics tool in many fields related to engineering, business, and government. The need of these industries to manage and use large amounts of complex spatial data in a timely fashion became a driving force in the rapid development of GIS software and applications. The focus on data acquisition and management are essential steps in the process of GIS mapping and analysis.\nIn the 1990s, some users of GIS began to adopt a broader view for the potential of GIS as more than just a geographic and management tool (Weiner & Harris, 2008) . In the groundbreaking book, Ground Truth: The Social Implications of Geographic Information Systems (Pickles, 1995) , the broader ramifications of rapidly developing digital technologies were presented. The chapters expanded the discussion about how technologies such as GIS increased information available for public discourse about societal issues and potentially influenced their outcomes. As GIS became accepted as a legitimate quantitative and analytic tool by geographers, researchers, and commercial and governmental entities, many began to discover its visual power in generating discussion and explanations outside of technical circles. The capabilities of GIS include the generation of maps as one source of data, but GIS can also be used as a method for integrating a variety of other data types (Pavlovskaya, 2009) "}, {"section_title": ". Elwood and Cope (2009) describe how GIS works as a qualitative approach by integrating multiple data sources:", "text": "Qualitative GIS [refers to] those approaches that seek to integrate qualitative forms of data into GIS, develop and support qualitative approaches to building knowledge and explanation with GIS, use GIS in research that emerges from multiple or hybrid epistemologies, and theorize previously unrecognized forms of social knowledge that may be present in GIS applications. These approaches are quite different in the way they bring together GIS and qualitative research, but all go beyond treating qualitative methods as 'add-ons' to essentially quantitative projects rendered in a GIS. Instead, they offer substantive shifts toward framing questions, collecting data, analyzing results, and representing findings in a truly integrated way. They intersect GIS and qualitative research with the goal of integrating multiple forms of evidence or ways of knowing, in order to explain how spatial knowledge, patterns, relationships, and interactions are produced, and with what sorts of social and political impacts. (p. 4) Elwood and Cope (2009) further explain why qualitative GIS can best be described as a mixed methods approach:\nThe core commitment of qualitative GIS to integrating multiple forms of knowledge and the findings from various techniques is also at the heart of mixed methods research. This integrative way of building robust explanations in research is what positions qualitative GIS as a mixed methods approach. . . . Mixed methods projects weave together diverse research techniques to fill gaps, add context, envision multiple truths, play different sources of data off each other, and provide a sense of both the general and the particular. (pp. 4-5) A particular type of qualitative GIS that emerged during the 1990s is a forerunner to the visual political literacy project approach in that it deals with public discourse, social outcomes, and the public good. PGIS or community-based GIS (Craig, Harris, & Weiner, 2002; Elwood, 2006 Elwood, , 2009 Sieber, 2006) encourages and facilitates public discourse on community issues and important social outcomes such as those related to education, public health, urban planning, and neighborhood revitalization. Weiner and Harris (2008) suggest that PGIS is a \"platform for integrating qualitative and quantitative information\" and further describe the nature of PGIS:\nPGIS explicitly situate GIS within participatory research and, as a result, local knowledge is incorporated into GIS production and use. In blending local knowledge with \"expert\" information, PGIS projects have in common the application of geospatial technologies to address concerns articulated by community participants. . . . PGIS projects are, at their core, political because they attempt to broaden access to digital spatial information and empower historically disempowered people and communities. PGIS projects are also political because they involve community participation, which is again essentially a political process. (pp. 469-471) PGIS projects attempt to capitalize on the capability of GIS to transform data into maps that convey powerful visual information. However, it is not only the visualization of data in maps that makes PGIS an effective vehicle for public discourse. The process of using data to focus discussions is crucial to promoting rational decision making in the context of emotionally charged issues. Using data and maps in PGIS attempts to get all stakeholders to understand the problems and issues from a common frame of reference despite differing agendas and backgrounds. Jankowski and Nyerges (2008) and Sieber (2006) discuss frameworks, methods, and guidelines for decision making in community PGIS projects.\nAccess to relevant data and the software/hardware required for GIS, together with the personnel expertise to bring these together in a user-friendly format, can be very valuable for community organizations when making decisions that have a spatial component. The data and maps can empower \"grassroots\" and community groups by allowing them to participate effectively in activities that require planning and policymaking decisions (Lin & Ghose, 2008; Sieber, 2006) . However, although PGIS may empower some groups, other marginalized groups may not benefit. If marginalized group members do not have access to the data, access to the Internet, or the expertise to create and use GIS and spatial information, then PGIS will not be an effective platform for public discourse (Harris & Weiner, 1998; Lin & Ghose, 2008; Weiner & Harris, 2008) .\nCommunity-based PGIS efforts provide the background for the visual political literacy project approach. Typically, PGIS collaborations use GIS methods to increase public participation in decision making and problem solving about a specific community issue. The visual political literacy project focuses more on developing political literacy in a broader sense, using powerful spatial maps as a medium to facilitate understanding about how geography is related to opportunities in housing, employment, education, and health and human services. Knowledge about place and space and location and distance and their relationship to the potential for attending good schools, living in affordable and decent housing, and access to living-wage employment is essential for communication and problem solving among civic leaders and minority groups.\nThe politically literate stakeholder must recognize that the geography of place and space has real impact on the opportunities of the poor and marginalized groups in our communities. The visual political literacy project approach uses visually informative geospatial methods to increase understanding of the synergistic relationship that politics and geography play in enhancing or suppressing life-changing opportunities."}, {"section_title": "Providing Interactive Geospatial Perspective for Education, Health, and Human Services Data", "text": "Data related to education, human services, and community health issues may be available on state or local websites. Typically, if these data are available, they would be in tabular form or spreadsheets. Data for single entities (e.g., a school) may also be accessed one at a time. The problem is that even if the data are available over the Internet, they may not be in a form that most grassroots or community-based organizations can readily use. However, when efforts are made to use GIS to organize and give spatial perspective to the data, the potential for people to understand and use the data increases dramatically. Mapping puts the data in the context of place and space related to neighborhoods. Most community groups, however, are not going to have the knowledge to integrate data into a GIS to produce maps for spatial decision making. In many cases, it will probably be necessary to have an experienced GIS professional create an interactive web-based mapping application if data are not available in a spatial format on existing websites. An Internet mapping website should provide access to a large number of people who can view data and variables in the transparent format of geographic space.\nOne example of an Internet GIS application that targets education variables in schools and districts located in the St. Louis, Missouri, metropolitan area can be found at http://maps.wustl.edu/cistl. This GIS website was developed to give data available from the state a geospatial perspective. The Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education website (http://dese.mo.gov) makes data accessible to the public in spreadsheets or by individual lookup for a single district or school. However, this format is not conducive to studying the data in a spatial context of all the schools and districts in the area. The website gives stakeholders such as parents, teachers, administrators, and community decision makers access to hundreds of education variables for 57 area districts and their schools. Users select variables to display on maps, and in seconds they are able to visually observe variable relationships across multiple schools and districts. Data previously inaccessible to most users are transformed into visual patterns of meaningful relationships based on location and spatial context. Figure 3 shows the variable of percentage of students receiving FRLs in the districts. The same map shows for the schools the percentage of students scoring proficient or advanced on the Missouri state eighth-grade mathematics test. It is readily apparent that districts with higher percentages of FRLs students have schools with lower percentages of proficient or advanced eighth-grade math students.\nAnother example of a well-developed interactive website is for health data at http:// www.healthlandscape.org. This site maps a variety of health-related variables including"}, {"section_title": "Figure 3 Percentage of Students Receiving Free or Reduced-Price Lunches in the Districts and for the Schools the Percentage of Students Scoring Proficient or Advanced on the Missouri State Eighth-Grade Mathematics Test", "text": "indicators for cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. It also lets users integrate their own local data with the public health data to generate custom maps. School district planning for transportation, enrollment projections, and boundary adjustments can be accomplished with an online GIS application at http://www.schoolsiteonline.com. An example of how several district level variables can be combined to provide a measure of return on educational investment and incorporated into an interactive GIS website is found at http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/01/educational_ productivity/.\nInteractive GIS mapping for criminal activity in urban areas is located at http:// www.crimereports.com.

The way we plan and build our neighborhoods, towns, and cities, including school locations, influences our health and other developmental outcomes (Meade & Emch, 2010) . According to Hynes and Lopez (2009) , the built environment is an embodied and embedded term. The built environment refers to construction materials, housing, transportation systems, and civic and commercial buildings (e.g., schools, libraries, recreation spaces, stores, shops, and workplaces). The built environment is embedded as it is situated within nested spaces-for example, regions, cities, neighborhoods, office parks, and other arrangements that are connected by roadways.\nThe concept of how our built environment affects us can be seen through examples of research involving school redistricting and travel safety as well as a variety of other public health issues influencing school-aged children-for example, respiratory dysfunction, lead-impaired neurological development, and obesity. As the following illustrative examples of geospatial research in the areas of school redistricting and travel and children's public health suggest, GIS can be used as a tool to inform research associated with the built environment."}, {"section_title": "School Redistricting and Travel Safety", "text": "GIS tools are used to construct spatial models and depictions to inform educational planning. This section will review several examples to illustrate the goals of this research and planning approach. Why is a better understanding of this approach important? The built environment is physically and conceptually constructed into spatial units that have been linked to many education and developmental factors (e.g., school assignment, health, and food security). Thus, research-based efforts to inform the planning of the built environment are critical elements of public discourse and democratic practice.\nGIS methods have been used to devise models of school redistricting and other issues related to student assignment. Caro, Shirabe, Guignard, and Weintraub (2004) devised an optimization strategy as part of a GIS modeling project developed to construct school redistricting lines. The analyses aimed to minimize long travel distances for students, as well as eliminate district boundaries that split traditional neighborhood configurations between multiple school districts. Another specific goal of the design was to develop user-friendly menus that allowed for customization as well as modifications to the redistricting lines. The models were tested on two regions in Philadelphia-one homogenous and the other dissimilar in terms of demographic population. The models provided new districts lines that were reported as improvements from older methodology, which lacked the dynamic interface of mapping and computational capabilities.\nAnother student assignment consideration in which GIS provides planning guidance is in the area of children's travel safety to schools. For example, Huang and Hawley (2009) devised a GIS database to model the walkability and bikeability of routes to schools as well as to document speed limits and the amount of traffic in areas near schools. The program also detailed the safety of certain crosswalks including measures in place to protect pedestrians, such as islands. The modeling is designed to provide the safest walking and biking routes to schools for students. There also is a function to support the development of safe school bus routes. Their research and development was designed to provide a web-based source for public use.\nOther researchers have examined the relationship between school location and traffic accidents involving children. LaScala, Gruenewald, and Johnson (2004) hypothesized that the annual numbers of child pedestrian injury collisions (both in-school and summer combined) would be greater in communities and areas with higher youth densities, more traffic flow, higher unemployment and fewer higher income households. Also, they predicted that youth population density, and its interaction with the number of schools in a given area, would be related to the in-school month rates of child pedestrian collisions. Using GIS, the researchers mapped traffic accidents with children under the age of 16 years in California as well as census data describing neighborhood characteristics and income level. The study concluded that higher youth densities, more unemployment, fewer high-income households, and greater traffic flow were risk factors for child pedestrian injury collisions. In addition, students in middle school had higher rates of accidents than high school and elementary school students. The findings suggest that planners need to regulate speed limits and traffic flow in areas with more students and communities with higher concentrations of poverty.\nAbdel-Aty, Chundi, and Lee (2007) used geospatial and log-linear modeling to document the locations of pedestrian/bicyclist crashes involving school-aged children (4-18 years old) and to determine risk factors associated with crashes.\n1 They found a majority of school-aged children crashes occurred in areas near schools. In addition, although elementary children were involved in some crashes, middle and high school children were involved in more crashes, particularly in high-speed multilane traffic configurations. Thus, the children's demographic background and the geometric characteristics of roads near schools should be of interest to school district leadership.\nAnother planning consideration, particularly in urban communities, is the land cover of urban schoolyards. Green spaces as developmentally appropriate and safe locations for children to grow and play are a relevant consideration for planners. Schulman and Peters (2008) used GIS methods to classify and compare land cover on 258 elementary and middle schools in three cities-Baltimore, Boston, and Detroit. On average, the schoolyards were dominated by turf grass and impervious surface, whereas tree canopy occupied the smallest proportion of schoolyard land cover (about 10%). Considering the increased interest in the development of and the benefits associated with the use of trees and natural terrain in creating aesthetically pleasing green spaces, it would behoove local and governmental officials to carefully examine how the presence or absence of green space in schools affects children's safety on school playgrounds. In addition to providing visual models of school redistricting options, as well as insights into how to support safe travel once students are assigned to schools, geospatial methods and GIS-based research have informed other public health issues facing school-aged children."}, {"section_title": "Public Health and School-Aged Children", "text": "Geospatial methods are part of an emerging literature that is examining the relationship between spatial arrangements and children's developmental and health outcomes (Meade & Emch, 2010) . For example, studies of childhood risk and protective factors associated with respiratory dysfunction, lead-impaired neurodevelopment, obesity, and teenage pregnancy have used GIS modeling. The following describes some key studies from each of these areas, thereby illustrating how geospatial methods are increasingly being used to understand the relationship between spatial arrangements and children's developmental and health outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Respiratory Dysfunction", "text": "The relationship between traffic exposure and respiratory dysfunction has been the focus of several geospatial analyses of childhood asthma. Newcomb and Li (2008) conducted a retrospective study of the relationship between traffic exposure and childhood asthma exacerbations. They hypothesized that, after controlling for demographic and social factors, exposure to traffic emissions would predict hospital utilization for children with asthma. The hospital records of 2,357 children (aged 1-12 years) admitted for emergency or impatient treatment were analyzed using GIS mapping and logistic regression. On average, patients with asthma lived closer to major roadways than did patients who did not have asthma.\nIn another study of traffic exposure and risks to respiratory function, Appatova, Ryan, LeMasters, and Grinshpun (2008) examined the effect of road development on the health risk of students attending urban schools near major roadways. The location of public schools and students was linked spatially to interstate, U.S., and state highways in nine large Metropolitan Statistical Areas of the United States. The analysis illustrated that among the surveyed schools and students, more than 30% fell within 400 meters of a major roadway and more than 10% were within 100 meters. For some Metropolitan Statistical Areas, nearly 50% of the student population attended schools near (\u2264400 meters) major roadways, resulting in a potentially increased risk for asthma and other chronic respiratory problems, especially in schools representing the urban fringe locale. Guidry and Margolis (2005) examined respiratory health risk using GIS as a tool to document the aftermath of hurricane-related flooding. They used satellite-derived imaging of flooded land with school locations. In 36 counties of North Carolina, they found 77 flooded schools and 355 schools that were not flooded. The schools were categorized based on income, race/ethnicity, and age of their student population. The reported prevalence ratios indicated that low-income students, in which a majority of the students were Black, had twice the risk of being flooded compared with the referent group of non-low-income schools with a majority of non-Black students. The study suggests that schools serving students already at elevated risk for respiratory dysfunction were disproportionately affected by the hurricane flooding. The study demonstrates race and social class dynamics in terms of schools and students affected by hurricane flooding and, particularly for this review, the potential role of GIS in identifying and prioritizing schools for assistance following flooding or other natural disasters."}, {"section_title": "Lead-Impaired Neurodevelopment", "text": "Geospatial methods have been used to study problems associated with exposure to neurotoxic materials and child development. Miranda and Dolinoy (2005) developed a spatially based model of childhood lead poisoning for a six-county region. The modeling strategy used GIS technology to link county tax assessor, North Carolina blood lead screening, and U.S. Census data to create household-level priority models for childhood lead exposure. The method, by way of spatial analysis, integrates a number of previously unlinked datasets to categorize lead risk levels at the individual tax parcel unit level. The modeling strategy identified the heavier concentrations of higher risk parcels as well as identifying risk factors-age of housing, race, and household income. Roberts, Hulsey, Curtis, and Reigart (2003) also used GIS methods to assess risk factors for elevated blood lead levels in children. They argued in the study that targeted screening for childhood lead poisoning depends on assessment of risk, including age of housing stock. Since housing stock is a known risk factor, they categorized housing in the county under study into three categories-housing built before 1950, between 1950 and 1977, and after 1977 . The next part of the analysis mapped by address the children in the county who were screened positive for lead poisoning. The study also documented the lead screening activity across the region. Overall, one third of the children who tested positive for lead poisoning lived in housing stock built before 1950; 17% lived in homes built from 1950 through 1977; and nearly 50% lived in homes built after 1977. However, the sample of children screened in homes built after 1977 was 5 times greater than the sample of children living in pre-1950 housing. Children living in pre-1950 housing were 4 times more likely to be lead poisoned than children living in housing built after 1950. There was no statistically significant difference in risk for lead poisoning among children living in housing built from 1950 through 1977 compared with the risk for lead poisoning in those living in housing built after 1977. Without the use of GIS technologies, a larger number of newer housing tracts built after lead paint bans would not have been appropriately identified as greater hazards for producing childhood lead poisoning."}, {"section_title": "Obesity", "text": "The high rates of obesity in children are a major public health concern in the United States.\n2 Geospatial factors have been examined using GIS to evaluate potential relationships to obesity risk. Oreskovic, Kuhlthau, Romm, and Perrin (2009) examined differences in the built environment and child weight, as well as associations between high-and low-income communities. They hypothesized that low-income areas would have higher obesity rates, fewer opportunities for exercise, and more fast-food options than high-income areas. The study used cross-sectional clinical and demographic data for children aged 2 to 18 years from an integrated health state system. Towns with at least 100 subjects per town were included in the analysis. The towns were divided into quartiles by household income and compared on environmental characteristics (density of fast-food restaurants, distance to nearest fast-food restaurant, distance to nearest age-appropriate school) and overweight and obesity prevalence. Clustered logistic regression was used to assess the relationships between environmental characteristics and weight, as well as stratified analyses by age (2 to <5, 5 to <12, 12 to 18 years). GIS was used to create overlay maps that integrated children's addresses with neighborhood demographic and environmental information such as sidewalks, bike trails, and fastfood restaurant locations.\nThe study's findings indicated that low-income towns had more sidewalks, less open space, a greater density of fast-food restaurants, and higher rates of overweight/ obesity. The article reported that among low-income-town children, after adjusting for age, gender, race, and town, density of fast-food restaurants was positively related to overweight and obesity, whereas distance to nearest age-appropriate school and fast-food restaurant was inversely related to obesity. Children from low-income towns appeared to have more consistent associations between weight status and the built environment.\nBaker, Schootman, Barnidge, and Kelly (2006) examined the role of race and poverty as part of a study that audited community supermarkets and food restaurant access in a city in the Midwest. Their goal was to document the level of access to food consistent with U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) dietary guidelines, among African Americans and Whites, as well as by income status in the city. Spatial clustering of supermarkets and fast-food restaurants was estimated using a spatial scan statistic. The researchers found that the spatial distribution of fast-food restaurants and supermarkets that provided options for meeting USDA dietary intake differed according to racial distribution and poverty rates. There were fewer grocery stores offering healthy options in tracts with high rates of African Americans than in tracts with high rates of Whites. Income and race together also were associated with access to nutritious food, as areas that were primarily low income and African American were less likely to have access to supermarkets with food consistent with USDA guidelines. Conversely, areas that were primarily White and middle class were more likely to have access to these types of supermarket options."}, {"section_title": "THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT", "text": "Meade and Emch (2010) described the social environment as comprising the groups, relations, and societies within which people live, including the organization of our workplaces and schools, as well as the policies we create to order our lives. Their description included schools and higher education as an important consideration in developmental science and medical geography. An emerging literature in the social sciences has incorporated GIS methodology to examine access to schools and other influences on human development as part of the study of the social environment (e.g., Lubienski, Gulosino, & Weitzel, 2009; Sohoni & Saporito, 2009) . This research has the potential to inform how regions plan and organize learning opportunities and developmental pathways. This is particularly important in densely populated cities and metropolitan regions. Rogers (2009) argued that cities require better tools and methods to support economic, cultural, and democratic practices:\nBut even on their own, or in cooperation with one another, cities can provide an infrastructure of education and training systems, research institutions, advanced physical structure, systems to provide cross-firm learning, information systems to measure accurately the value of social and natural assets and the costs of their renewal, systems of social insurance (such as healthcare) to improve the efficiency of labor markets, and a bottom line \"social wage\" independent of particular employment.

Sohoni and Saporito (2009) used GIS to study how student enrollment in nonneighborhood schools influenced the level of racial segregation in public schools across urban school districts by comparing the racial composition of schools and their corresponding attendance area. They used GIS to link maps of elementary, middle, and high school attendance boundaries with 2000 Census data, the Common Core of Data, and the Private School Survey for the 22 largest school districts. GIS was used to digitize paper maps into GIS files so that these files could be incorporated into the analysis. The findings indicate that public schools would be less racially segregated if all students living in a school district attended their local, neighborhood schools. In addition, the results demonstrated how private, magnet, and charter schools contribute to racial segregation within most school districts. In an article published earlier, Saporito and Sohoni (2007) used GIS methods in a similar fashion to study economic segregation in schools. They assigned poverty rates from the 2000 Census to maps of school attendance boundaries for 21 of the largest school districts in the United States and linked this information with a data set detailing the number of poor children enrolled in each school. The results demonstrate that the percentage of poor children in neighborhood schools is greater than their corresponding catchment areas, and this difference is greater when the majority of children living in a neighborhood are racial minorities. This pattern reflects the entry of wealthier and nonminority children into private, charter, and magnet schools. The result is that poor and minority children are more highly concentrated in high-poverty public schools."}, {"section_title": "Choice", "text": "Drawing from theories of institutional environments and nonprofit firms, Lubienski et al. (2009) incorporated GIS methods as part of a study of the local education market (LEM) in three urban cities. The study focused on the role of competitive incentives in arranging the geography of opportunity in LEMs. The analysis used computer mappings of educational options-choice plans-available across diverse social landscapes. The results varied across the LEMs. However, in all cases, market segmentation and hierarchies emerged across individual schools and school types. In all three LEMs, at least one group of schools demonstrated evidence of avoiding areas associated with disadvantage. Specifically, competitive incentives appear to have encouraged schools to sort themselves on the basis of preferred clientele, with some groups of schools using their market position to serve more affluent students."}, {"section_title": "VISUALS TO VISION: GEOSPATIAL TOOLS AND MOBILIZATION", "text": "Universities and colleges play an important role in education-and research-related leadership in regions across the world. GISs represent an opportunity for programs in the social sciences and professional programs in education, health, and human services to develop course work, tools, and research in support of human capital development and rigorous analysis. GIS methods, software, and web-based interfaces have advanced sufficiently to be integrated into existing coursework. In addition, stand-alone GIS coursework would benefit many areas of study. Developing sufficient human capital with expertise in GIS and matters related to health, education, and human services will be a challenge. However, we believe our current geospatial arrangements in metropolitan and rural regions across the world require more, not less attention from well-trained professionals.\nWe have provided evidence in this chapter that geospatial tools provide a method to support understanding the contours of the built environment and the social environment. Moreover, we submit that geospatial technology might serve as an important component of local and regional efforts to mobilize community engagement related to education, health, and human development issues. Henig, Hula, Orr, and Pedescleaux (1999) recommended that local organizations and school systems build evaluative functions that support community mobilization efforts rather than more traditional centralized command and control accountability models that often do not accommodate community interaction. In their view, this alternative model would include a variety of performance indicators as part of a communication system developed for the objective of sharing information with the public. We contend that one model aligned with this goal would be to provide the community with a sense of the nature, distribution, and significance of education, health, and human development factors in geospatial terms. Massey (2009) and other scholars (Briggs, 2005; Gordon, 2008; Morris & Monroe, 2009; Patillo, 2007; Soja, 2010) argued that emerging geopolitical ecologies must be understood and factored into policy discussions, community engagement, collective action, and justice.\nThe use of maps in research and data-driven planning appears basic at first glance. However, when considered in light of the cognitive benefits, visual modeling-learning, retention, and related perceptual advantages-and GIS-generated visual production represent at least an empirical starting point in support of collective cognition and civic engagement. Every community should have an ongoing visual political literacy project. Our position is that geospatial visual production should inform the vision for a community."}]
