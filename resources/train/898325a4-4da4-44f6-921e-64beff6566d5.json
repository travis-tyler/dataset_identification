[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objective: Changes in progranulin (GRN) expression have been hypothesized to alter risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the relationship between GRN expression in peripheral blood and clinical diagnosis of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: Peripheral blood progranulin gene expression was measured, using microarrays from Alzheimer's (n = 186), MCI (n = 118), and control (n = 204) subjects from the University of California San Francisco Memory and Aging Center (UCSF-MAC) and two independent published series (AddNeuroMed and ADNI). GRN gene expression was correlated with clinical, demographic, and genetic data, including APOE haplotype and the GRN rs5848 single-nucleotide polymorphism. Finally, we assessed progranulin protein levels, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and methylation status using methylation microarrays. Results: We observed an increase in blood progranulin gene expression and a decrease in GRN promoter methylation in males (P = 0.007). Progranulin expression was 13% higher in AD and MCI patients compared with controls in the UCSF-MAC cohort (F 2,505 = 10.41, P = 3.72*10 \u00c05 ). This finding was replicated in the AddNeuroMed (F 2,271 = 17.9, P = 4.83*10 \u00c08 ) but not the ADNI series. The rs5848 SNP (T-allele) predicted decreased blood progranulin gene expression (P = 0.03). The APOE4 haplotype was positively associated with progranulin expression independent of diagnosis (P = 0.04). Finally, we did not identify differences in plasma progranulin protein levels or gene methylation between diagnostic categories. Interpretation: Progranulin mRNA is elevated in peripheral blood of patients with AD and MCI and its expression is associated with numerous genetic and demographic factors. These data suggest a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative dementias besides frontotemporal dementia.\n616"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The 88 kDa progranulin and its 6 kDa processed products (granulins) represent a class of secreted proteins with diverse functions peripherally and in the brain. Granulins and progranulin have been implicated as potent immunomodulators and cell-cycle regulators. In the CNS, progranulin expression increases with age in both neurons and microglia, and plays a role in neurite outgrowth, synapse modification, and the prevention of neuronal apoptosis. [1] [2] [3] [4] This neuroprotective function is highlighted by the relationship between progranulin and neurodegenerative disease; heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding progranulin (GRN) cause frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 5, 6 and a common rs5848 allele in the 3 0 UTR of GRN has been associated with both decreased serum and brain progranulin expression levels and increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). [7] [8] [9] Additionally, misregulation of progranulin expression has been implicated in parkinsonism, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and other neuropsychiatric disorders. 10, 11 Mutations in the GRN gene may contribute to the risk of developing AD. 8, 12 Additionally, progranulin localizes at the margins of amyloid plaques in both mouse and human postmortem brain tissue, and increased progranulin mRNA levels have been reported in the brains of multiple AD-mouse models. 13 Overexpression of progranulin in these models has been shown to slow plaque deposition and cognitive decline. 14, 15 Taken together, these data suggest a direct role of progranulin in AD pathogenesis. Previous studies examining protein levels in peripheral blood failed to detect a relationship between peripheral progranulin protein levels and AD status. 16 We first observed a relationship between GRN mRNA levels and AD status in a small patient series, 17 but no study to date has conclusively shown a connection between progranulin expression and sporadic AD.\nEarly detection of AD has increasingly become a focus of the biomedical community, as future treatment modalities will likely hinge on slowing or preventing neurodegeneration before it has occurred. As such, mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-defined by focal memory or executive function deficits not explained by age, without dementia or loss of day-today function -has become a major focus of study. 18 MCI patients convert to AD at a rate of 10-15% per year. 19, 20 However, the majority of MCI patients will not transition to dementia, and some may display spontaneous improvement. 19 Currently, estimates of hippocampal or entorhinal cortex volume coupled with cognitive function testing are the best predictors of disease transition. 20, 21 However, reconstructive MRI imaging is expensive and not easily transferable to community hospitals. Thus, further work is needed to uncover peripheral blood markers of MCI.\nWe studied GRN expression levels in peripheral blood in a large patient series with AD and MCI, and asymptomatic controls, as well as in multiple datasets from the literature. We correlated GRN mRNA levels with demographic characteristics, disease status, genetic risk factors, methylation at the GRN locus, and progranulin protein levels as assayed by ELISA."}, {"section_title": "Material and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects and samples", "text": "This study received prior approval from the Institutional Review Board at the University of California San Francisco, and informed consent was obtained from subjects prior to study enrollment and sample collection."}, {"section_title": "UCSF-MAC cohort", "text": "In this study, 530 patients clinically diagnosed as either AD, MCI, or unaffected controls were enrolled at the Peripheral blood from each subject was collected in Paxgene tubes and kept in ice prior to total RNA isolation.

We first analyzed the UCSF-MAC cohort (n = 508).\nFirst, we assessed the relationship between gene expression, sex, and age, after ensuring no confounding between our predictors. We verified no collinearity between sex and diagnosis in our dataset (G-test, G-statistic (2) \nThe Authors. Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc on behalf of American Neurological Association. P = 0.52) nor between age and diagnosis (F 2,505 = 2.04, P = 0.13). We next fit a linear model for our covariates. We observed that GRN mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in males than in females (log 2 fold-change [log 2 FC] = 0.09, corresponding to a 6% increase, Tstatistic = 6.26, P = 0.013, Fig. 1A ) across diagnostic categories, and that age was significantly but trivially correlated with progranulin mRNA levels (Pearson's r 2 = 0.008, P = 0.04; Fig. 1B ) consistent with previous reports. 11 We next compared GRN levels between diagnostic categories (F 2,505 = 10.41, P = 3.7*10 \u00c05 ). Patients diagnosed with AD had a statistically significant increase (log 2 FC = 0.17, corresponding to +13%, Tukey's test P = 0.00019) in GRN mRNA expression compared with controls. We also observed a similar increase (log 2 FC = 0.17, P = 0.0012) in the MCI group compared with controls ( Fig. 1C) . We observed no significant differences in GRN mRNA levels between AD and MCI. When we modeled interactions between sex and diagnosis, as well as age and diagnosis, we did not observe significant effects, arguing against a synergistic relationship between these covariates. We next sought to replicate our findings. We first analyzed the AddNeuroMed Cohort (n = 274; Table 1 ). We initially observed collinearity between age and diagnosis (F 2,305 = 5.81, P = 0.003) and therefore stratified and discarded 34 samples until collinearity was no longer significant (F 2,271 = 3.0, P = 0.051). Sex remained independent after stratification (G (2) = 4.38, P = 0.11). We again fit a linear model with all covariates and relevant interaction terms. Progranulin mRNA expression again was higher in males compared with females (log 2 FC = 0.12, +9%, T-statistic = 4.4, P = 0.037), but age was no longer predictive (T-statistic = 2.3, P = 0.13). We observed a significant effect based on diagnosis (F 2,271 = 17.9, P = 4.8*10 \u00c08 ) but no interaction effects. Similar to the UCSF-MAC cohort, we observed a significant increase (log 2 FC = 0.28, corresponding to +21%, TukeyHSD; P = 5.6*10 \u00c06 ) in progranulin mRNA expression for AD patients compared with controls, and an increase (log 2 FC = 0.35, +27%, P = 6.4*10 \u00c07 ) for MCI patients compared to controls (Fig. 1D) . We next validated these sex and age findings in a third dataset, the San Antonio Family Heart Study cohort (diagnosis was not relevant for this dataset). After stratifying to correct for collinearity between sex and smoking status, we excluded all samples under 30 years of age to more appropriately match mean cohort age with our other cohorts while still maintaining statistical power (n = 543, mean age = 49.7 years). We ensured no collinearity between age (T-statistic = 1.06, P = 0.3) or smoking status (G (2) = 4.48, P = 0.08) and sex and fit a linear model. We again found that progranulin was higher in males than females (log 2 FC = 0.07, +5%, T-statistic = 4.8, P = 0.03) and found no correlation with age (T-statistic = 0.04, P = 0.8). Interestingly, smoking status was an independent predictor of blood progranulin mRNA expression in this cohort, with a 6% GRN increase in smokers (log 2 FC = 0.08, T-statistic = 4.5, P = 0.03).\nFinally, we analyzed the ADNI patient cohort (n = 617), which is divided into asymptomatic controls, early MCI (eMCI), late MCI (lMCI, with regard to clinical disease progression), and AD. This cohort was initially confounded with significant collinearity between age (F 3,696 = 10.9, P = 5*10-7), sex (G (3) = 11.1, P = 0.01) and diagnosis. We stratified and excluded samples (described in methods) until age (F 3,613 = 2.49, P = 0.06) and sex (G (3) = 5.58, 621 P = 0.13) were no longer collinear with diagnosis. However, a plate batch effect remained (G (24) = 38.9, P = 0.03), which we corrected with the ComBat package. In this cohort, neither age nor sex were predictive of progranulin expression, and we did not observe differences in progranulin expression levels between diagnostic categories (F 3,611 = 0.31, P = 0.82, TukeyHSD post hoc P > 0.05 for all comparisons; Fig. 1E )."}, {"section_title": "Effects of genotype on GRN expression", "text": "Next, we genotyped samples from the UCSF-MAC cohort for the risk-associated rs5848 GRN variant. Homozygotes for the risk-associated allele (T:T, n = 25) had a 12.3% decrease in progranulin mRNA expression compared with C:C carriers (log 2 FC = \u00c00.19, Wilcoxon Rank sum test, P = 0.02) supporting an earlier report of decreased GRN mRNA levels in postmortem brain tissue of T:T genotype carriers. 36 We also found that T-allele carriers had significantly lower progranulin levels than C:C homozygotes (log 2 FC = \u00c00.1, Welch, T 506 = 2.24, P = 0.03; Fig. 2A ). After ensuring there was no collinearity between the rs5848 genotype and sex (G-statistic 1 = 0.21, P = 0.65), we fit a linear model using sex and haplotype as an interaction term, but did not observe any significant interaction in our data. Additionally, using a Fisher's exact test, we observed an enrichment of T-genotype carriers in the AD population compared with controls, which did not reach statistical significance (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 0.95-2.38, P = 0.09). Thus, it is noteworthy that AD patients on average still have elevated progranulin gene expression despite the overrepresentation of rs5848 T-allele carriers (associated with lower progranulin levels) in the AD patient population.\nWe also studied the relationship between GRN gene expression levels and the AD risk-associated APOE haplotype. 37 We observed a significant effect of the APOE haplotype on progranulin levels in the UCSF-MAC cohort across diagnostic categories, with progranulin mRNA levels significantly higher in E4 risk allele carriers compared with E2/E3 haplotypes (log 2 FC = 0.12, +9%, Welch, T (441) = 2.82 P = 0.005, Fig. 2B ). However, there was also significant collinearity between APOE haplotype and disease status; the E4 haplotype was significantly enriched in AD patients (Fisher's exact test, OR = 4.83, P = 6.3*10 \u00c011 ) compared with controls, confounding our results. Therefore, we attempted to estimate the independent relationship between APOE haplotype and GRN expression. After removing the effects of diagnosis as a confound using a parametric empirical Bayesian estimator (ComBat), we still observed significantly higher progranulin gene expression levels in ApoE4 haplotype carriers (log 2 FC = 0.08, Welch T-test, P = 0.04), suggesting that APOE4 genotype might function as a trans expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) controlling GRN expression. We validated this finding in the Genotype-Tissue Expression consortium dataset (GTEx). 38 Analysis of rs429358 SNP (minor C-allele tags the APOE4 haplotype) and RNA-seq data from 328 samples revealed a significant association between expression and genotype (effect size = 0.12, P = 0.004) in whole blood. We checked the relationship between APOE4 carrier status and GRN expression in the ADNI dataset but failed to detect a difference in GRN expression between APOE4 carriers and controls (T (613) = 1.43, P = 0.15). We also performed the converse analysis in the UCSF-MAC cohort. Using ComBat to remove the effect of APOE haplotype, we then modeled the effect of diagnosis on progranulin expression. We found that AD samples still had significantly higher progranulin expression (log 2 FC = 0.17, T (450) = 3.9, P = 0.0001) compared with controls suggesting that diagnosis predicts progranulin expression independent of APOE4 sample overrepresentation."}, {"section_title": "GRN protein levels in CSF and plasma", "text": "We next utilized ELISA to quantify progranulin protein levels in plasma (n = 266) and CSF (n = 80) in a subset of patients from the UCSF-MAC cohort.

Additionally, we find that progranulin expression is significantly increased in patients with mild cognitive impairment. While we have replicated these findings in an independent patient cohort (AddNeuroMed), we failed to replicate them in the ADNI cohort. Of note, both our cohort and the AddNeuroMed cohort used Illumina microarray platforms while the ADNI gene expression data was run on an Affymetrix platform. We therefore hypothesize that this discrepancy may be a feature of Affymetrix probes, which may not sensitively or reliably detect changes in progranulin expression levels. This is supported by our additional failure to detect any correlation between progranulin expression and age, sex, or genotype in the ADNI dataset.\nWhile we identified differences in mean progranulin expression between groups, our results indicate that progranulin cannot be used on its own as a sensitive or specific biomarker of disease. However, our results suggest that it should be possible to identify further differentially expressed genes that could perhaps then be incorporated into a diagnostic panel. Because peripheral blood can be drawn from living patients in the most basic clinical settings, this has broader clinical utility. Most saliently, this study represents the first association between peripheral progranulin expression and MCI to our knowledge, suggesting that progranulin may play an early role in AD pathogenesis.\nPrevious studies in mouse models of AD have found that the artificial increase in progranulin levels can slow disease progression including disrupting Ab plaque deposition and neurotoxicity.\n14 Furthermore, loss-of-function mutations in the progranulin gene are risk factors for developing AD as well as other neurodegenerative disorders. 4, 6, 8 Together these findings suggest that progranulin plays a primarily neuroprotective role, reactively modifying or guarding against neurodegenerative processes. Our data support this hypothesis. The small subset of patients with the rs5848 (T:T) haplotype had significantly lower progranulin levels and were also more likely to have AD, as expected. 7, 9 However, AD patients in general had protein levels. However, analysis of our ELISA data failed to show a difference in progranulin protein levels between AD, MCI, and control patients, consistent with earlier reports. 16 There was also no correlation between progranulin protein levels in plasma and CSF and no correlation between protein and gene expression. 39 Our ELISA findings are entirely consistent with and replicate previous independent reports, indicating that our results are not the result of operational error or a technical artifact. One likely interpretation is that the current ELISA methodology fails to accurately detect subtle changes in plasma progranulin levels. The progranulin protein has complex posttranslational regulation, including glycosylation and variable cleavage into a variety of intermediaries as well as any of 8 final granulin products. These various protein configurations have myriad and often contradictory functions. 41 In fact, the current ELISA used is specific for unprocessed progranulin. 30 Given high antibody specificity and the diversity of progranulin end products, it is unlikely that ELISA can sensitively detect overall changes in specific forms of progranulin being expressed in AD, MCI, and controls; rather it is likely reflective of a particular subset of progranulin products.\nAdditionally, progranulin and granulins undergo complex spatial regulation with progranulin being shuttled to both the lysosome or excreted into the extracellular space. As such, the biological fluid and cellular components assayed have a large impact on progranulin measurements. 42 This might explain the sex dimorphism discrepancy between our gene expression and ELISA data in addition to differences in progranulin cleavage and processing. ELISA, which measures extracellular fluid (plasma), may not be directly comparable to intracellular gene expression profiles. Nevertheless, the functional significance of possibly increased progranulin secretion in females versus relative intracellular retention in males requires further study.\nFinally, our data suggest that blood progranulin gene expression is higher overall in males than in females. Our GRN methylation data also supports this finding, as males have reduced promoter methylation, suggesting a derepressed state primed for transcriptional activation. These data are intriguing considering that progranulin expression in rat hippocampus was found to be under the control of estrogen. 43 Although there have been numerous studies describing sex dimorphisms in gene methylation in peripheral blood, these studies have failed to specifically identify progranulin. 44, 45 Nevertheless, it is especially interesting to consider this sex dimorphism as women are twice as likely to develop AD as men. If progranulin indeed plays a protective role, increased endogenous progranulin expression in males might partly explain this phenomenon, and this might be mechanistically mediated by differences in progranulin promoter methylation. data are disseminated by the Laboratory for Neuro Imaging at the University of Southern California."}]
