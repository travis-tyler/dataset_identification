A total of 2224 participants from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database who carried a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (n = 1188) or mild AD (clinical dementia rating r1) (n = 1036) were included in this study. A subset of the mild cognitive impairment (n = 61) and mild AD (n = 79) participants underwent an autopsy. A dysexecutive subgroup (n = 587) was defined as having executive performance >1 SD worse than memory performance, and an amnestic subgroup (n = 549) was defined conversely. Among the autopsy subset, the odds of an AD pathologic diagnosis were compared in the 2 subgroups. The demographics, APOEe4 status, and vascular risk factors were compared in the 2 subgroups. Among the autopsy subset, the odds of having an AD pathologic diagnosis did not differ between the dysexecutive and amnestic subgroups. Under an additive model, participants in the dysexecutive subgroup possessed the APOEe4 allele less frequently compared with those in the amnestic subgroup. The dysexecutive subgroup had a history of hypertension less frequently compared with the amnestic subgroup. These distinct characteristics add to accumulating evidence that a dysexecutive subgroup of AD may have a unique underlying pathophysiology.\nKey Words: Alzheimer disease, mild cognitive impairment, executive function, memory, APOE, vascular risk factors (Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord 2013;27:218-225) A lthough episodic memory loss is a classic early symptom of Alzheimer disease (AD), 1 the presentation of AD can be quite heterogenous.

The study was approved by an institutional review board at each institution. The current study is a secondary analysis of data previously collected. Recruitment, participant evaluation, and diagnostic criteria for dementia, probable AD, and MCI are detailed elsewhere. 18 Each participant with MCI was further classified as having memory impairment (aMCI) or not having memory impairment (nonamnestic MCI). Each participant with aMCI was further classified into single domain (memory impairment only) or multiple domain (attention/processing speed, executive function, language, or visuospatial function). Because we were interested in the early presentation of AD, we restricted our sample to participants who met criteria for probable mild AD (CDRr1) or for single-domain or multiple-domain aMCI (who are more likely to progress to AD compared with nonamnestic MCI 19 ).\nRace (white, African American, American Indian or Alaska native, Pacific Islander, Asian, or other) and presence of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity were ascertained by selfreport using 2 separate questions. All references to African Americans and whites imply non-Hispanic African Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Years of education was ascertained by self-report.\nStroke was defined according to the World Health Organization criteria, on the basis of self-report and supplemented by a neurological examination. History of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and myocardial infarction (MI) were ascertained by self-report at the first visit. A vascular risk score was assigned to each participant on the basis of the number of vascular risk factors (0 to 5).\nAll participants underwent the ADCs Uniform Data Set (UDS) neuropsychological battery. The tests include Digit Span Forward, Digit Span Backward, Digit Symbol, Trail Making Test (TMT) part A, TMT part B, Logical Memory Test story A (LMTA) immediate recall, LMTA delayed recall, Animal List Generation, Vegetable List Generation, and the Boston Naming Test. 20 The neuropsychological data were used from the first visit during which the diagnosis of MCI or AD was made.\nAn APOE genotype was determined for each participant and classified as having no APOEe4 alleles, 1 APOEe4 allele, or 2 APOEe4 alleles.\nA total of 2224 (31%) of the 7126 eligible participants were included in this study. Inclusion criteria are illustrated in the flow chart in Figure 1 . Participants were excluded if they had incomplete neuropsychological testing, lacked APOE genotyping, or had incomplete vascular risk factor data. Included and excluded participants did not differ in sex or age. Compared with the included participants, the excluded participants were less educated by 0.4 years (P < 0.001), were disproportionately African American [odds ratio (OR) = 1.42, P < 0.001], and were disproportionately demented (OR = 1.24, P < 0.001).\nOf the 2224 included participants, 140 underwent an autopsy. Compared with the nonautopsy subset, the autopsy subset was 6.7 years older (P < 0.001), had 0.6 more years of education (P = 0.017), was less likely to be African American (OR = 0.13, P = 0.004), and was less likely to be female (OR = 0.67, P = 0.022). Each autopsy participant was given a primary pathologic diagnosis. If AD pathology was present and considered by the pathologist to be the primary diagnosis, but did not meet the Reagan criteria, 21 the participant was still considered to have pathologic AD in our study.\nControls were diagnosed as normal at each annual NACC evaluation (n = 6385, first visit mean age = 71.3). Using neuropsychological data from their first visit, a mean and an SD were calculated for each test in the UDS. These were used to calculate the Z scores on each test for each participant with cognitive deficits. A global cognitive score was calculated for each participant by averaging the Z score on each of the UDS neuropsychological tests.\nClassification of the \"dysexecutive\" and \"amnestic\" subgroups was made according to methods used by Dickerson and Wolk 6 in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with modification due to test availability. The LMTA and the TMT were used to evaluate memory and executive function, respectively. This method was chosen because it uses neuropsychological tests (or variations on them) that are widely used so it can be easily replicated. The method has been shown to differentiate patients into subgroups who demonstrate consistent generalizable deficits in their respective cognitive domains on multiple neuropsychological tests. 6 In the LMTA, delayed recall was subtracted from immediate recall to account for learning ability. This value was termed the memory score. In the TMT, TMT A was subtracted from TMT B to account for attention. This value was termed the executive score. Even though all the participants needed to have cognitive impairment to be included in the study, they could have either positive or negative memory and executive scores because each of these scores was obtained by taking the difference between 2 neuropsychological tests. A mean and SD for the executive and memory scores were calculated. These were used to calculate the Z scores for each participant. Participants were considered members of the dysexecutive subgroup if their executive performance was Z1 SD below their memory performance. Participants were considered members of the amnestic subgroup if their memory performance was Z1 SD below their executive performance.\nTo determine whether the dysexecutive and amnestic subgroups also differed in other aspects of cognition, we calculated several composite scores on the basis of a recent factor analysis of the NACC cognitive battery in normal controls, MCI, and dementia. 22 Specifically, we calculated scores for each of the 4 identified neuropsychological factors by averaging the Z scores for each participant on the tests that make up the factor. The executive factor consisted of TMT A, TMT B, and Digit Symbol. The memory factor consisted of LMTA immediate recall and LMTA delayed recall. The language factor consisted of Boston Naming Test, Animal List Generation, and Vegetable List Generation. The attention factor consisted of Digit Span Forward and Digit Span Backward.\nAfter controlling for variables that differed between the 2 subgroups (ie, age, education, ethnicity, APOEe4, and global cognition as demonstrated in the results section), the AD dysexecutive subgroup performed worse than the AD amnestic subgroup on the executive factor (P < 0.001), but performed better than the AD amnestic subgroup on the memory factor (P < 0.001) and the language factor (P < 0.001). They did not differ on the attention factor. After controlling for covariates, the MCI dysexecutive subgroup performed worse than the MCI amnestic subgroup on the executive factor (P < 0.001), but performed better than the AD amnestic subgroup on the memory factor (P < 0.001). They did not differ on the attention or language factors."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analyses", "text": "All analyses were carried out in the entire sample and separately in MCI and AD participants.

We also examined the rate of pathologic AD at autopsy in MCI participants that were excluded from the current study because they were defined as nonamnestic.

However, when stratified by diagnostic group across MCI and mild AD, other demographics of the cognitive subgroups differed substantially.

Because the APOEe4-AD association is weaker among African Americans than among whites, 24 and because there was a higher proportion of African American participants in the dysexecutive MCI subgroup as compared with the amnestic subgroup, we repeated the above analysis stratified by ethnicity. In African Americans, under an additive genetic model, after controlling for covariates, there was no difference in the odds of the APOEe4 allele.

Because of the possibility of additivity among vascular risk factors, we calculated a vascular score ranging from 1 to 5 on the basis of the number of vascular risk factors. After controlling for covariates, the vascular risk score did not differ in the 2 subgroups (Table 6 )."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Although episodic memory deficits are a classic early symptom of AD, the cognitive presentation of AD can be quite heterogenous. In this study, we explored the demographic, genetic, and the vascular characteristics of a dysexecutive subgroup of AD early in the disease course and compared these characteristics with an amnestic subgroup of AD. Participants were included in the analyses if they had single-domain aMCI, multiple-domain aMCI, or mild AD (CDRr1). Although it may have been informative to include those with nonamnestic executive MCI, we restricted our analyses to aMCI participants to increase our confidence that these individuals would progress to AD rather than a non-AD dementia. Existing studies have shown that aMCI is more likely to progress to AD than nonamnestic MCI. 19, 25 Moreover, the rate of pathologic AD at autopsy in a subset of the nonamnestic dysexecutive MCI participants in the NACC (36.3%) trended lower compared with a subset of the amnestic single-domain MCI participants (60.9%).\nThe dysexecutive and amnestic subgroups characterized in the current study did not differ in odds of having a pathologic diagnosis of AD. Although not significantly different, the AD dysexecutive subgroup had pathologic AD in >80% of participants as compared with 60% of the amnestic subgroup, the latter of which also captured several individuals with hippocampal sclerosis. These findings, and the fact that the amnestic subgroup accounted for only 27% of the current study sample, highlight the frequency of executive dysfunction in early AD. 26 Thus, the amnestic subgroup in the current study should not be considered typical AD, but rather a focal presentation used to create a clear distinction from the predominantly dysexecutive subgroup. A large portion of individuals in our study did not meet criteria for either of these \"extreme\" subgroups, and these individuals generally had demographic, genetic, and vascular characteristics that were intermediate between the amnestic and dysexecutive subgroup characteristics. Although subgroup categorization was based on only 2 neuropsychological tests, the construction of the subgroups is nonetheless meaningful: investigators have previously shown in ADNI that these subgroups, derived from very similar methodology, are biologically different, with the dysexecutive subgroup exhibiting greater frontoparietal cortical thinning on magnetic resonance imaging than the amnestic subgroup. 6 Further, composite scores for recently derived NACC neuropsychological factors 22 differed in the 2 subgroups. Expectedly, the subgroups differ in the executive and memory factors. Given the fact that the language factor is derived largely from the tests of semantic fluency (that tend to be impaired in conjunction with memory secondary to compromise of the medial temporal lobe), it is not surprising that the AD amnestic subgroup was also more impaired on this factor. No differences were seen on the attention factor. These results support the definition of amnestic versus dysexecutive subgroups implemented in the current study, as well as the existence of different subgroups within AD more broadly.\nAfter controlling for covariates, the African Americans had greater odds of being members of the dysexecutive subgroup in MCI; however, ethnicity did not differ between the subgroups in mild AD. Healthy African American elders obtain lower scores on tests of executive function compared with whites. 27 Perhaps, the finding in MCI reflects these differences in specificity of executive function measures among cognitively normal African Americans rather than a finding specific to AD pathology. Future longitudinal analyses would help clarify whether the African Americans in the dysexecutive subgroup might develop AD at a lower rate compared with the African Americans in the amnestic subgroup, as these data may intimate.\nAfter controlling for covariates, the dysexecutive subgroup was older than the amnestic subgroup in MCI but was younger than the amnestic subgroup in mild AD. The dysexecutive subgroup also had fewer years of education compared with the amnestic subgroup in MCI, but years of education did not differ between the subgroups in mild AD. Advanced age and fewer years of education are associated with lower scores on tests of executive function in healthy elders. 28 Perhaps the age and education findings in MCI reflect these differences among cognitively normal elders rather than a finding specific to AD pathology. Age of onset for focal, nonamnestic presentations of AD has been reported to be earlier compared with typical presentations of AD. 29 The younger age of the dysexecutive subgroup in AD might echo these findings in the literature. Future longitudinal analyses would also help clarify whether an older or less educated subset of the dysexecutive subgroup might develop AD at a lower rate compared with the amnestic subgroup as these data may intimate.\nWe decided to look at APOEe4 frequency in the amnestic and dysexecutive subgroups because AD-APOEe4 carriers have been found to have greater memory deficits and greater medial temporal atrophy compared with noncarriers. 30, 31 In addition, AD noncarriers have been found to have greater executive impairment and greater frontoparietal atrophy compared with carriers. 31, 32 In our study, after controlling for covariates, under an additive genetic model, participants with the APOEe4 allele had smaller odds of membership in the dysexecutive subgroup compared with the amnestic subgroup. These findings were still present when stratified into MCI and mild AD. This result replicates data from ADNI 6 in a considerably larger sample using a superior genetic model. Unlike previous studies, our additive model controls for potential effect modulators and demonstrates a dose-effect on the basis of the number of APOEe4 alleles.\nIn the NACC sample used for this study, there were 1861 whites (83.7%) and 219 African Americans (9.8%). Given that whites make up most of the sample, it is not surprising that the results of the full-sample APOE analysis were replicated in the whites when analyses were stratified by race. When we performed this analysis in the African Americans, there was no significant difference in the odds of individuals with the APOEe4 allele in each subgroup. Nonetheless, the OR in African Americans was similar to the OR in whites. Given the small number of African Americans, our study might lack the power to detect a true difference. Alternatively, this might reflect the historically weaker APOEe4-AD association in African Americans. 24 After controlling for covariates, participants in the dysexecutive subgroup had a smaller odds of having a history of hypertension compared with the participants in the amnestic subgroup. The 2 subgroups did not differ in odds of history of hyperlipidemia, diabetes, stroke, or MI. When a vascular score was calculated on the basis of the number of vascular risk factors, the 2 subgroups did not differ after controlling for covariates. These findings suggest that the dysexecutive subgroup is not associated with increased vascular risk factors either individually or additively compared with the amnestic subgroup. Multiple studies suggest that AD patients with vascular risk factors have more executive impairment compared with those without vascular risk factors. 16, 17 Multiple studies also suggest that AD patients with vascular risk factors including hypertension have more memory impairment compared with those without vascular risk factors. 16, 33 Although it may be a widely held belief that an increase in vascular risk factors leads to relatively more executive dysfunction compared with memory dysfunction in AD, the literature does not address this question directly. Our findings suggest that the vascular risk factors do not impose a disproportionate executive to memory burden in AD, and in fact hypertension may impose a disproportionate memory to executive burden in AD. Our findings might also suggest that executive dysfunction might have another underlying etiology besides subcortical white matter disease such as increase in plaque and tangle pathology in the prefrontal cortex.\nThe study has several limitations. Participant demographics and clinical criteria may have lacked uniformity, given the heterogeneity of the 29 ADCs contributing to the NACC database. Nonetheless, the large NACC sample size should have reduced the likelihood that false positives contaminated the results. Further, the heterogeneity allows for greater generalizability to other populations.\nAnother limitation is the limited utility of trails B in individuals with poor education or who lack familiarity with the English alphabet. Although one may argue that our findings in African Americans may be disproportionately affected by this limitation, we control for education in our model.\nWithin MCI, the requirement that all participants have memory impairment might suggest that the dysexecutive subgroup (that must be multidomain MCI) had more advanced disease compared with the amnestic subgroup (that could be either single-domain or multidomain MCI), confounding the comparison. However, it was not the case that both groups had comparable memory loss, with additional executive dysfunction in the dysexecutive group. Rather, memory was more impaired in the amnestic subgroup than in the dysexecutive subgroup, suggesting that the 2 groups were qualitatively different presentations rather than similar presentations at different points on a continuum. Further, to be sure that disease severity did not drive the current results, we controlled for global cognition in our regression analyses.\nThis study illustrates the distinct demographic, genetic, and vascular characteristics of a dysexecutive subgroup of AD. Specifically, it further supports data indicating that APOE impacts the clinical presentation of AD through effects on the anatomic distribution of the disease. 31 Future studies should investigate additional non-APOE-mediated susceptibility factors that participate in executive dysfunction in AD and potential differences in rate of decline across the various AD subgroups. Well-defined AD clinical phenotypes likely will have value in differential diagnosis and prognostication in clinical practice and in uniform patient recruitment for genetic studies and clinical trials."}]
