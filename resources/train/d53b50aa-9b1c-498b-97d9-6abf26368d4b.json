Study subjects comprised 6,027 community-dwelling individuals who were recruited to a population-based longitudinal genetic epidemiological study. Bonferroni's correction was applied to compensate for multiple comparisons of association and P<0.0011 was considered statistically significant. Body mass index and waist circumference increased with age up to ~50 years and decreased thereafter in men, whereas the two parameters increased linearly with age in women. The prevalence of obesity was highest (41.1%) in men aged 40-49 years, after which it decreased with age. The prevalence of obesity in women increased with age to \u226432.2% in those aged \u226570 years. Systolic and mean blood pressure (BP), as well as pulse pressure, increased linearly with age in all subjects, whereas diastolic BP increased with age up to ~60 years and subsequently decreased. The prevalence of hypertension increased with age to \u226469.9 or 68.5% at age \u226570 years in men and women, respectively. The fasting plasma glucose level, blood hemoglobin A 1c content and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus increased gradually with age in men and women. The serum triglyceride concentration increased with age up to ~50 years and decreased thereafter in men, whereas it increased linearly with age in women. The prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia increased to a peak of 56.8% at age 50-59 years and subsequently decreased in men, whereas in women it increased with age to \u226434.9% at \u226570 years. The serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol concentration increased with age up to ~50 years and decreased thereafter in women. The prevalence of hypo-HDL-cholesterolemia increased gradually with age in women. The serum concentration of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol increased with age up to ~50 years and subsequently declined in men, whereas it increased linearly with age in women. The prevalence of hyper-LDL-cholesterolemia increased with age to \u226453.4% at 50-59 years in men and \u226463.9% at 60-69 years in women and it decreased thereafter in the two genders. The serum creatinine concentration and the estimated glomerular filtration rate increased or decreased linearly with age, respectively. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) increased with age to \u226445.1 or 39.6% at \u226570 years in men and women, respectively. Therefore, these results indicate that 13 clinical parameters, as well as the prevalence of obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and CKD, were significantly associated with age. They may therefore prove informative for the prevention of these diseases and contribute to the achievement of a healthy long life and successful aging."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Aging is an inevitable, complex and multifactorial process that is characterized by the progressive degeneration of tissues and organ systems in humans (1) . Although the aging process is largely determined by genetics, it is influenced by various environmental factors, including diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol intake and exposure to microorganisms, pollutants and ionizing radiation (1) . People of the same age may thus differ markedly in terms of their physical appearance and physiological status (1) . In addition, in the majority of developed countries, women typically outlive men by 7-10 years (1,2). Recent research has also shown that childhood personality and education, as well as behavioral factors, contribute to longevity (3) .\nPhysiological changes associated with aging lead to a decrease in the function of various organ systems (4, 5) . Given that aging also increases mortality risk as a function of time, it is important to understand precisely the anatomic and physiological changes attributed to the normal aging process. A key medical and social aim is to extend the healthy life span of humans and to prevent prolonged immobility or hospitalization of the elderly due to serious conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke or fractures.\nThe present study examined age-related physiological changes in 13 clinical parameters and their associations with obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in community-dwelling Japanese individuals. The aim of the study was to contribute to the prevention of these diseases and to promote the achievement of a healthy long life and successful aging in the elderly."}, {"section_title": "Subjects and methods", "text": "Study population.

The results indicate that these clinical parameters and disease prevalence are significantly associated with age.\nCross-sectional studies with large populations have shown that body weight and BMI increase gradually during adult life, \u226450-59 years of age, and subsequently decrease in men and women (13) (14) (15) . Given the cross-sectional nature of these studies, there was a possibility of survival bias due to the higher mortality rates for obese individuals in middle adulthood (16) .\nLongitudinal cohort studies have shown that body weight and BMI increase with age up to ~50 years in men and women, remain unchanged between 50 and 70 years in men and between 50 and 60 years in women, and subsequently decline at later ages (17) (18) (19) . Waist circumference was also found to increase with age, with the extent of this increase being greater in women compared with men (20) .\nAging is associated with substantial changes in body composition (21) . Fat mass increases after 20-30 years of age, whereas fat-free mass (reflecting mostly skeletal muscle) progressively decreases by \u226440% from 20 to 70 years of age (22, 23) . Whereas fat-free mass is maximal at ~20 years of age and fat mass is maximal at 60-70 years, with the two parameters declining following these respective ages (22, 23) . Aging is also associated with a redistribution of body fat and fat-free mass. With aging, there is an increase in intra-abdominal fat relative to subcutaneous or total body fat, as well as a decrease in peripheral fat-free mass relative to central fat-free mass as a result of the loss of skeletal muscle (24) . The balance between energy intake and expenditure is an important determinant of body fat mass (21) . Previous studies have suggested that energy intake either does not change or decreases during aging (25, 26) . A decrease in total energy expenditure, including that attributable to the resting metabolic rate and the thermic effect of food and physical activity, may therefore be an important factor in the gradual increase in body fat with age (27) . Physical activity decreases with age (28) and this decrease has been estimated to account for about one-half of the decline in total energy expenditure that occurs with aging (27) .\nThe present results show that BMI, waist circumference and the prevalence of obesity increased gradually with age up to ~50 years and decreased thereafter in men, whereas these parameters increased gradually with age in women.\nThe age-related change in BMI for men was similar to that observed in previous cross-sectional and longitudinal studies (13) (14) (15) (17) (18) (19) . The age-related change in waist circumference for women was similar to previous observations (20) , however, that of the BMI change for women was not consistent with the results of previous studies (13) (14) (15) (17) (18) (19) . Although the reason for this latter discrepancy is unclear, it may reflect differences in ethnicity (genetics) or environmental factors, including dietary habits, physical activity and other lifestyle aspects.\nIn the Framingham Heart Study, systolic BP was found to increase between the ages of 30 and \u226584 years, whereas diastolic BP increased until the fifth decade and subsequently decreased slowly from the ages of 60-84. These changes in systolic and diastolic BP resulted in an increase in pulse pressure with age (29) . An increased pulse pressure due to elevated systolic BP and decreased diastolic BP in elderly individuals "}, {"section_title": "A B C D A B", "text": "was shown to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (29) . An increased risk of cardiovascular complications associated with an increased pulse pressure was also demonstrated in a meta-analysis including the results of several major trials (30) . The Prospective Studies Collaboration examined 61 studies of BP and mortality in 1 million adults with no previous cardiovascular disease at baseline and identified that BP was strongly associated with the age-specific mortality of stroke, coronary artery disease and other vascular diseases (31) . The increase in BP with age is associated with changes in arterial and arteriolar stiffness. The stiffness of large arteries is due mostly to arteriosclerotic structural alterations and calcification, and it leads to earlier reflected pressure waves from arterioles toward the heart during BP wave propagation. These pressure waves arrive back during systole, increasing central systolic BP and widening pulse pressure (32) . Large-artery stiffness and peripheral vascular resistance contribute to the increase in systolic BP with age, whereas the increase in diastolic BP at \u226450 years is mostly due to increased peripheral vascular resistance in small vessels and the subsequent decrease in diastolic BP is attributable to the increase in large-artery stiffness. Although peripheral vascular resistance may initiate hypertension, it is the acceleration of large-artery stiffness that leads to the rise in systolic BP >50 years of age (32) .\nThe present results show that systolic and mean BP, pulse pressure and the prevalence of hypertension increased linearly with age, whereas diastolic BP increased with age up to ~60 years and decreased thereafter. The age-related changes in systolic and diastolic BP and pulse pressure in the study are thus consistent with those observed previously (29) .\nAging is accompanied by an increase in glucose intolerance and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (33,34), both of which result from an imbalance between the body's requirement for insulin (insulin sensitivity) and its ability to secrete insulin (\u03b2-cell function). Glucose intolerance in the elderly may result from impaired insulin secretion, increased peripheral insulin resistance or changes in other hormone systems. Additional factors that affect glucose tolerance in the elderly include obesity, physical inactivity, reduced dietary carbohydrate, impaired renal function and administration of certain drugs (35) . The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging revealed that glucose tolerance declines prominently >60 years, primarily as a result of an age-related increase in adiposity and decrease in physical activity, with the effect of age itself being moderate (36) . The finding that impairment of glucose tolerance develops largely >60 years of age (36) is consistent with the results of several studies showing that insulin-mediated glucose disposal is also decreased in such elderly individuals (37) (38) (39) . Loss of glucose tolerance with age is thus associated with weight gain and a sedentary lifestyle, as well as to a loss of insulin secretory function and insulin sensitivity (40) .\nThe present results show that the fasting plasma glucose level, blood hemoglobin A 1c content and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus gradually increased with age in men and women. Age-related changes in these parameters in the study are thus consistent with previous observations (36) (37) (38) (39) .\nLongitudinal and cross-sectional analyses of lipid profiles in a previous study with Japanese individuals showed that serum triglyceride levels increased until 50 years of age and subsequently decreased in men, whereas they increased until 70 years of age in women (41, 42 ). An age-related change in serum HDL-cholesterol level was not observed in men, whereas this parameter decreased with age in women. In men, the serum LDL-cholesterol concentration increased until age 60 and remained unchanged from age 60-80, whereas in women it increased until age 80. ."}, {"section_title": "A B C D", "text": "The mechanisms responsible for the development of dyslipidemia with age remain unclear, however, they may be associated with changes in the liver sinusoidal endothelium (pseudocapillarization), an increase in postprandial lipemia, insulin resistance induced by free fatty acids, growth hormone deficiency, a decline in androgen levels in men and in estrogen levels in women and a decrease in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 expression in the liver (43) .\nThe present results show that the serum triglyceride level increased with age up to ~50 years and decreased thereafter in men whereas it increased linearly with age in women. The serum concentration of HDL-cholesterol did not change with age in men, whereas it increased slightly with age up to ~50 years and decreased thereafter in women. The serum LDL-cholesterol level increased with age up to ~50 years and subsequently declined in men, whereas it increased linearly with age in women. With the exception of HDL-cholesterol results for women, the age-related changes in lipid profiles in the study are thus largely consistent with those observed previously (41, 42) .\nRenal function was previously shown to decrease gradually >30 years (44) . Numerous individuals thus manifest a progressive decrease in glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow with age, although there is wide interindividual variability. The decline in glomerular filtration rate is attributable to a reduction in the glomerular capillary plasma flow rate and the glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient (44, 45) . Aging is also associated with altered responsiveness to vasoactive stimuli, such that responses to vasoconstrictor stimuli are enhanced whereas vasodilatory responses are impaired (45) . The activities of the renin-angiotensin and nitric oxide systems also change with age (45) . These physiological changes result in age-related impairment of kidney function and the development of CKD (45) .\nThe present results show that the serum creatinine level and the prevalence of CKD increased linearly with age, whereas eGFR declined. The age-related changes in these parameters are consistent with previous observations (46, 47) .\nThere were limitations to the present study, which included: i) Substantial percentages of the subjects had undergone medical treatment for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, or CKD; ii) although the mean follow-up period for the cohort was 5 years, this time varied among individuals (from 1 to 11 years); and iii) the number of subjects differed among the different age groups.\nIn conclusion, the present results indicate that 13 clinical parameters, as well as the prevalence of obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and CKD, are significantly associated with age. These age-related changes may have important practical implications for the clinical management of elderly individuals. Given that metabolic status is dependent on age, changes in the responses to commonly administered drugs may necessitate adjustment of dosage in the elderly. There is also a requirement for the implementation of a rational diet and exercise programs in an effort to delay or reverse some of these age-related physiological changes. These results may prove informative for the prevention of the common complex diseases examined in the present study, as well as for more serious conditions such as coronary artery disease and stroke, and they may therefore contribute to the achievement of a healthy long life and a successful aging strategy."}]
