[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This study investigates the relatively low rates of early marriage and cohabitation among Asian Americans compared to Whites. With an emphasis on family value socialization and other precursors measured in adolescence, data from Waves 1 and 3 of Add Health are used to test five hypotheses. Analyses of early marriage indicate that the Asian-White difference is driven primarily by differences in adolescent sexual and romantic relationship experiences, and several measures of family values play a stronger role among Asian Americans than Whites. Asian-White differences in cohabitation persist net of SES and other adolescent precursors, but differences are attenuated when parental value socialization, intimate relationship experiences, and educational investments are controlled. These results are interpreted within a culturally sensitive conceptual framework that emphasizes independent versus interdependent construals of the self."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Recent studies of union formation have emphasized continuities between adolescence and adulthood (Crissey, 2005; Manning, Longmore, & Giordano, 2007; Plotnick, 2007; Raley, Crissey, & Muller, 2007) . Increasingly, scholars argue that the family values and attitudes toward sex and intimate relationships acquired in the teenage years foreshadow union formation expectations and behaviors in the early adult years. Indeed, several studies have shown that patterns of union formation in young adulthood can be predicted from attitudes and experiences in adolescence. For example, romantic relationship experiences at the end of high school increase the likelihood of marriage, whereas nonromantic sexual experiences predict later cohabitation (Raley et al. 2007 ).\nFurthermore, racial differences in adolescent values and attitudes toward sexual behaviors and union formation have been reported. For example, when asked about desired ages at marriage and first birth, Hispanic and Black girls desire faster transitions than White or Southeast Asian girls (East, 1998) .\nDespite efforts to understand differences in union formation patterns across racial/ethnic groups, few studies of marriage or cohabitation have incorporated Asian Americans. Data from the 2000 Census show that the median ages at first marriage for Asian American men and women are higher than those for White Americans: 29 versus 26 for men and 26 versus 24 for women 1 . When compared to other racial/ethnic groups, Asian men have the highest median age at first marriage, whereas Asian women have the second highest (only lower than Black women). Nonetheless, most (independent versus interdependent). Attention to how values are internalized in culturally diverse families provides insight into the mechanisms underlying behavioral differences. Third, we address multiple understudied research issues by: (1) focusing on both marriage and cohabitation among Asian Americans; (2) looking at actual occurrences of marriage and cohabitation, rather than expectations about unions; (3) simultaneously examining the influences of family values, adolescents' own sexual and relationship values, adolescents' sexual and relationship experiences, and educational investments on the transition to first union; and (4) utilizing a nationally representative sample of a recent cohort of White and Asian youth."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Framework", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Race and Union Formation", "text": "Over the past few decades, the mean age at first marriage and the percentage of never-married individuals at most ages have been on the rise (Casper & Bianchi 2002) . Cohabitation has become prevalent, whether or not it is followed by marriage. Differences in patterns of union formation have been reported repeatedly for Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics (Bumpass & Lu, 2000; Manning & Smock, 1995; Schoen & Cheng, 2006) , but because of the limited attention to Asian Americans, the portrait of their union formation behavior is less complete. Glick et al. (2006) , using the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS), reported a lower likelihood of entry into marriage for Asian youth when compared to Whites. However, the difference between Asians and Whites was non-significant after family socioeconomic status and generation status were considered. Findings from East's (1998) study indicate that when family characteristics and socioeconomic background are controlled, Southeast Asian girls prefer later and more gradual transitions to sexual, marital, and birth events than Hispanic and Black girls. Finally, Plotnick (2007) found that Asian American adolescents have significantly higher expected and desired age of marriage than White adolescents. All of these studies accentuate the need to further explore the factors involved in differences in the timing of union formation between White and Asian American young adults."}, {"section_title": "Perspectives on Self-Construal as a Way to Understand Family Influences", "text": "The term \"self-construal\" refers to the awareness and conception of oneself in relation to others, especially the extent to which one sees how he/she is separated from or connected with others (Markus & Kitayama 1991) . The seminal work of Markus and Kitayama (1991) "}, {"section_title": "Family Value Socialization and Adolescents' Values", "text": "Asian culture places strong constraints on young people's premarital sexual behaviors and cohabitation (Staples & Mirande 1980 , Espiritu 2001 , Chan 1994 . This is true in countries influenced by the Confucian culture as well as other countries like the Philippines, even though recent trends indicate a rise in premarital sex and cohabitation in such settings (Jones 2007 , Williams et al. 2007 ). First-and second-generation Asian American adolescents remain under the strong influence of the Asian value system because of their exposure to immigrant parents. For example, Espiritu's (2001) qualitative study of first-and second-generation Filipino daughters and their parents reveals strong parental disapproval of sex along with strict parental control of daughters' sexuality and dating choices. This causes conflicting emotions in daughters who want to adapt to the U.S. culture and to stay true to their ethnic identity.\nAnother source of family values is religion. Offspring of more religious parents are more likely to internalize conservative family values than offspring of less religious parents. They may therefore perceive more negative social consequences of early sexual and dating activities, which may deter actual involvement in these activities. Lower involvement in sex and dating decreases the likelihood of cohabitation and marriage in early adulthood (Crissey, 2005; Manning et al., 2007; Meier & Allen, 2007; Raley et al., 2007) . At the same time, prior research shows that religiosity has a positive effect on the perceived likelihood of marriage (Crissey 2005 , Manning et al. 2007 ) and a negative effect on cohabitation (Williams et al. 2007 , Thornton et al. 1992 .\nParental attitudes about dating and sex are also intertwined with parents' aspirations for their children. Asian families place great emphasis on making sure the young excel in school and advance to higher education (Hirschman & Wong 1986) , and Asian American youth invest considerable time and energy pursuing educational goals that fulfill the expectations of family members (Asakawa & Csikszentmihalyi 2000) , often their parents. As a consequence, they are likely to refrain from seeking sexual or romantic relationships that are considered secondary or inappropriate in adolescence (Espiritu 2001 "}, {"section_title": "Sexual and Relationship Experiences", "text": "Recent studies have investigated the links between romantic relationships and union formation expectations in adolescence and union formation behaviors in young adulthood. Crissey (2005) finds that adolescents who are involved in serious relationships are more likely than others to think that they will get married by age 25. Raley and colleagues (2007) report similar findings, except the outcomes in their study are actual marriage and cohabitation. They show that adolescents who have romantic relationships by the end of high school are more likely to be married and to cohabit in early adulthood than those who do not. In addition, nonromantic sexual relationships in adolescence elevate the risk of cohabitation, but not marriage. Meier and Allen (2007) show that adolescents who have a history of either \"progression to a steady relationship\" or \"remaining in a stable steady relationship\" are significantly more likely to get married, whereas those who never had any relationship by early adulthood are much less likely to cohabit. Similarly, Manning et al. (2007) find that adolescents who have never dated are less likely to expect to cohabit before marriage than adolescents who are currently dating. They also show that sexual activity in adolescence increases the likelihood of expecting the \"cohabitation then marriage\" pathway instead of the \"direct marriage\" pathway (Manning et al. 2007) . Together, these studies make clear that adolescent relationship experiences are critical precursors of union formation behavior in young adulthood.\nThus, it is hypothesized that Asian adolescents' limited experiences in sexual and romantic relationships (Carver et al. 2003 , Chris & Hahm, 2006 will partially explain their relatively low rates of forming marital and cohabitating unions (Hypothesis 4)."}, {"section_title": "Educational Investments", "text": "The relationship between schooling and union formation has been tested extensively (Glick et al. 2006 , Thornton et al. 1995 . Both school enrollment and greater investment in education are associated with later union formation, especially marriage. Although schooling may have a weaker effect on minority youths for whom socioeconomic advancement is blocked structurally (Edin and Kefalas 2005) , this is generally not the case for Asian Americans. Asian Americans have relatively high rates of attending elite universities, getting professional or managerial jobs, and making high income when compared with other minority groups (Hirschman & Wong 1986) . Asians' high investments in education should delay their union formation. In fact, Glick et al.'s (2006) study demonstrated that Asian teens with high educational engagement have a very low predicted probability of marriage.\nEast's (1998) study further highlights the links between race/ethnicity, education, and union formation. East argues that despite the similar socioeconomic profiles of Southeast Asian and Black girls, the former have higher educational and job aspirations than the latter, and this lowers their desire for early sexual and marital events. Family culture plays a key role in this difference. Asian parents' expectations are also high in comparison to those of White parents. It is thus hypothesized that educational investments contribute to the relatively low rates of early union formation of Asian"}, {"section_title": "Americans compared to White Americans (Hypothesis 5).", "text": "To sum up, to unravel the processes underlying Asian-White differences in the formation of cohabiting and marital unions, we investigate the influence of family value socialization, adolescents' own values and attitudes, early romantic and sexual relationships, and educational investments beyond high school. Throughout our analyses, we control for socioeconomic background because of its well-established role in union formation. It is important to bear in mind that our analysis focuses on early union formation-that is, union formation before age 25."}, {"section_title": "Research Design", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "This paper employs data from Waves 1 and 3 of Add Health, a longitudinal study that began with a national sample of adolescents in grades 7-12 in 1994-1995. Students were selected from a sampling frame of 26,666 U.S. high schools, including public, private, and parochial schools. These schools were grouped into strata based on enrollment size, school type, region, urbanity, and percent White students. Schools were selected using systematic sampling methods and implicit stratification. Students within each selected school were chosen with a known probability sampling method. Minority groups including Asians, Cubans, Puerto Ricans and African Americans from well-educated families were oversampled. Post-stratification adjustments were made on region so that the sum of school weights would equal the number of schools in each region of the United\nStates (Harris et al., 2003) .\nThe data were collected mainly through in-home interviews, with extra parent questionnaires in Wave 1. The first wave of Add Health data was collected between September 1994 and December 1995. The Wave 2 in-home interviews were conducted between April 1996 and August 1996.\nFinally, the Wave 3 in-home interviews were conducted between 2001 and 2002."}, {"section_title": "Sample", "text": "The sample selected for the current study is individuals who participated in the Wave 1 and Wave 3\nAdd Health in-home interviews (n=11,621). We excluded 793 individuals because they lacked the longitudinal sampling weight for analyses using Wave 1 and Wave 3, resulting in 10,828 Our multivariate analysis is based on a person-year file that includes observations for each year between Wave 1 and the specific union transition being analyzed. If a respondent never experienced any union, the last observation is the year in which the Wave 3 interview was conducted. Some respondents were excluded because they experienced a certain event prior to the Wave 1 interview; these respondents were not at risk of a first union transition between Wave 1 and Wave 3. Twenty seven adolescents had married and 107 adolescents had cohabited by Wave 1. These individuals were left-censored from the relevant statistical analyses. The multivariate analyses of first marriage and first cohabitation are based on 4501 and 4421 respondents, respectively. These analyses are based on different numbers of individuals because of differences in the number of adolescents experiencing each event before Wave 1."}, {"section_title": "Variables and Measures", "text": "Outcome Variables. Respondents were asked to report the month and year of their first marriage and their first cohabitation in Wave 3. From these dates, century months were calculated for entry into marriage and cohabitation. When both the month and the year were missing, the case was deleted from the analysis. When the month was unknown and the year was available, the case was retained and we assumed that the event occurred in the middle of the year (i.e., in June). The outcome variables were coded '0' until the year in which the event of interest took place. To determine the year of a particular union event, the century month of the event was compared to the century months in which the person year started and ended. If the event fell within the person year, the event variable was coded '1.'\nSociodemographic Control Variables. The sociodemographic characteristics included in this study are age, gender, maternal education, family income, and family structure at Wave 1. Prior studies document that the socioeconomic status of the origin family affects the likelihood of marriage and cohabitation. For example, Schoen et al. (in press) show that among White and Black women, higher maternal education is associated with fewer transitions to cohabitation and marriage in young adulthood. It is also well documented that children who experienced parental divorce or lived in a stepfamily are more likely to form marital or cohabiting unions early than those from intact two-biological-parent families (Michael & Tuma, 1985) . Family structure is a four-category variable: two biological parents, stepfamily, single parent family, and other family. It is important to note that the Asian sample is largely made up of first-and second-generation individuals (90% versus 5% for Whites), whereas the majority of Whites are third or higher generation (95% versus 10% for Asians). Because generation status overlaps so fully with race (see Table 1 Have you ever had sexual intercourse? (3) Not counting the people you have described as romantic relationships, have you ever had a sexual relationship with anyone?\nEducational investment is measured with two time-varying variables: highest degree attained and school enrollment status at each age. The dates of degree completion (e.g., high school degree and college degree) were matched with the century month of each birthday to determine the highest degree attained at the beginning of each age. School enrollment status is a dichotomous variable indicating whether a respondent is currently enrolled or not. This variable was constructed with a procedure outlined in Amato et al. (2008) ."}, {"section_title": "Missing Data and Complex Survey Design", "text": "Missing data were handled with the multiple imputation procedure (Proc MI) in SAS.

Finally, we utilize the Clogg test (Clogg et al. 1995) to determine whether coefficient changes across models are statistically significant. Finally, the panel for time-varying educational investments demonstrates that Asian American adolescents are less likely to have no degree and more likely to be currently enrolled in school. This pattern was observed for both the transition to first marriage and the first cohabitation data files. Table 3 focuses on entry into cohabitation. As shown in Model 1, Asian American youth are less likely to enter cohabitation in early adulthood than are White youth (OR=0.51, p<.001), and this negative relationship is stronger than that observed for marriage in Model 1 of Table 2 . The lower likelihood of cohabitation for Asian Americans persists across models."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Statistics", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Transition to First Marriage", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Transition to First Cohabitation", "text": "Models 2 through 4 show that higher maternal education reduces the odds of forming a cohabiting union in early adulthood, but in Model 5 (which adds adolescent sexual and romantic relationship experience) maternal education is no longer significant. This pattern indicates that maternal education affects cohabitation in part through adolescents' intimate relationship experiences. The full model (Model 6) shows that those most likely to cohabit are individuals from stepfamilies, single-parent families or \"other\" families, those who indicated in adolescence that they would consider childbearing as an unmarried person, and those who had romantic and sexual relationships in adolescence. Cohabitation is less common among men and women who were raised by more religious parents and those who were still enrolled in school. According to the Clogg test for the significance of changes in coefficients across models, the Asian-White difference in the odds of cohabitation is reduced significantly by the inclusion of measures of family socialization and adolescent intimate relationship experience. It becomes nonsignificant once the measures of educational engagement are added. Finally, none of the six interaction terms was significant.\nContrary to our expectations, family values do not seem to have a stronger influence on the likelihood of early cohabitation among Asian Americans than among Whites."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This study investigated the processes underlying the low rates of early union formation among Asian Americans relative to Whites. Five research hypotheses were proposed and tested. The first hypothesis was that parental values partially explain Asian-White differences in union formation.\nThis hypothesis received support in models of cohabitation, but not in models of marriage. The Asian-White difference in cohabitation was significantly reduced when measures of family socialization were added to a model that included only sociodemographic controls. The second hypothesis was that differences between Asian American and White youth's values regarding sex partially account for Asian-White differences in the risk of early union formation. This hypothesis was not supported for either marriage or cohabitation. Due to limitations in sample size and the number of events, we also could not investigate differences in union formation patterns of Asian subgroups.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first empirical study based on a national sample of a recent cohort of Asian American youth to examine the formation of both marital and cohabiting unions with a conceptual framework that incorporates multiple sets of predictors. The results reveal that Asian American young adults are less likely than White youth to enter marriage or cohabitation in early adulthood. The findings also highlight the importance of value socialization for Asian Americans' lower likelihood of early marriage, as well as sexual and romantic relationship experiences for the timing of cohabitation and marriage. Given the rapid growth of the Asian American population, we hope the current study will elicit further efforts to understand the family processes and behaviors of this growing minority group in the United States.
