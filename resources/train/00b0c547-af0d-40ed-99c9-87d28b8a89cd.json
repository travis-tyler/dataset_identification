[{"section_title": "", "text": "Retirement among scientists and engineers with doctoral degrees has important consequences for the science, engineering, and health (SEH) labor force. Retirements can mean loss of significant amounts of human capital, depleting an organization's ability to carry out its work; however, retirement of older individuals opens opportunities for younger scientists and engineers. Debates over the pros and cons of later retirement have been particularly evident within higher education. Federal legislation prohibiting mandatory retirement was passed in 1986, but postsecondary institutions were given a special allowance to maintain the practice for tenured faculty aged 70 and older until 1994 (Clark and Hammond 2001). 2 This allowance was sought by many leaders in higher education because of concern that the tight academic labor market of the late 1980s would become even more severe, with a resulting loss of new hires from deferred retirements as well as increased salary costs (Ehrenberg 2001). More than a decade after the end of mandatory retirement, the concern persistsrightly or wrongly-that retirement ages have increased while the proportions of new doctorate recipients taking postdoctoral or temporary faculty appointments have grown (Beckham 2003, Fogg 2005. Tracking retirement is a challenge because many individuals continue to work in another capacity after officially retiring from one job, and others move in and out of retirement in the same type of job. In this report, retired individuals are those whose most recent employment was in a postsecondary institution and are not working because they have retired, and those who have retired but are working part time in any sector. 3 It does not include individuals who retired from a postsecondary institution and later returned to full-time employment in any sector."}, {"section_title": "Age Distribution and Retirement Trends in Postsecondary Institutions", "text": "The number of SEH doctorate recipients employed by postsecondary institutions increased by 26% (from 221,790 to 279,550) between 1993 and 2003.

"}, {"section_title": "Retirement and Type of Postsecondary Institution", "text": "Individuals' decisions about when to retire are likely to be affected by various aspects of their current employment situation, future prospects, and the type of institution where they are employed. The most widely used classification system for colleges and universities is the Carnegie classification, 5 which defines a distinct class of such institutions based on institutional mission and organization. Work demands, particularly the balance of research and teaching responsibilities, generally differ among institutional types. Salary and benefits also have been shown to vary among types of institutions (Cataldi, Fahimi, and Bradburn 2005). These differences likely factor into individuals' retirement decisions and may show up in retirement-rate differences among types of institutions. One hypothesis is that the end of mandatory retirement in higher education would have the greatest impact on retirements among faculty at research universities. This is based on the idea that faculty who tend to be the most NOTES: Postsecondary institutions include 2-year and 4-year colleges and universities, medical schools, and university-affiliated research institutes. % retired includes individuals not working because they have retired and those who have retired but are working part-time in any sector.

On the other hand, faculty at research universities tend to be the highest paid members of academia and would be the best able to afford retirement (Cataldi, Fahimi, and Bradburn 2005). Age-specific retirement rates for the doctoral SEH labor force from the three largest types of academic institutions and all other postsecondary institutions are shown in table 2. In both 1993 and 2003, SEH doctorate recipients currently or previously employed in research universities had lower retirement rates within each age grouping than did their counterparts in other institutions, but the differences were generally not statistically significant at the 5% significance level. Among the 71-75 age group, the 2003 retirement rate was lower than in 1993. There were no significant differences between 1993 and 2003 for the 71-75 age group by type of institution."}, {"section_title": "Retirements by Doctoral Fields of Study", "text": "Another aspect of academic employment relevant to retirement decisions is likely to be the individual's field of doctorate. Fields have different labor markets, compensation levels, and mobility options. They also differ in the organization and technical infrastructure required to conduct research, and such differences could be factors in retirement decisions. Scientific fields not requiring large teams and laboratory equipment may be more conducive to rewarding participation by older individuals. Retirement rates by field of doctorate are examined here only for individuals currently or most recently employed in research and doctorate-granting universities and only for 1993 and 2003. The results indicate that the overall decline from 1993 to 2003 in retirement rates among the 71-75 age group was not concentrated within one or another of these broad disciplinary groupings (table 3). Among all retired individuals between The End of Mandatory Retirement for Doctoral Scientists and Engineers... 4 56-75 years of age, there was a statistically significant drop in the retirement rate between 1993 and 2003 only for biological, agricultural, and health sciences doctorate recipients (from 39.8% to 33.7%). 6"}, {"section_title": "Retirements by Sex", "text": "Another possible source of difference in retirement rates among scientists and engineers working in educational institutions is their sex. From a financial standpoint, women may find it more difficult to retire due to having average career earnings lower than those of men (National Science Foundation 2006). Some women also may delay retirement relative to men because of better health and longer life expectancies, or because they have a later schedule for career goals than their male counterparts as a result of family-related commitments made at earlier career stages (Mason and Goulden 2004). In 2003 the percentage of men over the age of 55 who had retired was about 10 percentage points higher than the comparable percentage of women (table 4). In 1993 the difference was 4 percentage points. The larger difference in 2003 compared with 1993 between men and women in the over-55 age group reflected in part a higher representation of women in the youngest age cohort, where retirement rates are lower."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "This InfoBrief uses data from the National Science Foundation's Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR). The SDR is a biennial survey of doctoral recipients in science, engineering, and health that began in 1973. The focus of this panel survey is on the labor force experiences of this population and how those experiences change over the course of individual careers and across historical cohorts. The 1993-2003 SDR surveys were administered to a nationally representative sample of about 40,000-50,000 science, engineering, and health doctorate recipients from U.S. universities who were residing in the United States. The sample frame for the SDR is built from the Doctorate Records File (DRF), which includes all research doctorate recipients and information on their educational and demographic characteristics from U.S. universities from 1920 to the present. Since 1958 the DRF has been updated annually with data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), a census of new doctorate recipients sponsored by NSF and other federal agencies. The SDR sample is augmented every 2 years with members of the new U.S. doctorates cohorts surveyed by the SED, and sample members are retired   NOTES: Postsecondary institutions include 2-year and 4-year colleges and universities, medical schools, and university-affiliated research institutes. % retired includes individuals not working because they have retired and those who have retired but are working parttime in any sector.
