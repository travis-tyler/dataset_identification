[{"section_title": "", "text": "American Indian and Alaska Native young children and families possess some important advantages in comparison to other rural children and families. Rural AI-AN parents in the ECLS-K were significantly more likely to indicate or exhibit positive parenting skills: \u2022 Positive discipline: Rural AI-AN parents were significantly more likely than all other subgroups to report using positive discipline exclusively in response to their children hitting them (see Figure 1). \u2022 Parental warmth: Rural AI-AN parents (76.1%) were about as likely as rural Non-Hispanic white (hereafter white) parents (77.8%) and more likely than other subgroups to exhibit high levels of parental warmth. \u2022 Parental aggravation: Rural AI-AN parents (8.0%) showed similar levels of parental aggravation as rural white parents (7.6%) and were significantly less likely than rural Non-Hispanic black (hereafter black) parents (16.8%) to report high levels of aggravation. ECLS Kindergarten Cohort or ECLS-K. The NCES launched a second study of a group, known as the ECLS Birth Cohort or ECLS-B, in 2001 when the children in that national sample were an average of 9 months old. The National Center for Rural Early Childhood Learning Initiatives at Mississippi State University, known as Rural Early Childhood, commissioned the nonpartisan research organization Child Trends to conduct such an analysis of the ECLS-K and ECLS-B baseline data, focusing on selected indicators related to child and family health and socioeconomic status and children's readiness for school. It is important to note that this analysis does not examine whether family poverty or parental education, rather than rurality, is the key factor related in the disparities."}, {"section_title": "Findings", "text": "Overall, the baseline data in the ECLS-K and ECLS-B suggest that AI-AN children in rural America differed significantly from AI-AN children in nonrural areas and from rural children in other ethnic subgroups on numerous indicators.  .  1  e  r  u  g  i  F  s  r  e  n  e  t  r  a  g  r  e  d  n  i  k  l  a  r  u  r  f  o  e  g  a  t  n  e  c  r  e  P  e  n  i  l  p  i  c  s  i  d  e  v  i  t  i  s  o  p  g  n  i  s  u  t  r  o  p  e  r  s  t  n  e  r  a  p  e  s  o  h  w  l  a  r  u  R  :  e  c  r  u  o  S  (  .  y  t  i  c  i  n  h  t  e  y  b  ,  y  l  e  v  i  s  u  l  c  x  e  d  l  i  h  C  d  n  a  d  o  o  h  d  l  i  h  C  y  l  r  a  E  l  a  r  u  R  y  b  s  i  s  y  l  a .  1  e  r  u  g  i  F  s  r  e  n  e  t  r  a  g  r  e  d  n  i  k  l  a  r  u  r  f  o  e  g  a  t  n  e  c  r  e  P  e  n  i  l  p  i  c  s  i  d  e  v  i  t  i  s  o  p  g  n  i  s  u  t  r  o  p  e  r  s  t  n  e  r  a  p  e  s  o  h  w  l  a  r  u  R  :  e  c  r  u  o  S  (  .  y  t  i  c  i  n  h  t  e  y  b  ,  y  l  e      Rural AI-AN parents in the ECLS-B were more likely to exhibit positive parenting skills, during observation, than other rural parents: \u2022 Encouraged play: Rural AI-AN parents were more likely than rural black and Hispanic parents to provide toys or interesting activities for their babies (see Figure 2). \u2022 Allowed exploration: Rural AI-AN parents were less likely than rural white and Hispanic parents to interfere with or restrict their babies' actions or exploration at least three times during an observation (see Figure 3). Rural life appears to offer some benefits for AI-AN children and their families in comparison to nonrural life: \u2022 Head Start participation: Rural AI-AN kindergarteners were more likely than non-rural AI-AN kindergarteners to have attended a Head Start program (39.1% vs. 14.1%). \u2022 Attendance at full-day kindergarten: Rural AI-AN kindergarteners were more likely than non-rural AI-AN kindergarteners to be enrolled in a full-day kindergarten program (89.8% vs. 37.8%). For some indicators, however, rural life is related to significant risk factors for school success for AI-AN young children: \u2022 Poverty: Rural AI-AN kindergarteners were more than twice as likely as non-rural AI-AN kindergarteners to live below the poverty threshold (60.5% vs. 23.1%). \u2022 Parental education: Rural AI-AN kindergarteners were only about a third as likely as non-rural AI-AN kindergarteners to have a parent with a bachelor's degree or higher degree (7.8% vs. 26.4%). \u2022 Parents reading to children: Rural AI-AN kindergarteners were less likely than non-rural AI-AN kindergarteners to have a parent who read to them three or more times per week (60.5% vs. 82.7%). \u2022 Children reading to selves: Rural AI-AN kindergarteners were less likely than non-rural AI-AN kindergarteners to read to themselves outside school three or more times per week (58.2% vs. 82.4%).  .  3  e  r  u  g  i  F  e  s  o  h  w  s  e  i  b  a  b  l  a  r  u  r  f  o  e  g  a  t  n  e  c  r  e  P  s  n  o  i  t  c  a  s  '  d  l  i  h  c  d  e  t  c  i  r  t  s  e  r  r  o  d  e  r  e  f  r  e  t  n  i  s  r  e  h  t  o  m  .  y  t  i  c  i  n  h  t  e  y  b  ,  s  e  m  i  t  e  e  r  h  t  t  s  a  e  l  t  a  n  o  i  t  a  r  o  l  p  x  e  r  o  y  l  r  a  E  l  a  r  u  R  y  b  s  i  s  y  l  a  n  A  l  a  r  u  R  :  e  c  r  u  o .  4  e  r  u  g  i  F  s  e  i  b  a  b  l  a  r  u  r  f  o  e  g  a  t  n  e  c  r  e  P  c  i  n  h  t  e  y  b  ,  d  e  k  o  m  s  y  l  t  n  e  r  r  u  c  s  r  e  h  t  o  m  r  a  E  l  a  r  u  R  y  b  s  i  s  y  l  a  n  A  l  a  r  u  R  :  e  c  r  u  o  S  (  S  L  C  E  f  o  s  d  n  e  r  T  d  l    \u2022 Social competence: Rural AI-AN kindergarteners were less likely than non-rural AI-AN kindergarteners to very often exhibit social competence, according to parents' ratings of their children's ease in joining play, making and keeping friends, and interacting positively with other children (38.8% vs. 53.8%). \u2022 Self-control: Rural AI-AN kindergarteners were less likely than non-rural AI-AN kindergarteners to very often exhibit self-control, as reflected in their respect for the property rights of others, control of their tempers, and acceptance of peer ideas for group activities (19.9% vs. 37.3%). \u2022 Internalizing behavior problems: Rural AI-AN kindergarteners were more likely than non-rural AI-AN kindergarteners to exhibit internalizing behavior such as episodic stomachaches in response to change (10.8% vs. 4.9%). \u2022 Externalizing behavior problems: Rural AI-AN kindergarteners were more likely than non-rural AI-AN kindergarteners to exhibit externalizing behavior such as routinely taking toys from other children and trying to hide their actions when questioned (15.3% vs. 7.3%). AI-AN young children and families, in comparison with other rural young children and families, are at a disadvantage in terms of certain health risks and early literacy skills: \u2022 Breastfeeding: In the ECLS-B, rural AI-AN mothers (8.8%) were significantly less likely than rural white (25.6%) or Hispanic mothers (23.6%) to currently be breastfeeding their babies. \u2022 Second-hand smoke exposure: In the ECLS-B, rural AI-AN babies were significantly more likely than rural black and Hispanic children to be exposed to smoking in the home (see Figure 4). There was no significant difference between AI-AN and white babies on this measure. \u2022 Parental alcohol use: In the ECLS-B, rural AI-AN babies were significantly more likely than rural black babies to have mothers who drank in the 3 months before pregnancy (see Figure 5). There was no significant difference between AI-AN and white or Hispanic babies on this measure. \u2022 Letter recognition: Rural AI-AN children in the ECLS-K were significantly less likely than rural white or black children to be proficient at letter recognition (see Figure 6).  .  5  e  r  u  g  i  F  e  s  o  h  w  s  e  i  b  a  b  l  a  r  u  r  f  o  e  g  a  t  n  e  c  r  e  P  e  r  o  f  e  b  s  h  t  n  o  m  3  e  h  t  n  i  k  n  a  r  d  s  r  e  h  t  o  m  l  a  r  u  R  :  e  c  r  u  o  S  (  .  y  t  i  c  i  n  h  t  e  y  b  ,  y  c  n  a  n  g  e  r  p  d  l  i  h  C  d  n  a  d  o  o  h  d  l  i  h  C  y  l  r  a  E  l  a  r  u  R  y  b  s  i  s  y  l  a .  6  e  r  u  g  i  F  e  d  n  i  k  l  a  r  u  r  f  o  e  g  a  t  n  e  c  r  e  P  e  l  t  a  y  c  n  e  i  c  i  f  o  r  p  d  e  t  a  r  t  s  n  o  m  e  d  t  a  h  t  b  ,  y  r  t  n  e  n  e  t  r  a  g  r  e  d  n  i  k  t  a  n  o  i  t  i  n  g  o  c  e  r  E  l  a  r  u  R  y  b  s  i  s  y  l  a  n  A  l  a  r  u  R  :  e .  7  e  r  u  g  i  F  s  r  e  n  e  t  r  a  g  r  e  d  n  i  k  l  a  r  u  r  f  o  e  g  a  t  n  e  c  r  e  P  g  n  i  n  n  i  g  e  b  t  a  y  c  n  e  i  c  i  f  o  r  p  d  e  t  a  r  t  s  n  o  m  e  d  t  a  h  t  y  b  ,  y  r  t  n  e  n  e  t  r  a  g  r  e  d  n  i  k  t  a  n  o  i  t  i  n  g  o  c  e  r  d  n  u  o  s  l  a  r  u  R  y  b  s  i  s  y  l  a  n  A  l  a  r  u  R  :  e  c  r  u  o  S  (  .  y  t .  8  e  r  u  g  i  F  s  e  i  b  a  b  l  a  r  u  r  f  o  e  g  a  t  n  e  c  r  e  P  c  f  o  m  r  o  f  y  r  a  m  i  r  p  s  i  e  r  a  c  e  v  i  t  a  l  e  r  -n  o  n  s  i  s  y  l  a  n  A  l  a  r  u  R  :  e  c  r  u  o  S  (  .  y  t  i  c  i  n  h  t  e  y  b  f  o  s  d  n  e  r  T  d  l  i  h  C  d  n  a  d  o  o  h  d  l  i  h  C  y  l  r  a  E   5 \u2022 Beginning sound recognition: Rural AI-AN children in the ECLS-K were less than one-fourth as likely as rural white children to be proficient at beginning sound recognition (see Figure 7). Although rural AI-AN children were more likely than their non-rural counterparts to participate in Head Start, overall, rural AI-AN children were more likely to be in parental care or care by a relative, than in a center-based program, in the year before kindergarten: \u2022 Parental care only: Almost half of rural AI-AN babies were in no care outside the home (44.2%). \u2022 Care by relatives: Of rural babies who received care by a relative other than a parent, the rate was significantly higher for AI-AN babies than for white or Hispanic babies (42.5%). \u2022 Non-relative care: Only 5.1% of rural AI-AN babies were cared for by a non-relative (see Figure 8). \u2022 Center-based pre-kindergarten care: Rural AI-AN children in the ECLS-K were less than one-third as likely as rural white children to have attended a center-based pre-kindergarten program (10.6% for AI-AN children vs. 35.3% for white children)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Comparisons of rural AI-AN young children to non-rural AI-AN young children and to rural young children in other ethnic subgroups, in the Kindergarten and Birth Cohorts of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, reveal that rural life is associated with some positive indicators for AI-AN children, particularly in the area of parental warmth and positive discipline. Rural AI-AN children and their families also were more likely than their non-rural counterparts to receive WIC, participate in Head Start, and participate in full-day kindergarten. However, rural life is associated with wide disparities for AI-AN children, in comparison with their non-rural counterparts, on indicators of behavior problems and social competence as well as being read to and reading outside of school. Rural AI-AN children and their families particularly differed from other subgroups of rural children on indicators of health-related behavior such as breast-feeding and exposure to second-hand smoke and indicators of early literacy development such as letter recognition."}]
