It focuses on bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees earned by black Americans. It also examines the advancement, or lack thereof, of black faculty members. The study uses data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data Series and the Survey of Doctorial Recipients. The following observations are select summaries of the study. \u2022 The number of black Americans awarded bachelor's degrees increased 73 percent compared to 25 percent for non-black Americans. At the doctorate level, black Americans had an increase of 56 percent compared to 6 percent for non-black Americans. \u2022 Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) increased both the number of degrees they awarded and the diversity of their student body at the bachelor's and doctorate degree levels. The increase in bachelor's degrees at HBCUs was 39 percent compared to 33 percent for all schools. At the doctoral level, HBCUs had a 67 percent increase compared to 14 percent for all schools. \u2022 Although only 3.3 percent of all the institutions, HBCUs awarded nearly 50 percent of all bachelor's degrees received by black students in the natural and physical sciences, a little more than 25 percent of all bachelor's degrees in engineering, and nearly 25 percent of all bachelor's degrees awarded to black Americans. \u2022 Blacks with doctorates are more likely to be employed in colleges and universities than non-black Americans. Blacks make up less than 5 percent of the total faculty in colleges and universities. viii Younger blacks with doctorates do not appear to face the same barriers to promotions as did older blacks with doctorates. Although this study includes National Science Foundation (NSF) data, this usage does not imply NSF endorsement of the research methods or the conclusions contained in this report. ix ACKNOWLEDGMENTS T he editors would like to express their deepest gratitude to the NAFEO board of directors, the members, and the staff for their support and assistance in completing this publication.

Founded in 1969 by a group of presidents of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, NAFEO is \"the voice for blacks in higher education.\" The association represents the presidents and chancellors of all the nation's black colleges and universities: public, private and land-grant, two-year, four-year, graduate and professional, historically and predominantly black colleges and universities. Whether an institution is one of the 39 private black colleges and universities that belong to UNCF, one of the 47 public colleges and universities that belong to the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund; one of the 18 land-grant universities or 19 other public universities that belong to the National Association of State Universities and Land-grant Colleges' Office for the Advancement of Public Black Colleges; a black 2-year institution that belongs to the American Association of Community Colleges, or one of the emerging predominately black universities and colleges, the institution has a voice and a vote in NAFEO. It was founded to provide an international voice for the nation's HBCUs; to place and maintain the issue of equal opportunity in higher education on the national agenda; to advocate policies, programs and practices designed to preserve and enhance HBCUs, and to increase the active participation of blacks at every level in the formulation and implementation of policies and programs in American higher education."}, {"section_title": "NAFEO's MISSION", "text": "\u2022 To champion the interests of historically and predominantly black colleges and universities; xii \u2022 To provide services to NAFEO members; \u2022 To build the capacity of HBCUs, their executives, administrators, faculty, staff and students; \u2022 To serve as an international voice and advocate for the preservation and enhancement of historically and predominantly black colleges and universities and for blacks in higher education."}, {"section_title": "NAFEO's VISION:", "text": "To be the leading and most respected advocate for historically and predominately black colleges and universities, and for blacks in higher education, serving our members professionally, effectively, and efficiently. xiii"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION Lezli Baskerville, J.D.

With generous support from the Lumina Foundation for Education, The State of Blacks in Higher Education is an important document for researchers, policy makers and shapers, university administrators, and those in the corporate and social sectors who are interested in understanding how blacks are faring across the higher education spectrum. This report describes the tremendous progress that blacks have made in achieving higher education over the last twenty years, and it explains what needs to be done to see this progress continue. In short, The State of Blacks in Higher Education is an essential tool in ensuring excellence and equity in postsecondary education. The State of Blacks in Higher Education examines black progress in higher education from bachelor's degree attainment through the tenure track. As you will see in the publication, blacks are achieving higher education in unprecedented numbers. There is still, however, much to be done to ensure that the institutions that are serving minority, low-income, and firstgeneration students are receiving their fair share of funding from state and federal governments. You will also learn about the tremendous work that our nation's black colleges are doing to provide educational opportunities not just for black students, but for any student who walks through their doors. Black colleges are the nation's quintessential equal opportunity institutions, and The State of Blacks in Higher Education demonstrates the importance of these schools in filling the gap that has been created as the costs of higher education continue to soar and access is denied to all but the most privileged. In addition to producing a disproportionate share of black graduates in all fields, The State xiv of Blacks in Higher Education describes how black colleges are also doing well as educating nonblack and foreign students. Some of the report's major findings include: \u2022 During 1996During -2005, the number of degrees awarded to blacks across all discipline groupings increased. \u2022 HBCUs increased the number of bachelor's degrees awarded from 1986-1995 to 1996-2005 by 39% compared to a 29% increase in degrees awarded by all schools. \u2022 Of the master's degrees awarded in engineering, the physical and natural sciences, and the life and medical sciences from HBCUs, over 25 percent were earned by nonblack citizens. \u2022 Black citizens increased the number of doctorates earned from 1986-1995 to 1995-2005 by 56 percent. The importance of higher education in creating a globally competitive workforce is undeniable. It is imperative that our students acquire the skills to succeed in the twenty-first century economy. The State of Blacks in Higher Education provides a basis for those committed to minority student access and success in higher education to develop sound policies and best practices for increasing achievement in college and beyond. I invite you to learn more about NAFEO and its research through The State of Blacks in Higher Education."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER ONE", "text": "Bachelor's to Doctorates: Who Gave and Who Got Them? T his report provides an overview of the status of blacks in higher education. It addresses the number and proportion of bachelor's, master's and doctorates awarded to black Americans, non-black Americans and non-Americans between 1986 and 2005. Additionally, this report describes the representation of black men and women in faculty positions in academe, with a focus on career paths, rank and salary. In 1994 Robert Bruce Slater reported in the Journal of Negro Education that by the end of the Civil War, only 40 blacks had been awarded bachelor's degrees from colleges and universities located in the United States. 2 These 40 degrees did not include bachelor's degrees awarded by Wilberforce University or Lincoln University, two of the nation's oldest historically black institutions. 3 Additionally, the Slater report found that by 1900 the number of blacks with a bachelor's degree had increased to nearly 400. According to the 2006 Current Population Survey, nearly 13 percent of the black U.S. population had a bachelor's degree (roughly 2.72 million people) and 6 percent of blacks held an advanced degree (approximately 1.25 million people). The chart on page 2 plots the percentage of black men and women who completed at least four years of college from 1960 through 2006. According to this chart, the percentage of men and women who are college graduates, or have completed at least four years of college, follows similar paths until 1996 when the gap between men and women widens in favor of women.  1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2008 Statistical Abstract: The National Data Book.

Specifically, it analyzes degrees earned by citizenship, race, gender, all-schools and at HBCUs in engineering, humanities, natural and physical sciences, social sciences, life and medical sciences, business and law and education. Our data set is the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System Completions Survey by Race, accessed by way of WebCASPAR. Table 1 illustrates the degree attainment of black men and women. For the decade 1986-1995, black men earned degrees in engineering and life and medical sciences at more than twice the rate of black women. However, black men lagged behind black women in degrees earned in the humanities, natural and physical sciences, social sciences, business and law, and education. This pattern is not replicated among non-black Americans or non-Americans, with the exception that men in both of these categories earned degrees in engineering at much higher rates than women. As a group, the bachelor's degrees awarded to black Americans were 4 percent of engineering, humanities and education degrees, 7 percent of natural and physical sciences, social sciences, and business and law degrees, and 6 percent of the life and medical sciences degrees. The share of bachelor's 3 degrees awarded to blacks in engineering is smaller than those awarded to non-Americans. However, blacks exceeded the share of bachelor's degrees awarded to non-Americans in all other discipline groupings. The number of bachelor's degrees awarded by HBCUs follows the pattern for all schools. Men earned more bachelor's degrees than women in engineering, but earn fewer bachelor's degrees than women in all other disciplines. A closer look at the bachelor's degrees awarded by HBCUs shows that nearly one in four bachelor's degrees awarded in engineering and the life and medical sciences was awarded to non-black Americans (14 percent and 19 percent, respectively) or non-Americans (10 percent and 5 percent). HBCUs awarded nearly 50 percent of all bachelor's degrees to blacks in the natural and physical sciences, and a little more than 25 percent of all bachelor's degrees awarded to blacks were in engineering. Although they represent only 3.3 percent of all institutions of higher education, HBCUs awarded nearly 25 percent of all bachelor's degrees earned by blacks. During the decade of 1986-1995, of the top 10 schools that awarded bachelor's degrees to blacks in engineering, HBCUs held six of the 10, all 10 slots for women and nine of the 10 slots for men for natural and physical science bachelor's degrees, five of the 10 slots for bachelor's degrees awarded in the social sciences for both men and women, four of the 10 slots for women, and three of the 10 slots for men for bachelor's degrees in the humanities, and six of the 10 slots for women, and eight of 10 slots for men in the life and medical sciences. On average, the schools on the top 10 lists awarded 10 percent of all bachelor's degrees given to black Americans. During 1996-2005, the number of degrees awarded to blacks across all discipline groupings increased. Relative to 1986-1995, the number of bachelor's degrees awarded to black men in the humanities more than doubled and nearly doubled for black women in the social sciences. The widening in the gap between men and women, shown in the chart on page 2, seems to be driven by the massive increase in bachelor's degrees earned by black women in the social sciences relative to men. From 1986-1995, black men earned more than twice as many bachelor's degrees in the life and medical sciences as women. However, by the 1996-2005 decade, women earned nearly four times as many bachelor's degrees in the life and medical sciences. The number of bachelor's degrees earned by black women in the social sciences from 1996-2005 nearly exceeded the total number of bachelor's degrees earned by black men during that same time period. Black women increased their share of bachelor's degrees in engineering, as did women in general. The 73 percent growth in bachelor's degrees from 1986-1995 to 1996-2005 for black women and men exceeds the rate of growth for non-black Americans by 25 percent. HBCUs increased the number of bachelor's degrees awarded from 1986-1995 to 1996-2005 by 39 percent, compared to a 29 percent increase in degrees awarded by all schools. Over the same period, the number of non-black Americans earning degrees in engineering and life and medical sciences at HBCUs decreased by 39 percent and 50 percent, respectively. The decrease in bachelor's degrees awarded in engineering, the natural and physical sciences, and life and medical sciences by HBCUs to non-black Americans was offset by nearly a 100 percent increase in bachelor's degrees awarded in the humanities, and a nearly a 425 percent increase in bachelor's degrees awarded in the natural and physical sciences. HBCUs had a 29 percent increase in the number of degrees awarded to non-black Americans, compared with a 25 percent growth for all schools. HBCUs also continued to have strong representation in the top 10 schools producing black bachelor's degrees for the 1995-2005 decade. Morgan State University and Florida A&M University joined the top 10 list, increasing the number of HBCUs in the top 10 from six to seven. In the natural and physical sciences, Florida A&M University, Tennessee State University and Morgan State University joined the top 10 list for black women; for black men, Benedict College and City University of New York City joined the top 10 list. The number of HBCUs in the top 10 also increased for the life and medical sciences, as Southern University joined the top 10 for both women and men, and Morehouse College and Tennessee State University joined the top 10 for men. The top 10 schools in the social sciences and humanities for both black men and women changed a bit during the 1986-1995 and 1996-2006 decades, but the number-one schools-Morehouse College and Spelman College-remained the same. HBCUs had decreased representation in the top 10 lists for the humanities and social science. Over the 20 years analyzed, the percentage of degrees awarded to blacks by the top 10 schools decreased less than 3 percent on average, suggesting that black Americans are attending a broader range of colleges and universities. The Georgia Institute of Technology, for example, is ranked high on the engineering list. This may be explained by the development of the dualdegree program with the schools in the Atlanta University Center.    "}, {"section_title": "Master's Degrees Awarded", "text": "Trends in degrees conferred at the master's level is similar to that at the bachelor's level. During the decade 1986-1995, black men earned more than twice the number of master's degrees in engineering than those earned by black women in that discipline. However, black women earned more master's degrees in the social sciences, education, and life and medical sciences than black men. Black women earned fewer master's degrees than men in the natural and physical sciences and in business and law. Overall, blacks have received a smaller share of degrees awarded at the master's level than at the bachelor's level. This is also true of non-black Americans. Non-Americans increased their share of master's degrees relative to bachelor's degrees (see Table 3). More than 25 percent of the master's degrees awarded by HBCUs in engineering, the physical and natural sciences, and the life and medical sciences were earned by non-black Americans from 1986 to 1995. In general, 29 percent of the master's degrees awarded by HBCUs were earned by nonblack Americans. Non-Americans received 8 percent of the degrees awarded by HBCUs. These numbers suggest that more than one-third of the master's degrees granted by HBCUs were awarded to non-black Americans or to non-Americans. During the 1996-2005 decade, blacks doubled their share of master's degrees. Although black men and women earned approximately the same number of master's degrees during the 1986-1995 decade-similar to the degree gap at the bachelor's level-black women earned more than twice as many master's degrees as black men earned during the 1996-2005 decade. The percent of master's degrees awarded to non-black Americans and non-Americans from HBCUs remained relatively unchanged from the 1986-1995 decade to the 1996-2005 decade, 26 percent and 5 percent respectively. Women who were non-black Americans earned twice as many master's degrees from HBCUs than non-black Americans men. Of the master's degrees awarded to non-black Americans, 96 percent were in the social sciences, life and medical sciences, law and business, and education. Of the master's degrees awarded to non-Americans, 72 percent were in the same disciplines. However, from the 1986-1995 decade to the 1996-2005 decade, HBCUs increased the percentage of master's degrees awarded to black Americans. The number of master's degrees awarded to black Americans nearly doubled during the decades analyzed in this report. The growth in the number of master's degrees awarded to Americans by HBCUs suggests some key trends. Black Americans are increasing their credentials to remain competitive in the ever-changing global economy. In addition, the graduate programs at HBCUs are competitive and large shares of the students they serve are non-black, resulting in a diverse graduate student population. Also, the master's degrees awarded by HBCUs may serve as \"training\" or \"skill\" development degrees for those interested in pursuing the doctorate."}, {"section_title": "Doctorate Degrees Awarded", "text": "Unlike the bachelor's and master's degrees, the doctorate signals a level of \"expertise\" that expands employment opportunities to include think tanks, research laboratories, and colleges and universities. We have a particular interest in the number of doctorates awarded to black Americans because of the potential impact in the college classroom and diversity in higher education. For the 1986-1995 decade, black Americans earned 3 percent of the doctorates awarded, compared to 71 percent by non-black Americans and 26 percent by non-Americans. Black Americans hold 8 percent of the doctorates awarded in education and 4 percent of the doctorates awarded in the social sciences. The representation of black Americans in the remaining discipline groups is between 1 and 2 percent. This is drastically lower than the representation of non-black Americans and non-Americans in the remaining discipline (see Table 4). Black Americans increased the number of doctorates earned from 1986-1995 to 1995-2005 by 56 percent. Additionally, black Americans increased their share of doctorates in all discipline groupings. Black American women nearly doubled the number of doctorates earned during the 20-year time span. Again, there is a widening of the gap in degrees earned by black American women and black American men. Black American women earned nearly 40 percent more doctorates than did black American men. Nonetheless, black American men continued to earn more doctorates in engineering, natural and physical sciences, law and business than black American women. HBCUs also saw a 67-percent increase in the total number of doctorates awarded from 1986-1995 to 1996-2005. Over the 20 years analyzed, the diversity of the students receiving doctorates from HBCUs also increased from 16 percent to 21 percent among non-black Americans. However, the percentage of non-Americans decreased from 23 percent to 21 percent. Nearly 50 percent of the doctorates awarded in engineering for both decades were awarded to non-black Americans. HBCUs saw an increase in the percentage of doctorates awarded to non-black Americans in the natural and physical sciences, life and medical sciences, and education. It is important to note that for both decades the percentage of doctorates awarded to non-Americans from HBCUs mirror the percentage awarded to this group from all institutions. In fact, with the exception of education, the percentage of doctorates awarded to non-Americans from HBCUs is similar to the percentage awarded from all institutions. As with the master's degree, these results suggest that HBCUs are competitive in attracting non-black Americans at the doctorate level. Knowing the number of doctorates awarded to black Americans is important (see Table 5). So too is knowing the schools that are successful at educating black Americans at the doctorate level in order to build relationships to recruit a diverse faculty and workforce. For both decades, the Georgia Institute of Technology tops the engineering lists for both black American men and black American women. For both decades, Howard University is on the top 10 engineering list for black American men and is tied with Pennsylvania State University-College Station and Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the 1996-2005 decade. Howard University is on the top 10 lists for all disciplines, with the exception of law and business and of education. For black American men, Meharry Medical College is on the top 10 lists for life and medical sciences for both decades and on the top 10 lists for black American women for the 1996-2005 decade. Jackson State University is on the black American men top 10 lists for business and law for the 1996-2005 decade and is the only HBCU on the law and business top 10 lists for either decade. Clark Atlanta and Jackson State University are the only HBCUs on the education top 10 lists-for both black American men and women for the 1986-1995 decade, and black American women for the 1996-2005 decade. No school is on the top 10 lists for all disciplines for both decades. However, the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and Howard University are on more top 10 lists across disciplines than all other institutions.   T his chapter compares black PhDs with their non-black counterparts. Black American men are compared with non-black American men. Likewise, black American women are compared with non-black American women. The comparisons are conducted across and within groups, or cohorts, having certain statistical similarities such as the year members of the group received their PhDs. In these analyses, one cohort consists of men and women who received their doctorates between 1973-1982. Members of another cohort received their doctorates in the interval of 1983-1992. The final group in this study received their doctorates between 1993-2002. This study compared cohort members with other members in their cohort, or grouping, as well as members of other cohorts. Cohort members' responses were compared with other respondents at similar points in their careers across survey periods. Comparisons involved the use of cross-tabulations of numerous variables that resulted in the capture of the state of blacks in higher education. The data come from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) Doctoral Recipient files, which are a representative sample. Survey weights were used to obtain the populations. Data from the 1993 and 2003 SDR surveys were used for Cohorts 1 and 2. Only data from the 2003 SDR survey were used for Cohort 3. 1 The main variables of interest in both surveys are faculty rank, the field of highest degree, salary and age. The sample is limited to persons who are Americans, hold academic positions, and earned their doctorate in computer and math sciences; life and related sciences; physical and related sciences; social and related sciences; and engineering (hard and social sciences). 2 Table 6 presents the percentage of those in Cohort 1 who are holding college or university positions. In each table, an asterisk (*) represents a significant statistical difference at the 95 percent level, or more, between black men and non-black men or between black women and non-black women in the same survey. A cross ( \u2020) represents a significant statistical difference at the 95 percent level, or more, between a particular group from one survey to the next. 3 As the table shows, in both survey years, black men were significantly more likely to be employed in the academic world than non-black men. In the 2003 survey, black women were significantly more likely to be in academia than non-black women. Non-blacks in this cohort experienced significant decreases in their relative presence in colleges and universities, while black men and women did not.

Although black men and women were more likely to be in colleges and universities, they only represent 3 percent of the total doctorates from this cohort in the academy. Black men represented 3 percent of the men in both the 1993 survey and the 2003 survey. Black women represented 4 percent of the women in 1993 and 5 percent women in 2003. As a whole, in the hard and social sciences, blacks are underrepresented.

Table 8 displays the weighted means of age and experience of respondents to the 1993 survey. Black men doctoral recipients are significantly older than non-black men. Black women are not significantly different in age from non-black women. Black men and women have statistically more experience than non-black men and women. For black men, the reason more experience is there is that they are significantly older than non-black men. Black women have reported significantly more experience than non-black women without being significantly older.

Table 9 shows the proportion doctorates in the hard and social sciences at HBCUs in 2003. This data informs us that blacks are significantly more likely to be employed at HBCUs than non-blacks. Non-black Women Source: National Science Foundation, Survey of Doctoral Recipients: 1993Recipients: , 1995Recipients: , 1997Recipients: , 1999Recipients: , 2001Recipients: , and 2003. Table 10 represents doctoral degrees. Black men are significantly less likely to get a doctorate in computer and math sciences and physical and related sciences than non-black men, but are much more likely to get a degree in the social and related sciences. For women, there are no significant differences. There were no black women in the survey who hold an advanced degree in engineering in this cohort. Source: National Science Foundation, Survey of Doctoral Recipients: 1993Recipients: , 1995Recipients: , 1997Recipients: , 1999Recipients: , 2001Recipients: , and 2003 Tables 11 and 12 indicate faculty rank in 1993 and 2003, respectively. No testing is done on the other categories. \"CNT\" means that a test could not be performed on a category or for a particular group. If it could not be performed for a group it was due to the fact that the all-black group was not in the particular category. Tables 11 and 12 show there are no significant differences at any rank between blacks and non-blacks. Placing Table 11 with Table 12 shows the career progression over 10 years. Additionally, all groups except black women are more likely to be professors and less likely to be associate professors. Black men and women did not see statistically significant decrease in the percent of assistant professors. This seems to indicate that black women from this cohort are not progressing in terms of faculty rank at the same rate as other groups, or they are leaving the academy altogether. In Table 11, percentages will not add up to 100 because some survey respondents skipped this question.

Due to a large number of outliers, the focus is on medians. The table, however, shows the significance test for means. In both the 1993 and 2003 surveys, there are no significant statistical differences in the medians for black men and non-black men as there are for black women and nonblack women. When comparing changes in median salary between 1993 and 2003, we find that non-blacks experienced significant increases, but blacks did not. This suggests that for blacks in this cohort there were barriers to promotion.

Table 18 reports the percentage of members in each group in the field of their doctoral degree for Cohort 2. Non-black men statistically are significantly more likely than black men to obtain their doctorates in computer and math sciences and in physical and related sciences (the \"hard\" sciences). Non-black women also are more likely than black women to obtain their degree in life and related sciences and in physical and related sciences. All blacks are more likely than non-blacks to obtain their degree in social and related sciences.

Non-black men were significantly more likely than black men to state that rank is not applicable at their institution. For 2003, black men were more likely than non-black men to be instructors. Comparing the change in rank from 1993 to 2003, there are numerous improvements. Non-blacks are much less likely to state that tenure is not applicable for their position. All groups have experienced statistically significant increases in the number of professors and decrease in the number of assistant professors. Black women are the only group that did not experience a significant increase in the number of associate professors. For all groups in Cohort 2 there is progress in rank of professor and assistant professor over the 10-year span, which is not seen for Cohort 1. This suggests that the barriers faced by the older cohorts no longer exist, or do not affect the younger cohorts in the same manner.

The only significant difference in the median is that black women in 2003 have a higher median than non-black women. Due to the significant progress made by all groups in rank, there has been a statistically significant increase in the median salaries for all groups.

Additionally, Cohort 2 in 1993 and Cohort 3 in 2003 are compared when both groups are within a decade from receiving their doctorate. Across all cohorts, in 2003 blacks are more likely than non-blacks to be in colleges and universities. Comparing Cohort 1 in 1993 to Cohort 2 in 2003, and comparing Cohort 2 in 1993 to Cohort 3 in 2003-there are no significant differences. For the population numbers in the academy, there is an increase over time for all cohorts and groups. Black men doctorates do not increase as rapidly as black women from cohort to cohort. Furthermore, blacks are the only group in Cohort 3 in which the majority of those with doctorates in the academy are women. Black men generally are older in only Cohort 1. Comparing Cohort 2 in 2003 to Cohort 1 in 1993, and Cohort 3 in 2003 to Cohort 2 in 1993, Table 29 shows that non-black men and women are significantly older. This indicates that the age of PhD attainment is increasing for these groups. Blacks in all cohorts are more likely to work at an HBCU. In addition, across all cohorts, black men are more likely than non-black men to have obtained their degrees in social and related sciences and less likely to obtain their degree in physical and related sciences. For Cohorts 2 and Cohort 3, black women are more likely to have obtained their degree in social and related sciences and less likely to obtain a degree in life and related sciences, and physical and related sciences. Across cohorts, black and non-blacks have the same likelihood of reaching rank of professor, associate professor, and assistant professor. The lack of progression in rank for black women for Cohort 1 did not present itself for progress for Cohort 2 except in the rank of associate professor. Comparing Cohort 1 in 1993 to Cohort 2 in 2003, the only significant difference occurs for non-blacks. Those in Cohort 2 were more likely to say rank was not applicable for their position, assistant professor, and instructor, and less likely to have the rank of professor. There are only a few differences when comparing Cohort 3 in 2003 to Cohort 2 in 1993. All groups are more likely to be lecturers. Non-black men and women are more likely to say rank was not applicable for position and instructor. Non-black women are less likely to be associate professors. When comparing medians for Cohort 1 in 1993 to Cohort 2 in 2003, and Cohort 2 in 1993 to Cohort 3 in 2003, there are no significant differences."}, {"section_title": "Professional Transitions", "text": "This study looked at the overall professional advancement of black doctorial recipients-specifically at the probability of a black doctorial recipient moving among one of six mutually exclusive employment outcomes: postdoctoral fellowship, tenure-track faculty, adjunct faculty, academic research, other (academic administration, government, or industry position) and none (unemployed). To analyze the progression of black doctorial recipients we use transitional matrices, which calculate the probability of moving from any one of these employment outcomes to another. The data for this analysis is limited to doctorial recipients who completed the doctorate after 1973, completed the 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001 and 2003 Survey of Doctorial Recipients, were U.S. citizens in 1993, and earned their doctorate in computer and math sciences, life and related sciences, physical and related sciences, social and related sciences, and engineering. Compared to non-black men, black men take 25 percent of successive postdoctoral fellowships. Non-black men weigh in at 6 percent, and nonblack women at 5 percent. However, black women do not take successive postdoctoral fellowships. One would expect postdoctoral fellowships to lead to a higher probability of securing a tenure-track faculty position, which is true for blacks but not for whites. With the exception of black men, the probability of making a transition from a postdoctoral fellowship to an academic administration, government or industry position is more than 40 percent. Unfortunately, black women also have a higher probability of making a transition from a postdoctoral fellowship to an adjunct position (14 percent) and have the highest probability of making a transition to unemployment after a postdoctoral fellowship (21 percent). Although black women with a postdoctoral fellowship have the highest probability of unemployment, they have the lowest probability of moving from unemployment to the employment (59 percent); non-black men have the highest (85 percent). Black women also have the lowest tenure-track faculty retention rate (54 percent), compared to 57 percent for black men, 65 percent for non-black women, and 68 percent for non-black men. More than 40 percent of black women move from the tenure-track faculty position to the other employment outcome. However, 4 percent of black women move from the tenure-track faculty position to the adjunct research employment outcome, which is 2 percentage points higher than the other groups. Black women and men in the academic research employment outcome transition to the other employment outcome at 64 percent and 33 percent, respectively, compared to less than 30 percent for non-blacks. Black men have the highest probability of making the transition from the academic research employment outcome to the tenure-track faculty employment outcome, 10 percent, compared to about 3 percent for non-blacks, and zero percent for black women. One explanation for this is that one-third of black men moved from the postdoctoral fellowship to the academic research employment outcome, which may have allowed black men to generate greater research output. This also may explain the low adjunct faculty retention rate for black men, 58 percent, compared to 63 percent for black women, 68 percent for non-black women, and 64 percent for non-black men. The probability of a black woman moving from the adjunct employment outcome to the tenuretrack faculty employment outcome is zero; but it is only percent for nonblack men, which is the highest rate. The majority who leave the adjunct employment outcome shift to the \"other\" employment outcome-about 30 percent for black men and women compared to about 20 percent for nonblack men and women. The other employment outcome has the highest retention rate of all the employment outcomes analyzed, nearly 90 percent for all groups. Transitions from the other-employment outcome to the tenure-track faculty employment outcome or unemployed employment outcome are similar: 5 percent versus 3 percent for black men; equal for black women at 4 percent; 4 percent versus 5 percent for non-blacks. It is important to note that nearly 75 percent of black men and women are in the other-employment outcome compared to approximately 70 percent of non-blacks. The transitional matrices provide a glimpse into the professional employment outcome of blacks and non-blacks."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The state of blacks in higher education is encouraging. The number of black degree recipients at the bachelor's, master's and doctorate levels are increasing. The growth in the number of degrees earned by blacks at the bachelor's level is 73 percent compared to 25 percent for non-black Americans. At the doctorate level the growth for black Americans is 56 percent compared to 6 percent for non-black Americans. Much of the progress for black Americans is driven by the increase in degrees earned by black women who earned nearly twice as many degrees at the bachelor's, master's and doctorate degree levels as did black American men. The progress of black Americans is shared by the HBCUs, which were established to educate blacks during segregationist years. HBCUs increased the number of bachelor's degrees awarded by 61 percent. The increase for doctorates was 40 percent. Additionally, HBCUs increased the diversity of the student body from 21 percent to 23 percent for non-black Americans. The progress of HBCUs and black Americans has positive implication for the faculty pipeline. The number of blacks at the college and university level is increasing, and the proportion of that being black women has also increased. Compared to all schools, HBCUs have the most diverse faculty and hire a large share of black doctorial recipients in faculty positions. The barriers that seem to impede the promotion of the older black doctorial recipients do not seem to affect younger black doctorial recipients in the same manner. Blacks are more likely to be faculty members in the social sciences rather than in the hard sciences. Despite this progress, blacks make up less than 5 percent of the faculty in academe."}]
