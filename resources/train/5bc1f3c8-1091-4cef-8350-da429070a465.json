Both effects on memory were evident only after long-term therapy. CEE \u03e9 MPA did not significantly influence positive affect, negative affect, or depressive symptoms.\nThe effect of CEE \u03e9 MPA on cognitive function varies across cognitive domains in older women, reflecting both possible beneficial and detrimental actions of ovarian steroids on the aging brain.

However, the WHIMS findings did not address the effects of HT on specific cognitive domains.\nHere, we report findings from the largest longitudinal study of HT on standardized tests of memory and other cognitive functions. Data are drawn from the WHI Study of Cognitive Aging (WHISCA), an ancillary study to the WHI (11) and WHIMS. WHISCA was designed to determine whether HT affects the rates of age-related changes in specific cognitive functions, particularly memory, and affect in postmenopausal women without dementia (12) and was initiated 3 yr after WHI randomization. This report focuses on 1416 WHISCA participants in the HT subtrial receiving combination CEE and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Based on our earlier findings in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (13-15), we predicted that CEE \u03e9 MPA would protect against age-related declines in particular domains of cognition, with greatest effects on verbal and figural memory, but would not have global effects on all aspects of cognitive function in women without dementia."}, {"section_title": "Subjects and Methods", "text": "The design of WHISCA, including recruitment of participants, test battery and rationale, training of testers, scoring, quality control, and data management procedures, is detailed elsewhere (12) and summarized below."}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Procedures for enrollment and baseline sample characteristics for WHI (11) and WHIMS (10) and the subsamples in the CEE \u03e9 MPA trial (1, 16) have been reported.

Differences between WHISCA women randomized to CEE \u03e9 MPA vs. placebo with respect to demographic characteristics at the time of WHI enrollment were determined using 2 tests and Student's t tests. Analyses were repeated for participants who completed three WHISCA assessments before July 8, 2002 .\nThe principal outcome measures for WHISCA are the mean rates of change across follow-up for tests of specific cognitive functions and affect. Generalized linear models with random effects (for intercepts and slopes) were used to estimate the difference in the mean rate of change (slope) for women grouped by treatment assignment. Covariates included visit number and time from WHI randomization to WHISCA enrollment. We adopted a linear model for visit unless a class model (to absorb learning effects that were common across treatment groups) improved the fit significantly. We also examined mean differences between treatment groups at the time of enrollment into WHISCA, using analyses of covariance to adjust for time since randomization. To control type I error across the multiple outcome measures, a two-sided 0.01 critical level for statistical significance was specified a priori by the WHISCA protocol; a strict Bonferroni adjustment would be overly conservative due to correlations among outcomes.\nWe conducted several supporting secondary analyses. Although participants with existing diagnoses of dementia were not enrolled in WHISCA, all enrolled participants, including those who developed dementia during follow-up, were included in the primary intention-totreat analyses. To examine the impact of treatment assignment on women free of clinically detectable disease throughout the trial, analyses were repeated for participants who remained free of probable dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and stroke. The same analyses were performed for the subgroup completing three follow-up visits before termination of study medications. To examine the impact of treatment adherence, we repeated the intention-to-treat analyses after excluding test scores from visits after which participants became nonadherent by WHI criteria: 1) stopped study pills (drop-outs), 2) took fewer than 80% of study pills between dispensation and collection, or 3) began prescription hormones outside the main WHI trials (drop-ins). Analyses also were repeated adjusting for 3MS score at WHIMS baseline to control for variability in global cognition at the time of WHIMS enrollment. Finally, subgroup analyses were conducted on WHI baseline factors thought to either influence test scores or the impact of CEE \u03e9 MPA treatment."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participant characteristics", "text": "Of CEE \u03e9 MPA trial participants, 2089 were eligible for WHISCA, and 1416 (68%) agreed to participate. Compared with 673 eligible women in the CEE \u03e9 MPA trial at the 14 sites who did not enroll in WHISCA, WHISCA participants were slightly younger, more highly educated, and had higher scores at WHI baseline on the 3MS (P \u03fd 0.001), had a higher proportion of Caucasians (P \u03fd 0.001), a lower prevalence of hypertension (P \u03fd 0.01), and were less likely to report moderate/severe vasomotor symptoms at WHI baseline (P \u03fd 0.05).

Treatment groups were also comparable with respect to body mass index (BMI), alcohol intake, and antihypertensive use at WHISCA enrollment and numbers of incident cases of diabetes and myocardial infarction since randomization (P \u03fe 0.05). Comparisons of the subgroups completing three WHISCA assessments before July 8, 2002 showed that treatment groups remained comparable and did not differ significantly on demographic and health-related measures. However, women in the CEE \u03e9 "}, {"section_title": "Effects of CEE \u03e9 MPA", "text": "After enrollment in WHISCA, 11 participants were diagnosed with probable dementia (five CEE \u03e9 MPA, six placebo), 19 with mild cognitive impairment (six CEE \u03e9 MPA, 13 placebo), and 14 with incident strokes (nine CEE \u03e9 MPA, five placebo).\nMean unadjusted scores and sd values for the outcome measures are presented by treatment group and visit in Table  3 . With the exception of category fluency and digits backward, scores on the cognitive tests indicated overall improvements in performance over time across treatment groups (P \u03fd 0.05). Positive affect scores increased slightly over time (P \u03fd 0.01) across treatment groups, and negative affect scores were unchanged, despite small increases in depressive symptom scores (P \u03fd 0.001). Results of the primary analyses are summarized in Table 4 for the intention-to-treat sample. Mean differences between treatment groups at the initial WHISCA assessment, adjusted for time since randomization, are shown in the left column of Table 4 , with positive values indicating higher scores for the CEE \u03e9 MPA compared with placebo group. No differences across the 16 outcomes reached the 0.01 level of significance. The largest differences were for the attention/working memory scales; on average, women randomized to CEE \u03e9 MPA scored slightly lower at initial WHISCA assessment than those randomized to placebo on the digits forward (P \u03ed 0.05) and digits backward (P \u03ed 0.08) tests. Results were similar in analyses excluding individuals with probable dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and stroke.\nThe primary outcome measures, differences between treatment groups in rates of change during WHISCA followup, adjusted for time since randomization, are shown in the middle columns of Table 4 for all participants and in the right columns for women completing three visits. Positive values indicate greater longitudinal increases or smaller decreases in scores for the CEE \u03e9 MPA compared with placebo group and negative values indicate greater longitudinal increases or smaller decreases for the placebo group. [Note that the Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT) scores reflect errors rather than correct responses.] Rates of change over time showed significant differences between treatment groups that varied across specific cognitive functions. CVLT scores among CEE \u03e9 MPA women showed significant declines relative to placebo for learning (P \u03ed 0.009), and trends for short (P \u03ed 0.016) and long (P \u03ed 0.015) delay free recall but not learning after interference.\nIn contrast to the results for verbal memory, women assigned to CEE \u03e9 MPA compared with placebo showed a trend for greater improvement (fewer errors) over time on the BVRT test of figural memory and visuoconstructional skills, with a mean difference in rates of 0.27 errors/yr (P \u03ed 0.012). Rates of change for the remaining tests did not differ significantly between treatment groups.\nResults remained similar in secondary analyses for the subsample completing three visits, after excluding participants with probable dementia, mild cognitive impairment and stroke, and after adjustment for WHI baseline 3MS scores. Although trends were also consistent in analyses restricted to women meeting the WHI criterion for adherence, only the greater decline for the CEE \u03e9 MPA group on CVLT short delay free recall score reached the 0.01 significance level. Correlations between longitudinal changes on the BVRT and CVLT were nonsignificant and near zero. There were no significant effects of CEE \u03e9 MPA treatment on scores at initial WHISCA assessment or on longitudinal changes for positive affect, negative affect, or self-reported symptoms of depression. None of the subgrouping variables showed robust interactions with treatment effects, although power was limited by small samples."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this ancillary study to WHI and WHIMS, we investigated the effects of combination CEE \u03e9 MPA on longitudinal changes in specific cognitive functions, emphasizing tests of verbal and figural memory according to a priori hypotheses based on previous results from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (13, 14) . Both treatment groups showed expected improvements in performance during the study period, reflecting effects of repeated administrations. Although most cognitive domains were not affected by HT, differences between treatment groups in rates of change over time varied across specific aspects of memory, suggesting that HT may have different effects on specific cognitive domains.\nOn CVLT measures of verbal learning and memory, a deleterious effect of CEE \u03e9 MPA treatment was observed after long-term treatment (average of 4 -5 yr). Measures of new learning and short and long-delay free recall showed greater declines in the CEE \u03e9 MPA group. The lack of benefit of CEE \u03e9 MPA on verbal memory and evidence of a modest decrement are contrary to predictions from randomized trials of estradiol alone after surgical menopause (8), after pharmacological ovarian hormone suppression (20) , and from some observational studies of women who typically initiated treatment around menopause (14, 21) . However, the lack of a benefit of HT on verbal memory in our older sample is consistent with trials in older women (9, 22) , although prior studies examined pre-vs. posttreatment effects rather than effects on longitudinal age changes.\nIn contrast to the effect of HT on verbal memory, the CEE \u03e9 MPA compared with placebo group showed a trend toward greater improvement over time on the BVRT, a measure of short-term figural memory and visuoconstructional abilities. Performance was comparable across groups at initial WHISCA evaluation (after 3 yr of treatment), with improvement in the CEE \u03e9 MPA group and little change over time for the placebo group. The finding that longer but not shorter durations of CEE \u03e9 MPA treatment were associated with a trend toward better figural memory performance may clarify discrepancies among some studies of HT and cognition that vary in duration of use. For example, short-term estradiol treatment did not influence figural memory performance in some studies (23, 24) , but long-term HT use since menopause was associated with enhanced performance (13, 25) .\nIn WHISCA, longitudinal changes in CVLT performance were unrelated to BVRT changes, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. The longitudinal stability and lack of significant treatment effects on measures of positive affect, negative affect, and depressive symptoms also indicate that HT effects on memory are not mediated through changes in affect. Treatment effects on rates of change for other cognitive domains did not approach significance and offered no support for either decreased (9) or increased (26) category fluency in association with HT.\nA number of limitations of this study should be considered in interpreting these results. Although a double-blind randomized clinical trial, WHISCA was initiated 3 yr after WHI randomization. The two treatment groups were well-balanced at WHI and WHISCA initial assessments on demographic and health-related characteristics and global cognitive functioning, but pretreatment levels of specific cognitive abilities were unavailable. At the initial WHISCA assessment, only digits forward and digits backward tests showed trends toward differences between treatment groups. The slight decrement on these measures is at odds with some prior reports of better attentional functioning after shortterm estradiol (8) and longer term HT (27, 28) , and the effect did not endure over follow-up.\nAnother issue in longitudinal studies of cognition, particularly memory, is the complex relationship between practice effects and age-related changes. Learning is observed even a P for improvements in performance or change in affect over time across groups; for CVLT, the visit effect generally reflects overall improvement from visit 1 to visit 2 and decline at visit 3 due to greater difficulty of CVLT form B compared with A; positive affect and GDS depression scores increase over time.\nb Higher scores reflect poorer performance.\nwith 1 yr between assessments, highlighting the importance of a placebo-treated control group tested with the same schedule. With increasing follow-up intervals and age, learning effects become less apparent, and longitudinal age changes predominate (17) . With the 1-yr retest and short follow-up interval in this study, expected improvements in performance predominated over age-related declines. Early termination of the intervention also limited the follow-up assessments included in analyses. Demographic and health-related characteristics remained comparable for women completing three assessments before the termination of study medications, and analyses restricted to these participants yielded similar findings. Furthermore, treatmentrelated differences in rates of change were unchanged after controlling for variability in 3MS at WHI baseline. Early termination of the WHI CEE \u03e9 MPA trial also limited power to detect treatment effects. The original sample size and 4-yr follow-up for WHISCA was chosen to provide 90% statistical power to detect a 50% effect of active treatment (CEE-only and CEE \u03e9 MPA) on rates of change in the BVRT. WHISCA CEE \u03e9 MPA trial women averaged 1.35 yr (maximum 2.51 yr), with approximately 35% power to detect the effect size originally targeted for the BVRT (a difference in rates of change of 0.23 errors/yr). Our power to detect significant changes may be reduced further by the substantial rate of nonadherence. Despite these limitations, the observed difference in BVRT rate of change of 0.27 errors/yr is consistent with our original projection, and we detected significant deleterious treatment effects on verbal memory. Although treatment effects on rates of change were expected to be small over the study duration, they could produce clinically relevant, albeit modest, cumulative effects over time if they endure.\nHow can the current findings be reconciled with the WHIMS results indicating a 2-fold increase in the risk of all-cause dementia in the CEE \u03e9 MPA compared with placebo group? The deleterious effect of CEE \u03e9 MPA on verbal memory is consistent with the WHIMS findings (1, 2) and may be mediated by risks for ischemic and thromboembolic events associated with CEE \u03e9 MPA (16, 29). Recent investigations (30 -33) demonstrate increases in dementia risk in individuals with infarcts. It also has been suggested that the progestin, MPA, may antagonize some beneficial effects of estrogens on the central nervous system (34 -36) . Estrogen and MPA, but not estrogen alone, were associated with increased cognitive decline in one longitudinal study (37) , and additional research on the central nervous system effects of different progestins is indicated.\nIn contrast to the detrimental effects of CEE \u03e9 MPA on risk for dementia and verbal memory, the modest benefits of CEE \u03e9 MPA on longitudinal changes in figural memory in WHISCA may reflect a different process. Substantial neurobiological evidence indicates that estrogens have neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects on the central nervous system, including enhancement of synaptic plasticity, reduction in \u2424-amyloid formation, and modulation of neurotransmission and cerebral glucose metabolism (6, 38, 39) . Thus, risks for thromboembolic and ischemic events, on the one hand, and possible benefits on the pathological processes that lead to memory decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD), on the other, may represent competing effects. In the WHISCA sample of women who were without dementia after 3 yr of CEE \u03e9 MPA treatment, modest beneficial effects of CEE \u03e9 MPA on BVRT performance may predominate over adverse effects. In this regard, it is notable that in another study, BVRT scores predicted risk for AD as long as 15 yr before diagnosis (40) . Thus, beneficial effects of CEE \u03e9 MPA on the BVRT may be apparent where possibly reduced risk of AD exists for genetic or other reasons. The relative health of older women enrolled in WHISCA compared with WHIMS is supported by the lack of an effect of CEE \u03e9 MPA on global cognition in WHISCA participants after 3 yr of treatment and on rates of change during WHIMS and WHISCA follow-up periods.\nWHISCA findings of different effects of CEE \u03e9 MPA on specific cognitive functions do not change current recommendations that older postmenopausal women should not initiate combination CEE \u03e9 MPA because the risks outweigh benefits (16). However, they suggest that HT may have different effects on specific cognitive domains, perhaps in women with different risks for vascular events or AD-type pathology. These findings also may help explain differences in dementia risk between observational studies of HT and the WHIMS randomized clinical trial. The observational studies focus on ever use of HT, and most use of HT has been relatively short-term during the menopausal transition. The WHIMS and WHISCA studies in older women do not address short-term effects in younger women. In addition, full results from the CEE-only arm of WHISCA are pending, and these data will be important in understanding the effects of estrogen alone on specific aspects of cognitive function. The WHISCA data highlight the importance of future studies to determine short-and long-term effects of particular hormone regimens on specific cognitive functions, particularly memory, in women with different liabilities to dementia. The challenge to researchers is to further investigate potential neuroprotective benefits of HT without putting women at increased risk for other negative outcomes."}]
