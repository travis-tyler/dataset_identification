[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The goal of this study was to examine the age-associated differences in ventricular-vascular coupling, defined by the ratio of arterial elastance (EaI) to left ventricular systolic elastance (E LV I), and its components, at rest and during exercise. BACKGROUND Ejection fraction (EF) increases during exercise, but the EF reserve decreases with aging.\nEjection fraction is inversely related to EaI/E LV I, an index of the interaction between arterial and ventricular properties, which is an important determinant of cardiac performance. Thus, age differences in EaI/E LV I during exercise, due to age differences in EaI, E LV I, or both, may help to explain the age deficit in EF reserve.\nWe noninvasively characterized EaI/E LV I \u03ed end-systolic volume index (ESVI)/stroke volume index (SVI) and its two determinants EaI \u03ed end-systolic pressure/SVI, and E LV I \u03ed end-systolic pressure/ESVI, at rest and during exercise in 239 healthy men and women (age range, 21 to 87 years). Blood pressures were assessed with cuff sphygomanometry, and cardiac volumes with gated blood pool scintingraphy.\nResting EaI/E LV I was not age related in men or women. In both sexes, EaI/E LV I decreased during exercise and declined to a lesser extent in older subjects. There were gender differences in the components of EaI/E LV I during exercise: EaI was greater in older versus young women (p \u03ed 0.01) but was unaffected by age in men. Left ventricular systolic elastance increased to a greater extent in young versus older subjects (p \u03ed 0.0001 for men, p \u03ed 0.07 for women). CONCLUSIONS Age-associated differences in EaI/E LV I occur in both genders during exercise. Sub-optimal ventricular-vascular coupling helps to explain the age-associated blunting of maximal exercise EF, and its underlying mechanisms appear to differ between men and women. Although ejection fraction (EF) is clinically considered an important index of left ventricular (LV) systolic function, it is not exclusively governed by LV properties. Rather, EF is determined by the interaction of arterial and ventricular properties (1-3). Effective arterial elastance (EaI) is a steady-state arterial parameter that characterizes the functional properties of the arterial system by incorporating peripheral vascular resistance, total lumped vascular compliance, characteristic impedance, and systolic and diastolic time intervals (1). Effective arterial elastance shares common units with elastance measures of ventricular function (E LV I), and their ratio (EaI/ E LV I), an index of arterial-ventricular coupling (1), is mathematically inversely related to EF (4). In healthy subjects free of cardiovascular disease, EF increases by up to 30% during exercise (5). In order for the EF to increase during exercise, the coupling ratio EaI /E LV I must decline. Furthermore, studies have shown that with aging, the increase in EF during exercise (i.e., EF reserve) becomes blunted (5,6), suggesting age-associated differences in the shift of the coupling ratio and its components during exercise. Therefore, we sought to noninvasively measure EaI/E LV I and to characterize its arterial and ventricular determinants in healthy normotensive men and women at rest and during graded aerobic exercise: 1) to describe the age-associated changes in these parameters; 2) to compare how they differ between women and men; and 3) to investigate the functional changes that underlie the compromised EF reserve with aging during such (dynamic) exercise.\nStudy population.

Men over age 40 and women over age 50 years also had a negative exercise thallium scan. No subject took any cardiac or antihypertensive medications. All subjects gave informed consent to participate, and the study was approved by the institutional review board. Exercise protocol and blood pressure. All subjects underwent gated blood pool scintigraphy in supine and upright positions at rest and during graded upright maximal cycle exercise, with determination of oxygen consumption from expired gas analysis. Upright graded exercise on an electronically braked cycle ergometer started at a 25-W workload and was increased by 25 W every 3 min, with pedal speed maintained at 60 rpm until exhaustion. Rest and exercise SBP and DBP were determined by cuff sphygmomanometry. Pulse pressure (PP) was calculated as the difference between SBP and DBP and mean arterial pressure as (2 \u00b7 DBP \u03e9 SBP)/3. Additional blood pressure (BP) determinations included end-systolic pressure (ESP) approximated by (2 \u00b7 SBP \u03e9 DBP)/3. This noninvasive assessment of ESP accurately predicts LV pressure-volume loop measurements of ESP (7) . Gated blood pool scans. Upright rest and exercise gated blood pool scans were obtained in a 40\u00b0left anterior oblique position to best define the ventricular septum after in vivo labeling of red blood cells with 25 to 30 mCi of technetium99m, as previously described (8) . Calculation of EF and cardiac volumes was performed by validated count-based methods described in detail elsewhere (8) . All gated blood pool scan-derived volumes were normalized to body surface area, yielding their respective indexes: end-diastolic volume index, end-systolic volume index (ESVI), stroke volume index (SVI), and cardiac index.\nThe following indexes were calculated: 1) arterialventricular coupling index (EaI/E LV I) \u03ed ESVI/SVI; 2) EaI \u03ed ESP/SVI; and 3) LV systolic elastance index (E LV I) \u03ed ESP/ESVI. Of note, EaI/E LV I is mathematically related to EF according to the formula EaI/E LV I \u03ed (1/EF) \u03ea 1. The noninvasive values of EaI/E LV I are not dependent on BP measurements and can be regarded as relatively accurate. On the other hand, central pressures (including ESP) cannot be accurately measured during exercise; thus, the values of EaI and E LV I should be viewed as approximations.\nData analysis. Because the cardiac response to exercise differs in men and women (5) , the data were analyzed separately by gender. Linear regression analyses were performed to determine the relationships between age and EF, EaI/E LV I and its components, EaI, and E LV I, ESVI, SVI, and ESP at rest in the sitting position, at 50%, and at maximal effort. The age relationships of these variables were also evaluated at an absolute work rate of 100 W in men and 75 W in women. The interaction of gender with age as a continuous variable in the entire cohort was determined by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). If the interaction was not significant, then gender differences in EF, EaI/E LV I, EaI, E LV I, ESVI, SVI, and ESP at the various workloads were determined by ANCOVA. Additionally, to better illustrate age differences, hemodynamic parameters in 38 women and 39 men who were \u03fd40 years of age were compared with those from 26 women and 55 men \u03fe60 years by analysis of variance. To eliminate the influence of resting differences, we also calculated reserve function, defined as the change in a hemodynamic parameter from rest to individual work rates of 50% of maximum and to maximal exercise. Comparisons of the reserve parameters between young and older subjects were made by unpaired t tests. Associations between peak oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) and the elastance parameters were examined using Pearson's correlation coefficient. To evaluate the independent association between VO 2 max and EaI/E LV I, EaI and E LV I, multiple regression analyses were performed for each of these elastance parameters, with age, VO 2 max, and age \u03eb VO 2 max as independent variables in these models.

Because cardiac reserve during maximal exertion decreases with increasing age in healthy humans (5), evaluation of rest and exercise ventricular-vascular coupling in a large, healthy cohort illuminates reasons for this decline. This study is the first: 1) to evaluate the coupling index and to dissect out its elastance components in an attempt to glean insights into the mechanisms that underlie the coupling and its changes with exercise; and 2) to investigate the influence of gender differences on the coupling index and its elastance components. Ventricular-vascular coupling at rest. We found no age difference in the resting ventricular-vascular coupling index, similar to prior invasive studies (2, 4) . Resting EaI/E LV I in this study averaged 0.5 to 0.6, which is similar to both noninvasive and invasive coupling measurements in prior studies and a value at which the work efficiency of the heart is maximal (6, 10) .\nWe also found no age associations with resting EaI in our cohort. However, previous invasive studies had reported that resting EaI increases with age (2, 4) . This discrepancy may be related to the careful screening of our healthy subjects for the absence of cardiovascular disease, and for the absence of hypertension as defined by the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure-VI criteria (11) . Indeed, when subjects with SBP up to 160 mm Hg are included in the analysis, women did display an age-associated increase in resting EaI (data not shown). Ventricular-vascular coupling during exercise. Prior studies both in animal models (12) and in humans (13) have shown that EaI/E LV I decreases from rest to peak exercise, similar to our findings in this study. Thus, although in the resting state arterial-ventricular coupling is maintained in a range that maximizes the efficiency of the heart, when the system is stressed, energetic efficiency is sacrificed in favor of cardiac efficacy, manifest by a decrease in the coupling index (i.e., a greater relative increase in ventricular contractility than arterial load).\nIn this study, EaI/E LV I decreased less in older versus younger persons, suggesting that aging is associated with less reserve capacity, or the inability to attain maximal efficacy, manifest by a lesser reduction in the coupling index. Gender considerations. At rest, we found significant gender differences in the age regressions of EaI/E LV I and EaI, but not E LV I. Saba and colleagues (14) previously reported gender differences in arterial load, and they observed in 71 normotensive subjects that EaI was significantly higher in women than in men. Prior population studies also demonstrate that PP, an index of arterial stiffness, increases with age to a greater extent in women than in men (15) .\nMen and women displayed mechanistic differences in their predisposition for the age-associated suboptimal efficacy during exercise. Indeed, we found that exercise E LV I is higher in younger than in older men and tended to be higher in younger than in older women, with a significant age-gender interaction. In contrast, we observed that exercise EaI is higher in older than in younger women during all stages of exercise, with no age differences in men, and with a significant gender difference at maximal exercise. Interestingly, the marked gender differences in EaI and E LV I noted in the young individuals at peak exercise (Figs. 2A and 2B) were attenuated in older subjects. Clinical implications. Therapies that improve the coupling of ventricular and vascular elastances are likely to improve cardiac function and exercise tolerance in healthy subjects. This concept is supported by two recent studies in healthy older subjects: Administration of the direct vasodilator sodium nitroprusside caused reductions in reflected waves (manifest as a reduction in the augmentation of the carotid PP) as well as reductions in preload, resulting in reduced cardiac volumes and higher EF at rest and during maximal exercise as compared with placebo therapy (16) . Administration of intravenous verapamil reduced noninvasive indexes of arterial and ventricular systolic stiffness and improved exercise tolerance and oxygen consumption before reaching anaerobic threshold (17) . Study limitations. Although measurement of the arterialventricular coupling index relies only on evaluation of volumes and is independent of BP, a potential limitation of this study was the use of noninvasive measures to separately characterize the individual components of this index (i.e., effective arterial and LV elastances). The estimation of E LV I by ESP/ESVI assumes V 0 \u03ed zero. Because our subjects were healthy, we likely overestimated actual end-systolic elastance. Furthermore, while acute changes in LV elastance assessed in the catheterization laboratory often reflect changes in contractility, long-term age-associated changes in ventricular elastance estimated in this cohort probably reflect, in addition, increased wall thickness and myocardial fibrosis (6, 9) . Nonetheless, this approach has been used in prior noninvasive evaluations (4), and importantly, the values of EaI/E LV I in this study are similar to those obtained invasively (3, 4) . Secondly, brachial artery measurements of BP do not completely describe central aortic pressures, although we should emphasize that the arterial to ventricular coupling ratio is not affected by central pressures because the pressure terms in the numerator and the denominator cancel out. Nevertheless, prior studies suggest that ESP estimated from cuff BPs closely approximate central pressures (7, 18) . Nussbacher et al. (16) reported that brachial cuff BP measurement overestimate estimated central ESP values by \u03fd5% in a group of older, healthy subjects. Furthermore, while central pressures can be derived in the resting state, brachial pressure measurements are the only feasible method to assess ventricular and vascular elastances during exercise in a large, healthy cohort. A final limitation in this study is the comparison of exercise parameters across age groups and the greater maximal workload achieved in younger subjects, resulting in higher arterial and ventricular indexes by virtue of the greater workload. However, even at submaximal workloads, these relationships of age and gender are still evident.\nIn conclusion, in healthy men and women, noninvasive evaluation of EaI/E LV I allows characterization of age and gender differences in EF at rest as well as the decline in exercise EF reserve with increasing age in both genders. In women, this is likely due to an age-associated increase in exercise arterial elastance without an appropriate rise in ventricular elastance. In men, this is probably due to an age-related decline in exercise LV elastance index, as arterial elastance does not change with age. These arterialventricular mismatches in older men and women provide potential mechanisms for the age-associated blunting of maximal exercise EF. Therapies aimed at improving ventricular-vascular coupling in the elderly may improve exercise performance."}]
