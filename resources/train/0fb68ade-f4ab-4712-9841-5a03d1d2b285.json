[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "To identify the top brain regions affected by MS-specific atrophy (i.e., atrophy in excess of normal aging) and to test whether normal aging and MS-specific atrophy increase or decrease in these regions with age.\nSix hundred fifty subjects (2,790 MRI time points) were analyzed: 520 subjects with relapseonset MS from a 5-year prospective cohort with annual standardized 1-mm 3D T1-weighted images (3DT1s; 2,483 MRIs) and 130 healthy controls with longitudinal 3DT1s (307 MRIs). Rates of change in all FreeSurfer regions (v5.3) and Structural Image Evaluation Using Normalization of Atrophy (SIENA) were estimated with mixed-effects models. All FreeSurfer regions were ranked by the MS-specific atrophy slope/standard error ratio (\u03b2 MS \u00d7 time /SE \u03b2MS \u00d7 time ). In the top regions, age was added as an effect modifier to test whether MS-specific atrophy varied by age.\nThe top-ranked regions were all gray matter structures. For SIENA, normal aging increased from 0.01%/y at age 30 years to \u22120.31%/y at age 60 years (\u22120.11% \u00b1 0.032%/decade, p < 0.01), whereas MS-specific atrophy decreased from \u22120.38%/y at age 30 years to \u22120.12%/y at age 60 years (0.09% \u00b1 0.035%/decade, p = 0.01). Similarly, in the thalamus, normal aging increased from \u22120.15%/y at age 30 years to \u22120.62%/y at age 60 years (\u22120.16% \u00b1 0.079%/decade, p < 0.05), and MS-specific atrophy decreased from \u22120.59%/y at age 30 years to \u22120.05%/y at age 60 years (0.18% \u00b1 0.08%/decade, p < 0.05). In the putamen and caudate, normal aging and MSspecific atrophy did not vary by age.\nFor SIENA and thalamic atrophy, the contribution of normal aging increases with age, but does not change in the putamen and caudate.

Although the exact mechanism is unclear, brain atrophy in MS is thought to represent the net accumulation of tissue damage over time. Using MRI, numerous crosssectional 1,2 and longitudinal 3, 4 studies have demonstrated the clinical relevance of whole-and regional brain volume loss in MS. As such, brain volumetrics, particularly whole-brain volume, are often incorporated into MS clinical trials and clinical research as an in vivo proxy of neurodegeneration.\nHistorically, the literature describing brain atrophy in MS has generally reported the total volume loss in a given structure, e.g., whole-brain volume decline of \u22120.7% to \u22121.0% per year. 1, 4 Only recently has the contribution of normal aging begun to be explored, mainly in the context of developing \"pathologic cutoff\" values for whole-brain volume loss to discriminate patients with MS from healthy controls (HCs), 5, 6 with the ultimate goal of incorporating such values into a definition of \"No Evidence of Disease Activity-4\". 7 However, a systematic, unbiased analysis that considers all brain regions to identify which regions undergo the highest amounts of excess atrophy in MS compared with normal aging has not been undertaken.\nThe excess atrophy in MS that is beyond normal aging, or \"MS-specific atrophy,\" 8 may be of fundamental importance because only the excess, disease-related atrophy is presumably modifiable with therapeutic intervention and should represent the therapeutic target for treatments aimed at slowing tissue loss in MS. This requires a robust understanding of normal aging, which is a complex process that varies across structures. [9] [10] [11] After normal head and brain growth during childhood, each brain structure declines with normal aging. The age at which the decline begins varies widely across structures, and the trajectory of decline may be linear or nonlinear depending on the structure. [9] [10] [11] For example, whole-brain atrophy follows a nonlinear trajectory that accelerates significantly with age. 6, 12 Because the rate and trajectory of normal aging decline varies across structures, the amount of MS-specific atrophy should also vary across brain structures and as patients age.\nThe objectives of this analysis are to (1) identify the top brain regions that undergo the largest, least variable amount of MSspecific atrophy, and (2) test whether the amount of normal aging (and therefore the amount of MS-specific atrophy) increases or decreases in the top regions with age."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study population", "text": "As described previously, 8 from January 2005 through December 2010, all Caucasian patients aged 18-65 years who fulfilled the 2005 McDonald Criteria 13 for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or MS were offered enrollment into a large, prospective phenotype-genotype biomarker study (the EPIC study) at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) MS Center.

Out of every region in the human brain that is labeled by FreeSurfer, all the topranked regions were gray matter structures, including 3 deep gray nuclei and 1 cortical gyrus. This is consistent with previous histopathologic and MRI studies suggesting involvement of deep and cortical gray matter in the MS disease process [21] [22] [23] and underscores the importance of gray matter in MS.\nMore importantly, our findings indicate that for whole-brain (SIENA) and thalamic volume, the contribution of normal aging to total atrophy may increase significantly as the MS population ages. In these regions, most of the atrophy we observed at age 30 years was clearly in excess of normal aging and presumably disease related, whereas by age 60 years, the rate of normal aging had accelerated such that there was little excess atrophy attributable to MS. In the caudate and putamen, on the other hand, we observed a stable contribution of normal aging at each decade. In the case of whole-brain atrophy, our observed acceleration of normal aging is consistent with existing literature 12 and has been observed in other studies using SIENA. 5, 6 Although normal aging in subcortical structures is perhaps less well characterized, a similar pattern of behavior could plausibly occur. Some subcortical structures such as the amygdala, caudate, and thalamus have been shown to follow a linear decline over the lifespan in normal aging, whereas others such as the hippocampus may follow a quadratic (i.e., nonlinear) trajectory. 11 Most of the studies modeling atrophy in subcortical structures in normal aging have used cross-sectional data sets composed of 1.5T MRIs and relatively simplified statistical methods (i.e., linear or quadratic age terms) to estimate the effect of age. [9] [10] [11] Our data sets were composed of longitudinal 3T MRIs, and we used a more complex modeling strategy, making direct comparisons with published literature somewhat difficult.\nWe found that different brain regions behaved differently with respect to MS-specific atrophy vs normal aging. This suggests that tissue loss in MS may occur for reasons that are distinct across brain regions. Axonal transection within white matter demyelinating lesions 24 can lead to upstream or downstream neurodegeneration, which likely contributes to whole-brain and thalamic atrophy in MS. 25, 26 This may be a particularly important mechanism of thalamic atrophy, which is an area of early neurodegeneration in MS. [26] [27] [28] [29] A strong preponderance for MS lesions to form in thalamocortical white matter and a probable mechanistic link between thalamocortical white matter lesions and thalamic atrophy has been demonstrated using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography in subjects with CIS. 26 We hypothesize that the downstream effects of white matter lesions may explain the predominantly diseaserelated atrophy we observed at younger ages in whole brain and thalamus, whereas regions with fewer incoming long white matter tracts such as the caudate and putamen would presumably be less influenced by demyelinating injury. Indeed, in the caudate and putamen, the contributions of normal aging and MS-specific atrophy remained stable with age. Future work could test this hypothesis using a similar DTI tractography approach 26 to delineate incoming and outgoing tracts in the putamen and caudate and to estimate the effect (or lack thereof) of tract-specific white matter lesions on the volume of each structure. If we have indeed identified gray matter regions that are undergoing a high amount of excess MS-specific tissue loss that is relatively independent of white matter lesions, this may open a rich avenue for further exploration that could provide fundamental insights into tissue loss in MS. These regions could be used to study the contribution of other aspects of MS pathology to gray matter atrophy, such as intrinsic gray matter demyelinating lesions, 21, 22 iron deposition, 22 microglial activation, 30 mitochondrial dysfunction, 31 and glutamate excitotoxicity, 32 which could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of gray matter atrophy in MS.\nOur findings may have implications for clinical trial design and interpretation. If we presume that only the MS-specific atrophy is amenable to therapeutic intervention (i.e., that DMTs will not slow normal aging), our data suggest that the most appropriate brain region for a phase II primary end point, as well as the effect size that can reasonably be achieved and the sample size needed to demonstrate efficacy, may differ according to the patient population being studied (early vs late MS, older vs younger patients, etc.). More generally, a better understanding of the time and/or age where MSspecific atrophy is most prominent may help elucidate the \"therapeutic opportunity\" for current and future DMTs. Our findings could at least partly explain the suggestion in our literature that some DMTs aimed at slowing disease progression may not work as well in older patient populations, [33] [34] [35] perhaps because normal aging is more prominent and there is less \"therapeutic opportunity\" present. Finally, our data support the notion that any \"pathologic cutoff\" value used to discriminate patients with MS from HCs must be adjusted for age, which has also been suggested by the work of others. 5, 6 Our findings should not suggest that patients with MS at age 60 years are no longer undergoing pathologic disease-related whole-brain or thalamic atrophy. In fact, the total rate of whole-brain and thalamic atrophy in our subjects was consistent throughout the age range at \u22120.4% and \u22120.7% per year, respectively. Rather, our data suggest that normal aging accelerates with age in these regions, which mathematically decreases the excess atrophy because normal aging and MSspecific atrophy were estimated in the same statistical model. Whether whole-brain or regional gray matter atrophy accelerates throughout the MS disease duration has been unclear, with some studies suggesting an acceleration of gray matter atrophy in SPMS compared with RRMS 36, 37 and other, more recent work finding no difference in deep gray matter atrophy rates across MS subtypes. 8, 38 We examined the effects of age rather than clinical subtype; although age and clinical subtype are typically correlated, these should not be conflated. Finally, our findings describe a group-level difference between subjects with MS and HCs. Translating these findings to the individual level is an area of high interest that will require the development of methods to create an MS-specific atrophy biomarker for an individual; exploration of the clinical relevance of such a biomarker is likely to be informative. However, presently, it is premature to apply the current findings at the individual level.\nOur approach that focuses on excess, disease-specific atrophy could be applied to other imaging metrics in MS and to other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and Huntington disease, in which a similar conceptual model should apply. If one could estimate and adjust for the impact of normal aging, disease-specific atrophy measurements could allow for comparison across neurodegenerative diseases, which could uncover biologic, environmental, genetic, and phenotypic similarities (and differences) between diseases that could ultimately further our understanding of neurodegeneration in general. Furthermore, an impact of medical and psychiatric comorbidities on brain atrophy has been demonstrated in both MS [39] [40] [41] and non-MS [42] [43] [44] [45] subjects. This emerging area deserves further exploration. Because our data sets did not contain information on comorbidities, we were not able to examine their influence on our results. However, all brain regions in a given patient would have been exposed to the same milieu of comorbidities; therefore, it is unlikely that the impact of comorbidities explains our observation of differing behavior between deep gray matter regions. Similarly, the presence or absence of DMT is unlikely to explain our findings, unless one hypothesizes a differential impact of DMT on one deep gray matter structure vs another. Estimating the impact of comorbidities and DMTs on regional brain atrophy in MS will be an area of focus in future studies.\nStrengths of this work include the large sample size, longitudinal study design, careful acquisition and postprocessing of MRI data, and the unbiased selection strategy of the top regions of interest, which incorporates normal aging. Our approach of separating normal aging from disease-related atrophy is novel in brain atrophy analyses in the current MS literature and has several implications for MS and other neurodegenerative diseases that could be highly impactful. Limitations include a shorter mean follow-up time in HCs compared with subjects with MS and a relatively small HC sample size. HC MRI data, particularly longitudinal data, are rare in clinical research; efforts to assemble larger HC data sets are ongoing. However, to achieve the meaningful sample sizes that will be needed to fully understand normal aging will invariably require leveraging and combining multiple existing HC data sets composed of subjects scanned on different scanners, as we did in this analysis. Although this may initially prompt concern for increasing measurement variability, each HC subject in this analysis was required to be scanned longitudinally on the same MRI scanner throughout their study period, which reduces variability. 15 Moreover, we modeled the brain volume changes in this analysis as a percent change from baseline, which obviates the concern regarding heterogeneity across MRI scanners. Finally, by definition, linear mixed-effects models assume a linear decline in the outcome variable (brain volume) over time. Additional work with larger MRI data sets over a much larger age range is underway and will use advanced, nonlinear modeling strategies to further disentangle the contribution of normal aging from the pathologic atrophy observed in MS.\nIn summary, our findings indicate that the contribution of normal aging may increase with age and the rate of MSspecific atrophy may decrease with age in thalamic and wholebrain atrophy measurements in MS, whereas normal aging and MS-specific atrophy do not change with age in the putamen and caudate. This work emphasizes the need to understand each brain region separately in MS and has many potential implications for MS and perhaps for other neurodegenerative diseases. This could inform future work that furthers our fundamental understanding of brain atrophy in MS, including whether there are different causes of regional tissue loss and how to interpret the effect of disease-modifying therapies with age.
