Mitigation efforts thus far have been qualitative and fail to provide raw, quantitative data to aid in the successful management of flooding liabilities. This paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing infrastructure susceptibility by means of a component-based approach to consequences posed by water-borne incursions. Systems are simplified to collections of components, each with a lowestmember elevation, thereby identifying the benchmark for vulnerability. Further, the maintenance efforts required to return these systems to processing capability are integrated into the component database, identified by available repair and replacement tasks. Simulations for sitespecific flood information are analyzed through National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency data, which provide the expected inundation levels for the five separate categories of tropical events on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. These levels are applied to the elevations determined in the component analysis, thereby producing a legitimate estimate, measured in manhours, for reconstruction efforts following a flood event. These manhours are then used to calculate cost within a labor database composed of technical laborers and supervision, yielding a labor cost. Material costs based on historic pricing, equipment costs based on current market rates, and company overhead costs, composed of site project management, are aggregated to realize a total direct cost as a result of inundation at a specified flood depth. From this total direct cost, decisions at the owner level can be made concerning acceptable risk with quantitative data to support mitigation and prevention strategies."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION", "text": "The U.S. Gulf Coast is an industrialized landscape marked by an array of process facilities extending from Alabama to the Texas/Mexico border. This area faces flood threats both from riverine flooding in the spring as well as coastal surges accompanying the Atlantic hurricane season's storms. Bolstering the U.S. oil and gas industry's resilience to coastal hazards has the promise to decrease an estimated $350 billion in expected hurricane reconstruction expenditures over the next two decades, an amount nearly three percent of the regional GDP (Entergy 2010). It is estimated that approximately ninety-five percent of flood losses can be mitigated by following proper flood protection techniques (Rose, Porter et al. 2007), thereby increasing the impetus for developing appropriate means to understand flood damage within the confines of individual industrial sites. A more resilient infrastructure capable of resisting the impacts of flood hazards would also reduce the risks of materials release following a major event (Pine 2006, Stout, Liu et al. 2007. Risks posed to the surrounding community and environment, due to infrastructure failure, can therefore be reasonably lessened by refining flood damage assessment and developing prevention strategies. Local communities that are economically tied to the operation of plants would similarly benefit from better understanding and mitigation of flood hazards by reducing plant shutdowns and outages, providing more stable employment for workers. Barriers to the development of industrial infrastructure vulnerability assessment methodologies to flooding have been identified by several scholars. The cornerstone of these barriers is the wide range of systems and components within the broad industrial structure classification (Booysen, Viljoen et al. 1999). Building use is the key difference between the evaluation of industrial facility susceptibility and other occupancies. It is not possible to define industrial facilities within the same taxonomic systems used for residential and commercial structures. Standard damage may be assessed for the latter in terms of loss per unit area (Blong 2003) due to the lack of material and construction variance across the landscape. However, production processes vary significantly (e.g., textile mills, breweries, oil refineries), which concentrates capital assets in a wide range of locations, precluding the implementation of a standardized loss per unit area approach across all industrial structures. Moreover, the effort required to detail the affected object's behavior and aggregate flood performance metrics into a standard approach for the entire industrial landscape of a region would be too great (Merz, Kreibich et al. 2010). In spite of these previous findings, the economic value of industrial process facilities, their importance to national security, and the potential economic and environmental consequences of flood damage to those facilities are so great that development of methodologies to estimate the shutdown and economic impacts of flood events is imperative. By taking advantage of computational power and relational databases, it is possible to construct component-based depth-consequence relationships for specific facilities, which can be further extended to the network level. As the predecessor to the conceptualization of industrial flood vulnerability analysis, Kates (1965) proposed the use of synthetic flood functions to clarify the benefits of alternative adjustments to structures and land use change through the use of a fivestep process that crudely quantified impacts within the entire industrial flood zone. Of particular interest is his fourth point, the focus of this research, which is to design a matrix in which appropriate stage-unit functions are applied to the specified structure, contents, and production components. Establishing a benchmark for the development of modern flood vulnerability assessment techniques, Kates noted that his system was lacking, and that the ideal synthesis of information would grow from individual facilities, with inventories being developed and consequence functions realized. Perhaps it may be \"science fiction of the highest order\" (Kates 1963, p. 26), but by anticipating failures in the system before they develop, mitigation can be proactive in preventing possible future disruptions. This proposed process reconciles the barriers identified by previous scholars with the aims of Kates to synthesize a holistic method for the identification and quantification of the vulnerabilities of not only individual plants, but also of an industrialized region as a total system. Foremost, by combining the noted weaknesses detailed throughout the existing literature, the assessment commences at the component level and is extended on a systems basis only to the boundaries of the facility. By analyzing the effects of inundation, starting with the most basic elements of plant functions, a better means to understand and mitigate flood damage is not only realized through this ground-up approach, but a general template is also constructed for application to all elements of the industrial built environment."}, {"section_title": "Problem Statement", "text": "Flood vulnerability assessments are key to optimal decision-making for flood mitigation strategies, but little academic attention has been devoted to improve assessment of industrial infrastructure vulnerabilities (Merz, Kreibich et al. 2010). Insurance companies and others dedicate large amounts of money for damage modeling, but the focus of these studies is generally an overall risk assessment of the landscape, rather than a specific facility owner-level vulnerability study to locate and remedy issues in planning for flood damage. Current loss evaluations are based on qualitative estimates (Changnon 2003), leaving a gap in the translation from descriptive to numerical calculation of waterborne threats. The quantification of loss potential is essential for understanding and communicating the inherent liabilities of the constructed environment in response to natural hazards (Downton andPielke 2005, Scawthorn, Flores et al. 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Goals of the Study", "text": "The goal of this study is to quantify the economic threat of flooding to process facilities. As a step toward achieving this goal, this research details a conceptual vulnerability assessment process (VAP) to estimate the repair requirements, shutdown/outage time (i.e., schedule), and economic cost consequences for process facilities using a component-based approach. This is realized in two objectives: 1. Design a component-based VAP methodology to determine consequences of inundation at the part/unit level that aggregates flood, facility, and repair/replacement (construction) information in a single location for review. 2. Test the developed VAP by applying it to a complete subsystem to demonstrate flood depth-consequences within that process, rendering manpower and equipment requirements and budget to bring that subsystem back into a production capacity."}, {"section_title": "Scope of the Study", "text": "The information developed from this research can be applied horizontally across industrial facilities.

It does not identify costs associated with indirect consequences such as environmental cleanup of any shutdown-caused release, local economic hardship due to extended plant shutdown/outage time, or capital losses accrued by the owner from decreased production capacity through the duration of the maintenance. Further, the flood scenarios are based on the data available, and while many facilities in the area under investigation have levees, berms, and other structures in place to control floodwater incursion, this study has no means of evaluating the quality of those structures, and therefore takes for granted that the protection will perform as expected under all conditions."}, {"section_title": "Organization of the Thesis", "text": "This thesis is organized by objective topic.

Chapter 4 discusses the conclusions reached by the study, and proposes recommendations for future work."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 2: DEVELOPMENT OF VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT PROCESS FRAMEWORK FOR INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES", "text": "This chapter provides clarification for terms specific to this research. It also highlights the nature of the relationships within industrial facilities to enhance understanding of subsystem components' interdependency. Ultimately, the aforementioned are molded, through the tropical event and facility data, as well as maintenance labor information, into a concisely developed methodology for determining the total direct costs associated with returning processing capability following infrastructure inundation."}, {"section_title": "Concept of Vulnerability", "text": "Vulnerability generally refers to the degree to which a system is likely to experience harm due to exposure to a hazard (Brooks 2003, Turner, Kasperson et al. 2003. For flood hazards, it can therefore be understood to mean \"susceptibility to damage\" posed by floodwaters, with the inundation level acting as the independent variable. In turn, a thorough vulnerability assessment involves examining system elements and design, as well as identifying component failure modes in response to a given set of threats (Baker 2005). This comprehensive facility vulnerability assessment establishes the framework to organize a system of components with associated damage functions and failure modes in response to hazard impacts. The database formed from this consequence matrix serves as the foundation for the synthetic estimation analysis proposed in this paper."}, {"section_title": "Flood Vulnerability Assessment and Management", "text": "Flood management has undergone a shift in focus from original practices implemented by land developers, which prioritize containing the hazard through flood control structures (e.g., dikes, levee systems). Rather than simply mitigating flood risk, expansion of the built environment within the floodplain requires more consideration of the performance of at-risk elements exposed to flood hazards (Merz, Kreibich et al. 2010). Contemporary practices recognize system elements and layout, and attempt to evaluate their failure modes within the context of the natural threat to identify the overall flooding vulnerability to the system. These practices tend to identify \"critical\" components where a loss of function would immediately lead to downstream failures within the process system. However, the failure to recognize the importance of \"non-critical\" elements on overall system performance may have devastating consequences. For example, an oil spool piece has flange gaskets that, should they fail in a flood event, will allow contaminated water to enter the lubrication system, potentially causing damage to the efficiency and alignment of rotating machinery, thus transforming a seemingly noncritical element into an essential component within the function of the total system. To account for this, the operation, design, and interrelationships of the plant (i.e., plant subsystems and subsystem components) are detailed within the proposed VAP to determine failure modes and system repair requirements. From this point of view, the importance of individual process subsystems is recognized and recommendations can be made to reduce the vulnerability of the subsystem, and in turn the total facility system (Baker 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Damage Estimation", "text": "The contemporary approach to determining costs associated with natural hazards is economic estimation of direct damage (i.e. monetary loss) by applying depth-damage functions (Krzysztofowicz and Davis 1983, Dutta, Herath et al. 2003, Van der Sande, De Jong et al. 2003, Merz, Kreibich et al. 2004, Apel, Thieken et al. 2006, Pistrika and Tsakiris 2007, Friedland 2009). Rather than using the term \"depth-damage,\" this paper utilizes a more appropriate \"depthconsequence\" conceptualization to characterize inundation impacts. The depth-consequence function integrates the idea of physical damage with an estimate of facility loss to define the quantifiable effects of flooding within a single facility. To clarify disparity between the terms within the context of the framework, the following distinction between damage and loss is incorporated (Friedland 2009): \uf0b7 Damage is a direct consequence, expressed as a physical attribute that can be directly measured in terms of a level of degradation, spoil, removal or destruction \uf0b7 Loss is an indirect consequence, measured as the monetary obligation required to return a physically damaged condition to its full, undamaged state, expressed in absolute or relative economic terms Messner and Meyer (2006) emphasized the importance of spatial scale for flooding characteristics, differentiating macro-, meso-, and micro-scale approaches. As this VAP focuses on an individual facility, and more specifically, components and subsystems within that facility, a micro-level approach is taken, \"as small-scale analyses tend to use more accurate methods\" (Messner and Meyer 2006, p. 13). Further, absolute depth-loss functions, in which increased inundation is directly correlated with increased consequences (Penning- Chatterton 1977, Penning-Rowsell, Johnson et al. 2003), are disregarded in favor of a relative depthconsequence function so that Kates' adaptation option function can be incorporated."}, {"section_title": "Understanding Component Relationships", "text": "It is necessary to fully understand the nature of the analysis within the facility by defining terms used in the context of this paper. Rinaldi, Peerenboom et al. (2001) proposed a hierarchy of terms for a taxonomic identification of plant components, which is modified here with specific examples for oil and gas process facilities. Parts are individually identifiable components (e.g. a length of pipe or a bearing within a motor). Units are a collection of parts (e.g. insulated piping assemblies and complete motors). A subsystem refers to an entity of interdependent units (e.g. the oil house for a gas turbine containing motors, pumps, electrical systems, and piping). The system is an aggregation of all subsystems fulfilling a common task (e.g. a mechanical starting package, a generator, a gas turbine, and a boiler, with all auxiliary subsystems, produce the steam supply for an oil refinery). Infrastructure is understood as the complete network of systems within a particular field (e.g. an oil refinery's process systems are fed by steam created from a cogeneration system, which also supplies surplus electricity to instrumentation and control systems)."}, {"section_title": "Failure Modes", "text": "Descriptions of failure modes allow separation of the characteristics of impact upon the system through the failure of parts, units, and subsystems (Rinaldi, Peerenboom et al. 2001). A cascading failure is a disruption affecting each downstream process from the initial failure (e.g. a water-permeated gasket in one unit results in a water intrusion into the lube oil subsystem, leading to damage in the mechanical function of the entire gas turbine system). An escalating failure is a disruption in one system that causes a failure in a second, independent system (e.g. an unscheduled outage resulting from water intrusion in the gas turbine system forces a refinery to shutdown coker processes due to decreased steam feedstock). Finally, isolated failures are those disruptions that do not affect production processes or other elements of the system. Cognizance of the interactions within the infrastructure is vital to recognizing the scope of potentially small threats to overall resiliency."}, {"section_title": "Proposed Component-Level Vulnerability Assessment Process", "text": "The proposed component-based approach for assessing industrial flood vulnerability assessment is outlined in Figure 2.1. The process depends upon two phases: 1) collection of facility information and construction of the associated database, and 2) synthetic damage and economic loss modeling. systems. This step of the methodology requires direct industrial input to gain access to all necessary data, whether in hardcopy or electronic form. A partnership between industrial facility and researcher at this stage in the design is critical; without industrial collaboration, the necessary data cannot be compiled and the procedure is of no avail. The facility database is populated with a complete component inventory from the facility. Database entries are at the part or component level; the selection of which is dictated by the function of the piece under investigation. For example, piping, which is a part within the context of this methodology, is analyzed the same as a motor, which is considered a unit. The interdependencies previously noted are examined to understand whether potential failures are isolated or have a cascading effect through the system, and escalating effects can be determined by further implementation of the same process in neighboring systems throughout the infrastructure."}, {"section_title": "Construction Database", "text": "The construction database consists of the necessary manpower and management needed to complete a job. Industrial collaboration, again, is of the utmost importance to develop an accurate labor database measured in manhour units. Past invoices from maintenance are valid references for establishing typical productivity rates and labor costs for part and unit repair. The collection of those costs can then be aggregated into a subsystem repair cost, and further up to render a total system repair cost. Figure 2.2 identifies the process by which the damage and loss model is run to determine shutdown duration and labor, material, equipment, and overhead costs. The primary components of the process are described in further detail in the following sections.\nThe construction database details all elements required of an industrial contractor to return the subsystem to processing capacity. It not only quantitatively estimates the direct cost of restoration, but also provides the data to construct a reasonable schedule for the project. Using a manhour as the measuring unit, each part is assigned a total number of manhours necessary for either repair or replacement. Included in repair estimates are activities such as disassembly, correcting consequences due to foreign fluids and debris, cleaning, assembly with replacement of necessary material, and inspection for quality at each phase of activity. Table 3.3 provides the quantities, labor units, labor type, and manhour factors and material cost for repair and replacement of each part within the subsystem. Repair values shown as \"--\" indicates that the component cannot be repaired and must instead be replaced. In these cases, the repair calculations use the replacement manhour factors and material costs. Table 3.4 provides the labor rates for trades required to complete repairs or replacement.

Because of infrastructure design, the same lube oil supplied to the pump is circulated for supply to the motor, exposing the internal bearings and components to foreign material. If the product flow seals within the pump are also compromised, foreign material can be assumed to have entered the product and been transported through the subsystem. To know whether or not contamination has occurred, disassembly of all downstream components for inspection is necessary. Cleaning is required prior to assembly of any closed system. Further, once a flange is opened, new gasket material is needed to ensure the integrity of the flange. Any downstream component subjected to possible contamination is assumed to require replacement for quality and reliability concerns.

The location for the system under investigation is St. Bernard, Louisiana. The above mean sea level (AMSL) height is 4', according to a site survey completed in 2010.

These maps list the base flood elevation (BFE), or 1% chance of flooding, which is the regulatory requirement for the flood proofing of structures. In addition to this minimum elevation, the site's FIRM also denotes the likely sources of inundation. For St. Bernard, the primary sources of inundation are the Mississippi River, the Gulf of Mexico, and Lake Borgne. From the study area FIRM (Figures 3.2 and 3.3), the site is located in a leveed area, which protects it from the 100-year flood event.

After determination of the hurricane categories that would result in flooding of the leveed area, the predicted storm surge values for each event were obtained from SLOSH. SLOSH provides storm tide elevation referenced to the NGVD29 vertical datum, so conversion between datums was accomplished using VDatum, a vertical datum transformation tool developed by NOAA (http://vdatum.noaa.gov).

Using these assumptions, the labor cost to repair the damaged components is $1,204 and to replace is the damaged components $1,097 (Table 3.12).  Table 3.12 Case study labor cost (Category 2) continued Overhead costs (OC) include time for the labor supervisor, site engineer, safety specialist, project manager, and equipment operators. The amount of total work at the project site will dictate the proportion of overhead cost for each activity, but an estimate of 10% of staff supervisors' time is allocated to this particular activity, along with fulltime presence for the labor supervisor and equipment operators. Based on these assumptions, the overhead hourly rate is $100.00 per field hour (Table 3.15). The total OC (Table 3.16) is $2,259 (repair) and $2,059 (replace). Therefore, in the event of a Category 2 storm inundating this particular pump and motor assembly, the total direct cost (TDC) is calculated as LC+MC+EC+OC, or $17,015 (repair) and $28,652 (replace), shown in Table 3.17.

A Category 4 event reaches a height of 19.7' thereby inundating nearly the complete zone. Components 1-4 and 12-16 have lowest-member elevations below the watermark, translating into inundation. Additionally, as referenced in the binary table, the inundation of these nine components has immediate consequences for downstream components, indicated by a \"1\" in Table 3.19, shaded for clarity.

A crane and forklift are anticipated to be needed for the duration of either the repair or replacement. Equipment Cost (EC) is calculated using the rental rates shown in Table 3.5 for the durations of the repair and replacement activities. Rental days are calculated based on an 8-hour rental day. The total EC (Table 3.24) for this scenario is $2,212 (repair) and $1,983 (replace). The same assumption is made as for the Category 2 scenariothat 10% of staff supervisors' time is allocated to this particular activity, along with fulltime presence for the field supervisor and equipment operators. The overhead hourly rate is $100.00 per field hour (Table   3.15). The total OC (Table 3.25) is $4,155 (repair) and $3,725 (replace).

Assuming the same crew composition, work week, and labor burdens as scenarios, the hourly crew rate is $25.50 (Table 3.9), and the premium pay factor is 17% (Table 3.10). Using these assumptions, the labor cost to repair the damaged components is $2,618 and to replace is the damaged components $2,358 (Table 3.30). Material costs (MC) are calculated using the data in the Construction Database for this case study (Table 3.30). The anticipated materials costs for repair are $18,750, while the material costs for replacement are estimated as $36,400 (Table 3.31).  operators. The overhead hourly rate remains at $100.00 per field hour (Table 3.15). The total OC (Table 3.33) is $4,328 (repair) and $3,899 (replace). Therefore, in the event of a Category 3 storm inundating this particular pump and motor assembly, the total direct cost (TDC) is calculated as LC+MC+EC+OC, or $28,000 (repair) and $44,733 (replace), shown in Table 3.34.  Table 3.35 aggregates the findings of the individual analyses for tropical events. For Category 2-5 storms, if only repairs are needed, the minimum expected cost to return to processing capability is $17,015. The maximum cost, in the event that full replacement of the system is required, is $44,733. The anticipated repair/replacement time for this system ranges from 1.0 days to 2.1 days. The deciding factor of which level of cost and time are required depends on the damage to the system and whether components can be repaired or must be replaced. Additionally, some consideration of time versus budget may warrant spending more money on material costs to replace parts rather than spend the labor time to repair them, thus reducing shutdown durations.

A study into contemporary research on industrial hazard mitigation was conducted in Chapter 2, focusing on identifying gaps in the state of the art and clearly defining the terms to be used throughout the research. Based on review of the literature, vulnerability as it pertains specifically to flooding was recognized, as well as vulnerability management practices. Efforts have primarily focused on assets labeled as critical, while ignoring the interrelationships between those critical and noncritical elements in which failure can cascade from an isolated incident to a subsystem failure. The term \"depth-consequence\" was proposed to better gauge the effects of flooding to certain components, wherein the damage may not be confined to that specific point of process, but rather flow from that component, causing multiple consequences within the system. No methodology was found that determined the effects of flooding on single components and analyzed those damages in light of the relationships of individual parts within subsystems, thereby contributing to the overall operational capacity of the system. A whole-system evaluation was proposed by inventorying all components within that system through construction drawings. Relationships between components are determined by examining the piping and instrumentation diagrams to follow the process flow. Variables in the isolated components are identified, allowing for the manipulation of exposure data to affect materials. The construction database is a resource of previous productivity and cost data for the manpower needed to return the equipment to production. This includes general labor, specialty services, and management. It also takes into account the unique variables of performing in adverse conditions following a storm by incorporating certain productivity factors based on historical factors or determining a coefficient to represent diminished returns on worker output. Estimates of flood inundation, as well as the consequences of certain categories of storms are determined from flood modeling software, previous events, or hypothetical levels. Further, consideration of water quality in this methodology allows for the understanding of damage to a system based on salt or contaminant content."}, {"section_title": "Application of the Vulnerability Assessment Process", "text": "The tank and pump subsystem in Chapter 3 was used to demonstrate the utility of this methodology. The subsystem is broken down into components that are further identified by their material composition, elevation of lowest member, repair/replacement requirements, as well as the immediately affected downstream component. The flood database pulls from several sources of information to achieve a thorough understanding of vulnerability. The FIRM panel was used to identify sources of inundation; the DEM was referenced for elevation data; and NOAA's SLOSH model produced the inundation characteristics of flooding scenarios. A hypothetical construction database was developed that identifies the resources needed to return the subsystem to production. It identifies a standard mechanical field service crew, complete with a project management team and specialty contractors necessary to complete the maintenance. By combining all three databases into a single focused study, the consequences of inundation were calculated. Effort directed at developing a detailed inventory of plant equipment is the key to utilizing the VAP properly. Simple scenarios run through publicly available flood modeling software and seeking bids for hypothetical repair projects can then easily translate into new flooding mitigation strategies for facilities, safeguarding both owner assets and local dependence on the production processes that funnel money into the economy."}, {"section_title": "Final Remarks and Future Work", "text": "This research provides a novel framework for better understanding infrastructure vulnerability to flooding. However, as the first version of a process, it needs further review and validation. Were construction data more available for projects immediately following events, a more precise monetary estimate could be ascertained. Also, as experiences develop with future reconstruction efforts, more appropriate productivity coefficients can be applied to certain areas under certain conditions to further refine the scheduling practice. Significant modeling advances are also recommended for future work, including consideration of probabilistic repair/return relationships and more rigorous definition of repair/replace prerequisites and requirements that include multiple trades. The coast is constantly changing. While this research provides an initial direction, attention needs to be paid to environmental factors affecting the areas under investigation. Increasing rates of subsidence, heightened sea levels, diminished wetlands, and stronger storms are all going to affect future analyses and would be appropriately added for a more thorough evaluation of mitigation strategies. These could have far-reaching effects into coastal preservation and resilience techniques. The Gulf Coast is a hub of critical infrastructure. By better understanding the consequences of the natural environment, better practices can be utilized to construct the built environment, as well as bolster the as-built environment. Development along this energy corridor is currently increasing as more focus is placed on natural gas, both increasing the refining capacity and raising the demand on an outdated utility transmission grid. Several mega projects are in the construction phase at this time between Southwestern Louisiana and the Houston ship channel, and maintenance is an ongoing operation at all surrounding points. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita both touched the region as Category 3 storms and wrecked the lifeline infrastructure in their respective paths. As storm strength intensifies, a Category 4 or 5 is inevitable, necessitating, rather than recommending, better mitigation strategies."}]
