Different T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of the hippocampus (e.g., volume) are useful markers for the diagnosis of prodromal AD, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Dubois et al., 2007; Frisoni, Fox, Jack, Scheltens, & Thompson, 2010) . In fact, the hippocampal volume has been proposed as a biomarker of neuronal injury to establish the diagnosis of AD Cuingnet et al., 2011; Dubois et al., 2007; Leung et al., 2010) . However, it has been reported that this biomarker can distinguish between AD subjects and normal controls (NC) with accuracy of 75%, based on an analysis of the entire Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (Cuingnet et al., 2011) . In a longitudinal study based on 568 images from the ADNI dataset, Wolz et al. (2010) reported a correct classification rate of 82% for NC versus AD subjects using hippocampal volumes. This limited capability to classify AD patients using only the whole hippocampal volume may be due to simplification of the atrophic patterns to a global measurement and to the discrepancies caused by manual protocols. Notwithstanding, volumetric analyses of the hippocampus as a whole do not provide information about the precise locations of the morphological changes that characterize and occur during the progression of AD within this structure.\nFor this reason, several approaches based on hippocampal shape analysis have recently been proposed (Ch\u00e9telat et al., 2008; Csernansky et al., 2005; La Joie et al., 2010; Perrotin et al., 2015) . These methods attempt to capture detailed hippocampal structural modifications to obtain a more accurate classification. In fact, these techniques based on shape analysis (Gerardin et al., 2009 ) have yielded slightly better classifications than procedures that are focused on volumetric measures alone (Cuingnet et al., 2011) . Furthermore, shape analysis approaches have allowed the identification of atrophic regions in the hippocampus when comparing elderly controls and patients with MCI or AD, contributing to better prediction of the progression of the AD (Csernansky et al., 2005; Gutman, Wang, Morra, Toga, & Thompson, 2009; Kim, Valdes-Hernandez, Royle, & Park, 2015) .\nA promising method for segmenting subfields of the hippocampus has recently emerged Iglesias et al., 2015; Khan et al., 2015; Yushkevich et al., 2015) . This approach is potentially able to detect atrophic patterns in more detail. However, it requires a high-resolution MRI, which has not been implemented in standard clinical practice yet; thus, its application is restricted. Therefore, the development of new methods that are able to detect subtle anatomical modifications of the hippocampus are critical for obtaining a better classification rate.\nAlthough hippocampal volume has been evaluated as a measure for discriminating between symptomatic predementia (MCI) or dementia (AD) and healthy aging, in subjective cognitive decline (SCD) (Jessen et al., 2014; Reisberg, Shulman, Torossian, Leng, & Zhu, 2010) , hippocampal volume is insufficiently sensitive for distinguishing between SCD and NC subjects. Few studies have described hippocampal atrophy in subjects with SCD compared with controls (Saykin et al., 2006; Scheef et al., 2012) . Using a semi-automated surfacebased approach, Tepest et al., (2008) observed patterns of hippocampal surface deformation that were preferentially located in the area of the CA1 subfield in SCD, MCI, and AD subjects, but there were no significant differences between SCD subjects and healthy controls. In addition, some studies that have explored hippocampal differences between those MCI subjects who remained stable after a follow-up period (stable MCI, sMCI) and those who finally developed AD (progressive MCI, pMCI) have found differences in the left hippocampal volume (Douaud et al., 2013; L\u00f3pez et al., 2016) , while others have reported no differences (L\u00f3pez et al., 2014) .\nConsidering this background, in the present study we focused on exploring group differences in hippocampal atrophy at different stages and conditions of the disease: (1) healthy elderly individuals and SCD and MCI subjects and (2) sMCI and pMCI subjects. For this purpose, T1-weighted MRI images of the whole brain with typical clinical resolutions were used. The hippocampus was extracted using an automatic approach with the Harmonized Hippocampal Protocol (HarP) (Boccardi et al., 2011; Frisoni et al., 2015) (http://www.hippocampal-protocol. net). Once the left and right hippocampus were segmented, volumetric and shape analyses were performed, and a new marker was calculated from the mean curvatures in specific regions of the hippocampal surfaces. This new marker may increase the ability to discriminate between clinical groups at different stages along the AD continuum."}, {"section_title": "| MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "| Participants", "text": "A total of 307 subjects were included in the present study (NC = 70, SCD = 87, MCI = 137, and AD = 13). Participants were recruited from the Hospital Universitario San Carlos (Madrid, Spain), the Centre for Prevention of Cognitive Impairment (Madrid, Spain), and the Seniors Center of the district of Chamart\u00edn (Madrid, Spain). All subjects underwent an extensive neuropsychological assessment in order to explore their cognitive status (for a review of the protocol see L\u00f3pez et al., 2016) . The demographics and clinical details from the database are shown in Table 1 . SCD and MCI subjects were diagnosed according to the Subjective Cognitive Decline Initiative (SCD-I) Working Group (Jessen et al., 2014) and the National Institute on AgingAlzheimer Association (NIA-AA) (Albert et al., 2011) , respectively. The clinical diagnosis of MCI included the following features: (1) self-or informant-reported cognitive complaints; (2) objective evidence of impairment in one or more cognitive domains; (3) preserved independence in functional abilities; and (4) not demented (McKhann et al., 2011) . In addition to meeting the clinical criteria, MCI subjects showed signs of loss of the hippocampal volume compared with controls. As they fulfilled the criteria for both clinical and neuronal injury, MCI participants can be categorized as \"MCI due to AD\" with an intermediate likelihood (Albert et al., 2011) . It should be noted that hippocampal volumes were not used to establish any of the different diagnoses that were explored, since clinical and cognitive performance were used for this purpose.\nAdditionally, 97 of the 137 MCI subjects were followed-up for a period of 3 years to determine if they remained stable or progressed to AD. Therefore, at the end of this follow-up period, they were split into two subgroups according to their clinical outcomes: (1) 61 sMCI subjects who met the diagnostic criteria for MCI; and (2) 36 pMCI subjects who fulfilled the criteria for probable AD according to the NIA-AA (McKhann et al., 2011) (see Table 2 ).\nAll the participants did not have other severe medical conditions or psychiatric, medical or neurological pathologies (other than MCI or AD). The exclusion criteria were as follows: an age outside of the range of 65-85 years, a modified Hachinski score \u22654 (Rosen, Terry, Fuld, Katzman, & Peck, 1980) , a geriatric depression scale immediate recall score \u22655 (Yesavage et al., 1982) , and a T2-weighted MRI performed within 12 months before the clinical evaluation with indications of infection, infarction or focal lesions.\nThe study was approved by the local ethics committee, and all subjects or their legal representatives signed an informed consent that explained the technical and ethical considerations of the investigation."}, {"section_title": "| MRI acquisition", "text": "3D T1-weighted scans were performed with a General Electric 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner, using a high resolution antenna and a homogenization PURE filter [Fast Spoiled Gradient Echo (FSPGR) sequence with the following parameters: TR/TE/TI = 11.2/4.2/450 ms, flip angle 12 , 1 mm slice thickness, 256 \u00d7 256 matrix, and FOV 25 cm)."}, {"section_title": "| Segmentation method", "text": "We have recently proposed a fast label fusion method for segmenting anatomical structures, such as the hippocampus, with low intensity contrast using T1-weighted MRI images (Platero & Tobar, 2015 . The approach was based on a patch-based labeling method combined with atlas-warping using nonrigid registrations. The proposed segmentation scheme involved the following principal steps:\n(1) MRI preprocessing; (2) spatial normalization; (3) first labeling based on atlas-warping using nonrigid registration; and (4) final patch-based labeling based on similarity measures in intensity and labeling.\nDuring preprocessing of the MR images, nonbrain regions were removed, and intracranial volumes were estimated. Removing nonbrain tissue prior to registration is generally accepted to simplify the inter-subject registration problem and thus increase the quality of the registrations (Battaglini, Smith, Brogi, & De Stefano, 2008; Klein et al., 2009 ). The images were skull-stripped using Brain Extraction Tool (BET) (Smith, 2002) . To improve the results of BET, we followed the protocol proposed by Stein et al. (2012) . First, a coarse skull-stripping was performed, and then, the bias field correction was calculated and applied to the image. Finally, the corrected images were reapplied with BET, and all of them were spatially normalized to the same stereotactic space (Evans, Janke, Collins, & Baillet, 2012) . The MNI-152 template (Evans et al., 2012 ) was selected as a reference for coregistering the images with an affine transformation using FMRIB's Linear Image\nRegistration Tool (FLIRT) with 12 of freedom (Jenkinson, Bannister, Brady, & Smith, 2002) . The intracranial volume (ICV) was calculated by registration of each skull-stripped MRI to the MNI-152 template using the same affine transformation (Buckner et al., 2004) .\nA set of atlases were built using the HarP annotations on 134 images from the ADNI database (Boccardi et al., 2011; Frisoni et al., 2015) . The atlases were normalized to the MNI-152 space and then, a subset of normalized atlases was nonrigidly registered to the normalized subject image. Next, the registered atlases were fused, and the labeling was calculated using graph cuts based on minimizing an energy function (Platero & Tobar, 2015) . Then, a patch-based labeling method was applied; the patches and weights for this method were computed with a combination of similarity measures between patches using intensity-based distances and labeling-based distances (Platero & Tobar, 2017) . The labeling distances were calculated from the previous segmentation of the target image by means of atlas-warping using nonrigid registrations. The average computational time for hippocampal segmentation from a T1-weighted MRI was less than 17 min (see more details in Supporting Information Materials)."}, {"section_title": "| Markers", "text": "The markers were extracted from the automated hippocampal segmentations and were used to characterize four clinical groups: NC, SCD, MCI, and AD. The following markers were used to discriminate among the groups: normalized hippocampal volume, hippocampal surface roughness and a new marker called local surface roughness (LSR).\nWe explored these measures because recent studies have shown that a decrease in hippocampal volume and an increase in surface roughness are good markers for the progression of AD (Kim et al., 2015) . Moreover, the values of these features are scalar, showing higher robustness for generalization and avoiding overfitting when the size of the samples is limited."}, {"section_title": "| Volume", "text": "We first tested the classification accuracy using the hippocampal volume which was normalized by the total ICV. This kind of normalization reduces the variability in the volume measurements of nearly all brain regions (Keihaninejad et al., 2010) . Compared with other commonly used constants, ICV is less vulnerable to pathological changes (Pengas, Pereira, Williams, & Nestor, 2009 ). For more robustness in terms of hippocampal segmentation errors, both left and right volumes were averaged and normalized with ICV. This marker was called the normalized hippocampal volume (NHV)."}, {"section_title": "| Surface roughness", "text": "We used the surface roughness (SR) of the hippocampus as a marker to detect significant differences among the groups (Kim et al., 2015) .\nThe hippocampal surface roughness measures atrophy associated with the progression of AD using a single scan. The surface roughness was calculated using the mean curvature as follows:\nwhere, n is the number of the voxels belonging to the hippocampal surface, and K(x i ) is the mean curvature at each voxel x i . These voxels were extracted from the automated hippocampal segmentation in the standard space, that is, K(x i ) was calculated with the isotropic spacing\n(1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm 3 from the MNI 152 domain). The left and right hippocampal segmentations were embedded in a level set formulation, and the mean curvature was estimated using the following equation:\nwhere, \u0393 = {x|\u03c6(x) = 0} is the hippocampal surface, and \u03c6(x) is a signed distance function, which assigns positive distances to the inside of the object and negative distances to the outside (Osher & Fedkiw, 2006) .\nThe estimation of the mean curvature on each x i was controlled using Gaussian derivatives. In our experiments, a Gaussian kernel of 5 mm FWHM was applied to the images to calculate the mean curvatures.\nThis parameter was tuned by maximizing the discrimination capacity of the SR biomarker between NC and AD populations. For more robustness in terms of segmentation errors, the left and right surface roughness was averaged to determine the shape marker."}, {"section_title": "| Local surface roughness", "text": "A new marker based on the statistical significance maps between two clinical groups being compared from the mean curvature measures was introduced. With the normalized mean curvature maps of all participants, which were generated using volume-to-volume correspondence into a template (Heimann & Meinzer, 2009 ) and for each voxel belonging to the hippocampal surface, the statistical significance between two groups being compared was estimated via permutation tests (Pantazis, Leahy, Nichols, & Styner, 2004) . Group differences were assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, which does not require normality of the data. We defined LSR as a measurement of the SR on local regions of the hippocampal surface, which exhibited significant differences when two groups of subjects were compared.\nThe NHV or SR markers were based on the hippocampal segmentation. The LSR marker also requires statistical significance maps between two clinical groups, that is, this atrophy measure is not unique for a given hippocampal segmentation.\nLet X = {x i |\u03b1 k,l (x i ) < \u03b1 th } be the set of voxels of the hippocampal surface with significant differences in the measures of their mean curvatures between the k and l clinical groups, where \u03b1 k,l (x i ) is the p-value in the i-voxel for comparing its measures between the subjects belonging to the k and l clinical groups and \u03b1 th is the threshold of statistical significance, then"}, {"section_title": "| Statistical analysis", "text": "The effects of demographics and clinical measurements were tested using ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc comparisons for continuous variables, while categorical variables were analyzed using the Chi-square test. The hippocampal markers were first analyzed using MANCOVA and\nBonferroni corrections by adopting a general linear model procedure, adjusting for age and years of education as covariates. Bonferroni pairwise comparisons were performed to determine hippocampal marker differences between the groups. Homoscedasticity, normality and independence were verified in all the tests of analysis of variance.\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS v. 22.\nThe hippocampal markers were subsequently analyzed using linear discrimination, which fits a normal density to each group, with a pooled estimate of covariance. The use of a simple, linear classifier ensured that the classification accuracy was primarily determined by the quality of the input data rather than by stochastic variations in the classifier.\nFor each comparison between two clinical groups, we computed the sensitivity (SEN), the specificity (SPE) and the accuracy value (ACC) (Cuingnet et al., 2011) . Note that the number of subjects in each group was not exactly the same. The classification accuracy did not enable comparisons of the performances between the different classification experiments. Instead, we considered both the specificity and the sensitivity.\nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated for each hippocampal marker and for each group pairwise comparison. The discriminant value of the corresponding ROC curve was estimated using Table 5 after 5,000 runs.\n3 | RESULTS"}, {"section_title": "| Demographic and cognitive results", "text": "The cognitive measurements applied (i.e., MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975) and immediate and delayed recall (Wechsler Memory Scale III, WMS-III; Wechsler, 1997) ; indicated that cognitive scores were the lowest in the AD group and the highest in the control group (see Table 1 ). No significant differences in MMSE scores were observed between NC and SCD subjects, but there were significant differences in both episodic memory measurements between these groups. Additionally, SCD subjects had statistically higher scores on the MMSE and immediate and delayed recall than MCI and AD subjects, while there were only differences in MMSE scores and delayed recall between MCI and AD subjects.\nAfter the 3-year follow-up period involving 97 patients with MCI, no significant differences in age, gender, years of education and MMSE score were observed between sMCI and pMCI subjects.

Left and right hippocampal volumes\nwere not considered markers in the final classification because they showed less reliability than the NHV marker.\nTo control for the effects of age on the hippocampal markers, they were corrected using linear regression models (Dukart, Schroeter, Mueller, & The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, 2011).\nThe control group alone was used to estimate the age-related effect.\nThen, the markers were corrected for age and the corresponding linear model.\nThe results of the classification are summarized in Table 5 and in Figure 3 .

The Cox proportional hazards model is a very flexible and powerful method for demonstrating that atrophy on hippocampal measurements is associated with an increased risk of progression to AD (Desikan et al., 2009; Devanand et al., 2007; Sabuncu, Bernal-Rusiel, Reuter, Greve, & Fischl, 2014; Vemuri et al., 2011) .\nA set of univariate and multivariable Cox models were used. The first Cox model for each hippocampal measure was crude. The second multivariable model was adjusted for sex, age, and years of education.\nThese variables were added to determine whether the inclusion of demographic data provided redundant or complementary information to the markers concerned with predicting progression.\nIn the univariate Cox models, smaller volumes and higher surface roughness of the hippocampus, such as SR and LSR, were highly significant predictors of the time to conversion to AD (see Table 6 ).\nThose subjects with MCI whose NHV markers were 1 SD below the mean of this clinical group had an increased risk of progression to AD. In contrast, when MCI patients had 1 SD above the mean value of the SR or LSR marker, these measures also showed an increased risk of AD conversion. After adjusting for sex, education, and age, in the multivariate Cox analyses, a smaller NHV remained a strong predictor, but the level of statistical significance was decreased by the inclusion of the age adjustment. However, the LSR marker remained highly significant even after controlling for age and education (hazard Risk of progression to AD in subjects with MCI at baseline (n = 97) using the normalized hippocampal volume (NHV), surface roughness (SR), and local surface roughness (LSR) proposed from these zones. This method has been used for diagnosing AD using cortical thickness (Dickerson et al., 2009; Landin-Romero et al., 2017; Li et al., 2012) or shape analysis of the hippocampus obtained from the hippocampal thickness (Frank\u00f3 & Joly, 2013; Kim et al., 2015; Yushkevich et al., 2015) .\nWe reported that the normalized hippocampal volume decreased, and the SR or LSR markers were increased in SCD and MCI subjects compared with healthy elderly subjects. Hippocampal atrophy was found to be less pronounced in SCD subjects than in MCI subjects.\nOur results demonstrated that SCD subjects showed a differential pattern of atrophy of the hippocampal curvature compared with the NC group. Although we did not find significant differences between the SCD and NC participants in any of the analyzed markers, the LSR presented the highest classification accuracy with 68.2%. As previously described, the NHV marker does not seem to be a sufficiently sensitive measure for differentiating between SCD and NC. However, the LRS marker may be a promising measure for distinguishing these stages. In addition, it should be noted that the pattern of atrophy observed here increased during the progression of Alzheimer's disease, since greater areas of atrophy were observed in the MCI subjects than in the NC or SCD participants. Additionally, in all groups,\nlower NHV values were related to lower MMSE and episodic memory scores, while higher SR and LSR values were inversely related with these cognitive measures, and the strongest correlations were found with the LSR marker.\nAlthough the pMCI subjects exhibited lower NHV and higher SR\nand LSR values than the sMCI subjects, LSR achieved higher classification accuracy of 74.3% than the other markers (sensitivity = 77.4%, specificity = 72.3%, AUC = 0.831). These results suggest the relevance of this new marker for classifying those MCI subjects who will ultimately progress to AD, since some studies have reported no differences in hippocampal volume measurements, which is the most employed marker (L\u00f3pez et al., 2014) .\nAccording to Delong's test, the classification improvements were significant using LSR compared with the NHV and SR markers when the following groups were compared: NC versus SCD, sMCI versus pMCI, sMCI versus AD, and pMCI versus AD. In contrast, when the pair of groups being compared were very different in terms of the degree of the disease (i.e., NC vs. AD, SCD vs. AD, NC vs. MCI, or SCD vs. MCI), classification scores using the LSR marker were similar to the results determined by the SR marker. This is because the statistical significance map between these two groups covers almost the whole left and right hippocampal surface; thus, the LSR and SR values are similar.\nThe atrophic regions marked by statistical significance maps are consistent with those identified in other publications that used other methodologies, such as high dimensional diffeomorphic mapping (Ch\u00e9telat et al., 2008; Csernansky et al., 2005; La Joie et al., 2010; Perrotin et al., 2015) , spherical harmonic representation (Gerardin et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2015) radial distance mapping (Apostolova et al., 2012) or longitudinal deformation fields (Frank\u00f3 & Joly, 2013 ).\nIn the two-group comparison approach (sMCI vs. pMCI) and the Cox survival analysis, the LSR marker showed better prediction of the progression to AD than the classic marker hippocampal volume.\nAll these results provide evidence that the LSR marker may be a useful measure to include in AD studies since it is related to cognition and provides higher accuracy classification scores than the NHV or SR markers for comparing different clinical groups, such as NC versus SCD or sMCI versus pMCI.
