It is an issue that will have far-reaching consequences for California, given its 1100-mile open coastline and many additional miles of estuarine shoreline, as well as high concentrations of people and development along the coast. Sea-level rise will continue to threaten coastal communities and infrastructure through more frequent flooding and inundation, as well as increased cliff, bluff, dune, and beach erosion. Human development and pressures from a rising sea threaten the already diminished coastal wetlands along the California coast. Hundreds of miles of roads and railways, harbors and airports, power plants and wastewater treatment facilities, in addition to thousands of businesses and homes, are at risk from future flooding, inundation, and coastal retreat [1]. But the total potential impact of such coastal risks is significantly larger still: not only are economic assets and households in flood zones increasingly exposed, but also people's safety, lives, daily movement patterns, and sense of community and security could be disrupted. California also has the nation's largest ocean economy, valued at over $44 billion/ year [2], with the great majority of it connected to coastal recreation and tourism, as well as ports and shipping.

In 2010, the Governors of Oregon and Washington, along with 10 state and federal agencies, approached the National Research Council (NRC) with a request to provide estimates and projections of future sea-level rise. The NRC Committee built upon and updated the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report at the time [3]. The Committee's report, Sea-Level Rise for the Coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington -Past, Present and Future was completed in 2012 [4]. The future sea-level projections from this report have guided state agencies in their sea-level rise planning in the subsequent years. Five years have elapsed since the NRC study, during which time a new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report was published containing updated sea-level rise projections based on new scenarios, model simulations, and scientific advances [5]. New research has also been published on some of the primary drivers of sea-level change, which includes important new work on ice sheet mass loss in Antarctica, as well as on new methods for producing probabilistic projections of local sea-level change [6,7]. Now, the California Ocean Protection Council and the California Natural Resources Agency, in collaboration with the Governor's Office of Planning and Research, the California Energy Commission, and the California Ocean Science Trust, are updating this statewide guidance for a second time to reflect recent advances in ice loss science and projections of sea-level rise. The updated guidance will focus on the needs of state agencies and local governments. It will help cities and counties as they comply with a new law that requires them to incorporate climate change into their planning efforts. The updated guidance document will also assist state agencies prepare for and adapt to climate change, as directed by Governor Brown's recent Executive Order B-30-15. This document, a synthesis of the state of the science on sea-level rise, provides the scientific foundation for the update to the existing guidance document. Because effective planning for sea-level rise involves collaboration among various departments within coastal city and county governing bodies, special districts, state agencies, federal agencies, climate researchers, non-governmental organizations, business owners and other stakeholders, a robust public engagement process has been launched and will be implemented throughout 2017 to ensure that the new policy guidance is responsive to user needs.

Moreover, it is not just scientific understanding that is evolving and improving. Sea-level rise projections will continue to change as the impacts of local, regional, national and global policy choices are manifest. Given this dynamic environment, we encourage the creation of science-policy processes that are flexible, iterative and adaptive. At minimum, we recommend that sea-level rise projections be updated every five years, aligned with existing climate change assessment cycles, or when new data become available that are judged to significantly modify existing projections. More fundamentally, we encourage California lawmakers and policy makers to pursue institutional arrangements and processes for dynamic and rapid incorporation of the results of new science into policy. In this report we aim to provide a robust description of the considerations in selecting approaches to project sea-level rise, and justification of the current choices. Our goal is that this scientific information can begin to make the concept of adaptive policy tractable and actionable."}, {"section_title": "Understanding Sea-Level Rise", "text": "Sea level is expected to rise significantly over the next century due to a changing global climate. However, change in sea level is not a new phenomenon; sea level has been rising globally since the end of the last ice age about 18,000 years ago. Driven primarily by the melting of land ice, global mean sea level rose about 120 135 m (about 400-450 feet) during this period. Much of this took place between 18,000 and 8,000 years ago at average rates of about 11 mm/year (45 in/century) and then began to slow. Sea level rose very gradually (<1 mm/year) over the past 8,000 years. With the onset of the Industrial Revolution and the expanded use of fossil fuels, the greenhouse gas content of the atmosphere began to increase and the Earth has to analyze the global tide gauge records in order to accommodate the spatial and temporal variations, and these efforts have yielded sea-level rise rates ranging from about 1.2 mm/year to 1.7 mm/year (about 0.5 to 0.7 inches/decade) for the 20th century, but since 1990 the rate has more than doubled, and the rise continues to accelerate [8][9][10][11][12]. Since the advent of satellite altimetry in 1993, measurements of absolute sea level from space indicate an average global rate of sea-level rise of 3.4 mm/year or 1.3 inches/decade -more than twice the average rate over the 20th century and greater than any time over the past thousand years [13,14].  [16,19]. While the mantle responds on millennial timescales, the gravitational, rotational and crustal effects are essentially instantaneous. As a retreating ice sheet loses mass to the ocean, its gravitational pull on the surrounding ocean is reduced. Within about a thousand miles of a retreating ice sheet, the reduced gravitational pull on the ocean causes the sea-surface (and relative sea level) to drop, even though the ocean has gained volume overall. Further from the ice sheet (~4000 miles), the change in relative sea level is comparable to that expected from the increase in ocean volume contributed by the melting ice sheet. Beyond that distance, the change in relative sea level is greater than expected from the extra water added to the ocean by the melting ice sheet. Consequently, Northern Hemisphere coastlines generally experience enhanced sea-level rise from the loss of Antarctic ice, while coastlines in the Southern Hemisphere experience enhanced sea-level rise from loss of Greenland ice. Changing distributions of ice and water also shift the Earth's pole of rotation (the physical North and South Poles) and rate of rotation, which modifies the main gravitational response. Calculations of the spatial distribution of sea-level rise that take into account these gravitational and rotational effects, sometimes called sea level \"fingerprints\" (Figure 1, [16]), show that North America experiences more sea-level rise from a given meltwater contribution from Antarctica than from Greenland, and if the ice loss is from West Antarctica, the impacts are exaggerated even further. In fact, these calculations show that for California, there is no worse place for land ice to be lost than from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. For every foot of global sea-level rise caused by the loss of ice on West Antarctica, sea-level will rise approximately 1.25 feet along the California coast, not including the additional local factors mentioned above. In addition, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is considered the most vulnerable major ice sheet in a warming global climate, and serious irreversible changes are already underway (see discussion below and Appendix 2, [20][21][22]).  The maps depict the relative response of sea-level to the loss of ice mass from (a) Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) and (b) West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). The color bar represents the fractional departure of relative sea level rise from that expected given the ice contribution to global mean sea level. For example, when ice is lost from the Greenland Ice Sheet the relative effect on the US West Coast is 75% of the sea-level rise expected from the water volume added to the ocean. By comparison, when ice is lost from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet the US West Coast experiences 125% of sea-level rise from that expected from the water volume added. The Earth's surface has also continued to warm. Sixteen of the 17 warmest years in the 136-year period of global temperature measurements have all occurred since 2001. ii 2016 was the warmest year on record, and it was the 3rd year in a row that the record was broken. Arctic sea ice at the peak of the summer melt season now typically covers 40% less area than it did in the early 1980s. Arctic sea ice extent in September, the seasonal low point in the annual cycle, has been declining at a rate of about 13% per decade. iii"}, {"section_title": "GIS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Advances in observing and modeling sea-level rise", "text": "Of the major contributors to global sea-level rise, the loss of ice from the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets has the greatest potential to increase sea levels. Contributions from ice sheet losses also present the greatest uncertainty in the rate and amount of sea-level rise at time horizons beyond the next few decades. In the past five years (since the existing State guidance document was developed), new models and observations have highlighted this possibility and advanced our understanding of the dynamics of ice loss, and the atmospheric and ocean conditions that can drive significant loss. A more comprehensive discussion of this topic is provided in Appendix 2. Observational data from the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellites, which measure the Earth's gravitational field, have revealed increased loss of land ice from Greenland and West Antarctica [13], and confirmed previous observations. Satellite altimeter data show increased loss of grounded land ice from West Antarctica, and evidence of accelerated volume loss of ice shelves in West Antarctica, which buttress grounded ice [22]. i https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/monthly.html ii https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-noaa-data-show-2016-warmest-year-on-record-globally iii https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/sea-ice-extent-sinks-to-record-lows-at-both-poles  will be; so even if the physics were perfectly captured in the models, there would still be major uncertainty about which processes will become important as the   it is scientifically premature to estimate the probability that the H++ scenario will come to pass, and, if so, when the world will move onto the H++ trajectory. One important point that is underscored by the ad hoc approaches is that the mechanisms driving Antarctic ice mass loss today are different than those that may drive future ice sheet collapse. Although sea-level rise is not following the H++ scenario at this moment, this scenario cannot be excluded for the second half of this century on these grounds."}, {"section_title": "Timeframes and planning horizons", "text": "The projections of sea-level rise provided here are averages across an interval of 19 contiguous years, centered on 2030, 2050, 2100 and 2150.

Considerable local variability is evident in rates of sea-level rise recorded across these tide gauges, simply because they are all anchored on some land mass or structure that may be experiencing long-term uplift or subsidence (Box 2). We selected three of these gauges to use as the basis for sea-level rise projections: Crescent City, San Francisco Golden Gate, and La Jolla. Although there is considerable local variation that they do not represent, these gauges span the broad scale geographic extent of the California coastline taking into account the changing tectonic context along the coastline, the gradient of storm and wave climate from north to south, and in consideration of centers of human population and development.  Long-term change is listed on top of each record in mm/year. Short-term increases in sea level (such as 1982-93 and1997-98 El Ni\u00f1os) are clear in the records for all three stations."}, {"section_title": "How much sea-level rise will California experience?", "text": "Using the methodology of Kopp et al. 2014, we provide projections of sea-level rise that are based on the data from tide gauges in Crescent City, San Francisco and La Jolla ( Figure 3, Table 1). As described above (Section 3.1.1), these projections may underestimate the probability of extreme Antarctic ice loss, an outcome that is highly uncertain but, given recent observations and model results, cannot be ignored. Accordingly, we have also included an extreme sea-level rise scenario, which we call the H++ scenario. This is an unknown probability, high consequence scenario such as would occur if high rates of Antarctic ice loss were to develop in the last half of this century. When decisions involve consequential infrastructure, facilities or assets, we advise that extra consideration be given to this upper end of potential sea-level rise outcomes. We note that the differences in projections under different emissions scenarios before 2050 are minor. By comparison, after 2050, projections increasingly depend on greenhouse gas emissions. Accordingly, we present only projections for RCP 8.5 through 2050, and distinguish between emissions pathways for 2100 and 2150. Sea-level rise projections for RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6 are calculated using the methodology of Kopp et al., 2014. The shaded areas bounded by the dashed lines denote the 5th and 95th percentiles. The H++ scenario corresponds to the Extreme scenario of Sweet et al. 2017and represents a world consistent with rapid Antarctic ice sheet mass loss. Note that the behavior of the Antarctic ice sheet early in this century is governed by different processes than those which would drive rapid mass loss; although the world is not presently following the H++ scenario, this does not exclude the possibility of getting onto this path later in the century. The historical global mean sea level curve in (a) is from .   We recognize that planning decisions are often informed by estimates of rates of sea-level rise and estimates of when a particular level of sea-level rise is projected to occur. Rates of sea-level rise provide important context for the time needed to plan and implement adaptation options. They are also an important consideration in evaluating when and where natural infrastructure is a feasible and prudent choice for helping to mitigate the effects of sea-level rise. In some locations, rates of sea-level rise may exceed the rate at which habitats (e.g., seagrass beds, coastal marshes) can migrate and adapt. It is also important to keep in mind that while these natural habitats may provide some buffer to future sea-level rise in estuarine environments (San Francisco Bay, for example), on the exposed, high-energy, open coast, there are very few locations where biological buffers or habitats exist to provide any significant reduction to the impacts of coastal flooding and erosion from future sea-level rise. Employing the methodology of Kopp et al. (2014), and consistent with the projections above, we provide probabilistic estimates of the rates of sea-level rise at each of the three selected tide gauges: Crescent City, San Francisco and La Jolla (Table 2). We also provide tables of probabilities that sea-level rise will meet or exceed a given height for RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6 at each of the three tide gauges (Tables 3, 4 and 5). Under the H++ scenario, with rapid ice-sheet loss in the Antarctic, average rates of sea-level rise in California would exceed 50 mm/year (2 inches/year) by the end of the century. Projections are based on the methodology of Kopp et al., 2014 with the exception of the H++ scenario. For example, there is a 50% probability that sea-level rise rates in San Francisco between 2030-2050 will be at least 3.8 mm/year. The 'likely-range' is consistent with the terms used by the IPCC meaning that it has about a 2-in-3 chance of containing the correct value. The H++ scenario is a single scenario, not a probabilistic projection, and does not have an associated distribution in the same sense as the other projections; it is presented in the same column for ease of comparison.     In this report we adopt an approach (that of Kopp et al., 2014)  3.4. How do these projections compare with other regional and national projections? Projections are provided for 2100 according to the approach described in each report. The different approaches reflect the evolution of modeling techniques to project sea-level rise including new approaches to provide greater geographic resolution in projections and probabilistic projections, as well as the different intended purposes of the assessments (i.e., state and national). In brief, the figure depicts: CA 1st, 2nd, Increasing the reliability of future sea-level projections will be important in decisionmaking for both existing and proposed development and infrastructure. This is a tractable problem, but it will require concerted action on two fronts. First, it will require improved scientific understanding of mass-loss processes from the vast polar ice sheets across all the relevant spatial and temporal scales. This can only be achieved through continued and new observations from satellites and the field (both on the ice and in the surrounding atmosphere and ocean), combined with modeling to investigate key processes such as ice-ocean interactions, surface melting, and fracture mechanics of ice. This will require substantial international and interagency investment to support collaborations across the disciplines of glaciology, meteorology, oceanography, and computational science. Second, it will require tighter integration between the scientific and decision-making communities such that feedbacks from the latter can inform, via recursive process of scientific analysis and stakeholder deliberations [53,54], future sea-level rise studies and projections."}, {"section_title": "Model uncertainty", "text": "Advances in our understanding of global, regional, and local sea-level rise are already occurring and substantial advances are expected within the next decade. In the meantime, research currently underway and expected in the next one to five years includes improved understanding of the warming thresholds capable of driving substantial retreat in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Given these expected rapid developments, the approach taken here allows for relatively frequent updates of location-specific sea-level rise projections. Updating of the science underpinning California's statewide guidance will be important as our understanding of these ice-sheet contributions to sea-level rise increases, and/or the range of likely future emissions scenarios begins to narrow. In addition, the explicit consideration of an extreme H++ scenario of indeterminate probability flags for decision-makers the potential for extreme outcomes. Based on some modeling studies the possibility of such extreme sea-level rise is now supported and may come to be viewed as either more or less likely as scientific understanding evolves."}, {"section_title": "Informing near-term decisions", "text": "These projections of future sea level and changing coastal hazards can and should be used along with a comprehensive assessment of what is at risk (i.e., exposed to future coastal hazards) and what is at stake (i.e., the monetized and non-monetary values attached to what is exposed) to weigh the different types of costs, and potential losses and benefits of taking action now to prevent future harm against the wide-ranging risks of inaction [55]. However, doing so will require the development of decision-support systems that help California decision-makers and stakeholders to decompose what will be complex, uncertain, and inter-temporal decisions into more manageable parts. Various approaches are available for decision analysis and decision-making under uncertainty that aim to go beyond economic efficiency in determining the best possible way forward in the face of multiple objectives and criteria for making difficult choices [55,56]. At their core, these approaches help stakeholders and decision-makers to identify, define, and bound management problems and opportunities; they help these same groups to identify, characterize, and operationalize a shared set of objectives to guide management choices; these approaches emphasize the importance of characterizing the anticipated consequences, based on scientific assessments, of a broad array of different development and management alternatives; and they support the need for tradeoffs when objectives across alternatives inevitably conflict [57][58][59]. These decision-support approaches, together with numerous studies on the cost of inaction, generally suggest that uncertainty about the exact amount of future sea-level rise should not be a deterrent to taking action now [60][61][62]. Adaptation and hazard mitigation decisions and investments in the near-term can prevent much greater losses (many times the initial cost) than would incur if such action were not taken (e.g., [63,64]). The forthcoming, updated sea-level rise policy guidance will thus provide a decision-centric approach to using sea-level rise projections that is informed by a clear understanding of the decisionmakers and the decision contexts. It will guide decision-makers through a systematic and defensible process that assists them in framing and structuring the decisions at hand, explicitly laying out objectives and decision criteria, laying out distinct solution options and assessing them in the context of sea-level rise projections and key uncertainties, directly confronting trade-offs, and setting up an adaptive management process going forward [56,65]. In addition, providing recommendations for how to effectively communicate sea-level rise risks and meaningfully engage stakeholders in these challenging planning and decision processes can make the use of uncertain sea-level rise projections in decision making easier and ultimately lead to decisions that reflect decision-makers' risk tolerances and desired outcomes.

These massive ice sheets represent the greatest potential threat to the long-term sustainability of coastal populations and infrastructure."}, {"section_title": "Cai W,", "text": "Recently, the loss of land ice has surpassed ocean thermal expansion as the largest contributor to sealevel rise (Figure 1). Land ice contributions come from mountain glaciers and small ice caps and the polar ice sheets (Antarctica and Greenland). While glaciers and ice caps continue to contribute substantial meltwater to the oceans (Meier et al., 2009;Marzeion et al., 2012), satellite observations ( Figure 2) indicate that the rate of mass loss from Greenland and Antarctica is accelerating (Harig and Simons, 2015;Velicogna et al., 2014). The ice sheets have recently taken over as the dominant source of landice sea-level rise, with the potential to raise GMSL by several meters in future centuries (Clark et al., 2016;DeConto and Pollard, 2016;Golledge et al., 2015;Huybrechts et al., 2011;Robinson et al., 2012;Winkelmann et al., 2015). The Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) is currently losing mass at a faster rate than the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS; Figure 1), via a roughly equal combination of surface melt and dynamic thinning of its marginal outlet glaciers (Csatho et al., 2014;Moon et al., 2012). As surface melt increases, particularly around its lower elevation ice margins, the GIS will continue to lose mass at an increasing rate (Huybrechts et al., 2011;van den Broeke et al., 2009). In contrast, Antarctica's recent increase in mass loss is not through surface melt, but is instead mostly related to the increasing flow and retreat of outlet glaciers in the Amundsen Sea region of West Antarctica Pritchard et al., 2012;Rignot et al., 2014). As discussed below, warming ocean temperatures in this region are thinning ice shelves (the floating, seaward extensions of the glaciers) triggering a dynamic response of the grounded ice upstream (Pritchard et al., 2012;Paolo et al., 2015). NASA's Ice, Cloud and land Elevation (ICESat) mission revealed major mass loss from Antarctica's ice shelves (Pritchard et al., 2012) and grounded ice sheet (Shepherd et al., 2012)   1992 (black line) relative to contributions from 1) the total change in ocean mass contributed by land ice (mountain glaciers, ice caps and the polar ice sheets), and smaller contributions from groundwater and land water storage (Johnson and Chambers, 2013) (blue), and 2) the contribution from thermal (thermo-steric) expansion of the upper ocean (red) from Argo floats (Roemmich and Gilson, 2009). Note that increasing ocean mass, mostly from melting land ice, is now the dominant source of sea-level rise (Figure source:   (Velicogna et al., 2014;Velicogna and Wahr, 2013). Note the widely distributed ice loss around much of the Greenland Ice Sheet margin. In contrast, Antarctica's ice mass loss is concentrated in the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica, where warming sub-surface ocean temperatures are in direct contact with the underside of ice shelves (figure source: NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory). The image at right shows the rate of change in the surface elevation of the Antarctic ice sheet between 2010 and 2013, measured by satellite altimetry. Note the coherence between gravity and altimetry measurements, and the concentrated thinning of Amundsen Sea outlet glaciers (from McMillan et al., 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Greenland's Contribution to Future Sea Level", "text": "While Greenland is currently a greater contributor to sea-level rise than Antarctica, ice sheet modeling studies spanning a range of future warming scenarios and timescales (Goelzer et al., 2012;Huybrechts et al., 2011;Seddik et al., 2012), show that the potential for the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) to contribute truly catastrophic sea-level rise is limited. Most projections of Greenland's contribution to GMSL by the year 2100 are below 25 cm (10 inches), even in high-end greenhouse-gas emissions scenarios . While the balance between the rate of accumulating snowfall and the rate of meltwater and iceberg discharged to the ocean is sensitive to relatively modest warming (>2\u00b0 C above 19th century temperatures), modeling studies show that the near-complete loss of the GIS will be measured in millennia (Figure 3), not decades or centuries (Robinson et al., 2012). Figure 3. Future projections of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The percentage of Greenland ice volume lost in model simulations (left) using a range of melt-rate parameterizations and increasing summer temperature anomalies from 2 to 8\u00b0C (Robinson et al., 2012), whereby 100% loss is equivalent to a 7.4 m rise in global mean sea level. Note the jump in ice-sheet loss with summer temperature anomalies >2\u00b0C. Climate-ice sheet simulations (right) assuming a 4-fold increase in CO 2 concentrations over the next 200 years and maintained into the future (Huybrechts, et al., 2011). In both examples, substantial loss of the ice sheet takes centuries to millennia. Ice Loss from Antarctica will Impact California More than an Equivalent Ice Loss from Greenland GMSL is clearly rising (Figure 1), but it is relative sea level (RSL), the local difference in elevation between the height of the sea-surface and the height of the solid-Earth surface, that directly impacts coastal communities and ecosystems at risk from coastal flooding. 3 The rise in RSL from shrinking glaciers and ice sheets is not uniformly distributed around the Earth. Changes in the distribution of ice and water over the Earth's surface affects its gravitational field, the orientation and rate Earth's rotation, and the deformation of the Earth's crust and mantle . While the crust and mantle respond on long (millennial) timescales, the gravitational/rotational effects are essentially instantaneous (annual timescales) and have particular relevance for California. As a retreating ice sheet loses mass to the ocean, its gravitational pull on the surrounding ocean is reduced. Within a few thousand kilometers of a retreating ice sheet, the reduced gravitational pull on the ocean causes the sea-surface and thus RSL to drop, even though the ocean has gained volume overall. At some distance further away from the ice sheet (~7000 km), and rate of rotation, which slightly modifies the main gravitational response. The Earth's crust also flexes in response to the change in loading, affecting the height of the land; and given enough time, the Earth's viscous mantle also responds, but these are slower processes generally measured in thousands of years ). 4 Calculations of the gravitational and rotational effects (Figure 4), sometimes called sea level \"fingerprints\" , show that North America experiences more sea-level rise from a given meltwater contribution from Antarctica than Greenland, and if the ice loss is from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), the impacts are exaggerated even further. In fact, for California, there is no worse place for land ice to be lost than from West Antarctica (Figure 4). In the near-term, the WAIS is widely considered the most vulnerable major ice sheet to a warming ocean and atmosphere, and serious changes there are already underway, particularly in the Amundsen Sea region Paolo et al., 2015). Consequently, this report focuses on emerging science regarding the vulnerability of the polar ice sheets with a special emphasis on West Antarctica. . Sea-level \"fingerprints\" Hay et al., 2017).

The map at right shows the response from an equivalent mass loss from the the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). The units are the fractional departure of RSL relative to a given change in GMSL. Note that the U.S. West Coast only experiences about 75% of the GMSL rise contributed by Greenland (left), but the rise in RSL is about 25% greater than expected if meltwater is added to the ocean from West Antarctica (Figure, compliments of Carling Hay)."}, {"section_title": "Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets are Fundamentally Different", "text": "The ice sheets covering Greenland and Antarctica behave differently, in part because of the different climate regimes they occupy (relatively warm with massive snowfall on Greenland, versus cold and dry on Antarctica), but more fundamentally, because their subglacial topographies are so different. The bedrock beneath the GIS is above sea level around most of its margin, and below sea-level only in the interior (Figure 5). As a result, much of the ice in the GIS margin is terrestrial, with fast-flowing tidewater glaciers reaching the ocean in deep fjords (Moon et al., 2012). The GIS outlet glaciers lose mass via approximately equal proportions of iceberg calving and melting at their termini. The AIS, in contrast, contains more than seven times more grounded ice above sea level than the GIS. 5 Moreover, nearly half of the AIS sits on bedrock that is hundreds of meters (or more) below sea level (Fretwell et al., 2013). In many places around the Antarctic margin, grounded ice flows into the ocean and lifts off the bedrock to form large ice shelves; platforms of floating ice that extend over the ocean to form deep sub ice-shelf cavities. The location where the grounded, seaward flowing ice first loses contact with the bedrock to become an ice shelf is called the \"grounding line\" (Figure 6). Rather than surface melt, almost all of Antarctica's mass loss processes occur in the ice shelves: oceanic basal melting in the sub-ice cavities and iceberg calving from the ice fronts Paolo et al. 2015). Importantly, the ice shelves exert a back stress on the grounded ice, inhibiting its seaward flow, a process commonly called \"buttressing\" (Weertman, 1974;Thomas et al., 2004;Schoof, 2007). Thinning or loss of these ice-shelves reduces or eliminates this buttressing effect, allowing the grounded ice to flow faster toward the ocean (Rignot et al., 2004;Pritchard et al., 2012;Harig andSimmons, 2015, Paolo et al., 2015). In many places in Antarctica, especially in West Antarctica, deep troughs beneath the ice extend inland from the grounding lines, and slope downward toward the interior of the continent, eventually leading to submarine basins that can be more than 1 km deep. For example, Thwaites Glacier ( Figure 5) rests on a reverse-sloped bed, leading to the deep WAIS interior (see Figures 6 and 7) where there is enough ice above floatation to raise GMSL by ~3 m (9.8 feet). 6 Vast areas of the much larger East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) also rest in deep sub-marine basins and these East Antarctic basins contain enough ice to raise GMSL by ~19 m (62 feet) if the ice they contain were lost to the ocean. With a few exceptions (e.g., Totten Glacier), the majority of the EAIS ice shelves and outlet glaciers are currently stable Paolo et al., 2015), but that situation could change with increased ocean and atmospheric warming. Key Processes at Play in Antarctica (Marine-Based Ice) The climate in Antarctica is colder than in Greenland, but because most of the ice sheet margin terminates in the deep ocean, its outlet glaciers, grounding lines, and the underside of buttressing ice shelves are vulnerable to even modest amounts of ocean warming. In part, this is because the melting point of ice becomes lower with increasing water depth (Holland et al., 2008;Jacobs et al., 2011;Paolo et al., 2015;Shepherd, 2004 (Pritchard et al., 2012;Steig et al., 2012). Currently, the Southern Ocean is taking up more heat and warming faster than other parts of the global ocean (Levitus et al., 2012;Masahiro et al., 2013), especially at intermediate depths (Schmidtko, et al., 2014) where CDW has the potential to flow into sub ice-shelf cavities,. Many marine-based Antarctic outlet glaciers rest on bedrock hundreds of meters to more than 1 km below sea level ( Figure 5), and many of these have reverse-sloped beds. In places with this reverse-sloped geometry, including much of WAIS and deep EAIS subglacial basins , the ice sheet is susceptible to a Marine Ice Sheet Instability (MISI; Figure 6), whereby a reduction in ice-shelf buttressing causes an initial grounding-line retreat onto a reversesloped bed, which triggers a non-linear acceleration of ice loss and ongoing retreat of the ice margin, because the seaward flow of ice is strongly dependent on the grounding line's thickness (Pollard and DeConto, 2009;Schoof, 2007;Weertman, 1974) which thickens upstream. Figure 6. A time-evolving schematic sequence illustrating marine ice sheet instability (a-c), whereby a ~1-km deep, marine terminating ice-sheet margin with reverse-sloped bed is undergoing ice-shelf thinning due to oceanic warming. Note the sequentially thickening grounding lines (red dashed lines) from top to bottom and enhanced seaward ice flux as the ice margin retreats landward into a deepening basin. Once set in motion, even if the ocean forcing is removed, the retreat will continue until the grounding line meets upward sloping bedrock or a topographic bump, or if a confined ice shelf can reform to provide some buttressing against the seaward ice flow.  Figure 5 for location). The underlying bed is clearly visible. The glacier is ~120 km wide where it reaches the ocean (right) and reaches back into a deep, ice-filled basin almost 2 km below sea level (left) under the heart of the WAIS. The grounding line (vertical white line) is currently retreating on a reverse-sloped bed and undergoing MISI at an estimated rate of ~1 km per year . Its current grounding line thickness is too thin (~600m) to trigger widespread ice-cliff instability (see below), but that situation could change if its current retreat continues (figure source: Alley et al., 2015). The key glaciological processes associated with MISI have been known for decades, and studied with theoretical, analytical, and numerical models along flowlines or in limited-area domains (Cornford et al., 2015;Favier et al., 2014;Schoof, 2007;Weertman, 1974). There are various and well established approaches to independently model the grounded (e.g., Oerlemans, 1982;Huybrechts, 1994;Pattyn et al., 2003;Le Meur et al., 2004) and floating components of marine ice sheets (Morland, 1986;MacAyeal, 1989). However, coupling the grounded component (where vertical shear dominates ice flow) and the floating part (where horizontal stretching dominates) is a challenge, and requires either high spatial resolution at the transition between the grounded and floating ice (Goldberg et al., 2009;Cornford, et al., 2015) or a parameterization of the ice flow across the grounding zone (Schoof, 2007;Pollard and DeConto, 2012). Regardless of the approach, simplifications must be made to allow the computational efficiency needed to run a marine ice sheet model for an entire ice sheet for long time periods. "}, {"section_title": "Emerging Science and Previously Underappreciated Glaciological Processes", "text": "Recently, another glaciological process: Marine Ice Cliff Instability (MICI); Figure 8), not previously considered at the continental ice-sheet scale, was shown to have a profound effect on ice sheet simulations in climates warmer than today (DeConto and Pollard, 2016;Pollard et al., 2015). With summer warming sufficient to produce extensive meltwater ponding around the Antarctic margin, as expected to occur within decades if greenhouse gas emissions continue at their present rates (Trusel et al., 2015), it is possible that water-filled crevasses may 'hydrofracture' ice shelves (Banwell et al., 2013). This was witnessed during the breakup of the Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula in 2002 (Scambos et al., 2000). If this were to happen to ice shelves that currently protect thick grounding lines where the bedrock has a reverse slope, this could not only trigger MISI, but could also result in tall ice cliffs,   Figure 6, but feeling the effects of both sub iceshelf oceanic warming and atmospheric warming. Meltwater and rainwater accumulating on the iceshelf surface can fill crevasses (a), which deepens the crevasses, potentially leading to hydrofracturing (b). If the newly exposed grounding line is thick enough to have a tall subaerial ice cliff (c), the terminus would fail structurally. If the rate of structural failure outpaces the seaward flow of ice, the ice margin would back into the deep basin (after DeConto and Pollard, 2016), resulting in a massive loss of ice. The parameterization of complex processes in models usually relies on real-world observations. In the case of ice-cliff retreat, one major limitation is that marine-terminating grounding lines that are 1) thick enough to generate ~100m tall ice cliffs, and 2) have completely lost their ice shelves (like the Helheim and Jakobsavn Glaciers in Greenland; Figure 9) are few and far between today. While widespread MICI has not yet been observed in Antarctica, observations on the Antarctic Peninsula (Rignot et al, 2004;Scambos et al., 2004) and in Greenland (Joughin et al., 2008)   , but most of the grounding zone is currently resting on bedrock too shallow (Millan et al., 2017) to form a cliff face tall enough to induce MICI (Bassis and Walker, 2012). If grounding line retreat continues into the deep basin upstream, MICI could be initiated, exacerbating the rate of ice mass loss in West Antarctica. Helheim glacier in Southeast Greenland. The heavily crevassed glacier has no ice shelf and is thick enough at the calving front to produce a ~100m tall subaerial ice cliff. The cliff is failing structurally, with the calving front retreating at a rate roughly equivalent to the seaward flow of the glacier (~10 km year), despite the dense m\u00e9lange trapped within the narrow, 5-km wide fjord. In Antarctica, taller and vastly wider ice cliffs could emerge if ice shelves are lost to warming ocean and atmospheric temperatures (photo: Knut Christianson)."}, {"section_title": "Implications of MISI and MICI for California's Future", "text": "Accounting for MICI in an ice sheet can model dramatically increase future sea level projections, and because the epicenter of change will most likely be in WAIS, California would be especially impacted ( Figure 2). After including MISI and MICI in their ice sheet model, DeConto and Pollard (2016) tested the performance of the model against the only reasonable analogue for future sea-level: times in the geologic past when GMSL was higher than today and Antarctic temperatures were known to be warmer. The benchmarks they used were the Last Interglacial (LIG, about 125 thousand years ago) and the middle Pliocene (about 3 million years ago). During the Last Interglacial, global mean temperatures were similar to today (Capron et al., 2014;Hoffman et al., 2017), but GMSL was about 6 to 9 meters (20-30 feet) higher (Dutton et al., 2015). Most of the sea-level rise is now thought to have come from Antarctica, because Greenland is believed to have remained partially to mostly intact at that time (Dahl-Jensen et al., 2013;Stone et al., 2013), although the precise magnitude of Greenland retreat continues to be re-evaluated (e.g. Yau et al., 2016). Nonetheless, Last Interglacial sea levels provide a powerful message that the polar ice sheets are sensitive to modest warming. Global average temperatures during the middle Pliocene were warmer than the LIG, 2\u00b0-3\u00b0 warmer than today. GMSL, while uncertain, is thought to have been in the range of 10-30m (30 to 90 feet) higher than present (Miller et al., 2012;Rovere et al., 2014), requiring a substantial contribution from East Antarctica in addition to Greenland Depending on their assumptions about the magnitude of Pliocene sea levels, which affect the choice of model physical parameters (Pliocene sea-level estimates are more uncertain than LIG estimates), DeConto and Pollard (2016) found that Antarctica has the potential to contribute between 64 \u00b1 0.49 cm and 105 \u00b1 0.30 cm (25 \u00b1 0.19 inches and 41 \u00b1 12 inches) of sea-level rise by the year 2100 in the warmest future greenhouse gas scenario ( Figure 10). Another important implication of the study was the recognition that by 2100, the rate of Antarctica's contribution to sea-level rise could be in the range of 2 cm (almost an inch) per year. This finding is fundamentally different than the assessment of the IPCC AR5 , which concluded that Antarctica would contribute little if any GMSL rise by the year 2100, even in the highest greenhouse gas forcing scenario, Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8. 5 (van Vuuren et al., 2011). While at the high end, the results point to the potential for much higher sea levels than previously considered, but they also demonstrate a much reduced risk of future sealevel rise from Antarctica if the lowest greenhouse gas emissions pathway (RCP2.6) is followed. 7 Figure 10. Ensembles of Antarctic's future contribution to sea level, using paleo-calibrated ice-model physics, highresolution atmospheric climatologies from a regional atmospheric model, and time-evolving ocean model temperatures (from DeConto and Pollard, 2016). The inset at right shows time-evolving CO 2 concentrations (RCPs) used to force the ice sheet simulations (from van Vuuren et al., 2011). Note that different colors are used to represent the RCPs and ice sheet ensembles. The difference between the ensembles at left versus right lies in the assumptions used in the model calibration (based on geological sea-level reconstructions). These differences demonstrate the large uncertainty remaining in current projections. The timing when Antarctica begins major retreat in RCP4.5 and 8.5 (after ~2060) also remains uncertain. In addition to greenhouse-gas forcing, the onset of major retreat will be dependent on the trajectory of Antarctic warming in response to a complex combination of factors including recovery of the ozone hole, linkages with tropical dynamics, and feedbacks between the ice-sheet, solid-Earth, ocean, and sea-ice which are not accounted for here. Addressing these shortcomings and uncertainties will be the focus of future work. The Loss of Marine-Based Ice is a Multi-Millennial Commitment. Another underappreciated consequence of the loss of marine-based ice (as in WAIS) is that it can only readvance (regrow) if confined ice shelves can be reestablished. The shelves are required to buttress the grounding line, allowing it to migrate seaward on its reverse-sloped bed. Because ice-shelf melt rates are so sensitive to a warm ocean (Holland et al., 2008;Shepherd, 2004), the ocean will have to cool down before the ice shelves can reform. Because of the large thermal \"inertia\" of the ocean, this could take centuries to several thousands of years, after greenhouse gas concentrations return to their preindustrial levels (Winkelmann et al., 2015). The net result is that sea-level rise driven by the loss of marine-based ice (like WAIS) will remain elevated for thousands of years (DeConto and Pollard, 2016)."}, {"section_title": "Reducing Risk of a Serious Sea Level Contribution from Antarctica", "text": "The RCP2.6 ensemble averages in Figure 10 suggest Antarctica will make only a small contribution to 21st century sea-level rise if future greenhouse gas emissions are strictly limited. However, some of the individual RCP2.6 simulations do involve serious WAIS retreat ( Figure 11), with the two highest (of 58) ensemble members exceeding a 50 cm (20 inches) contribution to GMSL by 2100. This implies that the risk of threatening sea-level rise, while much reduced, is not completely eliminated in the scenario with the lowest emissions. This finding is in general agreement with other recent modeling studies and observations of the Amundsen Sea outlet glaciers (Thwaites in particular), suggesting that MISI has commenced in that location and retreat into the heart of the WAIS could be irreversible (e.g., Rignot et al., 2014;. More observational and modeling work will be required, before a precise climatic threshold for unstoppable WAIS retreat can be defined. In preliminary studies, a combined atmospheric and oceanic warming in the Amundsen Sea region of 2-3\u00b0C is found to be enough to trigger major retreat of the WAIS (Scambos et al., in press), but the timing when that much regional warming will appear in the Amundsen Sea remains difficult to predict. Figure 11. Two individual members of the RCP2.6 ice sheet ensembles ( Figure 10) using identical future climate forcing (ocean and atmospheric temperatures), but slightly different model parameters controlling oceanic sub-ice melt rates, sensitivity of hydrofracturing to surface meltwater, and the maximum rate of ice-cliff failure. In this case, both versions of the model are equally capable of simulating realistic modern and ancient ice sheets, so both results can be considered possible future outcomes. As in most RCP2.6 simulations, the model on the left produces almost no contribution to future sea-level rise. In contrast, the model on the right undergoes dramatic retreat of Thwaites Glacier and near compete loss of the WAIS within 500 years. Despite the limited warming in the RCP2.6 scenario, the model on the right produces ~57 cm (22 inches) of GMSL rise by 2100. Reducing the range of uncertainty in future ice sheet simulations should be a top priority. How Much Confidence Should be Placed in the New Projections? The obvious question is: how confident can we be in the recent model projections? First, it should be emphasized that the model ensembles ( Figure 10   . Another limitation is the interaction between the retreating ice sheet and the surrounding ocean. Massive volumes of fresh meltwater and ice volumes flowing into the Southern Ocean as the ice sheet retreats could enhance sea ice production, which might ameliorate the pace of atmospheric warming (Bintanja et al., 2013). At the same time, the resulting ocean stratification could enhance heat buildup in the subsurface, increasing ocean melt rates (Hansen et al., 2016). Interactively coupling ice and ocean models is a major challenge and accounting for these interactions at the continental scale is currently a priority of the international ice sheet modeling community. Another missing feedback is that between the retreating ice sheet and relative sea level at the grounding line. The reduced gravitational pull on the surrounding ocean as the ice sheet retreats leads to a local relative sea level drop at the grounding line. This can have a stabilizing effect on some retreating groundling lines, particularly in places where the onset of MISI is close to a threshold (Gomez et al., 2015). While this negative feedback reduces the total amount of modeled ice sheet retreat on millennial timescales, it has only a small influence in the near-term and is not likely to substantially reduce sea level rise risk on decadal to century timescales. In DeConto and Pollard (2016) and other recent Antarctic modeling studies (e.g., Cornford et al., 2015;Golledge et al., 2015), ice sheet retreat early in the 21st century is largely driven by sub-surface ocean warming and MISI as illustrated in Figure 6. Ocean models are well known to do a poor job simulating recent sub-surface warming trends around Antarctica A further possible complication is related to firn, old snow that is transitioning to ice and forms a layer below the newer snow. In a warming world, more snow is anticipated to fall over the EAIS, and hence the firn layer will thicken, at least in the short term. As summer air temperatures begin to exceed the freezing point, meltwater will be absorbed by the underlying firn, as long as there is remaining poor space between snow grains to allow refreezing ( Figure 12). Eventually, ice lenses will begin to form, the firn will compact, and it will no longer have the ability to absorb summer melt water. At that point, meltwater will have the potential to flow into underlying crevasses where it can cause hydrofracturing. Presently, the meltwater-buffering capacity of firn is poorly represented in most ice-sheet models. Because of this limitation, the timing when hydrofracturing begins to impact ice shelves in the models could be occurring sooner (by years to a few decades) than it will in reality. With that said, in the warmest (RCP8.5) scenario, so much meltwater would begin to appear over the ice shelves by the second half of the 21st century, the firn layer would be quickly overcome regardless of its thickness or the details of the firn model. However, in more moderate warming scenarios closer to a meltwater/ hydrofracturing threshold, the buffering capacity of the firn layer could be a determining factor of the timing when hydrofracturing might begin. Could Future Sea-Level Rise be Even Worse than the new Projections? The future ice sheet projections in DeConto and Pollard (2016) imply the potential for substantially more sealevel rise (2 m or more by 2100) than any previous model results. This is largely due to the explicit treatment of the hydrofracturing and ice-cliff physics described above. While the results remain uncertain for the reasons described here, it should be stressed that the ensemble averages in Figure 10, do not represent the model's maximum possible rates of Antarctica's contribution to sea-level rise. In the model cliff-collapse (the horizontal rate of ice-loss at the marine \"tidewater\" calving terminus) only occurs where ice cliffs are tall enough to generate stresses that exceed the strength of the ice. The rate of cliff retreat ranges from near zero where this stress-strength threshold is just exceeded, to some maximum allowable rate, regardless of the cliff height. This \"speed limit\" imposed on the model's representation of ice-cliff retreat is meant to represent 1) the average size and frequency of individual calving events, which involve brittle fracture mechanics and modes of ice failure whose controlling factors are not well understood, and 2) the buttressing effects of m\u00e9lange (icebergs and fragments of icebergs locked together by sea ice) at the ice terminus. Faster cliff collapse should generate more m\u00e9lange, providing a negative feedback that dampens the rate of retreat. In the future ice-sheet ensembles shown in Figure 10, a range of maximum cliff-failure rates are used, ranging between one and five km per year. At the tallest vertical ice cliffs observed today (e.g., Helheim and Jakobsavn glaciers in Greenland), the horizontal rate of cliff retreat is as high as 10-14km per year (Joughin et al., 2010;. This is quite remarkable, considering these outlet glaciers rest in narrow fjords 5 to 12 km wide, choked with dense m\u00e9lange as seen in Figure 9. In Antarctica, the cliff faces that could appear in the future will be much taller and wider than those in Greenland, "}, {"section_title": "Other Recent Antarctic Modeling", "text": "In the last year, several other modeling studies of the AIS' future were published in high profile journals (e.g., Clark et al., 2016, Golledge et al., 2015, Ritz et al., 2015, and Winkelmann et al., 2015. Among these, Ritz et al., (2015) and Golledge et al., (2015)  following the A1B emissions scenario used in IPCC AR4 (Solomon et al., 2007). 8 In places where they project MISI to begin, the persistence and rate of groundingline retreat is parameterized as a function of the local bedrock topography (slope), grounding line thickness (Schoof et al., 2007), basal slipperiness, and one of three different model treatments of basal friction which is shown to provide considerable uncertainty. The advantage of the approach used by Ritz et al., (2016)  Pollard's model. As a result, Golledge et al., (2015) find they can produce 39 cm (10 inches) of GMSL by 2100 from Antarctic in RCP8.5 (mainly through MISI), 8 Greenhouse gas emissions scenario A1B is roughly intermediate between RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. without the MICI physics used by DeConto and Pollard, (2016). Using a more conservative oceanic melt-rate parameterization in their simulations, the GMSL contribution drops from 39 to 10 cm by 2100, highlighting the ongoing uncertainty in heavily parameterized continental-scale ice sheet models, particularly with regard to their sensitivity to a warming ocean. While Ritz et al. (2015) and Golledge et al. (2015) both simulate less ice sheet retreat by 2100 than DeConto and Pollard (2016), these studies still represent a considerable departure from IPCC AR5 , which assessed little to no contribution to future sea level from Antarctica by 2100, even under the high-emissions RCP8.5 scenario. Furthermore, despite the enhanced sensitivity of the PISM model to a warming ocean, Golledge et al. (2015) also find that a low emissions scenario like RCP2.6 essentially eliminates the risk of a substantial future sea-level contribution from Antarctica. This important conclusion is in agreement with the findings of DeConto and Pollard (2016)."}, {"section_title": "Outlook: The Science is Moving Quickly", "text": "Recent advances in monitoring and modeling the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are leading to steady improvements in our understanding of the underlying processes driving ice-sheet retreat, but the multifaceted complexity of the coupled ice-atmosphere-ocean-Earth system continues to hamper predictions of the ice sheet's future. A number of coordinated, international programs are either just getting underway, or are planned in the near future with the goal of reducing uncertainty in future sea-level rise. Among others, these include, the NRC ESAS 2007 Decadal Survey, which identified the following as a major science question for satellite observations of Earth over the next decade: \"Will there be catastrophic collapse of the major ice sheets, including those of Greenland and West Antarctica and, if so, how rapidly will this occur? What will be the time patterns of sea-level rise as a result?\" It recommended three key Earth-observation missions for ice-sheet monitoring: (i) DESDynI (now NiSAR, a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to estimate surface deformation); (ii) Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) (laser altimeter to estimate ice sheet height) and (iii) a follow on to the current GRACE satellite. NISAR will launch in 2020, and the other two missions are due for launch within the next 2 years. Operation IceBridge is an airborne mission carrying instruments such as an laser altimeter and a sounding radar to bridge the gap between ICESat (ended 2009) and ICESat-2 (to be launched 2018). Internationally, there are several missions collecting relevant data: the European Space Agency has operated CryoSat-2 since 2010 to monitor the ice sheets with radar altimetry, another element in its continuous record since 1992 (ERS-1, ERS-2 and Envisat), and there are plans for a CryoSat-3. Other relevant SAR data also come from Sentinel-1a (ESA), ALOS (Japan) and TerraSAR-X (Germany). Continued availability of these types of observations will be critical for understanding processes and monitoring when and where the ice is thinning and retreating. One of the key limitations in understanding processes driving ice sheet mass loss is the lack of observations near the ice margins and the surrounding oceans. This is challenging, as the areas are often ice covered, and are logistically difficult to reach, and so much of the region remains unmapped. A NASA Earth Ventures mission, Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG), was launched in 2015 for $30M. This mission is acquiring, via aircraft and ship, vital measurements in the ocean off Greenland's outlet glaciers to understand how the ocean conditions are changing. The same needs to be done in Antarctica. In 2016 six ALAMO floats were deployed in the Ross Sea off the Ross Ice Shelf. Observations like these are needed all around Antarctica and especially in the vulnerable Amundsen Sea region. Constraining how much and how fast the WAIS will change in the coming decades has recently been identified as a It is worth emphasizing that the threat of massive sea-level rise from Antarctica is not only supported by the recent ice-sheet modeling literature, but also from basic observations and fundamental physical principles. First, lessons from the geological record show that the polar ice sheets and the AIS in particular are sensitive to modest amounts of warming (Dutton et al., 2015). Second, the amount of warming over Antarctica in highemissions future greenhouse gas emissions scenario will produce massive amounts of meltwater on Antarctic ice shelves before the end of the century (DeConto and Pollard, 2016;Trusel et al., 2015) and meltwater has been observed to drive ice-shelf breakup in the recent past. This includes the sudden collapse of the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002 that resulted in the speed-up of upstream glaciers, previously buttressed by the ice shelf, by a factor of eight in some instances Scambos et al., 2004). Third, loss of Antarctic ice shelves and the associated loss of buttressing will trigger MISI on reverse-sloped bedrock as is occurring in the Amundsen Sea today. Fourth, in some locations in Antarctica, marine-terminating ice cliffs greater than 100 meters tall will emerge in some places and these cliffs will fail structurally under their own weight as observed in Greenland today. Fifth, much of the Antarctic Ice Sheet rests in deep sub-marine basins, exposing the ice-sheet margin to a warming ocean, and dynamical instabilities induced by reverse-sloped bedrock. In summary, the current pace of global sea-level rise  A schematic representation of the primary, interconnected processes operating at a marine-terminating outlet glacier like the Thwaites Glacier. Both the individual processes and their coupled interactions must be understood to be properly modeled, illustrating the grand challenge faced when trying to predict how a system like this will behave in the future. Some processes shown, like cliff collapse and extensive meltwater ponding, have not begun in the region, but could if grounding line retreat and warming continues."}]
