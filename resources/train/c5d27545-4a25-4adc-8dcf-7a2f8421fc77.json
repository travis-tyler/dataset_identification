[{"section_title": "", "text": "Aiterations in arterial structure and function occur with advancing age in healthy individuals. These changes comprise an increase in arterial wall thickness secondary to hyperplasia of the intima, addition of medial lamellae, and loss of the orderly arrangement of elastin in the media. Additionally, there is degeneration and disorganization of the medial layers with partial replacement of elastin with less compliant forms of collagen.' These changes in the arterial wall with advancing age are accompanied by a progressive dilation of major arteries and a progressive increase in arterial stiffness. The age-associated increase in arterial stiffness manifests itself as a progressive increase in systolic blood pressure with advancing age, a widening of the arterial pulse pressure, and an increase in the pulse wave velocity.2 The arterial stiffening with advancing age leads to changes in the arterial pulse wave contour. Older subjects demonstrate an increase in the late systolic pressure peak,3'4 which is thought to result from early reflected pressure waves secondary to an increase in pulse wave velocity. [5] [6] [7] In prior studies that have examined the effect of aging on arterial stiffness, the populations examined were not rigorously screened to exclude hypertension, occult coronary disease, or diabetes mellitus.5-11 Additionally, whether arterial changes with aging differ between men and women has not been addressed. Furthermore, it is unknown whether exercise capacity or physical conditioning status affects the age-associated increase in arterial stiffness.\nIn the present study, we used the noninvasive techniques of carotid applanation tonometry9 and measurements of pulse wave velocity to define age-associated changes in arterial stiffness in healthy men and women from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). These community dwelling volunteers were carefully screened to exclude clinical and occult cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes. We hypothesized that the aortic pulse wave velocity and the late systolic pressure wave augmentation would increase to a lesser extent in this healthy normotensive population than in prior studies of less rigorously screened subjects. Because The carotid pressure pulse augmentation index (AGI) as initially described by Kelly et al6\"2\"13 was used to quantify the age-associated augmentation of the late systolic portion of the arterial pressure wave (Fig 1) . The shoulder of the pressure wave is defined as the first concavity on the upstroke of the wave and separates the initial pressure rise from that in later systole. We constructed a computer algorithm using the derivatives of the pressure wave to plot the timing of foot, shoulder, and peak of the transcutaneously obtained arterial pressure wave contour. The timing and amplitude of the shoulder were reliably determined by a local minimum in the first derivative. The AGI was defined for each averaged wave form as the height from the shoulder to the peak of the pressure waveform divided by the total height from the foot to the peak (Fig 1) , expressed as a percentage. The computer-selected shoulder of the pressure contour is highly correlated to that determined manually (r=.84, P=.001). The reliability of the pressure wave contour measurement and the waveform analysis was established by sequential measurement of the right carotid contour by the same examiner on differing occasions on a given subject (n=5). There was excellent correlation among the repeated measurements of the timing on the foot, shoulder, peak, and incisura of the pressure contours (mean coefficient of variation, 5%)."}, {"section_title": "Pulse Wave Velocity", "text": "Simultaneous recordings of the arterial flow waves from the right common carotid artery, or ascending aorta, and right femoral artery were made using nondirectional transcutaneous Doppler flow probes (model 810-A, 10 mHz, Parks Medical Electronics Inc, Aloha, Ore). Pulse wave velocity measurements were derived from these waveforms. Ascending aortic flow was measured by angulating the transducer in the suprasternal notch until a characteristic high-amplitude signal was obtained. If no reliable aortic arch signals could be obtained, the Doppler signal was recorded from the right common carotid artery.\nThe aortic pulse wave velocity (APWV) was determined from the foot-to-foot flow wave velocity. A minimum of 10 simultaneously recorded flow waves were recorded and averaged. The foot of the flow wave was identified visually as the point where systolic flow began. The time delay between the feet of simultaneously recorded flow waves was recorded. The distance between the sampling site over the aortic arch (mid point of the manubrium sterni) and the right femoral artery was measured over the surface of the body with a tape measure. When a flow wave could not be adequately measured in the aorta, the right common carotid artery flow wave was used instead; the distance between the midpoint of the manubrium sterni and the sampling site on the carotid was measured and subtracted from the manubrium-to-femoral artery distance. Measurements of APWV using the carotid artery were highly correlated with those using the aortic arch (r=.79, P<.01). If both measurements were obtained in a given subject, a mean of the two was used."}, {"section_title": "Maximal Oxygen Consumption", "text": "Maximal exercise testing was performed according to a modified Balke protocol on a motor-driven treadmill at a constant speed, usually 3.5 mph for men and 3.0 mph for women. 15 The treadmill incline was increased by 3% every 2 minutes starting from the level, until the subject was exhausted. The ECG was monitored continuously in leads I, aVF, and Vs. Brachial arterial cuff pressure and a 12-lead ECG were obtained during the final 30 seconds of each exercise stage and at 2, 4, and 6 minutes into recovery. The subjects' expired gases were measured using a Rayfield Equipment Corporation (model REP-9200) gas meter. 02 and CO2 concentrations in expired air were analyzed using a mass spectrometer, which was calibrated daily using standard gases. Ventilation, 02 uptake, CO2 production, and respiratory exchange ratio were measured continuously during each test by a computerized data acquisition system, which interfaced the gas meter and mass spectrometer. Values were calculated every 30 seconds and recorded for analysis. The (Fig 2A) BLSA male controls (Fig 4) . The senior athletes weighed less than the old and young controls and had a lower body mass index than the two control groups ( Table 2) . As anticipated by the study design, the Vo2, of the senior athletes greatly exceeded that of the old controls and was similar to that of the young controls.\nThe systolic blood pressure did not differ between old controls and senior athletes; it was significantly higher in old controls than in young controls (Fig 4A) (Fig 4B) .

Although such stiffening was originally regarded as a benign concomitant of the aging process, recent epidemiological studies have shown elevated arterial pressure'7-20 to be a potent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, even in older populations. At least some of this increased cardiovascular risk derives from the adverse effect of increased arterial pressure (and presumably stiffness) on the left ventricle. 21, 22 In the Framingham study, every 20 mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure was associated with a 10.6-g increase in left ventricular mass in male subjects 60 to 90 years old.22 Left ventricular hypertrophy, in turn, was a powerful independent risk factor for subsequent cardiac events.22 Even in normotensive populations, an age-associated increase in left ventricular mass has been demonstrated,23,24 which may be due, at least in part, to the increase in arterial stiffness with age.\nIn the present study, two vascular stiffness indexes, APWV and AGI, that have been previously described and validated by invasive methods812'13 were used to assess noninvasively the age-associated change in arterial stiffness in highly screened sedentary volunteers. There was a progressive increase in APWV with advancing age, with a 2.5-fold increase in APWV over an age range from 20 to 91 years. Avolio et a19 demonstrated a similar percentage increase in the APWV across age in urban and rural Chinese populations. The absolute level of APWV at any given age was similar in their rural cohort to our values. However, APWV values in their urban population, who consumed a much larger sodium intake and had a greater prevalence of hypertension than their rural counterparts, were considerably higher. In another population advised to injest low quantities of sodium for a 2-year period, the expected age-associated increases in aortic, arm, and leg APWV values did not occur. 25 Thus, several factors in addition to age per se probably exert significant influence on arterial stiffness, including ethnic and genetic differences, dietary and activity habits, as well as the prevalence of elevated blood pressure and other vascular diseases.\nArterial pressure waveforms were obtained by applanation tonometry and demonstrated an approximate "}]
