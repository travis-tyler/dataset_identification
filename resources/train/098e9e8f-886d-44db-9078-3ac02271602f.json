We have identified only 2 studies comparing developmental outcomes of late preterm infants with early term and term infants in infancy, 13, 14 with disparate results, wherein 1 study 13 found that late preterm infants demonstrated suboptimal development compared with early term and term infants at 8 and 18 months, and the other study 14 found no differences at 2 years.\nThese contradictory findings suggest that more research is needed to examine the developmental outcomes of late preterm infants in infancy and to determine when developmental risks emerge between infancy and kindergarten to better inform early intervention and developmental monitoring strategies.\nWe used a nationally representative, population-based sample to examine developmental and early reading and math outcomes of late preterm infants, compared with infants born early term (37-38 weeks) and term (39-41 weeks) gestation from infancy through kindergarten.

The BSF-R estimates the number of items a child would have gotten correct on the full BSID-II through the use of item response theory (IRT) modeling and demonstrates a reliability coefficient of 0.80 compared with the full BSID-II. 18 The BSF-R Mental T scores were norm-referenced by age to the ECLS-B population, adjusted for prematurity, and scaled to have a mean = 50, SD = 10. 18 Preschool and Kindergarten Assessments. Children were assessed at preschool and kindergarten via specialized reading and math assessments developed for the ECLS-B. The reading assessment was formulated from existing instruments including the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Third Edition and Preschool Comprehensive Test of Phonological and Print Processing and measured basic reading skills (letter and word recognition, understanding lettersound relationships, phonological awareness, sight word recognition, and understanding words in the context of simple sentences). The reliability of the early reading assessment is described by the IRT reliability coefficient, reported as 0.84 at preschool and 0.92 at kindergarten.

These disparate results may be explained by previous reports not correcting for prematurity 27 or may be attributed to differences in how standardized measures of development were derived from existing developmental measures at 24 months in previous research. 28 In our analyses, we used the BSF-R Mental T scores, available in the ECLS-B dataset, to compare developmental outcome of late preterm with full-term groups at 24 months. In accordance with the ECLS-B codebook, the BSF-R T scores were based on chronological age, normed to the ECLS-B population, adjusted for prematurity, and designed to enable individual comparisons with the corresponding age reference population. 16 In other research focused on late preterm outcomes at 24 months, 28 development was assessed with a measure constructed by the authors, labeled as a derived mental developmental index and derived psychomotor developmental index, which may psychometrically differ from the standardized measures included in the ECLS-B dataset. Furthermore, whereas the BSF-R T scores were adjusted for prematurity, it is not clear whether the derived mental developmental index and derived psychomotor developmental index corrected for prematurity, which may also account for our contradictory findings at 24 months, despite our use of data from the same dataset. Other studies have also found no developmental differences between late preterm and full-term infants at 2 years of age, 14, 26 raising the possibility that the subtle developmental delays of late preterm infants in infancy may become less apparent in the toddler period, which may have implications for developmental surveillance in primary care.\nDespite no developmental differences observed at 24 months, as in previous research, 29 we found that late preterm infants demonstrate less optimal developmental outcomes at preschool. This suggests that the preschool-age health supervision visit may be an especially important visit for pediatric providers to monitor for emerging developmental delays in children who were born late preterm and to facilitate appropriate management for developmental issues. 30, 31 Children who were born late preterm who demonstrate delays on pediatric screening should be referred for a comprehensive developmental assessment to provide a diagnostic evaluation for developmental delay and to facilitate referrals for appropriate interventions. In addition, these children should be referred for a school-based psychoeducational evaluation to determine the need for school-based supports and services. 32, 33 There are some potential explanations for the pattern of development observed in late preterm infants from 9 months to kindergarten. Compared with infants born full term, the late preterm brain manifests neurodevelopmental immaturity, characterized by lower brain volume and less differentiated patterns of myelination and neural connectivity. 34 -37 These structural differences in the brains of children born late preterm, including lower gray matter volume present in infancy and school age, 38, 39 may be associated with the suboptimal development in early reading and math skills we identified, similar to that which has been observed in children born full term. 40, 41 The lack of developmental differences in children born late preterm observed at 24 months and the reemergence of suboptimal development at preschool may also be related to limitations in the instruments used at the 24-month timepoint and to subtle differences in brain development that become apparent with advancing age. The mental scale of the BSID-II (after which the BSF-R was formulated) 16 was designed to assess sensory perceptual abilities, early verbal communication, and early number concepts 42 but may in fact be a partial measure of gross motor abilities and sensorimotor functioning 43 and may not be an accurate assessment of cognitive abilities in infancy. In addition, the neurocognitive deficits associated with late preterm birth, including deficits in early reading and math skills, 44, 45 may not be reliably detected in the toddler period.\nOur study had several strengths and limitations. The study includes a nationally representative sample, the results of which are generalizable to the population, and assessments of child development from infancy through kindergarten. In addition, in contrast to other studies that have used parent report questionnaires to assess development, 13, 14 the ECLS-B administered direct child assessments to measure development, thus minimizing biases that can be associated with parent report measures. 46 One of the limitations of the study relates to different assessments of child development at infancy and the preschool and kindergarten timepoints. Because the BSF-R assessed different developmental constructs in infancy compared with the measures of early reading and math used at the preschool and kindergarten timepoints, it was deemed that the measures were not equivalent, and a longitudinal approach to the data was not possible. As a result, we assessed developmental outcomes in a series of cross-sectional analyses rather than following the same child from infancy through kindergarten longitudinally. In addition, the ECLS-B did not include a measure of IQ at preschool and kindergarten, so the measures of early learning are limited to the early reading and math domains and cannot be generalized to an overall measure of intellectual aptitude. Furthermore, there is no information in the ECLS-B about illnesses and hospitalizations in the neonatal period, or the specific details regarding the medical morbidities associated with late preterm birth 47, 48 that may be associated with suboptimal developmental outcomes."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We found small but meaningful mean differences in developmental outcomes between late preterm infants and full-term groups, which, when extrapolated to a population level, can have potentially significant public health implications for longterm outcomes. 12, 49 Developmental differences in late preterm infants emerged between 24 months and preschool, suggesting that late preterm infants may benefit from closer developmental monitoring, targeted assessments, and interventions before school entry."}]
