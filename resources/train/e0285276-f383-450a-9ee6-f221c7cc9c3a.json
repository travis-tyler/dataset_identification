[{"section_title": "A nthony DePass of Long Island University-Brooklyn and Daryl", "text": "Chubin of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) began the conference by briefly laying out the measured progress and continued challenges that characterize the effort to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in the biomedical and behavioral sciences. Minorities underrepresented in the sciences make up 31 percent of 18-to 24-year-olds in the United States, and the representation of minorities in the U.S. population is steadily growing (Figure 1). Yet minorities constitute progressively smaller percentages of the students earning bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in the sciences (Figure 2). Understanding this phenomenon and the educational interventions that could mitigate this loss of talent at progressively higher levels of education was the principal driving force behind the conference. The increasing percentage of minorities in the U.S. population has steadily been changing the population of elementary and secondary school students. Most of the growth of high school graduates over the next decade will come from minority populations, with Hispanics constituting the largest portion of that increase. This trend varies from region to region within the United States. The minority population in high schools is growing fastest in Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Texas, Georgia, and Florida. On the other end of the scale, Montana, Wyoming, the Dakotas, Kansas, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Louisiana are expected to have decreasing numbers of high school students, in the last case because of Hurricane Katrina. As Brian Bridges of the American Council on Education said later in the meeting, \"Whites will continue to comprise the majority of all high school seniors, but a slow progression toward a majority minority population has definitely begun.\""}, {"section_title": "DEGREES EARNED by UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES", "text": "The percentages of bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees earned by minorities underrepresented in the sciences have increased over the past three decades (Figures 3 and 4). At the bachelor's level, the percentage in the biological and agricultural sciences has gone from 6.4 percent FIGURE 1 Non-Hispanic whites will continue to decline as a percentage of the U.S. population while the percentages of groups underrepresented in the sciences increase.

At the doctorate level, the percentages have gone from 3.4 percent to 8.6 percent and 3.3 percent to 6.6 percent, respectively, over the same period. That represents real progress, DePass and Chubin said, and at least part of that progress can be attributed to educational programs put in place during that period. However, these percentages are still far from the 31-percent level that would be required to reach parity with the representation of these groups in the 18-to 24-year-old U.S. population. At the doctorate level, the per-  centages are less than half the parity line in all fields but education (Figure 5). And the absolute numbers of students in these categories remain low. At 8.6 percent of the doctorates awarded in 2005 in the biological and agricultural sciences, underrepresented minorities represent just a few hundred Ph.D.'s per year. The numbers of minorities in U.S. colleges and universities have been growing. Since 2005, minority students have constituted more than a quarter of all undergraduate enrollments, and the number is steadily increasing. Furthermore, minority students have the same levels of aspirations and interests in pursuing degrees in the sciences as non-minority students, said Bridges. But minority students leave science majors in larger numbers than do their non-minority peers. Many \"need additional support,\" said Bridges, \"because they come from academically unprepared backgrounds.\" Females also are underrepresented among doctoral recipients in some fields, though not in all ( Figure 6). In the life sciences, they are approximately at the parity line of 49 percent. But they earn fewer than 30 percent of Ph.D.'s in mathematics and the physical sciences, while they earn more than half of the Ph.D.'s in psychology, education, health, and the humanities. FIGURE 5 Among U.S. citizens and permanent residents, minorities underrepresented in the sciences earn fewer than 10 percent of the doctorate degrees in the life and physical sciences, and between 10 and 20 percent of the doctorate degrees in the social sciences, humanities, and professions. SOURCE: NSF Science and Engineering Doctorate Awards 2005. One reason that minorities are less likely to earn a Ph.D. than the members of other groups is that they emerge with a doctorate on average much more in debt than their non-minority peers, Chubin pointed out (Figure 7). The percentage of African-Americans who have more than $50,000 of debt after earning a Ph.D. is 27.7 percent, compared to just 1.5 percent for white doctoral recipients."}, {"section_title": "UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES IN COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITy FACULTIES", "text": "Underrepresented minorities and females also are severely underrepresented in college faculties (Figure 8). As Orlando Taylor of Howard University said, faculty establish the academic and intellectual climate of an institution, determine what is taught, serve as mentors, influence students' educational and career choices, serve as role models for young people, and advise government agencies on funding decisions. \"A diverse faculty of men and women from the many cultures of our nation is essential-some say even a requirement-for producing a scientific workforce that is prepared to meet the demands of a global world.\" Yet faculty diversity remains \"more of a dream than a reality,\" Taylor observed. After 35 years of concerted effort, only 8 to 9 percent of the full-time science and engineering faculty in the United States are underrepresented minorities. One key to encouraging minorities to enter academic careers is identifying the undergraduate institutions that feed those students into the academic pipeline, said Rhonda Sharpe from the University of Vermont. This varies from field to field and from one group to another. For example, African-Americans are well represented in foreign languages, but Hispanics are not. Asian-Americans are well represented in some academic FIGURE 8 Minorities underrepresented in the sciences constitute less than 10 percent of all faculty in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering.

Demographic \"bulges\" of minority students do exist at various places in the educational pipeline, Bridges pointed out. Undergraduate enrollments among minorities are up, as are graduate degrees in certain fields. But several bottlenecks at various points, including doctorate enrollment and faculty participation, continue to prevent the maximum participation of minorities at all levels of the academy. Minority students need to be introduced both to graduate schools and to the idea of graduate school, Sharpe said. If they have opportunities for master's degrees, the idea of a doctorate becomes more imaginable. Members of these groups are susceptible to discouragement and need to be supported at all levels. And minority students need to be shown that faculty positions give them an opportunity to give back to their communities, which is an important goal for many of these students."}, {"section_title": "LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS", "text": "Universities are very influenced by societal considerations, Chubin pointed out at the end of his introductory remarks. One of the most notable of these considerations is the legal environment in which all educational programs operate. Because programs targeted to particular groups have become difficult to defend legally, many programs have been dismantled, eliminated, reduced in scope, or opened to all students. A 2004 report from the AAAS and the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering (NACME) sought to give university administrators and faculty tools that can help them cope with actions that those opposed to affirmative action are now leveling against such programs. 1 These campaigns, which are focused at the state level, are particularly targeted to public institutions. \"You may not be able to control the kinds of forces that are making your life more difficult,\" said Chubin. \"You're going to have to negotiate them.\""}]
