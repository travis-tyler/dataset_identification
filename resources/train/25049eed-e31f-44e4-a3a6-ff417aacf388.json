Despite their popularity, unidimensional item response theory and classical test theory may not be useful for this purpose, given that a single continuous latent trait or true score is assumed. Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs), on the other hand, have drawn researchers' attention recently because they have the potential to pinpoint which attribute students possess and which they do not. This could offer additional information about students' strengths and weaknesses, thus informing instruction and remediation.\nHowever, to make valid inferences about the presence and absence of these finegrained attributes, a deep understanding of what attributes are involved in students' problem-solving is critical. Various techniques have been utilized to identify the attribute and item association, or Q-matrix (Tatsuoka, 1983) , such as expert panels, think aloud and protocol analysis (Leighton & Gierl, 2007) . Researchers have also developed some post hoc methods to identify the potential misspecifications in a Q-matrix (e.g., Chen, 2017; de la Torre & Chiu, 2016) . However, the identification process remains challenging. For example, as noted by DeCarlo (2011), Tatsuoka's (1983) fraction subtraction data have been used for more than 20 years, but its Q-matrix is still the subject of debate: researchers *Corresponding should be addressed to Wenchao Ma, The University of Alabama, Box 870231, Room 307B, 520 Colonial Drive, Tuscaloosa 35487, AL, USA (email: wenchao.ma@ua.edu).\nhave suggested various modifications to some entries (e.g., de la Torre & Chiu, 2016; de la Torre & Douglas, 2008) .\nOne possible cause of this challenge is the fact that students may use multiple strategies in their problem-solving. On the one hand, different strategies may involve different attributes. For example, Mislevy (1996) analysed the fraction subtraction items and found that students generally had two strategies for solving these problems. Seven attributes were involved in these items, namely, (a 1 ) performing basic fraction subtraction operation; (a 2 ) simplifying/reducing; (a 3 ) separating whole number from fraction; (a 4 ) borrowing one from whole number; (a 5 ) converting whole number to fraction; (a 6 ) converting mixed number to fraction; and (a 7 ) column borrowing in subtraction. Students using strategy A, which involves a 1 , a 2 , a 5 , a 6 and a 7 , convert mixed numbers to improper fractions before performing subtraction; whereas students using strategy B separate the fractions into whole-number and fractional parts before performing subtraction. If necessary, they borrow a 1 from the whole number for fraction subtraction. This strategy involves a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , a 4 and a 5 (Mislevy, 1996) . For example, as shown in Table 1 , to solve 3 1 6 \u00c0 5 6 , two strategies each involving three attributes can be used. Most existing CDMs cannot accommodate items of this type in that they assume all students use the same set of attributes in their problem-solving. An exception is the multiple-strategy deterministic inputs, noisy \"and\" gate (MS-DINA; de la Torre & Douglas, 2008 ) model, which assumes that different individuals can adopt different strategies for each item. This model, however, is very restrictive in that it assumes solving an item using different strategies has the same guessing and slip parameters.\nOn the other hand, different strategies may also involve distinct condensation rules (Maris, 1999) , which indicate how attributes are \"condensed\" to yield observed responses. For example, using one strategy, students may need to master all required attributes to have a high success probability; while using another strategy, students may only need to master at least one required attribute to have a high success probability. If multiple strategies involve the same attributes but distinct condensation rules, the MS-DINA model is not suitable.\nAlthough most research on CDMs focuses on dichotomous responses that typically stem from multiple-choice items, constructed-response items have been shown to be potentially more appropriate for diagnostic purposes (Birenbaum & Tatsuoka, 1987; Birenbaum, Tatsuoka, & Gutvirtz, 1992) . A major advantage of using constructedresponse items rather than multiple-choice items is that students' detailed problemsolving procedures can be observed, which provides direct evidence for making inferences about students' proficiency. A few CDMs have been proposed to analyse polytomously scored items (e.g., de la Torre, 2010; Hansen, 2013; Kuo, Chen, Yang, & Mok, 2016; von Davier, 2008) , but none of them are capable of Strategy A Strategy B\nStep Attribute\nStep Attribute 3 dealing with multiple strategies used by students, which makes the use of constructedresponse items in CDAs challenging. Scoring rules are typically needed for constructed-response items. Two conventional scoring schemes are holistic and analytic systems. For the former, the work is evaluated as a whole and the grade indicates the overall unidimensional performance. Because of this, holistic rubrics are typically used in summative assessments and tend to provide limited feedback to students (Mertler, 2001) . The analytic rubrics, on the other hand, require raters to assess students' work on several criteria. Students could be given a grade on each individual criterion, which tends to be more informative (Mertler, 2001) . As a result, the analytic rubrics are naturally more appropriate for diagnostic assessments, where we are interested in students' proficiency at each attribute. However, traditional analytic scoring scheme cannot accommodate multiple strategies and thus need to be modified.\nThe goal of this study is twofold: (1) to introduce a scoring scheme that can record students' problem-solving procedures and strategies; and (2) to develop a diagnostic model to analyse the response data collected from this scoring scheme. The remainder of this paper is laid out as follows. Section 2 introduces the so-called two-digit scoring scheme for CDAs, which consists of two digits: one for partial credits and one for strategies. Section 3 presents the novel psychometric model, including model formulation, parameter estimation algorithm, and relation with other statistical models. Section 4 describes in detail a simulation study for evaluating the viability of the proposed model under varied conditions. Then a data set from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2007 mathematics assessment is analysed to illustrate how to use the proposed scoring rubrics and psychometric model to analyse constructed-response items in practice. We conclude in Section 6 with a brief summary of this study, and a discussion of directions for future research."}, {"section_title": "Two-digit scoring scheme", "text": "To record students' strategies, it is necessary to know what strategies may be used. To this end, subject experts may be asked to answer test questions using multiple strategies and to imagine the possible solutions that students can come up with. It is also possible to summarize the strategies used by students in pilot tests. With the strategies identified, we need to create rubrics to record both students' partial credits and strategies. Traditional holistic and analytic scoring schemes only record partial credits. An exception is the twodigit scoring system used in TIMSS for constructed-response items. This scoring scheme was originally initiated by the TIMSS Norwegian national centre and later developed by the Free-Response Item Coding Committee with representatives from various countries (Lie, Taylor, & Harmon, 1996) . In this two-digit system, the tens digit indicates the level of correctness (e.g., correct, partially correct or incorrect), while the units digit is related to the approaches and strategies involved, or common errors or misconceptions if students have difficulty with the item.\nIt is straightforward to employ the two-digit scheme in CDAs when students' problemsolving procedures can be observed. An example is given in Table 2 , which shows the two-digit scoring rubrics for item 3 1 6 \u00c0 5 6 . Students can obtain a score from 0 to 3, which occupies the tens digit. The strategy indicator (i.e., either 1 or 2) is given at the units digit. If the test is to diagnose the presence or absence of a set of attributes only, different strategies can have different numbers of response categories. Nevertheless, if reporting the total score is necessary, test developers may need to ensure the number of response categories is equal under different strategies, which can be achieved by combining some response categories for some strategies.\nNote that it is critical for students to show their work explicitly to be scored accurately using this scoring rubric. Giving the final answer correctly (or incorrectly) without showing their procedures could make the inference challenging. However, if it is reasonable to believe that a correct final answer without procedures implies that students know how to solve the problem, a full mark can be given without the strategy indicator because the strategy involved is not identifiable. For example, a score of 3 instead of 31 and 32 can be assigned as the full mark for item 3 1 6 \u00c0 5 6 . In doing so, the challenge is that we do not know the strategies used and may need to consider more complicated psychometric models."}, {"section_title": "Diagnostic tree model", "text": "In this section, a diagnostic tree model (DTM) is proposed by incorporating the CDMs within the tree model to analyse the polytomous responses from constructed-response items using the two-digit scoring rule. Similar to the sequential G-DINA model (sG-DINA; , the DTM assumes that, for each strategy when multiple strategies exist, solving an item involves performing a series of tasks successfully. Students need to carry out a task successfully before undertaking the next one. This sequential mechanism is accommodated using a tree structure in the DTM, which describes how a manifest response is achieved through a series of internal steps.\n3.1. Tree structure A tree (e.g., Batchelder & Riefer, 1999 ) is composed of a root (i.e., the single initial node), several intermediate nodes, leaves and branches. Nodes represent tasks that students need to undertake, and the root is the first task for solving the problem. Nodes are also referred to as pseudo-items, and these two terms are used interchangeably in this paper. A node can have two or more internal outcomes, indicating students' performance on the given task. For a binary pseudo-item, outcome 1 denotes success in performing the task and 0 denotes failure; whereas for a polytomous pseudo-item, different internal outcomes indicate different performance levels or strategies. Leaves in a tree represent a set of observed response categories which are mutually exclusive, while branches display the paths of problem-solving by connecting the root, intermediate nodes and leaves.\nIn this study, a tree is referred to as a divergent tree if there is only one path from the root to each leaf, and a convergent tree if there is more than one path to any leaf. For instance, the tree diagrams for 3 1 6 \u00c0 5 6 are displayed in Figure 1 , where circles represent nodes or pseudo-items, arrows represent branches, and numbers on the branches represent the internal outcomes associated with each pseudo-item. The divergent tree on the left corresponds to the scoring rubrics in Table 2 , while the convergent tree on the right accommodates the correct solution without work shown. There are five pseudoitems for each tree, where the first pseudo-item has three internal outcomes and the rest each have two. In this study, we use P n C x to denote a branch associated with internal outcome x of pseudo-item n. For instance, a score of 21 is achieved through three branches: P1C1, P2C1 and P3C0. In other words, a student with a score of 21 got an internal outcome 1 on the first pseudo-item (i.e., X 1 ), and then answered the second pseudo-item (i.e., X 2 ) correctly, but failed the third pseudo-item (i.e., X 3 ).\nBecause each pseudo-item represents a task that needs to be undertaken, different attributes may be involved for different internal outcomes. Take the first pseudo-item of item 3 1 6 \u00c0 5 6 as an example. Students can choose branch P1C1 if they convert 3 1 6 to 19 6 using attribute a 6 , or branch P1C2 by converting 3 1 6 to 2 7 6 using attribute a 4 . As a result, the attribute and step association can be specified for each pseudo-item under each strategy, indicating which attributes are involved. Table 3 gives the Qmatrix for 3 1 6 \u00c0 5 6 based on two strategies, which can be used along with either the divergent or convergent tree structure in Figure 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Model parameterization", "text": "Let X ijn denote the internal outcome variable of individual i for node n of item j, where i = 1, . . . , I, j = 1, . . . , J, n = 1, . . . , N j , and X ijn 2 {0, . . . , M jn }. Assuming K attributes are involved in an assessment, there are 2 K latent classes. The attribute pattern for latent class c is denoted by a c = (a c1 , . . . , a cK ) 0 , where c = 1, . . . , 2"}, {"section_title": "K", "text": ", and a ck = 1 if attribute k is mastered by individuals in latent class c. Similar to de la Torre (2011) and , if latent response category x for node n of item j involves Let p jnx (a c ) be the conditional probability of individuals with attribute profile a c having outcome x on node n of item j, given that they have already arrived at node n through a certain path of problem-solving. In this study, p jnx (a c ) is referred to as pseudo-item response function and formulated as\nNote that when latent class c is collapsed into latent group l for category x, we have p jnx \u00f0a c \u00de \u00bc p\u00f0a \u00c3 ljnx \u00de and accordingly, we define\nwith the constraint that h(d jn0 , a c ) = 0. d jnx0 is the intercept parameter, d jnxk is the main effect due to the mastery of attribute k, d jnxkk 0 is the interaction effect due to the mastery of attributes k and k 0 , and\nis the highest-order interaction effect due to the mastery of all required attributes. Note that p jnx (a c ) is defined similarly to the general nominal diagnostic model (GNDM; Chen & Zhou, 2017) and nominal response diagnostic model (NRDM; Templin, Henson, Rupp, Jang, & Ahmed, 2008) . When all outcomes of node n involve the same attributes, they are equivalent. For a binary node, p jnx (a c ) is equivalent to the logit link G-DINA model (de la Torre, 2011) and the loglinear CDM (Henson, Templin, & Willse, 2009) .\nLet Y ij be the observed response variable of individual i to item j and Y j be the corresponding sample space consisting of all response categories of item j. Because of the sequential processes, the observed category response function, P(Y ij = y | a c ) for y 2 Y j , can be expressed as the product of a series of p jnx (a c ). Specifically, suppose there are S jy possible paths to obtain a score of y on item j, and define t \u00f0s\u00de jnxy \u00bc 1 if branch P n C x is on the path s, and t \u00f0s\u00de jnxy \u00bc 0 if not. The observed category response function can be written as \nFor example, assuming item j has a convergent tree structure as shown in Figure 1 , we can calculate the probability of individual i with a c getting a score of 3 as\n3.3. Parameter estimation Item parameters of the DTM can be estimated using the marginal maximum likelihood estimation via expectation-maximization (MMLE/EM) algorithm (Bock & Aitkin, 1981) . Under the assumption of local independence, the conditional probability of the response vector Y i can be written as\nwhere 1 \u00bdY ij \u00bcy is an indicator variable with a value of 1 if Y ij = y and 0 otherwise. The MMLE/EM algorithm consists of an E-step and an M-step. In particular, for item j, based on the provisional item parameter estimates and the population proportion parameter p(a c ), the E-step calculates the expected number of examinees with attribute pattern a c scoring in category y, that is,\nwhere P(a c | Y i ) is the posterior probability of examinee i with attribute pattern a c , and can be calculated by\nThe M-step is implemented item by item. Specifically, for item j, the object function\nis maximized, with respect to item parameters d j , using some quasi-Newton methods such as the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm.\nIn educational assessments, monotonic constraints are sometimes preferred (Hong, Chang, & Tsai, 2016) . A monotonic constraint is satisfied when students who master extra required attributes have a higher item success probability. For the DTM, monotonic constraints may be imposed on the pseudo-item response function when the pseudo-item has two internal outcomes. For pseudo-items with three or more internal outcomes, imposing monotonic constraints may or may not be meaningful. In addition to monotonic constraints, it is possible to impose equality constraints for simplicity or interpretability. Take item 3 1 6 \u00c0 5 6 as an example. The monotonic constraints may include p\u00f0a \u00c3 ljn1 \u00bc 1\u00de ! p\u00f0a \u00c3 ljn1 \u00bc 0\u00de for nodes 2, 3, 4 and 5. Meantime, we may also assume that a 1 has the same effect on nodes 2 and 4, and that a 2 has the same effect on nodes 3 and 5. To accommodate monotonic and equality constraints, the M-step becomes a constrained optimization problem. This could be solved using some general optimization method, such as the method of Lagrange multipliers (Butenko & Pardalos, 2014) .\nAlthough the MMLE/EM algorithm above is suitable for DTMs regardless of tree structure. For the divergent tree structure, item parameter estimation can be further simplified. Specifically, a mapping matrix specifying how each observed response Y ij is related to a series of nodes can be used to facilitate the estimation (e.g., B\u20ac ockenholt & Meiser, 2017; Tutz, 1997) . In this mapping matrix, rows represent observed response categories and columns represent pseudo-items. Entries represent the internal outcomes that each pseudo-item needs to take to reach an observed response. If answering a pseudoitem is not necessary to obtain an observed response, the entry is denoted as missing. The mapping matrix based on the divergent tree structure for 3 1 6 \u00c0 5 6 is given in Table 4 . For example, Y ij = 0 corresponds to X 1 = 0 and all other nodes being missing, and Y ij = 22 corresponds to X 1 = 2, X 4 = 1, X 5 = 0 and all other nodes being missing.\nBased on the mapping matrix, responses to 3 1 6 \u00c0 5 6 can be recorded as five nodes. For example, an individual with Y ij = 21 has X 1 = 1, X 2 = 1, X 3 = 0, and missing values on X 4 and X 5 . After the transformation, the M-step of the MMLE/EM algorithm is implemented node by node, instead of item by item. For example, parameters in equation (1) for each pseudo-item with two internal outcomes can be estimated as in the G-DINA model (de la Torre, 2011). It should be emphasized that the appropriateness of using the mapping matrix for estimating the DTM with divergent tree structures is attributed to the sequential mechanism assumed in equation (3) \n. This is equal to the contribution of all pseudo-items in that, as shown in Table 4 , pseudo-items X 4 and X 5 are missing and do not contribute to the likelihood function. "}, {"section_title": "Relation with other psychometric models", "text": "To analyse constructed-response items, the DTM integrates the CDMs and tree structures. Considering the CDM component, the DTM is related to several existing CDMs. The DTM can be viewed as an extension of the GNDM (Chen & Zhou, 2017) and NRDM (Templin et al., 2008) for nominal response data, as well as a generalization of the sG-DINA model for ordered responses. For dichotomously scored items, the DTM is equivalent to the loglinear CDM (Henson et al., 2009 ) and the G-DINA model (de la Torre, 2011), and by setting appropriate constraints, the DINA model (Haertel, 1989) , the DINO model (Templin & Henson, 2006) , the reduced reparameterized unified model (Hartz, 2002) , the additive CDM (de la Torre, 2011), and the linear logistic model (Maris, 1999) can be obtained as well. Furthermore, although a direct connection in model parameterization between the DTM and the MS-DINA model (de la Torre & Douglas, 2008) is not straightforward, they both aim to accommodate multiple strategies involved in item responses. Figure 2 gives the tree diagrams for the G-DINA model/LCDM, the GNDM/NRDM, and the sG-DINA model under the DTM framework. Note that the GNDM/NRDM is equivalent to the DTM having a single node with several nominal internal outcomes; whereas the sG-DINA model is a DTM with a linear tree structure. In a linear structure, there is only one path to each observed response category and each node has only two internal outcomes, one of which must connect with an observed response. This implies that the linear structure is divergent and thus item parameters of the sG-DINA model can be estimated using the aforementioned mapping matrix.\nOn the other hand, the DTM shares its tree structure with many other statistical models because the tree structure has been widely used in many fields. For example, Batchelder and Riefer (1999) summarized a number of applications in psychology using the multinomial process tree model, which combines the multinomial model with the tree structure. In addition, researchers have also incorporated item response models into tree structures for various purposes, such as modelling missing responses (e.g., B\u20ac ockenholt, 2012; B\u20ac ockenholt & Meiser, 2017; Jeon & De Boeck, 2016; Revuelta, 2008 )."}, {"section_title": "Simulation study", "text": "A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the parameter recovery of the DTM based on the proposed estimation algorithm, and to examine the improvement in attribute classification accuracy by using the DTM rather than the sG-DINA and MS-DINA models under various conditions."}, {"section_title": "Design", "text": "Four factors, including sample size, item quality, tree structures, and fitted CDMs, are manipulated in this study.

The divergent and convergent tree structures shown in Figure 1 are considered. To evaluate the impact of the tree structure, under each condition, all six polytomous items have the same structure. The Q-matrix for the polytomous items was simulated randomly with the constraint that the maximum number of attributes measured by each node is 2. The test also consists of K dichotomous items, each requiring a single unique attribute for completeness.\nUnder each condition, 100 data sets were simulated, and fitted using the DTM, sG-DINA and MS-DINA models. To fit the sG-DINA model, responses 11 and 12 were coded as 1; 21 and 22 were coded as 2; and, for the divergent tree structure, 31 and 32 were coded as 3. To fit the MS-DINA model, 31 and 32 in the divergent tree structure and 3 in the convergent tree structure were coded as 1 and other responses were coded as 0. Data simulation and parameter estimation for the DTM were implemented using R programming language (R Core Team, 2017). Code for estimating the MS-DINA model was also written in R.

Note that the recovery measure is not calculated for d parameters in equation (1) directly because they are on the logit scale and their magnitudes are hard to assess. The pseudo-item response functions, however, are on the probability scale ranging from 0 to 1, and derived from d parameters directly. Thus, the recovery for the pseudo-item response functions can be easily examined and poor recovery of the pseudo-item response function also indicates poor recovery of the d parameters.\nPerson parameter recovery was evaluated using the proportion of correctly classified attributes (PCA) and the proportion of correctly classified attribute vectors (PCV), defined as\nrespectively, where 1 \u00f0r\u00de \u00bda i \u00bc\u00e2 i is an indicator variable with an outcome of 1 if the estimated attribute vector matches the true one for the rth replication and 0 otherwise. Tables 5 and 6 give the RMSEs of the pseudo-item response functions for the divergent and convergent tree structures under varied conditions. Both sample size and item quality had impacts on parameter recovery. Specifically, the RMSEs became smaller as sample size increased or item quality improved. When sample size was small and items were of poor quality, the largest RMSEs were <.23 and .30 for divergent and convergent tree structure, respectively; whereas when sample size was large and items were of good quality, the RMSEs were as small as .021 for both structures."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "In addition, the root and the nodes close to the root tended to have better item parameter recovery than those close to the leaves, regardless of the tree structures. For example, under strategy A, P1C1 always had the smallest RMSEs and P3C1 had the largest RMSEs; whereas under strategy B, P1C2 always had the smallest RMSEs and P5C1 had the largest RMSEs. This is particularly intuitive for the divergent tree structure, where nodes are estimated directly after the transformation through the mapping matrix. The transformation produces sparse responses because of the missing values. The nodes are sparser if they are close to the leaves, yielding less stable parameter estimates. Furthermore, a divergent tree structure tends to produce better item parameter recovery than a convergent tree structure. From Tables 5 and 6, the RMSEs under the convergent tree structure were always larger than those under the divergent tree structure. This trend is not unexpected in that the divergent tree structure is more informative than the convergent tree structure. Tables 7 and 8 give the attribute and vector level classification rates under varied conditions. Several findings can be observed. First, as sample size increased or item quality improved, the classification rates for the DTM increased. Second, under all conditions, the DTM outperformed the sG-DINA model and the MS-DINA model in terms of classification accuracy. Specifically, the differences in PCV between the DTM and sG-DINA model ranged from .109 to .425 under the divergent tree structure, and from .106 to .403 under the convergent tree structure; and the difference in PCV between the DTM and the MS-DINA model ranged from .070 to .417 under the divergent tree structure, and from .050 to .370 under the convergent tree structure.

Three attributes identified by Lee, Johnson, Park, Sachdeva, Zhang, and Waldman (2013) are measured. There are 12 dichotomously scored items, and item M022232, which is displayed in Figure 3 , is polytomously scored. Item M022232 asks students to \"estimate to the nearest minute the total time taken for the temperature of the water in the beaker to cool from 95 to 70\u00b0C\" (Foy & Olson, 2009, p. 15) . The amount of cooling time is given for a series of 5\u00b0C intervals from 95 to 70\u00b0C in a table. Students need to collect data from the given table and round and add the numbers (i.e., amount of cooling time). This problem can be solved in various ways using (a 1 ) whole numbers and integers, and (a 3 ) data analysis and probability. For example, students can round each amount of time to whole minutes and then calculate the total amount of time, or round each amount of time to the nearest 5, 10, 15 or 30 s and then estimate the total. Although TIMSS distinguishes these two strategies, they were combined in this study and coded as strategy 1 using the two-digit scoring rule because the number of students using each strategy is small. In addition, students may find the total amount of cooling time directly by adding all the numbers and then rounding the result to the nearest minute. This is referred to as strategy 2. Other strategies may also be used, such as adding the minutes and seconds separately. These strategies were combined as well and coded as strategy 3. As shown in Foy and Olson (2009, p. 16) , there are six distinct strategy indicators at the units digit level to distinguish full marks (i.e., 2 points) and three indicators to distinguish partial credits (i.e., 1 point). Table 9 gives the transformation rule for creating the two-digit system for DTM analysis. The tree diagram of item M022232 is given in Figure 4 , which has a divergent structure with three nodes. The root has four internal outcomes (i.e., X 1 2 {0, 1, 2, 3}), representing failure, and strategies 1, 2 and 3, respectively. More specifically, internal outcome 1 involves rounding each amount of time correctly to whole minutes or the nearest 5, 10, 15 or 30 seconds and outcome 2 involves adding each amount of time correctly.

Similarly, students who complete outcome 2 of node 1 correctly arrive at node 3, where the total amount of time needs to be rounded. If they round the total amount of time correctly, they get a score of 22, otherwise a score of 12. Students using other strategies have a score of 23.

(2013) , is given in Table 10 ."}, {"section_title": "Model identification and estimation", "text": "As in other statistical models, the identifiability of parameters is critical for making valid inference from the DTM. A model is said to be (globally) identifiable if different parameter values yield distinct probability distributions of the data. Recent research has examined the conditions required for global identification of CDMs for dichotomous response data (e.g. Gu & Xu, 2017; Xu, 2017; Xu & Zhang, 2016) , but determining the identifiability conditions is typically challenging or even intractable for complex models (Maris & Bechger, 2009) . Assessing a weaker form of identification, or local identifiability, has been suggested as an alternative by Goodman (1974) and McDonald and Krane (1977) , among others, for non-linear models. The local identification can be examined by assessing whether the Fisher information matrix is positive definite or all its eigenvalues are positive. Equivalently, we can also check whether the Jacobian matrix, which is the firstorder partial derivative of the log likelihood function with respect to model parameters, has full column rank. This is a routine analysis for some commercial software programs for structural equation modelling such as Amos (Arbuckle, 2016) , and has also been used to assess the identifiability of CDMs by von Davier (2014). The rank of the Jacobian matrix based on the DTM and the data set presented here is 47, which is equal to the number of free parameters, made up of 40 item parameters and seven population proportion parameters. All eigenvalues of the Fisher information matrix, approximated numerically using the Richardson extrapolation method, are positive. The condition number of the information matrix, defined as the ratio of the smallest to the largest eigenvalue, is 1.58 9 10 \u00c05 , which is above the lower threshold (i.e., 1 9 10 \u00c06 ) for potential non-identification for latent class models used in Mplus (Muth en & Muth en, 2017, p. 529) . Table 11 gives the estimated pseudo-item response functions based on the DTM, which was calibrated using the MMLE/EM algorithm described in the previous section with a convergence criterion of 0.001. Note that for all items except item 6, the DTM is equivalent to the G-DINA model. There are 2 K \u00c3 jnx pseudo-item response functions for internal outcome x of node n associated with the reduced attribute patterns given at the top of the table. The same reduced attribute pattern for different nodes may not represent the same set of attributes. Estimated pseudo-item response functions for internal outcome 0 were also presented in Table 11 for nodes with three or more categories, but were omitted for those having two categories only. For item 6, students who mastered all required attributes (i.e., a 1 and a 3 ) have about equal chance (i.e., 10%) of adopting either strategy 1 or strategy 2, but are more likely to use strategy 3 (23.6%). However, they also have a 55.3% chance of answering this item Note. a 1 , whole numbers and integers; a 2 , fractions, decimals and percentages; a 3 , data analysis and probability. Table 12 gives the statistics and associated p-values. The DTM has an adequate model-data fit at .01 alpha level, but none can fit the data adequately at .05 alpha level. It should be noted that bootstrapped v 2 and CR\u00f0 2 3 \u00de statistics are absolute fit measures. For model comparison purposes, information criteria are typically used such as Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). However, they are not appropriate in this study because the data are not the same for three models. Figure 5 displays the estimated population proportion parameters using the DTM, sG-DINA and MS-DINA models. It can be observed that all three models yielded similar estimates. In addition, each model classified students into one of eight latent classes and the agreement of classification was examined as well. Based on the kappa coefficient, the classification agreement is .96 between the DTM and the sG-DINA model, .93 between the DTM and the MS-DINA model, and .94 between the sG-DINA model and the MS-DINA model. The classification agreements among the three models are quite high because they have 12 common items."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Discussion", "text": "In this paper, we proposed to employ the two-digit scoring scheme to record both students' proficiency and strategies in constructed-response items in CDAs. It is not uncommon for students to be able to use multiple strategies in constructed-response items, but, to our knowledge, no procedures have been developed in CDAs to track students' strategies. The two-digit scheme has the potential to overcome this hurdle and advance the use of constructed-response items in CDAs. In addition, we also developed the DTM as a psychometric tool for analysing the data collected using the two-digit rubrics. Both divergent and convergent tree structures were considered, and the MMLE/ EM algorithm was used to estimate their item parameters. The simulation study showed that item and person parameters could be recovered accurately, and that, compared with the sG-DINA and MS-DINA models, the DTM produced more accurate person attribute estimation under all simulated conditions. A data set from TIMSS 2007 mathematics assessment was analysed as well. An item was used as an example to illustrate how the two-digit scheme can be used in practice. Local identification was assessed for the DTM by examining the Jacobian and Fisher information matrices. We also compared the DTM, sG-DINA and MS-DINA models in terms of absolute model-data fit and person classifications.\nDespite promising results, additional research along these lines is needed. First, the simulation study only considered fixed test length and number of attributes, all polytomous items had the same tree structure under each condition, and only two tree structures were considered. In future studies researchers could vary these conditions to examine the parameter recovery of the DTM. Second, the proposed two-digit scoring system and DTM require that we know all strategies students may use in the test in advance and that the Q-matrices are correctly specified for all strategies. These requirements could be challenging in practice, and thus future research could explore the impact when they are not met. Third, the DTM utilizes tree structures with a series of postulated cognitive processes underlying the item responses. Although, to some extent, the constructed-response items allow us to validate the proposed structure, other tree structures may still be possible. It would be important to investigate how to compare DTMs with different tree structures. In addition, although the Jacobian matrix and Fisher information matrix were examined to assess local identification for the real data analysis, it is still important to investigate the conditions for global identification in the future. Furthermore, the grading process using the two-digit scoring scheme could be timeconsuming. With the rapid expansion of online learning and intelligent tutoring, it is interesting to explore how the two-digit scoring scheme can be incorporated into automatic scoring system (e.g., Martinez & Bennett, 1992) . Last, as shown in equation (1), the pseudo-item response function of the DTM is defined as a nominal response model, which is particularly suitable for modelling multiple strategies. Alternatively, it is straightforward to parameterize it using graded response models, such as the sG-DINA model. The resulting model may be suitable for other settings."}]
