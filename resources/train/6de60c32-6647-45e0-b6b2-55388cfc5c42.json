Briefly, T1 186 images were processed using Freesurfer v5.3 and [\n18 F]AV1451 images were coregistered 187 to native T1s using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). 188 SUVR images were created using a cerebellar gray reference region and images were 189 normalized to MNI space using the parameters from the coregistered T1. Figure 1 Figure 2 ) [Bellec et al., 2010] . BASC is a two-step consensus-clustering 200 algorithm that enhances the stability of the clustering process by repeatedly clustering 201 bootstrapped samples of the input data, and deriving the final partition from this stability 202 matrix, rather than the original data (c.f. [Fred and Jain, 2005] ). This approach offers two 203 advantages in the context of this study. First, the stochastic nature of many clustering 204 algorithms tends to lead to different solutions depending on their initialization state, 205 whereas BASC performs clustering on a stability matrix generated from many solutions 206 (and thus many initializations). This leads to greater reproducibility in the clustering 207 solutions generated by BASC. Second, because the initial set of clustering analyses is 208 performed on bootstrap samples of the input data, the final solution is less dependent on 209 the clinical composition of the input data. 210"}, {"section_title": "BASC was adapted to 3D [", "text": "18 F]AV1451 data by stacking all 123 BioFINDER 211"}, {"section_title": "[", "text": "18 F]AV1451 images along a fourth (subject) dimension, creating a single 4D image to be 212 submitted as input. BASC first reduces the dimensions of the data with a previously 213 described region-growing algorithm [Bellec et al., 2006] , which was set to extract 214 spatially constrained atoms (small regions of redundant signal) with a size threshold of 215 1000mm 3 . In order to reduce computational demands, the Desikan-Killiany atlas 216 [Desikan et al., 2006] was used as a prior for region constraint, and the data was masked 217 with a liberal gray matter mask, which included the subcortex but had the cerebellum 218 manually removed (since this was used as the reference region for [ 18 \n18 F]AV1451 may be binding to several off-target agents, such as (neuro)melanin, iron, 526 vascular pathology and MAO-A/B Lowe et al., 2016; Marqui\u00e9 et al., 527 2015; Ng et al., 2017] , and as such, [\n18 F]AV1451 signal is likely a mix of true tau 528 pathology and other off-target and non-specific signals. Deriving the clusters from a 529 sample representing a wide breadth of disease stages and additionally including subjects 530 unlikely to have significant cortical tau pathology enhances the likelihood of isolating 531 true tau signal, which covaries strongly and in a regionally specific pattern across disease 532 stages. Additionally, deriving the clusters voxelwise allows freedom from anatomical 533 borders, which may impose unnecessary constraints irrelevant to the spread of tau. 534\nFinally, despite its many limitations, multi-subject automatic whole-brain sampling is a 535 distinct advantage of [\n18 F]AV1451-PET over pathological studies. This advantage may 536 further enhance the efficacy of data-driven approaches to ROI generation, which evaluate 537 regions equally that may otherwise be overlooked. 538\nStill, ROIs based on pathology remain important in understanding relationships 539 between tau burden and cognition. In our study, ROIs representing the earliest stages of 540 tau pathology, especially the entorhinal cortex, showed the strongest association with 541 episodic memory in a cohort of individuals with normal cognition, mild cognitive 542 impairment and early AD dementia. This finding supports previous literature highlighting 543 relationships between medial temporal lobe tau pathology and decline in episodic 544 memory [Maass et al., 2018] . However, it is noteworthy that the data-driven temporoparietal ROI was again among the top performing ROIs in describing episodic memory, 546 despite the absence of medial temporal lobe structures within this ROI. 547\nThe results of this study thus suggest a possible advantage of data-driven 548 approaches in evaluating [\n18 F]AV1451 PET data as a biomarker for AD. This study adds 549 to a rapidly growing body of data-driven [\n18 F]AV1451-PET studies that have helped to 550 characterize features of this tracer in the context of AD. Sepulcre and colleagues 551 employed a similar unsupervised clustering approach on a set of cognitively intact elderly 552 individuals, which, similar to our study, revealed [\n18 F]AV1451-PET covariance between 553 regions of early-and later-stage tau accumulation [Sepulcre et al., 2017] . This suggests 554 these patterns of signal covariance are stable even in the earliest disease stages, lending 555 credence to the use of data-driven biomarkers in multiple contexts. Meanwhile, Jones et 556 al. used a data-driven Independent Components Analysis approach to summarize 557 [Jones et al., 2017] . While the authors concluded the resulting ROIs 558 represented functional brain networks, three of the ROIs bore a striking similarity to 559 those generated by our clustering approach. Our approach builds on these previous 560 studies by assessing relationships between data-driven ROIs and cognition, and by 561 comparing them with other existing ROIs. Maass et al. employed a series of a priori and 562 supervised data-driven methods to generate [\n18 F]AV1451 ROIs and found a relative 563 equivalence between these ROIs in their association with cognition and a number of other 564 disease markers [Maass et al., 2017] . However, consistent with our study, Maass et al. 565 found [\n18 F]AV1451 signal to covary most strongly within a specific set of AD 566 vulnerable-regions, and conclude that these regional measures may perform better than 567 whole-brain ROIs, particularly regarding associations with cognition. 568\nThe consistencies across these studies are also underscored by the consistent 569 patterns of cross-subject [\n18 F]AV1451 spatial covariance found across the two datasets in 570 the current study. Despite the fact that the ADNI cohort had many fewer subjects with 571 extensive tau burden, and despite differences in the demographic and clinical 572 characteristics between the ADNI and BioFINDER cohorts, unsupervised clustering of 573\n18 F]AV1451 data revealed a level of consistency between these two datasets that rivaled 574 the consistency of clustering within the ADNI dataset alone. Certain patterns of tau-PET 575 accumulation emerged in key regions across both cohorts. However, the patterns of tau-576 PET covariance were not entirely consistent between the two datasets, which could 577 reflect true heterogeneity across samples, or could be a matter of instability due to the 578 relatively small sample sizes (particularly in ADNI). However, better consistency 579 between datasets was found within the cluster-cores -regions of greatest clustering 580 stability within the BioFINDER dataset. This finding, alongside the performance of these 581\ncluster-cores as biomarkers in ADNI, suggests some degree of cluster stability may be 582 achieved with the BASC approach, even with smaller sample sizes. 583\nWe employed a widely used feature selection routine to identify those regions 584 most informative in describing association between [\n18 F]AV1451 signal and cognitive 585 data. The feature most strongly associated with global cognition was the data-driven 586 temporo-parietal cluster, which harbored a strong negative relationship when included 587 and MMSE controlling for tau pathology is consistent with the concept of cognitive 591 reserve [Stern, 2012] , and suggests that more highly educated subjects may experience 592 preserved cognition in the face of tau pathology [Hoenig et al., 2017] Sch\u00f6ll et al., 599 2016; Smith et al., 2016] , possibly representing binding to reactive astrocytes [Harada et 600 al., 2018] or iron deposits . Since age was not selected by the Lasso and 601 therefore was not included in the multivariate model, this may explain the positive 602 association between these regions and global cognition when accounting for 603\n18 F]AV1451 signal in the temporoparietal region. However, the fact that these ROIs 604 were selected instead of age suggests they may carry additional cognition-relevant 605 information, which may demand further exploration. Regardless, the negative 606 relationship between Cluster 4 (\"Temporo-parietal\") and global cognition was 607 substantially increased after regressing out these other variables. This suggests that 608\n18 F]AV1451-cognition relationships may be enhanced by regressing out off-target or 609 non-specific signal sources. 610\nOur study comes with a number of limitations. First, there were several 611 differences in characteristics between the two samples. We decided to use the 612 BioFINDER cohort for clustering given the broad range of both [\n18 F]AV1451 uptake 613 (Figure 1 ) and cognitive scores ( "}, {"section_title": "F]AV1451 images). 219", "text": "The region-growing algorithm resulted in a total of 730 atoms, which were included in 220 the BASC algorithm. BASC next performs recursive k-means clustering on bootstrapped 221 samples of the input data. After each clustering iteration, information about cluster 222 membership is stored as a binarized adjacency matrix. The adjacency matrices are 223 averaged resulting in a stability matrix representing probabilities of each pair of atoms 224 clustering together (Figure 2 ). Finally, hierarchical agglomerative clustering with Ward 225 criterion is applied to the stability matrix, resulting in the final clustering solution. The 226 process is repeated over several clustering solutions (k=1 -50), and the MSTEPs method 227 [Bellec, 2013] was implemented to find the most stable clustering solutions at different 228 resolutions. In the interest of multiple comparisons, and similarity to Braak 229 neuropathological staging (i.e. six ROIs), we chose the lowest resolution solution for 230 subsequent analysis (though the other two solutions are visualized). Note that no size 231 constraints were imposed on clustering solutions (except at the level of atom-size in the 232 region-growing -see above). Cluster-cores were determined as voxels where cluster 233 probability membership exceeded 0.5 (BASC default setting), eliminating unstable 234 voxels from analysis [Bellec et al., 2010; Garcia-Garcia et al., 2018] . After determining 235\ncluster-cores in the BIOFINDER cohort, we extracted the average [ 18 F]AV1451 SUVR 236 for each cluster core from all ADNI subjects, and these values were used for subsequent 237 analysis investigating associations with cognition. 238\nThe choice of the k-means algorithm for the initial clustering and hierarchical 239 clustering with ward criterion for partitioning the stability matrix are somewhat arbitrary. 240 K-means is a particularly fast algorithm and therefore lends itself well to bootstrapping. 241\nMeanwhile, the hierarchical clustering routine used in BASC is an appropriate algorithm 242 for the stability matrix, which is a similarity matrix, and it provides solutions at multiple 243 resolutions making it amenable to the BASC framework [Bellec et al., 2010] . Both 244 algorithms are standard, well validated, simple and involve few free parameters. This 245 latter point is important, as BASC itself only has a few principle parameters: namely the 246 number of clusters to extract (in this case, determined by MSTEPS), the number ofbootstrap samples (in this case, 500), and the size of the bootstrap sample (in this case, 248 the length of the input data -123 cases) [Bellec et al., 2010; Orban et al., 2015] . Other 249 parameters are associated with some of the steps peripheral to the central BASC 250 algorithm, namely the region growing preprocessing step and MSTEPS algorithm to 251 determine the number of clusters, and these parameters were left to their default settings. 252\nBriefly, the region growing includes a threshold parameter limiting the maximum size of 253 \"atoms\", which is mostly related to computational demand. Meanwhile, MSTEPS works 254 on a sparse grid and includes a parameter specifying the percentage of variance 255 maintained (similar to PCA). In addition, MSTEPS allows the definition of the size of the 256 window within which stable clusters are sought [Bellec, 2013] . 257 258"}, {"section_title": "Definition of Braak stage ROIs described in other studies", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "259", "text": "A number of studies have created ROIs mirroring the Braak stages described from 260 pathological studies. To test the utility of our data-driven ROIs vis-\u00e0-vis those defined in 261 correspondence to the pathological literature, we recreated the Braak ROIs described in 262 three different studies [Cho et al., 2016; Sch\u00f6ll et al., 2016; Schwarz et al., 2016] cluster agreement between the two clustering solutions. We also performed the same 300 analyses constrained within the cluster-cores from the BioFINDER solution, assuming 301 the agreement should be higher within the cores. We also calculated both the adjusted 302\nRand index and adjusted mutual information score (passing the BioFINDER solution as 303 the \"true labels\") as a measurement of overall consistency between the two clustering 304 solutions. To put these measurements into context, we performed five 50% splits of the 305 ADNI data and compared clustering solutions between each split. The purpose of this 306 analysis was to identify whether clustering within the ADNI dataset showed greater or 307 less stability compared to the stability between the ADNI and BioFINDER datasets. 308 309"}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "310", "text": "Our secondary analyses were aimed to assess the utility and generalizability of 311 our data-driven covariance networks. We performed linear models between these 312 covariance networks and the scores from six different available test scores assessing 313 global cognition and function (see Table S1 ). In addition, the scores were summarized 314 using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) using Singular Value Decomposition. The 315 PCA was fit to data from the six cognitive test scores, which were scaled to a 0 mean 316 with unit variance. The first component explained 72% of the total model variance, and 317 was used to transform the cognitive data into a single Global Cognition composite score. 318\nFor each of the cognitive tests, as well as the composite score, separate general linear 319 models for each ROI (40 in total; our five data-driven clusters and 35 ROIs from the 320 literature) were constructed with cognitive test score as the dependent variable and age, 321 sex and education as covariates. We repeated this analysis for the ADNI-MEM score to 322 test the relationship between [\n18 F]AV1451 and episodic memory in all 40 ROIs. Tests 323 surviving Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons are reported. 324\nIn order to identify a sparse set of non-redundant covariates that best describe the 325 global cognitive data in ADNI, we submitted all 40 tau ROIs plus age, sex and education 326 to a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) regression-based feature 327 selection routine. The Lasso uses L1 regularization (coordinate descent) to penalize 328 regression coefficients based on their maximum likelihood estimates, and is therefore an 329 optimal approach to select a small number of variables from a large number of collinear 330\ncovariates. In the current implementation, the degree of penalization is optimized using 331 10-fold cross-validation. All tau ROIs and demographics were scaled to be mean-332 centered with unit variance, and entered into the Lasso regression model with the Global 333\nCognition composite score as the dependent variable. Features selected by the Lasso 334 (absolute beta > 0.25) were entered together into a general linear model (GLM) with 335 MMSE as the dependent variable. Additionally, to ensure our results were representative 336 of global cognition and not specific to the composite score, the fitted values from this 337 GLM were used to predict scores of each of the six cognitive tests. Finally, the Lasso was 338 repeated separately for each of the individual test as well.\nWith the exception of BASC, all statistics were implemented using the pandas, 340 numpy, scipy and scikit-learn [Pedregosa et al., 2012] subjects. The MSTEPS algorithm identified five-, nine-and 32-cluster solutions as 360 optimal solutions. The parcellations generated from the three stable clustering solutions 361 are visualized in Supplementary Figure S1 . For the purposes of comparing with Braak 362 stage ROIs, we chose the lowest-resolution solution (k=5) for subsequent analyses, 363 visualized in Figure 2 . The clusters were interpreted and named as follows: \"1: 364 Subcortical\", \"2: Frontal\", \"3: Medial/Anterior/Inferior Temporal\", \"4: Temporo-365 parietal\" and \"5: Unimodal Sensory\". Cluster 3 bore resemblance to regions often 366 involved in early tau aggregation and atrophy [Braak and Braak, 1991] , while Cluster 4 367 also appeared similar to regions commonly associated with neurodegeneration in AD 368 [Dickerson et al., 2011; Landau et al., 2011] . Of note, the hippocampus was largely 369 unrepresented in any of the cluster-cores, though some voxels in the head of the 370 hippocampus were included in Cluster 3, and a few distributed voxels were included in 371\nCluster 1 (Subcortex). However, using a winner-takes-all clustering approach, the voxels 372 in the hippocampus were almost equally distributed between Cluster 1 and Cluster 3. 373 To ensure our results were not specific to the Global Cognition composite score, 398\nwe repeated this analysis using the six individual measures of global cognition and 399 function that composed the composite score (Table S1 ). The data-driven Cluster 4 400 (\"Temporo-parietal\") described global cognition better than all other ROIs using four of 401 the six cognitive measures, and was in the top five for all of them. Across all cognitive 402 measures, Clusters 4 and 3 (\"Medial/anterior/inferior temporal\") ranked best and second 403 best, respectively, at describing global cognitive data ( Figure 5) . Notably, the Schwarz 404\nStage I ROI also performed well across cognitive measures, except for the MMSE. 405\nFinally, since many ADNI subjects had either MCI or were at early stages of 406 dementia and may not show great variation in tests of global cognition scores, we 407 repeated the above analysis substituting global cognition with a composite measure ofepisodic memory. (Table S2) (Table S3) . 428\nFinally, the Lasso feature selection analysis was repeated for the six individual tests of 429 global cognition. The data-driven Cluster 4 was selected across all six analyses, and was 430 the only ROI selected for two analyses (Table S4) . Despite the existence of this sixth cluster and the distinct clinical composition of 444 the two datasets, some agreement between the two clustering solutions could be observed 445 (Figure 7) . Overall, 35% of brain voxels showed similar clustering patterns between the 446 two datasets (adjusted Rand index = 0.112; adjusted mutual information score = 0.189). 447 Figure 7A shows a cortical projection of voxels demonstrating similar clustering behavior 448 across both datasets. Across datasets, [\n18 F]AV1451 spatial covariance was consistent in 449 the medial and inferior temporal lobes, the primary visual cortex, the temporo-parietal 450 cortex, the medial frontal lobe, and most acutely in the subcortex. The subcortex formed 451 its own cluster in both datasets, both including the hippocampus, and overall showed 452 excellent agreement (Dice coefficient = 0.87). The Dice coefficients in the other clusters 453 ranged from 0.33 -0.46 ( Figure 4B ), indicating that around one third to one half of 454 voxels within clusters showed agreement between the two datasets. Notable regions of 455 disagreement included the precuneus and posterior cingulate (clustered with the temporal 456 lobes in ADNI), the insula (clustered with the medial frontal lobe in ADNI), the 457 sensorimotor cortex and the lateral frontal lobes (distributed across multiple clusters in 458 ADNI). When restricting the analysis only to voxels contained within the BioFINDER 459 cluster-cores, the agreement between the two datasets improved ( Figure 7B ). This 460 observation was consistent across all clusters except the temporo-parietal cluster, and 461 provides evidence supporting the notion that voxels that covary stably within datasets 462 may also show more stable covariance across datasets. 463\nFor the purposes of comparison, BASC was performed on five random 50% splits 464 of the ADNI sample, and the resulting partitions were compared to one another. The 465 average adjusted Rand index across these five within-ADNI train/test splits was 0.166 466 (SD = 0.031) and the average adjusted mutual information score was 0.225 (SD = 0.021). 467\nThese within-dataset scores were equivalent to the between-dataset scores when restricted 468 "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "472", "text": "In the present study, we applied an advanced unsupervised algorithm to identify 473 clusters of [\n18 F]AV1451 signal in 123 subjects ranging from cognitively normal to AD 474 dementia in the Swedish BioFINDER study. Our approach yielded clusters in the 475 temporoparietal, medial/inferior/anterior temporal, unimodal sensory and frontal cortex, 476 as well as the subcortex. In an independent sample of 90 subjects (ADNI), we performedgeneral linear models between tests of global cognition and each [\n18 F]AV1451 cluster, 478 adjusting for age, sex and education. In addition, we ran similar models using 35 479 neuropathologically derived ROIs from previous publications [Cho et al., 2016; Johnson 480 et al., 2016; Sch\u00f6ll et al., 2016; Schwarz et al., 2016] . Several ROIs exhibited strong 481 relationships with cognition, though certain data-driven clusters (temporoparietal and 482 medial/inferior/anterior temporal cortex) appeared to perform slightly but consistently 483 better than other ROIs in ADNI. Supporting this notion, the temporoparietal data-driven 484 cluster was among the three most important features (identified by a Lasso regression 485 model) for predicting global cognition scores.

This suggests that data-driven approaches to 489 delineate ROIs may improve clinical utility of [\n18 F]AV1451 PET data. 490\nThe tau-PET covariance networks derived from our clustering approach exhibited 491 a fair degree of overlap with Braak ROIs derived from autopsy studies, thereby 492 demonstrating biological relevance. Particularly, Cluster 3 (\"Medial/Anterior/Inferior 493 Temporal\") was reminiscent of regions involved in early tau accumulation, whereas 494\nCluster 5 (\"Unimodal Sensory\") demonstrated a high degree of similarity to regions 495 involved only in the latest stages of AD. In contrast, Cluster 4 (\"Temporo-parietal\") did 496 not strongly resemble any of the Braak regions, while its pattern, together with the pattern 497 of Cluster 3, spatially overlapped with cortical regions most vulnerable to 498 neurodegeneration in AD [Dickerson et al., 2011; Landau et al., 2011] . Furthermore, 499 signal in the hippocampus was heterogeneous, adding additional evidence that[\n18 F]AV1451 signal in this structure should be interpreted with caution [Cho et al., 2016 ] 501 Ikonomovic et al., 2016] . Similarly, our data-driven approach 502 suggested that most (but not all) frontal lobe structures exhibited [\n18 F]AV1451 signal 503 patterns unique to the rest of the cortex. This is notable considering the original Braak 504\nStage V aggregates frontal lobe structures with many of the temporo-parietal structures 505 captured in our Cluster 4. Part of the successful description of cognitive data by the data-506 driven ROI may be due to its isolation from many of these frontal lobe structures, which 507 may be contributing signal less informative to AD progression, particularly in early 508 disease stages. Finally, our data-driven ROIs provide information that may reconcile 509 some differences between existing Braak ROIs. For example, in our study, [\n18 F]AV1451 510 signal in the putamen and insula covaried with other regions involved in early tau 511 accumulation, which was similar to the ROIs described by Sch\u00f6ll, Lockhart et al., but not 512 Table S5 for a summary).
