[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Lack of treatment response in patients with late-life depression is common. The role of brain betaamyloid (A\u03b2) deposition in treatment outcome in subjects with late-life depression remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate brain A\u03b2 deposition in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) with differing treatment outcomes in vivo using 18 F-florbetapir imaging. This study included 62 MDD patients and 18 healthy control subjects (HCs).We first employed the Maudsley staging method (MSM) to categorize MDD patients into two groups according to treatment response: mild treatment resistance (n = 29) and moderate-to-severe treatment resistance (n = 33).The standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of each volume of interest was analysed, and voxel-wise comparisons were made between the MDD patients and HCs. Vascular risk factors, serum homocysteine level, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype were also determined. Results: The MDD patients with moderate-to-severe treatment resistance had higher 18 F-florbetapir SUVRs than the HCs in the parietal region (P < 0.01). Voxel-wise comparisons further demonstrated elevated SUVRs in MDD patients with moderate-to-severe treatment resistance in the precuneus, parietal, temporal, and occipital regions. The MDD patients with mild treatment resistance were found to have increased 18 F-florbetapir uptake mainly in the left frontal and parietal regions as compared with the HCs. In addition, voxel-to-voxel correlation analysis showed that brain A\u03b2 deposition was correlated positively with MSM score in the occipital region.\n18 F-florbetapir SUVRs were correlated negatively with Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score in the sample of all MDD patients (r = \u22120.355, P = 0.005). Conclusions: This study provided preliminary evidence that region-specific A\u03b2 deposition was present in some (but not all) MDD patients, especially in those with moderate-to-severe treatment resistance, and their depressive symptoms may represent prodromal manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Depressive symptomatology in old age, particularly in subjects with a poor treatment response, may underscore early changes of AD-related pathophysiology."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Late-life depression is common in the elderly and usually accompanies cognitive and functional decline, which may result in increased mortality and disability. More than half of patients with late-life depression were found to respond only partially to initial first-line pharmacologic treatment [1, 2] . Impaired cognitive function is known to be frequently associated with response to treatment for depression [2] . Mounting evidence from many epidemiologic studies has indicated that a lifetime history of major depression is associated with an increased risk of developing dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) [3] [4] [5] . One postmortem study [6] showed that AD patients with a lifetime history of major depression had more pronounced amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangles as compared with AD patients without a history of depression. Non-invasive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to assess brain beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) deposition, one of the hallmarks of AD pathology, permits direct assessment of brain AD pathology in vivo. Some studies have shown that a lifetime history of major depression is associated with brain A\u03b2 deposition [7, 8] .\nNotably, some recent studies have provided evidence to show that depressive symptoms in old age might be affected by brain A\u03b2 pathology. One large-sample prospective study [9] focused on cognitively normal older adults and found that an elevated A\u03b2 burden increased the risk of developing clinically significant depressive symptoms during follow-up in the preclinical stage of AD. In addition, a recent review article [10] proposed that brain A\u03b2 accumulation may be an etiologic factor affecting the emergence of late-life depression and the level of treatment resistance by interfering with the brain mood-related frontolimbic network. However, at present, the association between brain A\u03b2 deposition and treatment outcome in late-life depression is not well understood.\nTreatment resistance in patients with depression is a significant clinical phenomenon and has both personal and social impacts owing to cognitive impairment, poor functioning and increased mortality [11] . Currently, treatment resistance in patients with depression is defined as failure to achieve remission following two trials of antidepressant treatment, but there is no consistent operational definition [12] . The Maudsley staging method (MSM) [13, 14] was recently developed in order to incorporate additional factors related to depressive disorder itself, in addition to a number of failed treatment trials. The MSM results in a score between 3 and 15 and allows classification of treatment resistance into three categories (mild, moderate and severe).\nTherefore, we aimed in the present study to investigate brain A\u03b2 deposition in MDD patients without dementia with differing levels of treatment resistance.\nWe hypothesized that greater resistance to treatment for depression would be related to greater amyloid deposition in MDD patients. In the current study, we used 18 F-florbetapir PET to investigate (1) brain A\u03b2 deposition in MDD patients with differing levels of treatment resistance and (2) the relationship between A\u03b2 burden and treatment resistance, in order to determine whether treatment resistance is associated with amyloid deposition in MDD patients."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects and protocol", "text": "This study included 62 MDD patients without dementia and 18 healthy controls (HCs). A consecutive series of MDD patients was recruited from the geriatric psychiatric outpatient clinic at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH). To be eligible for inclusion, patients had to be aged over 50, had to be diagnosed with MDD according to the DSM-IV criteria, had to have a clinical dementia rating (CDR) of 0 or 0.5, and must have been functioning well in activities of daily living. The control subjects were all confirmed to have a lifetime absence of psychiatric illness. The exclusion criteria for all subjects included clinically significant medical diseases or neurological diseases, alcohol or other substance dependence within the past year, and a current severe risk of suicide or psychotic depression. None of the participants met the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria for probable AD or the DSM-IV criteria for dementia. In addition, three Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) values representing different educational levels were used to exclude subjects in this study [15, 16] , i.e. less than 16 indicated illiteracy, less than 21 indicated grade school literacy, and less than 24 indicated junior high school and higher education literacy. These cutoff values have a validated sensitivity of 100% for dementia [16] . All subjects were evaluated by the same board-certified geriatric psychiatrist to examine their clinical characteristics.\nThe MDD patients were evaluated in terms of lifetime presence and course of major depressive episodes according to the DSM-IV criteria, treatment history, and severity of depression. Diagnosis and treatment of subjects with a lifetime history of MDD were also assessed using available medical information, including charts and information obtained from the treating physician. The clinical characteristics of MDD, including age of onset, number of major depressive episodes, treatment and response history, and presence of late-onset MDD (cutoff age 60 years) were recorded for further analysis. All eligible subjects were subjected to 18 F-florbetapir PET imaging. We also measured the serum homocysteine level and assessed vascular risk factors as defined by the Framingham stroke risk score (FSRS). The ApoE genotype of all subjects was determined by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification of genomic DNA. The MMSE score was taken to represent global cognitive function, and the CDR Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) was used to characterize cognitive and functional performance.

The MSM incorporates three main factors: treatment (i.e. number of antidepressant treatment failures and whether augmentation or electroconvulsive therapy had been used), severity of symptoms, and duration of presenting episode. The MSM score was used as a covariate in subsequent analyses. Staging of treatment resistance was also performed according to three categories of severity: mild (score = 3-6), moderate (score = 7-10), and severe (score = 11-15). In this study, only five MDD patients were classified into the group of subjects with severe treatment resistance based on MSM score. Due to the limited number of patients with severe treatment resistance in our sample, we categorized the MDD patients into two groups overall: subjects with mild treatment resistance (MSM score \u22646) and subjects with moderate-tosevere treatment resistance (MSM score \u22657).

Post hoc analysis showed significant differences between the MDD patients with moderate-tosevere resistance and the HCs (P < 0.01). Although not significant, the global cortical SUVR in the three groups seemed to be ordered as follows: moderate-to-severe resistance > mild resistance > HCs.\nThe SPM analyses are presented in Fig. 1 . The results showed that the MDD patients with moderate-to-severe resistance had significantly higher 18 F-florbetapir SUVRs than the HCs in the precuneous, parietal, temporal, and occipital areas.

To our knowledge, this was the first study to investigate brain A\u03b2 load in middle-aged to elderly MDD patients with different treatment outcomes in vivo using 18 F-florbetapir imaging. In this study, we first employed the MSM score to categorize MDD patients into two groups: mild treatment resistance and moderate-to-severe treatment resistance. Under the circumstance of no differences in demographic characteristics between groups, the MDD patients with moderateto-severe resistance exhibited higher 18 F-florbetapir binding than the HCs in the parietal region according to VOI analysis. Further analysis of the parametric 18 F-florbetapir images was conducted to examine differences in regional SUVRs between groups. The MDD patients with moderate-to-severe treatment resistance had increased 18 F-florbetapir uptakes in the precuneus, parietal, temporal, and occipital regions; also, the patients with mild treatment resistance were found to have increased 18 Impaired cognitive function in late-life depression and MRI white-matter hyperintensities have been frequently shown to be associated with the outcome of clinical treatment for depression [2, 15] . Our previous study [19] showed that MDD patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) had heterogeneously elevated 18 F-florbetapir retention. The MDD patients with amnestic MCI had similar regional distributions of A\u03b2 burden to the early AD patients, further suggesting a risk of developing AD in the future. In the present study, the MDD patients with moderate-to-severe treatment resistance were also found to have an A\u03b2 spatial distribution similar to those of patients with MCI or early AD [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . In addition, cognitive function as assessed by the MMSE score was negatively correlated to amyloid deposition in this group of MDD patients. Collectively, the characteristics described above suggested that the MDD patients with moderate-to-severe treatment resistance might be at the preclinical or even prodromal stage of AD. A recent study using 11 C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) imaging [25] found that cross-sectional depressive symptoms were positively correlated with the mean cortical A\u03b2 deposition in cognitively normal subjects with a higher cerebral A\u03b2 burden, but not in subjects with low and medium A\u03b2 burdens. The main increase in A\u03b2 pathology in subjects with a high cerebral A\u03b2 burden was localized to the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex as compared with subjects with a medium A\u03b2 burden. Collectively, recent findings have implied that more aggressive depressive symptoms in later life might be related to brain region-specific A\u03b2 deposition and may indicate that these patients are at risk of preclinical AD."}, {"section_title": "F-", "text": "Previous studies have suggested that structural and functional abnormalities in the brain network may contribute to resistance to antidepressant treatment in depressed older patients without dementia [26, 27] . In one study which investigated depression in AD, depressed AD patients showed decreased functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex, the right lingual gyrus, and the right occipital lobe compared to non-depressed AD patients [28] . In another study, during treatment of depression, remitters to escitalopram showed a significant tendency to modify resting-state activity in the occipital cortex. Conversely, non-remitters showed much lower levels of significant changes. It suggested that treatment response might be associated with activity in the occipital resting-state network [29] . In the present study, compared with the MDD patients with mild treatment resistance, the patients with moderate-tosevere resistance had greater 18 F-florbetapir binding in the temporal and occipital regions. Moreover, MSM score was found to be significantly correlated with A\u03b2 burden over the occipital region. Therefore, our findings also suggested that treatment response of depression might be associated with local or distant damage from A\u03b2 pathology occurred in these brain regions.\nNotably, the MDD patients with mild treatment resistance exhibited elevated A\u03b2 loads, mainly in the left frontal and parietal areas. A recently published study from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [30] focused on a population of A\u03b2-positive MCI subjects and found that subsyndromally depressed subjects had elevated amyloid loads in the left medial frontal, left superior temporal, and left parietal regions as compared with non-depressed subjects. In another recent study [8] , amnestic MCI patients with a lifetime MDD history were compared with amnestic MCI Fig. 3 Relationship between global 18 F-florbetapir SUVR and MMSE score in the MDD patients patients without a lifetime MDD history. The regions with higher A\u03b2 depositions in the patients with a lifetime MDD history included the bilateral prefrontal cortex and some regions in the right temporal area. These brain regions affected by A\u03b2 pathology comprise and connect with the prefrontal network known to be related to depressive disorder [31] . In our study, voxel-wise analyses showed that the MDD patients with moderate-tosevere resistance had significantly higher 18 F-florbetapir SUVRs than the HCs in the precuneous, parietal, temporal, and occipital regions, but not in the frontal area. Thus, we further performed subgroup analyses for amyloid positive group of the MDD patients. The cerebral amyloid positive cutoff point (global SUVR 1.178) was determined using independent data obtained from clinically diagnosed AD patients in a previous study by our research team [24] . The subgroup analyses found that the MDD patients with moderate-to-severe resistance (n = 8) also had significantly higher 18 F-florbetapir SUVRs than the HCs in the frontal area and showed the similar regional distribution of increased 18 F-florbetapir uptakes (n = 9) (data not shown). The preliminary findings of our study also suggested that depressive symptomatology might be related to A\u03b2 deposition in the frontal area. Some researchers have hypothesized that A\u03b2 accumulation might lead to pathophysiologic events that impair the brain frontolimbic or frontostriatal circuitry and predispose the patient to treatment-resistant depressive symptoms before the emergence of clinically significant cognitive impairment [15, 16, 25, 32] . Based on the collective evidence mentioned above, we speculated that the brain regions of the mood-related prefrontal network affected by A\u03b2 pathology might be linked to the clinical presentation of late-life depression.\nGreater amyloid burden had been demonstrated to be correlated to lower cognitive performance in cognitive normal older individuals [33, 34] . The present study was consistent with the previous results and found a negative correlation between 18 F-florbetapir SUVRs and the MMSE score in the sample of all MDD patients. We further conducted multiple regression analyses, and the negative correlation remained significant among the whole MDD group and the MDD patients with moderate-tosevere treatment resistance. Impaired cognitive function in late-life depression has been frequently related to the outcome of clinical treatment for depression [2] . It suggested the potential association between brain A\u03b2 deposition and treatment outcome in late-life depression. Given small sample size in this study, there was no significant difference of global SUVRs between two MDD groups. However, the negative correlation between 18 F-florbetapir SUVRs and the MMSE score was noted when the MDD subjects with moderate-to-severe treatment resistance were included. It implied the relationship between A\u03b2 loads and cognition in MDD patients was driven by the subjects with moderate-to-severe treatment resistance who had relatively higher A\u03b2 accumulation and lower MMSE score, compared to the patients with mild treatment resistance. Most importantly, region-specific brain A\u03b2 depositions similar to early AD patterns were observed in the MDD patients with moderate-to-severe treatment resistance. Therefore, this group of MDD subjects may be at greater risk of developing AD in the future.\nMore and more evidence is being produced that supports the hypothesis that depressive symptomatology in old age, in persons both with and without MCI, may be an early symptom of an underlying AD neuropathological mechanism [25, 32, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . Furthermore, one study [40] showed that patients with both MCI and depression are at greater risk of developing AD than those with MCI alone. In our previous study, patients without dementia with lifetime MDD had regionally higher 18 F-florbetapir SUVRs in the parietal and precuneus cortex areas [7] . Meanwhile, the results of the present study showed that the MDD patients with a higher level of treatment resistance had regionally higher 18 F-florbetapir SUVRs in the parietal cortex area. Previous evidence demonstrated that a higher A\u03b2 burden in this area is linked to AD conversion and was found among patients with early AD [41] [42] [43] [44] . Therefore, this group of MDD subjects may be at greater risk of developing AD, and their cognitive function should be followed up in a clinical setting. The results of this study suggested that late-life depression in some (but not all) patients might be related to disruption of mood-related frontolimbic networks by A\u03b2 deposition, which may cause a vicious circle, further worsening the outcome of depression and impairing cognitive function. However, results should be interpreted with caution due to small subject number of this preliminary study limitation. The inspection was done using a less strict statistical cutoff point (P < 0.01, uncorrected). Future work with more subjects could overcome the methodological issue encountered during our study. Although the present study suggests that amyloid accumulation may be associated with early signs of cognitive decline, longitudinal studies are required to understand how likely and how long it will be before such subjects progress to more serious levels of impairment. Future studies are needed to examine whether A\u03b2 deposition is a factor that directly moderates treatment response in late-life MDD patients."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The present study had several limitations. First, the sample size used in the study was relatively small; thus, our findings may not be relevant to other populations or groups. Given the relatively small sample size, we were unable to classify the subjects into amyloid positive/negative or with/ without MCI groups. Second, we included cases only from an outpatient setting to form the MDD group, which could explain the relatively small number of patients with severe treatment resistance; thus, the results are not necessarily representative of the larger population of patients with MDD. The small sample size might lead to a result that may not be of sufficient power to detect differences in regional and global amyloid burdens between subjects with severe, moderate, and mild treatment resistance and the control group. Third, the MSM was developed using a sample group that included in the main MDD patients with severe treatment resistance. The authors also suggested that the MSM might carry the potential for nongeneralizability of findings to less severe MDD or outpatient populations [13] . Other limitations of this method also exist: (1) the number of augmentation strategies and combinations of antidepressants are not included in the dimension of treatment failure; (2) the duration of illness is arbitrarily divided into three categories; (3) use of the chart review methodology causes potential recall bias; and (4) there is a lack of information about psychiatric/somatic comorbidity (operationalized by criteria) and previous psychotherapies. However, compared with other treatment resistance staging methods, the MSM is user friendly and enables prediction of clinical outcome after long-term follow-up [14] . Fourth, as this study employed a crosssectional design, causality was difficult to establish. While it would be premature to draw definitive conclusions from this analysis, our findings may be useful as pilot data for future studies that include longitudinal follow-up and more representative cohorts. Finally, the MDD patients had received various antidepressant and augmentation treatments over their lifetime before they were recruited into this cross-sectional imaging study, and it was difficult to precisely estimate the lifetime cumulative dosages of antidepressants. The potential effects of antidepressant treatment on A\u03b2 deposition and regional distribution are unknown. Future studies should be carefully designed to assess the effects of medications on amyloid binding through longitudinal follow-up."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The present study highlighted differences in regionspecific brain A\u03b2 depositions in middle-aged to elderly MDD patients with differing levels of treatment resistance. Regional patterns of early AD pathology were observed in the MDD patients with moderate-to-severe treatment resistance. The patients with mild treatment resistance exhibited elevated A\u03b2 loads, mainly in the left frontal and parietal areas. Such depressive symptoms in old age may potentially represent either prodromal manifestation of AD or an independent process interacting with underlying AD-related pathophysiology. Our findings may have clinical relevance, in that treatment response in patients with late-life depression could predict brain AD pathology and aid clinicians in identifying patients in need of vigilant follow-up to assess cognitive function."}]
