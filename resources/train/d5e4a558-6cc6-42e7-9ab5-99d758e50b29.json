The evaluation of coastal resources is necessary for conservation and management efforts, especially as sea-level rise and anthropogenic alteration impact tidal wetlands. This research project consists of three separate studies in the vicinity of the Delaware River and Bay coastline within the Delaware Estuary. They include: \uf0b7 The determination of the optimal (\"Goldilocks\") vertical growth range and above-ground and below-ground biomass production of Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) with respect to mean low water (MLW) and mean high water (MHW) tidal datums within six watersheds (Blackbird Creek, Bombay Hook Complex, St. Jones River, Murderkill, River, Prime Hook Creek, and Broadkill River). In these watersheds, S. alterniflora has an optimal growth range between -0.07 and 0.18 m relative to MHW elevation and between 1.25 and 1.72 m, relative to MLW. The results can be used to assess the ability of a marsh to combat changing conditions associated with sea-level rise, by determining whether or not the marsh platform is within the optimal growth range of S. alterniflora. This assessment method can be used to determine"}, {"section_title": "ABSTRACT", "text": "xvi whether a tidal wetland area is in need of restoration for longer-term sustainability, through the optimization of below-ground biomass production. \uf0b7 An assessment of water level management actions on accretion rates and wetland platform elevations of impoundment marshes using neighboring unimpounded tidal wetlands as reference sites. Nine impoundments (three in northern Delaware (in the vicinity of New Castle, Delaware), four in Central Delaware Bay, and two in lower Delaware Bay) and four reference tidal wetlands (two in Northern Delaware, one in Central Delaware Bay, and one in the lower Delaware Bay) were studied. Regular tidal inundation is vital in the development and evolution of natural marsh platforms. The study results show that only three of the nine impoundments having statistically significant differences (at the p<0.05 and/or p<0.01 levels) in mean accretion rate. Only two of the nine impoundments had significant differences (at the p<0.05 level) in mineral mass accumulation rates. Seven of the nine impoundments have significant differences (at the p<0.05 and/or p<0.01 levels) in organic mass accumulation rates. The effect of water level management on a wetland's ability to produce below-ground biomass and retain organic material appears to drive the differences in accretion and marsh platform elevation between impoundments and natural wetlands. It is paramount to manage water levels for species of concern, but in a way that below-ground biomass is optimized and decomposition rates are not enhanced through long-term marsh platform exposures. xvii \uf0b7 The utilization of surface elevation table (SET) monitoring within two watersheds, one relatively un-impacted (Blackbird Creek) and the other a heavily impacted mixed urban, suburban, and agricultural watershed (St. Jones River), to evaluate recent trends in tidal marsh surface elevation and short-term vertical accretion. The monitoring revealed that six of the eight sites showed a loss in marsh surface elevation (both shallow and deep) that has not recovered. Deep and shallow elevation changes occurred independent of accretion. It was observed that two (Eagles Nest and Beaver Branch) of the eight monitoring sites experienced rapid gains in elevation (and losses not experienced at the other six sites). The exact cause of large-scale wetland elevation losses that did not recover as of the end of the sampling are difficult to determine. However, moderate El Ni\u00f1o and high sea-level anomalies occurred along the East Coast during the sampling period. The lack of recovery may denote the overall stress of sea-level rise on the tidal wetlands and, as higher-level anomalies occur, vegetation cannot rebound in a manner that some marshes have demonstrated or been theorized to do under un-impacted conditions."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The evaluation of coastal resources is necessary for conservation and management efforts especially as sea-level rise and anthropogenic alteration impact tidal wetlands along the East Coast of the United States including the State of Delaware. The rate of relative local sea-level rise is currently estimated to be 3.14 to 3.20 millimeters per year (mm/yr) in the Delaware Bay, and it is projected to accelerate at rates that would produce an increase in sea level of 1 meter (m) over the next 100 years (Gornitz and Lebedeff, 1987;Nikitina et al., 2000;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2001; NOAA, 2014). Temporal variation in the rate of sea-level rise is one of the main controls on marsh development or destruction (Rampino and Sanders, 1981;Stevenson et al., 1986;Patrick and DeLaune, 1990;Ward et al., 1998). A marsh's ability to keep pace with sea-level rise is directly correlated to the rate of elevation change along the marsh surface. The rate of sea-level rise has to be slow enough that appreciable quantities of mineral matter or organic materials can be deposited to build (and maintain) the marsh surface to an elevation near mean water level (Frey and Basan, 1985;McKee and Patrick, 1988;and Ward et al., 1998). If sea-level rise outpaces vertical sediment accretion, wetland loss will result everywhere that lateral wetland migration is not possible. In addition, the increased presence of salt water will cause shifts in plant Chapter 1 community composition (Callaway et al., 1996;Burkett and Kusler, 2000;Winter, 2000;Darke and Megonigal, 2003). Anthropogenic alterations such as development of coastal areas, waterwithdrawal projects, dams, and reservoirs can affect the complex interactions of sediment deposition, erosion, and subsidence that determine wetland surface elevation (Davis, 1997;Najjar et al., 2000;Darke and Megonigal, 2003). Within the Delaware Estuary, intensive human alterations to wetlands have occurred in varying intensities over the course of the last several hundred years. Alterations of the wetlands have included: the impoundment of wetlands for farming (1700's and 1800's) and wildlife enhancement (mid to late 1900's), the dredging of channels for navigational purposes (1700's through the early 1900's), and the ditched and dredging of channels to reduce the prevalence of mosquitos (1930's through 1980's). These alterations have all affected the hydrology of the tidal marshes. Understanding how wetlands and their vegetation will respond is necessary to constrain the sustainability of tidal wetlands. Current dynamic trends (surface elevation, sedimentation, subsidence, and vegetation parameters) provide information that can be used to predict how wetlands will respond in the future to natural and anthropogenic stressors. The relationships between inorganic and organic sedimentation, subsidence, vegetation composition, health and density, and their role in governing changes in marsh surface elevation are key parameters. In a final report by the Coastal States Organization (CSO) Climate Change Work Group (\"The Role of Coastal Zone Management Programs in Adaptation to Climate Change\" (2007)), several critical research needs are identified relative to the impact of accelerated sea-level rise on coastal habitats. These include: \"natural sediment sources, the movement of sediment within the system, and the locations and rates of sediment deposition need to be quantified for discrete shoreline reaches in order for predictive capabilities to be developed (CSO, 2007).\" In addition, the report indicates that there \"continues to be a need for improved models that predict the migration and/or vertical accretion of coastal wetlands in response to accelerated sealevel rise, information on the costs of response options, and the consequence of taking no action.\" The effects of sea-level rise and/or water level management upon natural and impounded marsh platform development and the effect of changing tidal levels upon wetland vegetation has not been studied in detail within the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Establishing baselines for marsh surface elevations is an important firststep in determining the impacts of sea-level rise and anthropogenic alterations on wetlands and the ecosystem services they provide. In this dissertation, three separate wetland monitoring and research studies are presented in the vicinity of the Delaware River and Bay coastline within the Delaware Estuary. The specific studies are: \uf0b7 The determination of an optimal (or \"Goldilocks\") marsh platform elevation over which biomass production of Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) is maximized. This study examines the vertical growth range including aboveground and below-ground biomass production of S. alterniflora with respect to mean low water (MLW) and mean high water (MHW) tidal datums. The results are used to examine how the growth range for S. alterniflora can be used to assess the sustainability and restoration potential for wetlands, and the effects of altered hydrology on biomass production. S. alterniflora is the dominant halophyte within Delaware's marshes and is a key component in need of better understanding to evaluate the resiliency of tidal wetlands in response to rising sea level (DNREC, 2013). Delaware Bay, and two in lower Delaware Bay) and four reference tidal wetlands were sampled to determine their rates of accretion over the past 60 years and their wetland platform elevations relative to local tidal datums. The duration of impoundment and water level management goals vary between these sites. This allows for a unique opportunity to evaluate the short-term and longterm implications of water-level control on the evolution of marshes associated with impoundments. \uf0b7 The utilization of surface elevation table (SET) monitoring including the use of marker horizons at sites within two Delaware watersheds, Blackbird Creek (relatively un-impacted watershed) and St. Jones River (a heavily impacted mixed urban-suburban, and agricultural watershed), to evaluate recent trends in tidal marsh surface elevation and short-term vertical accretion. The elevation and accretion records provide a means of monitoring the response of a marsh to seasonal, annual, and decadal changes in tidal levels. SET and marker horizon data also provide information on surficial and below-ground processes. For example, differences between rates of vertical accretion and elevation change may be attributed to dewatering, enhanced root growth, decomposition, and/or root growth collapse. These studies including the methods used, results, and discussions of the results are described in Chapters 2 through 4 of this dissertation, respectively. A summary of the major conclusions from these studies is presented in Chapter 5."}, {"section_title": "DEVELOPING THE GOLDILOCKS ELEVATION FOR SPARTINA ALTERNIFLORA: IMPLICATIONS FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND RESTORATION POTENTIAL OF WETLANDS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The role of marsh surface elevation on the growth of halophytes, especially Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora), is documented in many studies (McKee and Mendelssohn, 1989;McKee and Patrick, 1998;Gough and Grace, 1998;Baldwin et al., 2001;Morris et al., 2002;Konisky and Burdick, 2004). Of particular interest is the role of marsh surface elevation on the below-ground biomass production of S. alterniflora. Below-ground biomass production plays a large role in enabling tidal wetlands to vertically accrete to keep pace with rising sea levels (Reed, 1995;Cahoon et al., 2006). The total below-ground biomass produced by halophytes is a factor in dictating the elevation change of the marsh platform, and the sustainability of the marsh with respect to long-term coupling of the marsh surface with sea level (Stevenson et al., 1986;Reed, 1995). McKee and Patrick (1998) and Morris et al. (2002) find that natural S. alterniflora platform elevation strongly correlates with the elevation of mean high water (MHW). The growth of most salt marsh species is negatively affected by increased flooding (Kirwan and Guntensbergen, 2012;Janousek and Mayo, 2013;Voss et al., 2013). Increased flooding upon a vegetated wetland platform lowers the redox potential, which in conjunction with more saline conditions, can generate elevated Chapter 2 sulfide concentrations (McKee and Mendelssohn 1989). Higher sulfide conditions negatively affect wetland plants and can result in lower biomass production (Koch et al., 1990). Changes in flooding intensity, duration, and salinity may differentially affect above-ground and below-ground production, several studies suggest that flooding disproportionally adversely affects below-ground biomass root production (Rozema and Bloom, 1977;Langley et al., 2013;Janousek and Mayo, 2013). Wetland plants allocate growth in response to the availability of resources such as nutrients and light, with abiotic factors, flooding, pH, etc., also affecting their growth (Tilman 1988; Janousek and Mayo, 2013). Primary productivity of salt marsh vegetation is regulated by changes in sea level (land subsidence plus eustatic change in sea level), sediment supply, and tidal range. The vegetation, as a result, constantly modifies elevation of the platform toward an equilibrium with sea level (Stevenson et al., 1986;Reed, 1995). S. alterniflora is considered an indicator and foundation species because of its ability to modify the physical environment to optimize its growth within tidal marshes (Pennings and Bertness, 2001). McKee and Patrick (1988) find that the occurrence and growth range of S. alterniflora correlates with the local tidal range of a watershed. Although primarily confined to the intertidal zone, they propose that the occurrence limits do not directly correspond to a consistent elevation relative to a tidal datum in all locations (McKee and Patrick, 1988). The disparity in the vertical distribution of S. alterniflora, between different watersheds, is chiefly due to the differences in mean tide range (MTR). A positive correlation between MTR and growth range exists, but it is limited to the local tidal conditions within a study region (McKee and Patrick, 1988;Morris et al., 2002). Morris et al. (2002) builds upon McKee and Patrick's (1988) findings and proposes that every marsh has: a theoretical optimum rate of relative sea-level rise (RSLR), an optimum depth below MHW at which the marsh community is most productive, and an equilibrium depth of inundation below MHW that can be greater or less than the optimum (Morris et al., 2002). The elevation of a marsh platform relative to mean sea level (MSL) is primarily one of the dominant factors in biomass productivity (Mendelssohn and Morris, 2000). S. alterniflora, primary production (both above-and below-ground biomass) varies throughout the marsh itself and within the tidal range and is found to be highest at the lower elevations of its vertical growth range (Pomeroy et al., 1981). At lower surface elevations (and thus greater extent of inundation), growth of S. alterniflora is likely limited and the marsh plant community is replaced by unvegetated tidal mudflats (Morris et al., 2002). A marsh platform positioned above its ideal elevation for biomass production is more sustainable because, in the future, it will endure a higher RSLR (Morris et al., 2002). There is an ideal marsh platform elevation for tidal wetland vegetation productivity, though it can differ by study area as a function of tidal range and other factors (McKee and Patrick, 1988). The constraint on productivity is an important factor in maintaining elevation in response to increased flooding and inundation. The evolution of the marsh platform could bring about increases in production and biomass density that could enhance sediment deposition by increasing the efficiency of sediment trapping (Gleason et al., 1979;Leonard and Luther, 1995;Yang, 1998), and increasing below-ground biomass production, which increases the elevation from the bottom up (Reed, 1995). Questions with respect to the growth range of S. alterniflora include: can calculated growth ranges be correlated across different watersheds within a region? and are the effects of elevation on below-ground biomass production consistent throughout a region? Being able to apply a standardized S. alterniflora growth range across different watersheds within a region allows for monitoring of below-ground conditions within a marsh and the potential sustainability of the marsh platform in response to changes in sea level. A greater understanding of the equilibrium between S. alterniflora elevation and the tidal datum increases the capability to assess platform stability. This can then be used in thin-layer application of sediment restoration efforts to optimize the quantity (i.e. thickness or depth) of sediment that could be added to a marsh to enhance S. alterniflora growth and long-term sustainability. One of the main goals of this study is to examine the vertical growth range of S. alterniflora, with respect to MLW and MHW, and the effect of that range on aboveground and below-ground biomass production. This study is limited in that marsh platform elevation is only one of many factors that dictates the growth and health of S. alterniflora. However, it is one of the most important factors impacting the halophyte (Reed, 1995;Cahoon et al., 2006). Marsh elevation is well-documented as a first-order control in dictating wetland flooding frequency, length of inundation, available suspended sediment concentration, and type and density of vegetative cover (Morris et al., 2002). Because of its limited nature, this analysis is not expected to completely account for all above-ground and/or below-ground biomass variability or deviation in growth elevation with respect to MHW or MLW. It is theorized that altered hydrology (i.e. mosquito ditching, channelization, impounding, and water level management) affects the health of S. alterniflora wetlands in Delaware, and the data collected in this study within two heavily impacted watersheds, in addition to four watersheds with significantly lower levels of alteration, assist in determining if changes in hydrology directly impact S. alterniflora growth. This study presents the correlation of tidal datum elevations within each of the study areas to the above-ground and below-ground biomass of S. alterniflora. The relationships are used to examine the effects of altered hydrology, and how the growth range for S. alterniflora can be used to assess the sustainability and restoration potential for wetlands. S. alterniflora is the dominant halophyte within Delaware's marshes and is considered by natural resources managers to be a key component in need of better understanding in evaluating the resiliency of tidal wetlands to rising sea level (DNREC, 2013).\n\nThe evaluation of coastal resources is a necessity for resource managers and conservation organizations, especially as sea-level rise and anthropogenic alterations have notably impacted tidal wetlands. Assessing marsh surface elevation trends are useful in determining impacts of sea level on wetlands and the ecosystem services that they provide. Local rates of relative sea-level rise of 3.14 to 3.20 mm/yr have been observed in the Delaware Bay, and they are projected to increase to as high as 10 mm/yr within the next 100 years (Gornitz and Lebedeff, 1987;Nikitina et al., 2000;IPCC, 2001;NOAA, 2014). Temporal variations in the rate of sea-level rise are one of the main controls on marsh development (Rampino and Sanders, 1981;Stevenson et al., 1986;Patrick and DeLaune, 1990;Ward et al., 1998). A marsh's ability to keep pace with sea-level rise is directly correlated with the rate of elevation change along the marsh surface. The rate of sea-level rise has to be slow enough so that appreciable quantities of mineral matter or organic materials can be deposited to build and maintain the level of the marsh to at least approximately the mean water level (Frey and Basan, 1985;McKee and Patrick, 1988;and Ward et al., 1998)."}, {"section_title": "Location", "text": "The biomass and elevation data were collected from six sub-estuaries (St Jones River, Blackbird Creek, Prime Hook Creek, Murderkill River, Broadkill River, and Bombay Hook Estuarine Complex (including the Leipsic, Mahon, and Simon's Rivers)) within the Delaware River and Bay Estuary (Figure 2.1). All of these sub-estuaries are microtidal (< 2 m), with ranges at their mouths of 1.28 to 1.75 m (Table 2.1). The tidal range increases north along the Delaware coast due to the influence of the constriction of the estuary (Sommerfield and Wong, 2011). The furthest upstream occurrence of short-form S. alterniflora varies between the sub-estuaries with in-channel distances ranging from 6,990 to 10,450 m (Table 2.1). The five more southern sub-estuaries are seasonally polyhaline, while the most northern sub-estuary can be polyhaline in the fall with spring salinity values of a more mesohaline range (Figure 2.1). All of these systems are heavily discharge dependent in their salinity values. Biomass data for each study area were collected in mid-August to mid- 2.1 Mean range of tides at their confluence with the Delaware Bay (mouth), Table  the tide range at the maximum upstream extent of short-form S. alterniflora, and the in-channel distance of the maximum or last occurrence of short-form S. alterniflora for the six sampled sub-estuaries.  (Jacobs and Bleil, 2008;Jacobs, 2010). Each collection site's above-ground and below-ground biomass data were defined as an aggregate of the three subsamples for each collection site.

The transects were ~150 m apart, with points along each transect collected every 15 m. The elevation data were downloaded and pre-processed using Trimble Business Center, and then converted to ArcMAP shapefiles for further analysis. The transect elevation data were used to calculate the mean platform elevation for each reference (natural) and impounded marsh (Table 3.1)."}, {"section_title": "Tidal Datum Calculations", "text": "The growth elevation of a wetland is controlled by the tidal elevation and range; hence, the elevation at all sites was correlated to the tidal datum elevations River (HydroQual, 2006;Li, 2006). The spot tidal datum calculations were used to create tidal datum curves along the axis of each sub-estuaries' short-form S. alterniflora distribution range. The axis started at the mouth of the sub-estuary at the Delaware Bay and extended up-estuary, within the main channel, to the furthest extent of S. alterniflora (Figure 2.4). Best-fit tidal curves were constructed for each sub-estuary; all sample sites were plotted on these curves in accordance with their distance up-estuary, to determine their MHW, MTL, and MLW elevations at each sampling site (    \nTidal datums for the reference and impoundment wetland sites were determined from several data sources. Three NOAA tide gauges and one USGS flow gauge were located in proximity to several of the study sites. Datums for all other sites were calculated using NOAA's VDatum (http://vdatum.noaa.gov/) for tidal elevations in the Delaware Bay. A mean value was determined for each reference and impoundment marsh based upon the available data (Table 3.1). A standardized wetland elevation was calculated for each reference and impoundment marsh by subtracting the site's MHW elevation from the mean platform elevation (calculated from the transect elevation surveys) (Table 3.1). This allowed the reference and impounded marshes to be compared across different tidal ranges and absolute tidal datum elevations."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The above-ground and below-ground biomass data for all sites were compared to their marsh elevation relative to the MLW and MHW tidal datums to determine if there is a correlation between marsh platform elevation and the amount of biomass produced (Figures 2.5 -2.9).\n\nElevation changes measured by a SET are influenced by both surface and subsurface processes occurring within the soil profile (    Cahoon et al., 2002a and b).

The live above-ground biomass values varied between 3.4 and 15.9 grams (g). The live fraction of the total above-ground biomass showed no apparent correlation to the MLW tidal datum. The live biomass data were spread over the entire tidal range (1.78 m), with the highest occurrences between 1.78 and 0.65 m above MLW, and 0.22 above and -0.18 m below MHW. The above-ground dead biomass data were more closely clustered with respect to the range of masses from 1.8 to 19.4 g, with the highest number of values clustering between 1.8 and 8.9 g. The dead biomass also showed no direct correlation to site elevation with respect to MLW. \nThe collected and analyzed above-ground biomass (both live and dead) show no obvious correlation with marsh elevation relative to MHW and MLW (Figures 2.5 and 2.6). The above-ground production and biomass do not appear to be influenced by the elevation of the site, in relation to the tidal prism. This is not a unique result based upon previous studies that indicate that above-ground biomass production is largely a product of available nutrient resources and the overall stress on the halophytes (Valiela and Teal, 1974;Morris, 1995;Blum, 1993;Visser et al., 2006;Dary and Turner, 2008). The presence of above-ground biomass may appear to show a healthy vegetative platform, but it could also represent an over-eutrophied marsh that is expanding on the surface rather than increasing its vital below-ground biomass (Morris, 2002;Darby and Turner, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Below-ground Biomass", "text": "Much like the above-ground biomass, the live, dead, and total below-ground biomass showed no direct correlation to the MHW and the MLW datums. This is somewhat of an unexpected result as previous research showed a normal to skewed relationship between biomass and MHW elevation (Morris et al., 2002). Morris et al. (2002), based on biomass data from North Inlet in South Carolina, found that there is an optimal depth of inundation, with maximum biomass production around MHW. In this dissertation project, the below-ground biomass relative to MHW and When the total below-ground biomass from the impacted Broadkill River and Bombay Hook Complex sub-estuaries are plotted with data from the four relatively un-impacted watersheds, large differences are observed. It is hypothesized that watersheds should have similar normal distribution patterns with respect to belowground biomass and MHW (Morris et al., 2002). Instead, the Broadkill River data show a bimodal distribution in total below-ground biomass with one group of data points with lower biomass values ranging between 170 and 210 g, and a second group with much higher biomass values ranging between 260 and 285 g (Figure 2.9). This bimodal distribution is not related to marsh elevations relative to tidal datum, as the two groups have similar elevations (ranging between -0.11 and 0.08 m) relative to the MHW tidal datum (Figure 2.9). The Bombay Hook Complex total below-ground biomass data are characterized by a wide range in values from 100 to 230 g, with eleven of the fourteen sampling stations having elevations below the MHW datum elevation (0.00 m; Figure   2.9). The data roughly aggregate with respect to their study areas (i.e., North, Central, and South within the complex; Figure 2.9). In the North Bombay Hook portion of the complex, sample locations 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 cluster having a mean total belowground biomass of 139.4 g (SD = 8.20) with values ranging between 125 and 145 g (Figure 2.9). The wetland platform elevations at these locations are all negative relative to MHW, although the relative elevations have a wide range between -0.27 and -0.06 m, with a mean value of -0.13 m (SD of 0.09; Figure 2.9). The biomass and elevation data for this study area generally fit within the values observed for the St.  2.10). Sample location 14, which is the only site south of the Leipsic River in this portion of the study area, has a total below-ground biomass value (104 g) that is much less than the other five central sampling locations to the north (Figure 2.9).     \nThe relationship of below-ground biomass to marsh elevation platform (relative to a site's tidal datum) shows the most significant correlation. The total below-ground biomass data from the four sub-estuaries (St. Jones River, Blackbird Creek, Murderkill River, and Prime Hook Creek) that are characterized by minor human-induced alterations that could affect the wetland hydrology (e.g., localized mosquito ditching) fit within defined minimum and maximum growth potential curves (Figure 2.7). In contrast, the two sub-estuaries (Broadkill River and Bombay Hook Complex) that contain intensive human alteration through mosquito-ditched and dredging of new waterways are characterized by biomass values that are much more scattered and tend to show much higher below-ground biomass as a function of elevation relative to tidal datums than predicted by the maximum growth potential curve (Figure 2.9)."}, {"section_title": "Above-ground versus Below-ground Biomass", "text": "Earlier studies suggest that the total below-ground biomass and the total aboveground biomass are related in their content and proportion (McKee and Patrick, 1988;Reed, 1995;Mendelssohn and Morris, 2000;Pennings and Bertness, 2001). However in this study, no apparent trend or relationship is observed (Figures 2.11 and 2.12). The live above-ground to live below-ground biomass comparison shows a scattered  distribution over ranges of biomass for above-ground from 3.4 to 15.9 g and belowground from 1.7 to 25.5 g (Figure 2.11). Similarly, there is no discernable correlation between total above-ground and total below-ground biomass (Figure 2.12).

In contrast to the MHW relationships, the tidal range and marsh platform elevation relative to MLW exhibit a linear relationship. It is not surprising that as the tidal range increases, the elevation relative to MLW increases above the MLW datum (0.0 m). This trend illustrates that S. alterniflora growsat higher elevations relative to the MLW datum as the tidal range increases. This trend is most likely due to the limitations on growth caused by the increasing range of inundation. At tidal ranges above ~1.55 m, the data suggest that marsh platform elevations plateau at ~1.70 m and no longer increase with increasing tidal range (Figure 2.14)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "A variety of data have been analyzed to determine the relationships between marsh platform elevation (relative to tidal datums) and biomass production for short-form S. alterniflora.

The growth range determinations provide a more precise means of targeting a desired elevation to optimize restoration of S. alterniflora. The restoration can be accomplished by improving below-ground biomass production thereby enabling marshes to better keep pace with rising sea levels.  Relative to MLW vs Tidal Range Figure 2.14 Marsh elevation relative to MLW (m) for the S. alterniflora sample sites versus the calculated tidal range for each site.\nEvaluating a wetland's ability to naturally evolve within its regional setting, before anthropogenic intervention, may be paramount in developing an understanding of its future response. Recovery is commonly thought of as a restoration of the system to the conditions before the area was disturbed, thus achieving a return to natural equilibrium (Magilligan and Stamp, 1997). Natural equilibrium is thought to be a relatively continuous relationship between the scale and degree of the inputs and outputs that affect the site's evolution, with an expectation that the relationship naturally changes through time, but ultimately maintains some longer-term median condition (Mackin, 1948;Hack, 1960;Langbein and Leopold, 1964;Renwick, 1992;Magilligan and Stamp, 1997). In many cases, recovery to a condition that closely approximates pre-disturbance conditions may take long, geologic-scale, intervals of time (Magilligan and Stamp, 1997). The recovery of tidally-influenced systems is not well understood and far less studied than upland systems. It is not known, definitively, if natural recovery can be obtained in tidal wetlands, let alone determining/estimating a timescale for it to fully occur. Lasting effects of anthropogenic disturbance may alter a system beyond normal restoration activities (Magilligan and Stamp, 1997). Sediment storage in fluvial to tidal marsh systems increases with increased drainage area (Renfroe, 1975), and sediment pulses of material may require tens to hundreds of years to migrate through a watershed (James, 1989;Magilligan and Stamp, 1997). Therefore, land-use alterations which have affected upland sediment input over the past ~250 years, could possibly affect wetlands and watersheds in the future even after stressors have been alleviated. The lack of mineral sediment input, due to the constriction of water control structures, water level manipulation, and reduced regular tidal flushing, has long been suspected of impacting impounded wetlands (Hossler, 1994;Meredith and Whitman, 1994). To shed further light on this hypothesis, earlier results in this dissertation suggest that plant biomass production plays the largest role in accretion. Specifically, it is the below-ground biomass production that appears to dictate overall platform elevation in relation to MHW elevation (see Chapter 2). The interrelation of vegetative biomass production and perceived organic decomposition can been shown, through the Tukey's HSD tests, to account for a significant difference between the impounded and reference wetlands. The statistical differences in the organic mass accumulation is irrespective of the length of impoundment (years) and/or overall water level management scheme (Table   3.2). It is noteworthy that only two impoundments contained a statistically significant difference (since 1954) in mineral mass accumulation rates in comparison to their reference wetlands. This illustrates that the long hypothesized notion that mineral accumulation dominantly dictates trends in platform elevation (Hossler, 1994;Meredith and Whitman, 1994) is not a ubiquitous theory that can be applied to all tidal wetland and adjacent impoundments. Water control structures and/or manipulations could affect the overall volume of suspended mineral mass that could enter an impounded wetland, as compared to a regularly flooded reference wetland. Even natural wetlands commonly experience a lack of vertical accretion, usually in the marsh interior, in locations that are the greatest distance from the flooding source. The Delaware River study area impoundments and reference wetlands are in close proximity to the turbidity maximum of the Delaware Estuary (Sommerfield and Wong, 2011), yet two of these three impoundments (i.e. Broad Dike and Gambacorta) show a statistically significant greater difference (at the p<0.05 level) in mineral mass accumulation rates compared to their reference wetlands. The Delaware River study area impoundments have improved regular tidal flushing, and subsequent mineral mass input, since the mid-1990's, but over the past 60 years the time average or long-term trend is that the mineral mass accumulation rate differences have been relatively significant (in relation to the reference wetlands). In comparison, the Central and Lower Delaware Bay study area impoundments are in a setting of lower suspended sediment concentrations (not being in close proximity to the turbidity maximum). The suspended sediment concentrations lower in the estuary are significantly different between tidal levels, and are commonly fed by the cannibalization of existing marsh and the re-circulation of resuspended sediments from the bay bottom and wetlands (Cahoon and Reed, 1995;Reed, 1995). The adaptability of coastal wetlands to sea-level rise has been partly attributed to flooding that will slow rates of organic matter decay (under anaerobic condition) and facilitate more rapid organic matter accumulation (Nyman and DeLaune, 1991;Reed, 1995;Miller et al., 2001). However in a study by Kirwan et al. (2013), it was found that enhanced flooding in brackish marshes led to little change in the rate of organic matter decay. Instead, Kirwan et al. (2013) suggested that enhanced root production (e.g. Langley et al., 2009; and/or mineral sedimentation were the principal mechanisms by which marshes could maintain their equilibrium in response to sea-level rise (e.g. Morris et al., 2002). Although the Delaware River, Central Delaware Bay, and Lower Delaware Bay study area impoundments all have distinctly different water level management schemes and goals for management, the Tukey's HSD analysis shows that they all (except Prime Hook Unit III and Gambacorta; Table 3.2) had statistically significant lower organic mass accumulation rates, as compared to their reference wetlands. The water level management schemes vary in time, duration, and amount of drawdown, but what is consistent are drawdowns in the spring/summer to reduce mosquito breeding and promote annual vegetation growth. During these drawdowns, the Delaware River and Central Delaware Bay study area impoundment wetlands are exposed, with flushing (in the ditches and pools), allowing for annual and perennial vegetation growth. The marsh surfaces are fully exposed in the Delaware Bay study area impoundments only from March 1 to April 30, with pool levels of 50% from May 1 to 30, and then 75% levels from June 1 through July 31 (Meredith and Whitman, 1994). Thus, aerobic exposure of the marsh flats is up to 100% from March 1 to April 30, 50% to 55% from May 1 to 30, and 25% to 35% from June 1 to July 31 (Meredith and Whitman, 1994). The Central Delaware Bay study area impoundments have a drawdown on March 28 to a 50% pool, which is maintained until August (Meredith and Whitman, 1994). This 50% pool level also incorporates a prescribed maximum tidal exchange through the water control structures to prevent soil salinity from becoming too high (Meredith and Whitman, 1994). A 50% marsh surface exposure may or may not always be possible in several of the Central Delaware Bay study area impoundments. The water control structures in these impoundments have experienced subsidence, in conjunction with rising sea level, and now have difficulties with moving water adequately in and out (Meredith and Whitman, 1994;Meredith et al., 2004). It is common for these impoundments (especially Port Mahon and Logan Lane North) to develop extensive desiccation cracks along their marsh surface (Figure 3.12). The desiccation cracks are indicative of long-term exposure, and therefore aerobic soil conditions . Evidence of desiccation is not as common in the Delaware River study area impoundments. This may be a reflection of the ability to better control these impoundments to meet water level management goals. The Lower Delaware Bay study area impoundments are managed under freshwater moist soil management, with a 50% pool from March to mid-April, then a 0% pool from mid-April to July (USFWS, 2012). The marsh flats are 50% exposed from March to mid-April and then 100% exposed mid-April to July (USFWS, 2012). Extensive exposure conditions (with limited or no punctuated anaerobic conditions via regular inundation) could drive organic decomposition rates to be extremely high (Neckles and Neill, 1994;Turner et al., 2000;. Especially when compared to natural inundating of reference wetlands and controlled flooding and draining of impoundments under prescribed water level management conditions . High water levels from August to mid-October would also likely reduce late summer and fall growth of wetland vegetation, thereby reducing the overall opportunity for vegetative growth and production of below-ground biomass. Given the current water management, it is not surprising that the Port Mahon, Logan Lane North, Logan Lane South, Prime Hook Unit II, and Prime Hook Unit III wetlands contain the lowest rates of organic mass accumulation (Table 3.2; Figure 3.10). In comparison, the Delaware River study area Buttonwood, Broad Dike, and Gambacorta Impoundments have the highest organic mass accumulation rates of all impoundments (Table 3.2). These higher rates could be the result of the lower salinity conditions in the Delaware River study area promoting a more stable vegetative community (and thereby a more robust below-ground biomass production). However, this is not supported by the data from the higher salinity Central and Lower Delaware Bay study areas where the reference Pickering Beach and Prime Hook Unit I Marshes had rates of organic mass accumulation that were higher than, and comparable to, the Delaware River study area impoundments, respectively (Table 3.2). A more appropriate assessment may be that water level management in the Delaware River study area impoundments is conducive to below-ground biomass production, and promotes a lower rate of organic decomposition with shorter punctuated aerobic exposure of the marsh platforms. A natural marsh platform is exposed to regular tidal inundation causing a shift in the decomposition setting (Kirwan et al., 2013). At lower tides, the marsh platform will become exposed and dry causing the rate of aerobic decomposition to increase (also through oxygen pumping into the soil through the roots of halophytes such as S. alterniflora) . As the marsh surface becomes inundated, the available oxygen is reduced and anaerobic decomposition rates increase 2013). Anaerobic decomposition is slow and under long-term conditions results in the accumulation of large quantities of organic material (e.g., peat in bogs and wetlands) 2013). It can be theorized that the most favorable means of managing impounded wetlands so that they vertically accrete is through enhanced below-ground biomass growth and retention. To do this, the impoundments in the Central and Lower Delaware Bay study areas (especially Port Mahon, Logan Lane North, Logan Lane South, and Prime Hook Unit III) need to have reduced long-term drawdowns, and increased control of water levels to allow for more short-term marsh platform inundations. The Delaware River study area impoundments have a period from June 1 to July 31 when the marsh platforms are at a 75% pool (Meredith and Whitman, 1994). With the addition of retrofit water control structures, these impoundments now appear to have better short-term management thereby reducing the time periods of aerobic decomposition during exposure of the marsh platforms. This enhanced water management provides an explanation for the relatively higher organic mass accumulation rates for these impoundments. However, it should be noted that for two of the three Delaware River study area impoundments (Buttonwood Dike and Broad Dike), their rates, although higher, are still statistically significantly lower than the organic mass accumulation rates of their comparison, naturalsetting, reference marshes.\nThe relationship between marsh surface elevation and tidal levels is one of the ultimate controls in dictating wetland flooding frequency, length of inundation, suspended sediment concentrations, and type and density of vegetation cover (Morris et al., 2002). As with any marsh surface elevation study, it is important to note that marsh accretion rates may not necessarily always reflect changes in the elevation of the marsh surface. Subsurface processes such as decomposition and compaction can lower the elevation of the marsh surface, independent of the accretion rates, which may exceed the rate of sea-level rise (Cahoon and Reed, 1995). Determining the factors that contribute to changes in marsh surface elevation is not easy. Changes in the shallow elevation and vegetation can have several effects on the overall marsh surface elevation, resulting in decreased below-ground biomass production which can lower the marsh surface elevation. Variations in the rate of decomposition (both organic and inorganic) can also affect marsh surface elevation changes . Variations in decomposition rates likely result from changes in water levels as increased tidal levels shift decomposition toward more anaerobic conditions . Regular tidal inundation creates anaerobic conditions during flooding and then more aerobic conditions at the surface during periods of low tide. Increased tidal levels, through local sea-level rise, could result in a higher likelihood of un-interrupted anaerobic conditions. The equilibrium between natural sedimentation (organic and inorganic) and sea level determines how a marsh will react to rapid and/or long-term changes in the rate of sea-level rise/fall (Reed, 1995). The primary productivity of salt marsh vegetation is regulated by changes in sea level (eustatic and/or land subsidence), sediment supply, and tidal range; the vegetation, in turn, constantly modifies the elevation of its habitat toward equilibrium with sea level (Stevenson et al., 1986;Reed, 1995). (Mendelssohn and Morris, 2000). Morris et al. (2002) suggest that every marsh has a theoretical optimum rate of relative sea-level rise (RSLR), an optimum depth at which the marsh community is most productive, and an equilibrium depth that can be greater or less than the optimum. As sea-level rises, the long-term sustainability of a salt marsh is dependent upon the vegetation to maintain the elevation of the marsh platform within the intertidal zone (Morris et al., 2002). S. alterniflora is considered an indicator and foundation species because of its modification of the physical environment to optimize growth within tidal marshes (Pennings and Bertness, 2001). S. alterniflora, primary production (both aboveand below-ground biomass) varies throughout the marsh itself and within the tidal range and is found to be highest at the lower elevations of its vertical growth range (Pomeroy et al., 1981). At lower surface elevations (and thus greater extent of inundation), growth of S. alterniflora is likely limited and the marsh plant community is replaced by un-vegetated tidal mudflats (Morris et al., 2002). A marsh platform positioned above its ideal elevation for biomass production is more sustainable because, in the future, it will endure a higher RSLR (Morris et al., 2002). There is an ideal marsh platform elevation for tidal wetland vegetation productivity, though it can differ by study area as a function of tidal range and other factors (McKee and Patrick, 1988). Past research shows that MSL can vary seasonally by up to ~30 cm (Kjerfve and McKellar, 1980). Marsh surface elevations cannot respond with changes of this magnitude in such a short time period. Variability in summer MSL, as great as + 20 cm, can have an effect on primary production (Morris et al., 2002). The variability of primary production is in part due to the time lag between changes in MSL and adjustment in elevation of the marsh surface. Within the Delaware Estuary as a result of steric effects on water temperature, seasonal variation in MSL can vary on the order of 16 cm (     Northerly-northeasterly wind forcing is parallel to most of the Mid-Atlantic and New England coastline (Han, 2007;Lentz, 2008). The observed coastal sea-level rise patterns could stem from both an Ekman-related on-shore transport, an enhanced along-shelf pressure gradient, and a related southwestward geostrophic transport over the Mid-Atlantic Bight and Scotian continental shelves (Han, 2007;Lentz, 2008;Sweet and Zervas, 2011).Higher water levels due to seasonal cycles, the 2009 interannual rising sealevel signal (incursion), the 2009-2010 El Nino effect, and the long-term increase in sea level, would result in increased flooding in the studied marshes causing a longer duration of inundation on the marsh platform, shorter periods of low tide marsh platform exposure, increasing salinity levels on the marsh platform, and a shift of the salt line further up the estuary. These factors would reduce the health of the wetland vegetation and result in a reduction in below-ground biomass production. The higher rates of subsidence through 2009 and 2010 could also be influenced by the increased water on the marsh during the higher water level period, due to greater overburden (weight of overlying water) on the marsh surface. This could result in Figure 4.21 El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a Years and Intensities Based on Oceanic Ni\u00f1o Index (ONI). The Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) has become the de-facto standard that NOAA uses for identifying El Ni\u00f1o (warm) and La Ni\u00f1a (cool) events in the tropical Pacific. It is the running 3-month mean SST anomaly for the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region (i.e., 5 o N-5 o S, 120 o -170 o W; (Null, 2014). decreases in marsh surface elevation. Short-term increases in subsidence could account for a portion of the elevation losses in the shallow and deep records. Sites with large losses in shallow elevation (with apparently healthy vegetation) are examples of this process. The Impoundment, Boardwalk, Isaac's Branch, and Delon sites all have apparent \"healthy\" vegetative communities, and all have been exposed to extensive flooding due to storm events and lunar tides. Of these four sites, the Impoundment, Delon, and Isaac's Branch SETS are characterized by high shallow subsidence rates of 65.8, 34.2, and 29.3 mm/yr, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Effect of Anthropogenic Alterations on Hydrology", "text": "As Figures alterniflora below-ground biomass production. The effect on below-ground biomass production is likely the result of changes in hydrology in the area. The Broadkill River below-ground biomass data has a distinct split into two modes. The upper or higher value data points (with total below-ground biomass values above 260 g) were sampled in areas of intensive mosquito-ditching. The remaining six sampling locations were either distal to the intensive ditching work, or at a proximal location to the headlands at the upper extent of the sampled portion of the sub-estuary ( Figure 2.9). The cause of the higher than normal below-ground biomass production which coincides with areas of intensive ditching, is unknown and unfortunately the level of data collected for this study cannot adequately address this question. The Broadkill River subestuary is highly eutrophied with an excess nitrogen and phosphorus load that has been proposed to be cut by up to 40% through the 2006 TMDL (HydroQual, 2006). Previous studies document that excess phosphorus, not nitrogen, appears to induce a response of decreased production of below-ground plant biomass as more phosphorus becomes readily available (Darby and Turner, 2008 , 2013). This negates any hypotheses that lower or optimal nutrient levels could exist in the Broadkill River sub-estuary, allowing the system to optimize belowground biomass production. It is likely that localized ditching has increased the marsh surface elevation due to the spoils being side-cast along the ditches, increased the rate of flushing, and reduced the effects of flooding toxicity on the adjacent wetlands. It is unknown if these conditions are sustainable. The central biomass samples from the Bombay Hook Complex contrast with the other four relatively un-impacted sub-estuaries and the Broadkill River (non-interior samples) by having higher below-ground biomass values produced at significantly lower marsh surface elevations below MHW (Figure 2.9). This may be an indication that a different hydrology, resulting in a larger tidal prism and higher MHW levels, may exist for this central region. It is of note that the northern and southern sites do plot in closer proximity to the other sub-estuaries, with the southern sites exhibiting higher biomass production and marsh platform elevations than the northern sites ( Figure 2.9). The data for the Bombay Hook Complex indicate that distinctly different wetland conditions, from north to the south, are affecting marsh platform elevations and overall below-ground biomass production. The central section of the complex appears to be a transition from the lower less productive S. alterniflora marshes in the northern section of the complex to the highly productive and subsequently higher elevation S. alterniflora marshes in the southern portion ( Figure 2.9). The negative effects or factors that are reducing productivity to the north, are not yet pervasive enough to be influencing the southern sites. Tidal circulation is primarily brought into the interior wetlands of the Bombay  1954, 1961, 1968, 1992, etc.). Raymond Gut connects the tidal flow from the Leipsic River to the wetland interior areas near Sheerness Pool. Sluice Gut has been added to connect Duck Creek to open tidal waters at three points (two to the Delaware Bay and one to the Leipsic River). The tidal datums for the Bombay Hook Complex indicate that these two dredged guts increase the interior MHW elevation of Leatherberry Flats to 0.34 m higher than at the mouth of the Leipsic River, 0.44 m higher than the dock on the Leipsic River, 0.44 m higher than the mouth of Sluice Ditch, and 0.37 m higher than the MHW level at the mouth of Sheerness Gut (Table 2.2). This anthropogenic alteration of tidal datums is significant as the short-form S. alterniflora in the complex has optimal growth and maximum below-ground biomass production at a level of 0.04 m (+ 0.1 m) above MHW (Figure 2.9). Based upon independent spot elevation surveys of the interior vegetative marsh platform (between the Leipsic River to the south and Sluice Ditch to the north), the mean elevation is 0.16 m (SD 0.12 m) below the MHW elevation. For the interior wetland areas experiencing the most widespread degradation and loss (adjacent to Leatherberry Flats and south toward Duck Creek), the vegetative marsh platform has a mean elevation of 0.27 m (+/-0.11 m) below MHW."}, {"section_title": "Optimal Growth Range for Below-ground Biomass", "text": "The main focus of this study is to calculate the optimal growth range for S. alterniflora where biomass production is maximized. A histogram of the below-ground biomass data from the four sub-estuaries (Blackbird, St. Jones, Murderkill, and Prime Hook) that are minimally altered, with a probability density function, was used to determine the range. The below-ground biomass data were aggregated into 0.08 m elevation bins relative to MHW to determine the frequency or count of values within each bin.

Tidal marshes that are already showing signs of stressed and underperforming vegetation will suffer further catastrophic losses, such as the Bombay Hook Complex. S. alterniflora wetland losses will only increase as longer durations of inundation will result in decreased productivity, and a continued lowering of the marsh platform through increased water levels and less accretion. This will eventually lead to complete failure of the marsh platform. A catastrophic loss in vegetation will ultimately result in a lowered platform and exposure of fine-grained mineral sediments to wind and tidal currentinduced erosion. This cycle will amplify wetland loss as open accommodation space (the space available for potential sediment accumulation resulting from platform lowering through erosion and rising water levels), will be filled with tidal waters. This will result in an increased rate of shallow subsidence, sediment erosion, and further alterations to the tidal prism through the volumetric increase in ebbing and flooding waters."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Results from this study show that S. alterniflora has an optimal below-ground biomass growth between -0.07 and 0.09 m (with high growth from 0.09 to 0.18 m) relative to the elevation of MHW within the sub-estuaries that were sampled. Belowground biomass data plotted in relation to MHW elevation at each site, the distribution of points and frequency of biomass (within elevation bins) used to determine the tidal elevations that corresponded to the maximum and minimum S. alterniflora biomass values. Maximum biomass growth is determined to be around MHW elevation (-0.07 to 0.09 m), while the growth of below-ground biomass is greatly reduced at elevation below (< 0.07 m) and above (> 0.18 m) the MHW datum. However, data from two of the sub-estuaries did not fit within the maximum and minimum potential growth limits. The Bombay Hook Complex appears to be influenced by altered hydrology within the sub-estuary. Two ditches (Raymond and Sluice Guts) were added within the complex artificially raising MHW near Leatherberry Flats, and not allowing the region to naturally drain. The altered hydrology increases the interior tidal range at a rate quicker than accretion can build the marsh platform. The higher water levels and lower elevation of the S. alterniflora relative to MHW stunt a plant's biomass growth causing further degradation of the platform. The Northern and Central biomass sample elevations has values ranges below the optimal range of -0.07 to 0.09 m, with values ranges of -0.06 to -0.27 m and -0.05 to -0.40 m (respectively). The biomass data relative to MHW elevations from the Broadkill River subestuary are also outside of the derived maximum/minimum potential growth limits (Figure 2.9). The range in Broadkill River biomass elevations is between -0.11 and 0.08 m, relative to MHW, with 8 of the 11 sample sites having an elevation at or below MHW (i.e. 0.0 m). This sub-estuary has a history of intensive mosquito-ditching; however, more investigation is needed in order to verify the effect of altered hydrology on the duration and depth of flooding on this platform. Mosquito ditches could result in a faster inundation of the marsh, which could lead to a longer period of inundation. . The data in this study can be used to assess a marsh's ability to combat changing conditions associated with sea-level rise, by determining whether or not the platform elevation is at the optimal -0.07 to 0.18 m relative to MHW, for maximum below-ground biomass production. This assessment method and the derived relationships to MHW (and MLW) also greatly assist in developing a better means of determining if a tidal wetland is in need of restoration. Due to the correlation of marsh platform elevation with MHW tidal datum elevation, S. alterniflora will attempt to maintain its relationship with water levels. If in need of restoration, it could be accomplished through thin-layer application of material, or alterations to hydrology, to optimize below-ground biomass production, thus building a more sustainable marsh platform. Delaware's tidal marsh impoundments are located on federal, state, and private lands. They range in size from less than a hectare (ha) to several hundred hectares. The oldest impoundments date back to Swedish and Dutch settlements in the 1600s and were typically built for agricultural purposes or to control flooding (Weslager, 1987). More recent impoundments were developed during the late 1930's by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) to control mosquito breeding. The negative impact of mosquito ditching became apparent by the 1940s as the natural vegetation in the marsh began to perish due to altered flooding and extreme soil salinities (Whitman and Cole, 1987).\nRegular tidal inundation is vital in the development and evolution of natural marsh platforms. Manipulations of water levels, through management and impoundment, can extensively alter long-term vertical accretion. This study evaluated the differences in accretion between natural and impounded wetlands. While there was a nearly two times greater difference in the mean rate of accretion between the reference (i.e., natural) marshes (0.82 cm/yr) and the impoundment wetlands (0.41 cm/yr), only three of the nine impoundments had statistically significant differences (at the p<0.05 level) in their mean accretion rates, and only four of the nine contain statistically significant differences (at the p<0.05 level) in bulk mass accumulation rates in comparison to their reference marshes. Long-term bulk mass accumulation rates, determined using radioisotopic dating ( 137 Cs), encompass deposition over the past ~60 years. As such, the impact of water level management changes and water control structure upgrades, or lack thereof, are aggregated into the results over the time interval of measurement (i.e., 1954present). One of the major results is that only two of the nine impoundments studied were characterized by statistically significant differences (at the p<0.05 level) in mineral mass accumulation rates when compared to their reference wetlands. These results contradict the generally accepted hypothesis that mineral mass accumulation is the largest difference between natural and impounded wetlands. For example, it is commonly discussed in coastal resilience outreach, and within the management agencies for impoundments in Delaware, that the lack of sediment deposition is a leading factor in the differences in accretion rates and overall marsh platform elevation between impounded and natural wetlands (Hossler, 1994;Meredith and Whitman, 1994). Although the highest priority might be to control water levels for wildlife of concern (i.e. waterfowl, shore birds, mosquito control, etc.), it is also important to manage an impoundment in a way that below-ground biomass production is optimized and decomposition rates are not enhanced through long-term platform exposure. A lower marsh platform, with respect to MHW, makes water level management even more difficult, especially facing accelerating rates of sea-level rise. If catastrophic levee breaches occur, as witnessed at Prime Hook Unit II in 2008, then the lowered platform will be permanently flooded (due to disequilibrium with the tidal prism), and a total loss of the resource for desired habitat management goals would occur. For example, the Prime Hook Unit II Impoundment is now a lagoon rather than a tidally-flooded back barrier wetland. This loss of a managed wetland serves as an indicator of the importance that water level management can have upon the long-term sustainability of impounded wetlands, and the importance of managing marsh platform elevation, especially in the face of sea-level rise.\nThe use of SETs is important in identifying and monitoring changes within tidal wetlands in response to sea-level rise. The SETs were used to make precise measurements, over the course of many years, of shallow and deep elevation change of the marsh surface, surface accretion, and subsidence at each monitoring site. The longterm monitoring revealed that six of the eight sites showed a loss in marsh surface elevation (both shallow and deep), that has not recovered. Deep and shallow elevation changes all occurred independent of accretion. It was also shown that two (Eagles Nest and Beaver Branch) of the eight monitoring sites experienced rapid gains in elevation (and losses not experienced at the other six sites). The results from the marsh elevation data for the SET sites within this study appear to be a result of both localized and larger-scale factors including: 1) localized effects on wetlands (as represented in the shallow and deep surface elevation records, 2) the effects of coast-wide sea-level anomalies, due to El Ni\u00f1o, on marsh surface elevation trends, and 3) the effects of localized watershed scale land-use changes. The exact cause for the large scale wetland elevation losses experienced in 2009 is hard to determine. However, the platform elevation loss at six of the eight sites does coincide with a moderate El Ni\u00f1o and high sea-level anomalies experienced along the East Coast that led to high water levels. The lack of recovery of the 2009 elevation losses may denote the overall stress that the current rate of sea-level rise has upon these tidal wetlands. Under these stressed conditions, the wetland vegetation cannot rebound in a manner that some marshes have demonstrated under natural conditions (Reed, 1995). It is also not clear as to the exact mechanism(s) that is/are responsible for the rapid gains in elevation that were recorded at the Eagles Nest and Beaver Branch sites. The gains could be linked to land-use changes (i.e. converting forest to suburban and agricultural land-uses) that resulted in uplift of the marsh surface, although a definitive determination cannot be made based upon the data available in this study. More detailed studies are needed to provide better constraints on the mechanisms or feedbacks that are responsible for both the dramatic 2009 wetland elevation losses and the subsequent lack of elevation recovery, and the rapid elevation gains at the Eagles Nest and Beaver Branch sites. With only four SET locations within each watershed, the collected data can most appropriately be used only to make general assessments of the trends in marsh surface elevation and accretion for each watershed. Replicate SET locations would be necessary to make more detailed assessments. The small area of study for each SET location allows for high precision assessments, but also limits the ability of the data to be correlated between sites when the number of sample sites is small (as is the case for this study). As standalone data, the results from the SET measurements obtained in this study are not sufficient to warrant publication in a peer reviewed journal. As additional SET data from the Delaware Estuary becomes available, the measurements obtained in this SET study from the St. Jones River and Blackbird Creek should be included in larger-scale assessments of tidal wetland elevation trends. and the derived relationships to MHW and MLW, assist in developing a better means for determining whether a tidal wetland area is in need of restoration. Thin-layer application of material is a typical restoration technique for such circumstances and the findings in this study help determine how much material must be added to raise the marsh platform to allow for longer-term sustainability, through the optimization of below-ground biomass production. It is the water level management effect on a wetland vegetation's ability to produce below-ground biomass and to also retain organic material (through lower rates of decomposition) that is likely the driving force in the observed differences in the accretion and elevation of impounded and natural or reference wetlands. The below-ground biomass can be the main mechanism for in-place vertical marsh accretion, but as the water level manipulations short-circuit these natural processes, the disparity in organic matter drives production and preservation of the impounded wetlands to have overall lower accretion rates and marsh platform elevation. It is imperative to manage water levels for the species of concern (i.e. waterfowl, shore birds, mosquito control, etc.), but also to manage in a way that below-ground biomass is optimized and decomposition rates are not enhanced through long-term marsh platform exposures. The overall lower marsh platform elevation with respect to mean high tide makes the ability to manage water levels harder for the desired outcome. If catastrophic levee breaches occur, as witnessed at Prime Hook Unit II in 2008, the lowered platform will be permanently flooded (due to the disequilibrium with the tidal prism), and large-scale loss of the wetland would result. In 2008/2009, storms caused breaches in Prime Hook Unit II and now the entire impoundment is a lagoon rather than a tidally-flooded back-barrier wetland. This loss of managed impoundment wetland serves as a lesson to the effect of water level manipulations and the importance of managing the wetlands for multiple goals. \uf0b7 The utilization of surface elevation table (SET) monitoring at sites within two Delaware watersheds, Blackbird Creek (relatively un-impacted watershed) and St. Jones River (heavily impacted mixed urban-suburban, and agricultural watershed), to evaluate recent trends in tidal marsh surface elevation and shortterm vertical accretion. The elevation and accretion records provide a means of monitoring the response of a marsh to seasonal, annual, and decadal changes in tidal levels. SET and marker horizon data also provide information on surficial and below-ground processes. The long-term monitoring revealed that six of the eight sites showed a loss in marsh surface elevation (both shallow and deep), that has not recovered. Deep and shallow elevation changes all occurred independent of accretion. It was also shown that two (Eagles Nest and Beaver Branch) of the eight monitoring sites experienced rapid gains in elevation (and losses not experienced at the other six sites). The SET monitoring sites, within the study, show both a reflection of localized factors or effects on wetlands (as represented in the shallow and elevation records) but, more importantly, these sites are influenced by the effects of coast-wide sea-level anomalies, due to El Ni\u00f1o on marsh surface elevation trends and the effects of localized watershed scale land-use changes. The loss of elevation at six of the monitoring sites is of concern for the overall health and sustainability of these watersheds. Although, the sampling sites are limited in their scope of coverage, they show that these sites are not keeping pace with sea-level rise and that other effects could be witnessed in the near future (i.e. lower vegetation productivity and/or loss of vegetation). These results need to be merged with additional datasets to develop a large more representative and complete assessment of these wetlands status in relation to sea-level rise "}, {"section_title": "THE EFFECTS OF LONG-TERM WATER LEVEL MANAGEMENT UPON ACCRETION AND WETLAND ELEVATIONS IN THE COASTAL IMPOUNDMENTS OF DELAWARE.", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Chapter 3", "text": "To aid in correcting these actions, marsh management entered a new era (during the 1950s and early 1960s) creating coastal impoundments to control mosquito breeding and improve wetlands for waterfowl and other wildlife (Catts et al., 1963;Whitman and Cole, 1987). The immediate short-term success of these coastal impoundments prompted the construction of additional ones along the coast from Port Penn to Little Assawoman Bay (Whitman and Cole, 1987). Most of these were established in the central Delaware Bay region, currently consisting of the Bombay Hook and Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) and five state wildlife areas. By the mid-1970s, impounded wetlands began to lose favor as a management option for wetland habitat due to the restriction of nutrient exchange with the bay and loss of high and low tidal marsh vegetation (Whitman and Cole, 1987). The existing impoundments may be operated as freshwater (primarily the NWR impoundments) or brackish water (state wildlife areas) units. Surface exposure in individual impoundments fluctuates from exposed mudflats to waters up to 10 cm (several inches) deep, with changes in water level dictated by rainfall, evaporation, outflow or water control structures, and controlled tidal flooding. The differing levels are adjusted for habitat use, typically flooded in the fall (for waterbirds), and maintained at lower levels in the summer for optimum vegetative growth (both annual and perennial plants) (Meredith et al., 2004). A diversity of habitat types (i.e. open water, wetlands, mudflats) during the seasons is ideal for managing the needs of multiple species of concern. The impoundments are managed to meet these needs in a regional context, allowing for multiple habitat types along the coast (Meredith et al., 2004). The fate of the impoundments is a major concern and is addressed in several planning studies such as: \"Ecological Conditions and Management for Coastal Impoundments in Delaware\" (Whitman and Cole, 1987), \"The Northern Delaware Wetlands Rehabilitation Plan\" (Hossler, 1994), \"Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP) for Delaware's Tidal Wetlands\" (Meredith and Whitman, 1994), This study evaluates the effects of long-term impoundment management on the rate of accretion and subsequent decreases in wetland platform elevation compared to neighboring un-impounded tidal wetlands. Nine impoundments (three in the City of New Castle, four in Central Delaware Bay, and two in lower Delaware Bay) and four reference tidal wetlands were sampled to evaluate their rates of accretion over the past 60 years, and their wetland platform elevations relative to local tidal datums. The duration of impoundment and water level management goals varies between impoundments. This allows for a unique opportunity to evaluate the short-term and long-term implications of water-level control on the impoundments."}, {"section_title": "Accretion and Wetland Build-up Background", "text": "Vertical accretion within tidal wetlands occurs when mineral and organic matter accumulation building the marsh platform happens at a rate faster than the rate of submergence of the platform (due to sea-level rise, subsidence, sediment compaction, and organic matter decay; Redfield, 1972;Warren and Niering, 1993;Morris et al., 2002;Neubauer et al., 2002;Rooth et al., 2003;Nyman et al., 2006). What is not as apparent is the effect of water level manipulations on the rate of vertical accretion in impounded marshes, and what role limited tidal flushing has upon input of mineral sediments and rates of organic decay (both aerobic and anaerobic). Several studies conclude that many coastal marshes accrete primarily through vegetative growth rather than by accumulation of inorganic or mineral sediments (McCaffrey and Thomson, 1980;Hatton et al., 1983;Bricker-Urso et al., 1989;Nyman et al., 1993;Anisfeld et al., 1999;Turner et al., 2000;Chmura and Hung, 2004;Nyman et al., 2006). A major point of consideration in developing this study is whether impounded wetlands vertically accrete in a fashion that more closely aligns with tidal freshwater wetlands, or if they are analogous to adjacent reference salt marshes. The vertical accretion of the marsh platform is a predictor for wetland sustainability in the face of sealevel rise, but also highlights the effect that water manipulations have had on the marsh platform elevation in comparison to naturally accreting tidal wetlands. The marshes that are not accreting rapidly enough to keep the marsh platform in equilibrium with local tidal levels continue to decrease in elevation with subsequent increased flooding stressing the existing vegetation (Nyman et al., 1993;Nyman et al., 2006). There is an ideal flooding frequency on marsh vegetation at which the rate of productivity (especially below-ground biomass) is optimized; where flooding can flush out salts, deliver nutrients, and increase biomass production (Morris et al., 2002;. At increasing rates of sea-level rise or using particular water level management schemes, anaerobic conditions can negatively impact the productivity of wetland vegetation through the accumulation of sulfides (Morris et al., 2002;. It is the seasonal manipulation of water levels in impoundments which makes it hard to predict how these managed wetlands vertically accrete as compared to natural tidal wetlands, and whether these manipulated water levels may affect the rate of decomposition. In freshwater wetlands, flooding frequency and duration cause an increase in the rates of decomposition in the soil (Ewel and Odum, 1978;Mendessohn et al., 1999), while in salt marshes it is more variable, and not likely related to flood duration and redox potential (Valiela et al., 1982;Hackney, 1987;Blum, 1993;Blum and Christian, 2004). In lower salinity wetlands (such as impounded wetlands), the ambient and pore water salinity may dictate the rate of organic matter decay (Sutton-Grier et al., 2011; Weston et al., 2011) which can then drive elevation changes in fresh and brackish marshes through these root zone processes and interactions (Craft, 2007;). Intermittent flooding typically enhances the decomposition of organic matter in ecosystems with mostly aerobic soil conditions such as riparian forests, prairie wetlands, and freshwater marshes (Brinson, 1977;Ewel and Odum, 1978;Day, 1979;Maltby, 1988;Neckles and Neill, 1994;Mendelssohn et al., 1999;.  theorizes that flooding may accelerate the decomposition of organic matterby providing moisture and nutrients to microbial and fungal communities (Neckles and Neill, 1994;Bragazza et al., 2012). Decomposition generally occurs more rapidly in aerobic soils than anaerobic soils, with .this mainly occurring near the soil surface with decay rates decreasing with increasing soil depth and decreased oxygen availability(e.g., Neckles and Neill, 1994;Mendelssohn et al., 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Impoundment Background", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Delaware River Impoundments", "text": "In Northern Delaware, the degradation of the wetlands began as early as the mid-1600s. Dutch and Swedish settlers extensively diked and drained tidal freshwater marshes along the Christina and Delaware Rivers to accommodate agriculture and development of adjacent upland areas (Weslager, 1987). This extensive system of dikes and tide gates has, for the most part, been maintained un-changed since its initial construction. This practice essentially prohibited several thousand hectares of tidal wetlands from receiving normal tidal exchange with the Delaware Estuary for up to 340 years (Carter, 1991). The dike system promoted the filling and additional draining of many wetlands for industrial, maritime, and residential development during the Industrial Revolution of the late 1800s   and early 1900s (Catts and Mancl, 2013). The Buttonwood, Broad, and Gambacorta Dikes are historic landmarks, which are considered to be some of the oldest dikes in the United States. Their origins are documented as far back as the late 1600s to early 1700s (Catts and Mancl, 2013;Mancl et al., 2013). Buttonwood Dike was constructed in 1786 by a newly formed marsh company that was responsible for the construction and care of dikes to enable reclamation of the marsh for agricultural purposes and provide foot traffic access (Catts and Mancl, 2013;Mancl et al., 2013). The associated marsh (Swanwyck Marsh) behind the dike, currently 17 ha (42 acres), has been cut off from regular flooding for over 228 years. The Buttonwood Marsh has a drainage area of ~348 ha (860 acres), which is dominated by residential, commercial, and industrial land-use. Broad Dike was constructed in 1675, when the authorities in the village of New Amstel (today's New Castle), ordered the construction of two dikes to cross marshland north of the town: one in the footprint of the current dike for foot-traffic and a second that was for vehicular traffic (historically called the Cart Dike, which is currently the crossing of Route 13) (Mancl et al., 2013). In 1681, a Dutch merchant ditched and drained the Broad Dike Marsh (Wacker and Clemens, 1995;Mancl et al., 2013). The Broad Dike Marsh is currently an 85 ha (210 acre) freshwater tidal wetland, which has been cut off from normal tidal inundation for over 339 years. The Broad Dike Marsh has a drainage area of 733 ha (1,811 acres), primarily consisting of residential and urban land-uses. The Gambacorta Dike was first documented in 1706 when the property was confiscated from Peter Alrichs, who had failed to drain the marsh, and was granted to George Deakyne, \"who drained the marsh, and built a dike along the river\u2026.\" (Eckman, 1947). The current 17 ha (41 acre) tidal freshwater wetland has been cut off from normal or regular tidal inundation for 308 years. The marsh's watershed encompasses 104 ha (8,258 acres) of urban and commercial development. These marshes were once a lush mosaic of rushes, sedges, cattails, and smartweeds (Hossler, 1994). They contained a high diversity of water birds and other wildlife (Hossler, 1994). By the 1700s, they were all diked and drained to accommodate agriculture and settlement of adjacent upland areas (Mancl et al., 2013). These practices continue to the present, resulting in lower biodiversity marshes, which until the mid-to late 1990s were dominated by the nuisance plant P. australis (Hossler, 1994;Mancl et al., 2013). The water management plan for the Buttonwood, Broad Dike, and Gambacorta Marshes has been the same for four decades with a single purpose to prevent flooding of the properties behind the levees, due to high tides, storm surges, or from upland storm runoff accumulating in the marsh (Hossler, 1994;Meredith et al., 2004). To accomplish this flood mitigation, several iterations of water control structures (i.e. flap gates) were installed to allow one-way flow out of the marsh (Hossler, 1994;Meredith et al., 2004). This allows storm run-off to flow out while preventing Delaware River water from inundating the marsh during higher water level events. However, because of the increase in upland runoff due to the increased impervious surface and decreased infiltration, and a significantly lower elevation of the marsh surface relative to the Delaware River, the existing structures have been found to be inadequate to handle storm runoff from severe rain events (Hossler, 1994;Meredith et al., 2004). In the mid-1990s, new water control structures were installed in the New Castle impoundments to allow daily tidal exchange (Meredith et al., 2004). The main goals of the new water control structures and updated water management plan are to: improve the wetland habitat and condition, improve water quality of both the marsh and river through daily tidal exchange, reduce the transportation of potential upland pollutants conveyed into the wetland by stormwater runoff, provide nutrient and organism exchange between the water bodies, and increase the volume of water exposed to wetland filtering benefits and nutrient uptake (Meredith et al., 2004). The habitat quality of the impounded wetlands suffered significantly due to reduced tidal flow, and by the mid-1980s were 70% -90% dominated by large stands of P. australis (Meredith and Whitman, 1994). The hope is that increased daily tidal flushing (in addition to several implemented management actions) will increase the percentage and diversity of emergent vegetation and open water habitats (Meredith et al., 2004). The anthropogenic impacts on the Gambacorta Marsh are more widespread than those experienced by the Buttonwood and Broad Dike Marshes, as this wetland was drained and filled with hazardous industrial waste from Deemer Steel, the Abex Corp., and Wilmington Fiber Co in the early 1900s (Hossler, 1994). In the mid-1980s, the waste was excavated and the former disposal site within the wetland was capped with clean material (Catts and Mancl, 2013). The excavated and capped locations are at the western edge of the impoundment, adjacent to State Route 9. Covering 275 ha (680 acres), Port Mahon is the largest impoundment in the Central Delaware Bay study area (Figure 3.3). The impoundment was created in 1967 by encircling a tidal marsh with low earthen dikes (Whitman and Cole, 1987). The initial wetland, prior to diking, was dominated by S. alterniflora, and Spartina patens (S. patens) (Whitman, 1995)."}, {"section_title": "Central", "text": "The Little Creek Impoundment consisted of four separate units, constructed in 1959, but due to the erosion of an earthen dike, only three exist today (Whitman and Cole, 1987). The largest impoundment within this complex, 243 ha (600 acres) in size, is used in this study (Figure 3.3). Before the area was impounded, it was dominated by dense stands of S. alterniflora, S. patens and Distichlis spicata (D. spicata) (Whitman and Cole, 1987;Meredith and Whitman, 1994). Water levels were managed by pumping tidal water into the impoundment, but by the 1980s this management scheme resulted in it being devoid of all emergent vegetation (Whitman and Cole, 1987). The only vegetation was found at the fringing wetlands, and was dominated by P. australis, Typha latifolia, and Iva fructescens (Whitman and Cole, 1987). The Logan Lane Impoundments are divided into northern (89 ha (221 acres)) and southern (173 ha (428 acres)) units (Figure 3.3). They were created in the early 1960s by diking around a back-barrier tidal marsh (Whitman and Cole 1987). Prior to ditching, the area was dominated by S. patens, D. spicata, and S. alterniflora (Whitman and Cole 1987). As with the Port Mahon and Little Creek Impoundments, habitat conditions deteriorated in both the northern and southern Logan Lane units by the mid-1980s (Whitman and Cole 1987;Meredith and Whitman, 1994). In the late 1980s to mid-1990s, water control structures were updated to allow for more effective water level management through the introduction of enhanced tidal flushing (Meredith et al., 2004). This updated water level management has resulted in a more robust habitat (Meredith et al., 2004). The Logan Lane North Impoundment has limited tidal exchange, through one water control structure into Logan Lane South. Logan Lane North is dominated by open water and mudflat habitat (~54% combined of total area), with vegetated wetlands consisting of a mix of annual vegetation, tall-form S. alterniflora, and S. patens (Coxe, 2012). The Logan Lane South Impoundment has a large tidal exchange, through a water control structure to the St. Jones River and an emergency spillway (Whitman and Cole, 1987). It is dominated by mixed mudflat, open water habitat (~ 35% of total area), and wetlands consisting of tall-form S. alterniflora, S. patens, and P. australis (Coxe, 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Lower Delaware Bay Impoundments", "text": "The impoundments in the Lower Delaware Bay study area contain about 1,700 ha "}, {"section_title": "Water level Management", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Delaware River Impoundment Management", "text": "As the past main goal of the Buttonwood, Broad Dike, and Gambacorta Impoundments was primarily flood protection, the water level management prior to the mid-1990s was for no tidal exchange with the Delaware River (Hossler, 1994;Meredith et al., 2004). The lower water levels in the wetlands reduced mosquito breeding (by only flooding the pools and ditches to a level to allow access for fish, but not flood the marsh surface; Meredith et al., 1985). During the mid-to late-1990s, tidal gates were installed on these impoundments to allow for two-way tidal exchange to increase flushing and water exchange to provide better habitat and biota access (Meredith et al., 2004). Since the mid-to late-1990s, the impoundments have been managed to maximize fish exchange and plant regrowth (Meredith et al., 2004). Under this water level management scheme, salinities of the wetlands vary between mesohaline in the summer and fall to oligohaline in the winter and spring (Hossler, 1994). The effectiveness of the water level management, to provide two-way flow, was adequate until the late 2000's (Catts and Mancl, 2013). Since that time, the cumulative effect of rising tidal levels in the Delaware River has made it difficult to remove water from the impounded wetlands during storm events or control the interior water levels under the normal tidal range (Catts and Mancl, 2013). In response to the rising water levels in the Delaware River and the increasing impervious area within the drainage basins, recent water level planning and water control structure upgrades (early-2010's) have been implemented to address these issues (Catts and Mancl, 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Central Delaware Bay Impoundment Management", "text": "Past water level management of the four Central Delaware Bay impoundments entirely cut-off water exchange with the adjacent Delaware Bay, except for once yearly flooding (Whitmore and Cole, 1987). Over the years, salinity in the impoundments increased; by the early 1980s, salinities were observed to be as high as 100 ppt. causing the vegetation to die back (Clark, 1995). Use by waterfowl had also drastically declined (Whitman and Cole, 1987;Stocks and Grassle, 2003).Water level management strategy changed by the mid-1980s with an eye toward increasing marsh productivity (Meredith and Whitman, 1994). The main focus of the improved management is to allow a fall flooding (beginning in October), and maintain a higher water level (greater than 61 cm (24 inches) on the marsh surface) through the winter to attract waterfowl (Whitmore and Cole, 1987). Tidal exchange has been eliminated, or is very limited, during the late fall and winter to allow maintenance of high water levels (Whitmore and Cole, 1987). Periodic drawdowns and re-floods are conducted from January through March to prevent ice formation (Whitmore and Cole, 1987). In March, a drawdown to a 50% pool (50% surface inundation) is conducted to expose the marsh surface to allow for shorebird feeding and vegetation to germinate (Whitmore and Cole, 1987). During times when sediments are exposed, frequent tidal exchange is prescribed to prevent soil salinities from climbing (Whitmore and Cole, 1987). From April to August, water levels are maintained at 50% pool (Whitmore and Cole, 1987). In September and October, big drawdowns and re-floods occur to flush the impoundments prior to the traditional fall reflood (Whitmore and Cole, 1987). The current water level management plan results in mean salinity levels of 14 to 18 ppt (Meredith et al., 2004). Control of water levels within the impoundments has become more difficult as the result of sea-level rise and subsidence of the water control structures (Meredith et al., 2004). This has resulted in lowering of the openings of the  (Meredith et al., 2004). Loss of control in the water levels is particularly evident in the Logan Lane South Impoundment, where an emergency spillway has subsided (relative to sea level and in conjunction with rising water levels), and now only allows a tidal inflow through the upper half of a normal neap tidal cycle (Meredith et al., 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Lower Delaware Bay Impoundment Management", "text": "Units II and III of Prime Hook NWR were managed as freshwater impoundments "}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "137 Cs (cesium) radiometric cores and elevation data were collected from nine  "}, {"section_title": "Core Collection", "text": "Three soil cores were collected at each of the nine impounded wetland units and at each of the four reference wetlands, for a total of thirty-nine cores.

An internal plunger was suspended in the core barrel (parallel to the marsh surface) during the process. This was done to reduce the amount of compaction or rodding that occurred. If a collected core had a rate of compaction or rodding that exceeded 8% of the total length, then the sample was discarded and the core collection was repeated. Cores were pulled out of the marsh subsurface using a winch suspended off of a tripod. The retrieved cores were then capped, and stored vertically in a dark, climate-controlled storeroom until they could be sub-sampled and analyzed. After cores were collected, the outer PVC barrel was removed with a circular saw. This method of sampling was preferred over vertical extrusion (through a plunger pushing the core out), as the organic-rich sediments would become highly compacted during pushing and could skew the data analysis.

The total 210 Pb (lead) and 137 Cs concentrations were computed spectroscopically from the 46.5 keV and 661.7 keV photopeaks, respectively, whereas excess 210 Pb was determined by subtracting the supported activity (determined from the 214 Bi (bismuth) photopeak) from total activity. Detector efficiencies were determined using National Institute of Standards and Technology standard reference material 4357 (Inn et al., 2001;Sommerfield, 2005 and. Measurements of 137 Cs, with a half-life of 30 years, and 210 Pb, with a half-life of 22.3 years, were calculated on sectioned cores following methods described in previous studies (Cutshall et al., 1983;Nittrouer et al., 1984;Sommerfield, 2005). Profiles of excess 210 Pb activity were used to derive linear sediment accumulation and mass accumulation rates averaged over the past ~100 years, whereas 137 Cs profiles provided the rates subsequent to 1954. The 137 Cs data were used further to validate the 210 Pb-based rates. A natural radioisotope of the 238 U (uranium) decay series, 210 Pb is produced via 222 Rn (radon) decay in the atmosphere and is deposited on the continents and surface waters through wet and dry deposition (Sommerfield, 2005 and. Because 238 U is enriched in sea water relative to freshwater, the standing amount of 210 Pb in estuarine waters is typically larger than in rivers, but less than that of the open coastal ocean (Sommerfield, 2005 and. Background levels of 210 Pb are produced in the sediment column via decay of 222 Rn, a source known as \"supported\" activity (Sommerfield, 2005 and 2012). In the estuarine water column, dissolved 210 Pb is scavenged by fine-grained particles and delivered to the seabed by sediment deposition (Sommerfield, 2005 and). If the deposition rate is high relative to the mean life of 210 Pb, activity is concentrated in the upper sediment column above that supported by in situ production-this \"excess\" activity is what allows for estimation of sediment accumulation rates (Sommerfield, 2005 and. Excess 210 Pb activity eventually decays to background levels at a rate constrained by the half-life of 22.3 years (Sommerfield, 2005 and. At steady state, the excess activity-depth profile reflects a balance between 210 Pb burial (gain) and radioactive decay (loss) (Sommerfield, 2005 and). 137 Cs, a product of nuclear fission, was first introduced to the environment by means of nuclear weapons testing and reactor releases around 1954 (Sommerfield, 2005 and. Atmospheric fallout of 137 Cs peaked in 1963\u221264, dropping thereafter to insignificant levels by about 1980 (Sommerfield, 2005 and. Sub-areal marsh surfaces sequester 137 Cs activity (and 210 Pb) directly through wet and dry deposition, whereas tidal waters provide another source of particulate and dissolved-phase 137 Cs (and 210 Pb) (Sommerfield, 2005 and. It is important to note that, because the atmospheric flux of 137 Cs has been negligible for the past several decades, 137 Cs present in the post-1980 sediment column represents activity redistributed from upland sources or surrounding estuarine deposits (Sommerfield, 2005 and. In this manner, 137 Cs distributions in estuarine sediments reflect the regional atmospheric source function as well as more localized sedimentary processes (Sommerfield, 2005 and.

Nonmetric MDS is a means of visualizing the similarity of individual parameters in a dataset. MDS normalizes the data through the use of an algorithm aimed to place each object or parameter in a dimensionless distance matrix, so the values can then be compared within an ordination coordinate frame (Wickelmaier, 2003;Holland, 2008a  eigenvector technique that ordinates the data such that one axis explains the greatest amount of variance, and the second axis explains the next greatest amount of variance (Holland, 2008a). Rather in MDS, values are arranged in such a way that their separation corresponds to their degree of similarity; similar objects occur closer to each other, dissimilar objects are farther apart. (Wickelmaier, 2003). PCA is a technique used to evaluate the variability of interrelated parameters by transforming them into dimensionless values, while retaining their initial variation (Jolliffe, 2002). The transformation is accomplished by generating values, or principal components, which are uncorrelated aggregates of the variation within the original data (Jolliffe, 2002;Holland, 2008b). The principal components are systematically generated so that the top few retain most of the variation of the original parameters (Jolliffe, 2002). The principal components are reduced to a matrix of eigenvalues and eigenvectors (Jolliffe, 2002;Holland, 2008b). The eigenvectors denote the directions of the variance (either positive or negative), and the eigenvalues are numerical values, which relay the variance present in that direction (Holland, 2008b). The eigenvector with the corresponding highest eigenvalue is the principal component (Holland, 2008b). Data from a total of thirty-six cores were used in the nonmetric MDS and PCA analyses (Table 3.2). Fourteen of the cores were from the Delaware River Study Area. Of these cores, six were from reference marshes and eight from impoundment wetlands (see \"n\" value shown in Table 3.2 for specific number of cores from a given study site). A similar number of cores were available from the Central Delaware Bay Study Area. Of In the nonmetric MDS analysis, the variables (rates of accretion, bulk mass accumulation, mineral mass accumulation, organic mass accumulation, and 137 Cs and 210 Pb inventories) were normalized by assigning each a number between 0 and 1 corresponding to its rank (i.e., 0 = minimum; 1 = maximum value measured for that parameter). Normalization is done to allow for all the data to be scaled to allow for an   Table 3.1). The results from the PCA analyses are similar to the nonmetric MDS. As shown in Figure 3.6, the Central and Lower Delaware Bay Study Area core data points cluster closer together and the Delaware River Study Area data are more broadly distributed. The PCA plot also shows dissimilarity between the reference marshes and impoundment wetlands for the Delaware River and Central Delaware Bay Study Areas (Figure 3.6). In contrast to the nonmetric MDS analysis, the PCA is evaluating the percentage of variance that can be explained by the differences in the parameters of interest (rates of accretion, bulk mass accumulation, mineral mass accumulation, organic mass accumulation, and 137 Cs and 210 Pb inventories). The principal components that show the greatest effect on variance (principal components (PC) 1 and 2) are the axes on the PCA plot (Figure 3.6). Eigenvalues show that PC1 and PC2, account for 80.3% of the cumulative variation, with PC1 accounting for 66.5% (Table 3.3). The eigenvectors for PC1 indicate that the variation within this component is dominated by the rates of bulk mass accumulation, mineral mass accumulation, organic mass accumulation, and accretion, respectively (Table 3.3). As these parameters are all closely related, it stands to reason that changes in the rates of mineral mass and organic mass accumulation would affect the rates of accretion and/or bulk mass accumulation. For PC1, as shown in Table 3.3 and the rosette in Figure 3.6, all of the variables impact the positions of the core data points in a negative direction. The eigenvectors for PC 2 show that the variation within this component is dominated by mean elevation of the site (in a positive direction) and 210 Pb inventory in a negative direction (Table 3.3; also shown in the rosette in Figure 3.6). 210 Pb inventory was not examined in detail within this analysis as it was a parameter that was not present in appreciable quantities in all of the collected cores. The Buttonwood and Broad Dike cores, as compared to the other data collection sites, have the lowest, and largest deviations between their, elevations. These relationships are shown in Figure 3.6 by their lower position (relative to the PC2 axis) and broader distribution for a given core collection site."}, {"section_title": "ANOVA Statistical Analysis", "text": "To examine in further detail the differences between the three study areas, and within each of the study areas the variability between reference marshes and impoundments, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) techniques were employed.

A significant difference was defined by significance level (p-values) less than 0.05, implying that there was less than a 5% probability that there were no differences between the impoundment and reference marshes.

The Delaware River and Central Delaware Bay study areas are ~72 km apart, while the Central and Lower Delaware Bay areas are ~27 km apart.

If sea-level rise outpaces vertical sediment accretion, wetland loss will result where lateral migration is not possible, and the change in location of the fresh water/ salt water interface will cause shifts in plant community composition (Callaway et al., 1996;Burkett and Kusler, 2000;Winter, 2000;Darke and Megonigal, 2003). On a local scale, anthropogenic activities such as development of coastal areas, reservoirs, water-withdrawal projects, and dams can affect the complex interactions of sediment deposition, erosion, and subsidence that control wetland surface elevation (Nittrouer et al., 1984;Davis, 1997;Darke and Megonigal, 2003).

Sediment plugs were randomly cut from each of the plots and the amount of sediment deposited on top of the marker horizon was measured (Figure 4.8). The sediment deposited was used to calculate the sedimentation rate (rate of vertical accretion) for that localized area, and the mean rate was calculated for each sampling station (benchmark area). When used simultaneously, SET and marker horizon techniques provide information on below-ground processes that influence elevation change. Differences between rates of vertical accretion and elevation change in the shallow benchmark SET measurements may be attributed to processes, such as dewatering, enhanced root growth, decomposition and root growth collapse, occurring below the feldspar layer and above the bottom of the shallow SET pipe."}, {"section_title": "Surface Elevation Change -Deep Benchmark Measurements", "text": "All four SETs along the St. Jones River experienced an overall loss in marsh surface elevation as measured by the deep benchmarks (Table 4.1 and Figure 4.10).

At the Blackbird Landing SET, a large overall decrease of -72.4 mm in elevation is observed; a decrease of -45.8 mm is measured at the Delon SET (Table 4.1 and Figure   4.11). The rates of elevation loss at these SETs (-10.4 and -6.2 mm/yr, respectively) are of similar magnitude to the St. Jones River SETs (Table 4.1). In contrast, at the Eagles Nest and Beaver Branch SETs overall increases in elevation of 14.9 and 8.6 mm, respectively are measured (Table 4.1 and Figure 4.11).

As shown by the relatively large standard deviations for the elevation changes in both the deep and shallow benchmark measurements (Figures 4.10 -4.13), there is a level of uncertainty in the data that reduces the extent to which changes in marsh elevation can be evaluated. The variability in the data at individual SET sites can in part be attributed to extensive bioturbation at the sites generated by burrowing and mound creation by fiddler crabs. Fiddler crabs were ubiquitous at most of the sampling sites, and produced local changes in elevation that were spatially distributed at a scale that corresponded to the spacing between the sampling pins of the SET instruments."}, {"section_title": "Surface Elevation Change -Shallow Benchmark Measurement", "text": "The length of time over which the shallow elevation change is measured is shorter than the deep SETs, as the shallow SET platforms were re-leveled on the St. Jones River in February 2011 and in December 2010 on Blackbird Creek. Initial baseline readings were re-started on the subsequent readings in 2011. Along the St. Jones River, and similar to that observed for the deep benchmarks, the shallow surface elevation measurements are characterized by an initial gradual elevation increase, followed by a relatively large and rapid decrease (Figure 4.12). Overall initial elevation increases range between 20.9 mm at the Impoundment SET and 7.8 mm at the Wildcat SET (Figure 4.12). The rates at which elevations increase between sampling periods varies between 4.2 mm/yr at the Boardwalk SET and 18.1 mm/yr at the Impoundment SET.

The average accretion rates at the Wildcat and Issac's Branch SETs are 20.0 +/-15.6 mm/yr and 22.9 +/-11.5 mm/yr, respectively. Accretion rates at the Blackbird Creek SETs are much more consistent in terms of magnitude and variability than that along the St. Jones River. With the exception of only two sampling periods, one at the Delon SET and one at the Beaver Branch SET, accretion rates are between 26.7 and 7.5 mm/yr (Figure 4.15). The Delon SET has the highest  Similarly, the lowest average rate of accretion (11.8 +/-3.5 mm/yr) occur at the Blackbird Landing SET, furthest upstream along Blackbird Creek. A low average rate of accretion is measured at the Boardwalk SET (5.3 +/-1.8 mm/yr) which is the nearest SET to the main stem of the St. Jones River (Table 4.1). Lower accretion rates upstream and near the main stem of the St. Jones River are expected within these tidal wetlands (Reed, 1995;Christiansen, 1998;Chmura and Hung, 2004;Li, 2006). Sites closer to the bay would be exposed to higher concentrations of suspended sediments due to closer proximity to the sediment-rich Delaware Bay waters, and the re-cannibalization of marsh (bay and channel) edges during storm events. Sites further upstream would experience lower rates of accretion due to reduced sediment concentrations in the tidal waters as a result, in part, due to the longer flow path up the main stem and any tributaries. Trends that were expected, but not clearly observed, are seasonal variations in accretion rates. A seasonal pattern of deposition due to higher stem and leaf densities during the summer, and lower stem densities and above-ground biomass during winter months (due to vegetation senescence), should result in a pattern of higher rates of accretion during the summer and lower rates during winter. Of the eight accretion records, only the Impoundment Site shows distinctly higher rates of accretion (during or right after summer months) in , 2008, and 2010. Two of the Blackbird Creek sites (Eagles Nest and Beaver Branch), show slightly higher rates during the summer, but the rates are not significantly different, and the trends are not consistent over the time period that data were collected (Figure 4.15). The lack of a clear seasonal accretion rate trend in the data is likely the result of allowing too much time to pass between sampling intervals, such that the effects of vegetation vigor on sediments trapping could not be constrained, and the effects of episodic coastal storms could not be excluded. If the sites had been sampled bi-monthly or even quarterly, then the seasonal effects could have been better constrained. Sampling before and after large coastal storms with significant storm surges (i.e. Nor'easters) would also be necessary to account or exclude the effects of episodic accretion events. It also cannot be discounted that the placement of a SET within the estuary or marsh may have an effect on the magnitude of the accretion. For example, if positioned along the fringe of the marsh (i.e. Boardwalk and Blackbird SET locations) where there are lower suspended sediment rates, the overall accretion rates would be lower and the degree of seasonal variability would be more difficult to measure. In contrast, sites (i.e. Impoundment SET) located closer to Delaware Bay (the sediment source for these estuaries), and/or closer to the main stem of the estuaries, would experience higher suspended sediment concentrations, and with a larger signal would have an easier to detect seasonal trend. The effect of re-suspension and re-deposition of mud by fiddler crab burrowing activities could be a factor in the rates of accretion that were measured. Areas of highest burrow intensity would most likely be associated with higher measured accretion rates, than those determined for non-altered sites. However, it was beyond the scope of this study to quantify the intensity of burrowing activity and volume of sediments brought to the surface by the activity."}, {"section_title": "Deep and Shallow Subsidence Rates", "text": "Deep and shallow rates of subsidence at a SET can be calculated by subtracting the accretion rate from the rate of elevation change. Deep subsidence rates are equivalent to the rate of elevation change as determined from the deep SET measurements minus the accretion rate; the shallow subsidence rate is equivalent to the rate of elevation change as determined from the shallow SET measurements minus the accretion rate. Deep and shallow subsidence rates for the St. Jones River and Blackbird Creek SETs are listed in where the benchmark is located). Sites with a healthy vegetative community will have a high volume of biomass in the shallow zone, and will have a rate of subsidence that is either very low, at zero, or even negative (i.e. an elevation increase). This can be seen at the Blackbird Creek Beaver Branch SET with a shallow subsidence rate of only 2.0 mm/yr (Table 4.1). Sites with stressed plant communities and potentially higher rates of decomposition will experience rates of shallow elevation decrease that are large, and amplify the effects of deep subsidence processes. This is observed at the St. Jones River Impoundment SET with a high shallow subsidence rate of 65.8 mm/yr (Table 4.1). Deep subsidence rates are a function of the degree of compaction, decomposition, and consolidation (de-watering) of the sediments, including those in the shallow zone, that underlie a SET. Thus, the rate of deep subsidence should differ between SETs due to variations in the composition (as it impacts compaction, decomposition, and consolidation properties) and the thickness of the Holocene sediments that underlie the SETs. The Holocene sediments that underlie the SETs, in both the St. Jones River and Blackbird Creek, are mainly composed of fine grained silts and clays with varying quantities of organic content (Marx, 1981;Oertel and Kraft, 1994;Wilson, 2004). They can range in thickness from centimeters (at the fringes of the estuary) to greater than 20 m (at the center of the basins, toward the bay; Marx, 1981;Oertel and Kraft, 1994;Wilson, 2004). These sediments are easily compacted due to the weight of the overburden; which causes pore fluids to be squeezed out, clay and silt particles to realign and compress, and organic deposits to compress. Compaction results in a loss of vertical volume, which lowers the ground surface above these deposits. The top ~2 m of the vegetated marsh deposits, are composed of higher quantities of organic content, and therefore experience high rates of shallow compaction (due to de-watering, compression, and decomposition; Pizzuto and Schwendt, 1997). Decomposition (aerobic and anaerobic) plays a huge role in organic loss in the upper deposits, while below ~2 m the rate of decomposition is reduced due to the lack of available oxygen (Pizzuto and Schwendt, 1997;2013). Cores to determine the composition of the underlying material at each SET were not collected as part of this study. Holocene sediment thicknesses at each of the SETs were determined by the depth of penetration of the surveying rod, in conjunction with the sediment type (Pre-Holocene sand and gravel deposits) sampled at the point of refusal. The Impoundment SET, with a large Holocene sediment thickness (24.3 m), is an outlier (Table 4.1). The other SETs have thicknesses that range between 12.2 and 7.3 m (Table   4.1). Past research confirms the thicknesses of the Holocene sediments in the vicinity of the SET locations (Marx, 1981;Oertel and Kraft, 1994;Wilson, 2004). It is expected that the greater the Holocene sediment thickness, the larger the degree of compaction and consolidation (de-watering), and thus the higher the rate of deep subsidence (Chrzastowski and Kraft, 1985;Wilson, 2004). However, this relationship is not supported by the SET data collected in this study. A plot of the rate of deep subsidence as a function of the thickness of Holocene sediments does not show a strong correlation (Figure 4.16). A best-fit line to the data has an R 2 value of only 0.4884. Clearly shown on this plot is the outlier nature of the Impoundment SET 24 m Holocene sediment thickness data point. What the data are lacking is deep subsidence rate values for sediment thicknesses between 12 and 24 m (Figure 4.16). To better constrain the relationship between thickness of underlying marsh sediments and the rate of subsidence, additional SETs would need to be located in the study areas at sites corresponding to Holocene sediment thicknesses between 12 and 24 m.
