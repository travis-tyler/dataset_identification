[{"section_title": "", "text": "What types of public schools have shortened school weeks, with fewer than 5 days per week? Schools were asked how many days were in a typical school week for students in grades 1-12. Nationally, about 1.9 percent of public schools have fewer than 5 days per school week (figure 1). This was more common at alternative/other schools than regular schools (7.3 and 1.6 percent, respectively; not shown in figure, see supplemental tables). Shortened school weeks were more prevalent at rural, western, and smaller schools. A larger percentage of schools in rural areas (4.6 percent) than schools in towns, suburbs, and cities (2.2, 0.8, and 0.6 percent, respectively) had shortened school weeks. Percent !

Schools in the West (5.3 percent) were more likely to have a shortened school week than schools in the Midwest or South (1.4 and 0.8 percent, respectively). 6 A larger percentage of schools with fewer than 200 students (7.1 percent) than schools with 200-749 students or schools with 750 or more students (1.1 and 0.6 percent, respectively) reported a shortened school week. Shortened school weeks were more prevalent at combined schools (7.0 percent) than at primary, middle, or high schools (0.9, 0.5, and 3.3 percent, respectively). In what states did at least 10 percent of schools have a shortened student school week, with fewer than 5 days per week? Although the national percentage of public schools with a shortened school week was about 1.9 percent, there were eight states, largely located in the western United States, where more than 10 percent of schools had a shortened school week: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, and Wyoming (table 1). Among all schools in the United States with a shortened school week, about 66.8 percent were in the West and about 67.9 percent were in these eight states. Furthermore, in two of these eight states-Idaho (17.5 percent) and Wyoming (19.5 percent)more than 15 percent of schools had a shortened school week. In five states, the percentage of schools with a shortened school week ranged from 2.5 percent (Missouri) to 8.4 percent (Nevada). In all other states, it was estimated that fewer than 1 percent of schools had a shortened school week or data did not meet National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) standards for reporting. with no adjustments for multiple comparisons. In the design, conduct, and data processing of NCES surveys, efforts are made to minimize the effects of nonsampling errors such as item nonresponse, measurement error, data processing error, or other systematic error."}, {"section_title": "Shortened School Weeks in U.S. Public Schools", "text": ""}]
