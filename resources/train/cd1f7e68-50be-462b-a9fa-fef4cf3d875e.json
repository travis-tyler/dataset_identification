[{"section_title": "Reply", "text": "We thank Drs. Bell and O'Keefe for the interest in our study about the relationship between the white blood cell (WBC) count and mortality over the period 1958 to 2002 (1).\nDrs. Bell and O'Keefe point out that the metabolic syndrome (MetS) could mediate the relationship between elevated WBC count and increased mortality shown in our study. Although we find this hypothesis interesting, we do not have adequate data to address it in the BLSA (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging). Information on the components of the MetS were not systematically collected over the period 1958 to 2002, and therefore we could not explore possible secular trends for this syndrome. Although the mortality risk ratio between WBC groups was adjusted for some components of MetS, such as triglycerides, blood pressure, and diabetes status, we could not investigate the role of waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, or high-density lipoprotein levels. Data on waist circumference were available for a small subgroup of the BLSA study population, and high-density lipoprotein was measured starting in the mid-1980s. Other longitudinal studies exist that collected information on the MetS and may better discern whether the presence of MetS is causal in both the elevated WBC count and the increased mortality.\nThe finding that WBC count is nonlinearly associated with all-cause mortality and almost linearly associated with cardiovascular mortality, while there is no significant association between WBC count and cancer mortality, supports hypotheses that elevated WBC count may be part of a cluster of risk factors that predispose an individual to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (2). However, whether this cluster corresponds to the MetS is still uncertain."}]
