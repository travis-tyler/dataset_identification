The difference in the language domain decreases until the age of 6 while it increases regarding children's cultural knowledge. Immigrant parents' acculturation to the receiving coun try is positively related with all three academic skill domains. Tloe results point to the importance o f early intervention strategies.\nKeywords: child developm ent, children o f immigrants, acculturation, cogni tive skills, language skills E ducational inequality between children of immigrants and children of native-born parents is an established phenomenon in most Western countries (for an overview, see Heath & Brinbaum, 2007) . On average, chil dren of immigrants show lower levels of school performance and educa tional attainment than children of native-born parents although there are large differences between various ethnic groups and countries (Levels, Dronkers, & Kraaykamp, 2008; OECD, 2006) . This finding attracts the atten tion of educational researchers as well as policymakers since children of im migrants are a growing population in many Western countries and their educational attainment influences their later success in the labor market (Granato & Kalter, 2001) .\nIn Western societies, the educational system demands and rewards cer tain academic skills in children (e.g., linguistic competence in the dominant language of the country; Bourdieu, 1977) . These academic skills are tied to the dominant culture o f a society and include the way of thinking and inter acting that are deemed appropriate and valuable. Such academic skills are unevenly distributed between different groups of children right from the start-which is one key mechanism of the reproduction of social inequality (Bourdieu, 1977) . It is a well-known finding that children's academic skills at the time of school entry are systematically associated with their social back ground (Crosnoe & Cooper, 2010; West, Denton, & Germino-Hausken, 2000) . There is also some evidence that differences in academic skills between chil dren of immigrants and children of native-born parents, too, are already pres ent at this age (Crosnoe, 2007; Magnuson, Lahaie, & Waldfogel, 2006; Reardon & Galindo, 2009 ). However, little is known about the development of such differences between children of immigrants and children without migration background in the age period before elementary school.\nThe present article analyzes the development o f cognitive, language, and cultural skills by children of Turkish origin and children of nativeborn German parents in Germany from age 3 to 6. We refer to Bronfenbrenner's (1977) bio-ecological theory of human development and combine this theoretical framework with Berry's (1997) acculturation scheme and the concept of the society-specificity of skills (Chiswick, 2009; Kalter, 2003) . Immigrant parents may engage in activities that are specific for the receiving country (RC) and/or in ones that are specific for their"}, {"section_title": "Development of Cognitive, Language, and Cultural Skills", "text": "country of origin (CO; see Berry, 1997) . We assume that this type of parental acculturation strategy affects the familial learning context, which in turn in fluences children's academic skill development (Bronfenbrenner, 1994) . However, this association probably depends on the type of skill under con sideration. We differentiate between skills that are \"general\" (e.g., nonverbal intelligence) from skills that are \"specific\" for either the receiving country (RC-specific skills) or the country of origin (CO-specific skills; e.g., language proficiency). Concretely, we examine the following research questions in this article:\nR e s e a r c h Q u estio n 1: Controlling fo r the fam ilies' socio eco n om ic status and som e other relevant child and family characteristics, do children o f Turkish origin dif fer from children o f native-born G erm an parents regarding their cognitive, lan guage, and cultural skills at the early age o f 36 months? We exp ect to find such differences in the dom ains o f G erm an language skills and know ledge about the W estern culture (tw o RC-specific skills) but not in the dom ain o f cognitive skills (a general skill). R e s e a r c h Q u estio n 2 : Are the RC-acculturation practices o f Turkish-origin parents positively associated with their child ren's cognitive, language, and cultural skills? We exp ect such associations in the dom ains o f G erm an language skills and cultural know ledge but not in the dom ain o f cognitive skills.\nnot the native language of the child (see Nell, 2004) . However, also nonver bal tests may be culturally biased: They often require specific strategies or cognitive styles that are characteristic o f middle-class Western cultures (Rogoff, 2003; Rossellia & Ardila, 2003) . In addition, test scores of some cul tural groups may be depressed because of negative attitudes to the test sit uation, the tester, or culturally unfamiliar demands such as working quickly (see Nell, 2004) . A large literature exists on the topic of stereotype threat that shows that the test performance of ethnic minority groups can be reduced in test situations where these individuals are concerned to con firm a negative stereotype about their group (Steele & Aronson, 1995;  for an overview, see Walton & Spencer, 2009 ). We tried to reduce these sources of cultural bias in our study as far as pos sible by adopting the following measures: All test instructions were available in German and Turkish and the children could choose their preferred lan guage and also respond in either language including switching between lan guages (the only exception being the subtest on German vocabulary where the answers had to be given in German, see the following). Thus, no language difficulties should impair the understanding of test instructions. This required that only bilingual testers were sent to Turkish-origin families. All o f our bilin gual test administrators were themselves Turkish immigrants or descendants of Turkish immigrants, which should reduce a possible stereotype threat in the test situation. We further tried to reduce anxiety in the children by com pletely avoiding the term test-, the interviewers were instructed to use the term educational gam e instead. This \"game-like\" character of the test situation was further enhanced by the colorful test materials, which are usually interest ing for children. Finally, there was no time pressure for the children, and the interviewers were instructed to have a break at any time during the test if nec essary, which should further prevent any stress. The following describes the concrete subtests and other measures in more detail.\n\nfrom age 3 to 6 shows that children of Turkish origin are disadvantaged with respect to academic skills that are specific for the German society (language skills, cultural knowledge). In contrast, we find a slight advantage for Turkish-origin children in the domain of cognitive skills when the social background of the family is taken into account. However, this advantage of the Turkish-origin children with respect to cognitive skills should not be overinterpreted since the differences in this domain are rather small in general and the nonrandom sample attrition might lead to an overestimation of the Turkish-origin children's test scores in the later panel waves. Thus, we only conclude that there is at least no disadvantage for children of Turkish origin regarding cognitive skills in early childhood while there are pro nounced differences with respect to RC-specific skills. These results are in line with other studies on immigrant children's academic skills that find the largest differences in the domain of RC-language skills (Dubowy et al., 2008; Magnuson et al., 2006; Niklas, Segerer, Schmiedeler, & Schneider, 2012) . This should be alarming for policymakers since especially immigrant children's RC-language skills are related to their later educational success (Demie & Strand, 2006; Esser, 2006; von Below, 2007) .\nThe finding that the differences between children of Turkish origin and children of native-born parents are strongest in the domain of RC-specific skills is supportive of our theoretical model. Taking Bronfenbrenner's notion that the influence of familial processes (e.g., parent-child interactions) also depend on the content of this microsystem and the concrete type of devel opmental outcome, we have argued that children's development also de pends on the \"cultural content\" of the familial environment. To arrive at concrete hypotheses, we have combined Bronfenbrenner's theoretical framework with the concept of the society-specificity of skills. Our theoret ical model assumes that the cultural content of the familial environment af fects children's skill development in the case that it matches the concrete type of skill regarding its society-specificity. In a first step, we only regard the families' migration background as a proxy for the cultural content of the familial environment (later we specify this in more detail by including the concept of immigrant parents' acculturation). The empirical results of our study confirm a differential effect of the migration background depend ing on the type of skill under consideration: We only find a small association between children's migration background and their cognitive skills (a gen eral skill) while this association is large in the case of language skills and cul tural knowledge (RC-specific skills). This shows that Bronfenbrenner's general idea that the content of the familial microsystem affects children's development can be applied to different cultural contexts in immigrant fam ilies and families without migration background. His idea o f differential in fluences depending on the type of developmental outcome can be applied to the differentiation between general and society-specific skills.\nIn our study, we not only find that the differences between children of immigrants and native-born parents vary by skill domain but also the longi tudinal development of these differences varies by type of skill: With respect to language skills, the difference in the test scores between the children of native-born German parents and the children of Turkish origin is most pro nounced at the earliest measurement in our study and then declines over time. Thus, children of Turkish origin rapidly catch up in this domain. However, the difference is still large at the age of 78 months-it nearly equals 1 year of learning for the Turkish-origin children. This finding is sim ilar to the results of Leseman, Scheel, Mayo, and Messer (2009) , who found large differences between Moroccan-Dutch children and Turkish-Dutch chil dren compared to monolingual Dutch children regarding their Dutchlanguage skills at age 3-These differences decline until the age of 6 but are still large at that point in time (Leseman et al., 2009 , p-299)-Niklas et al. (2012 describe a similar catching-up effect of children of immigrants regarding their early literacy competencies from age 5 until the time of school entry. However, we find the opposite pattern regarding children's cultural knowledge: The difference between children with and without migration background is not very large at age 3 but then steadily increases. Here, we know of no other study that has analyzed the longitudinal devel opment of children's cultural knowledge in early childhood.\nThese different longitudinal trajectories in the domain o f language skills and cultural knowledge (both RC-specific skills), of course, lead to the ques tion about possible reasons for these patterns. One interpretation could be that extra-familial learning contexts like preschools are of different impor tance in the acquisition of these skills. In Germany, most children start pre school at the age of 3-Thus, differences in the cultural content of the home are o f major importance for the development of society-specific skills up to that age. We find a large difference between children of Turkish origin and children without migration background with regard to their German vocab ulary at age 3, which is in line with this reasoning. The difference with regard to children's cultural knowledge at that age is not so large, which may be due to the greater difficulty of this subtest in general. Some of the test items in the cultural knowledge test are a bit outdated (e.g., knowing Charlie Chaplin) and very difficult even for children of native-born Germans. Thus, all children start at a rather low level in this test at age 3-In the follow ing years, the Turkish-origin children start catching up with respect to German-language skills. Preschool attendance may be an important factor for their language acquisition because they can get in much contact with the German language in this context. Various studies have demonstrated that preschool attendance positively affects children's skill development (e.g., Gormley, Phillips, & Gayer, 2008; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2002) . This is especially true for children whose parents do not speak the language of the receiving country at home (Gormley, 2008; Development of Cognitive, Language, and Cultural Skills Magnuson, Meyers, Ruhm, & Waldfogel, 2004) . Also in the present study, a longer preschool attendance is positively associated with children's lan guage skills. Separate models by migration status reveal that this positive preschool effect is much stronger for the Turkish-origin children than for the children of German native-born parents (results not presented). In con trast, preschool attendance does not have any significant influence on child ren's cultural knowledge in either group. Thus, children without migration background who probably get more exposure to the dominant culture at home as they get older can improve their knowledge about the Western cul ture much more than children of Turkish origin. We therefore see an increas ing difference in this domain.\nAn alternative explanation for the different trajectories could be that the children are in different phases on the same learning curve. Regarding child ren's cultural knowledge, we have observed the beginning of the acquisition process with all children starting at a low initial level at age 3-Children of native-born German parents could then make larger progress until the age of 6 than children of immigrants because of the \"match\" between the cul tural content of their familial environment with this type of skill. However, it is possible that a catching-up process has taken place after our observation period if the children of immigrants are more and more exposed to the dom inant culture. The situation regarding children's German vocabulary is differ ent: We have observed a large difference at the age of 3 but not the em ergence of this difference before that age. Since children start to build a vocabulary very early in life around the age of 1 (see Berk, 2009; Hart & Risley, 1995) , we have missed the period of increasing differences in our data. It is therefore possible that the two longitudinal trajectories are not in principal different from each other but only shifted in time. Unfortunately, we cannot test this idea with our current data since a longer time horizon would be necessary.\nThe second main topic of this article is the role o f immigrant parents' behavioral acculturation to the receiving country for their children's aca demic skill development in early childhood. Using Berry's concept of accul turation strategies, we have argued that parents' acculturation strategy shapes the cultural content of the familial microsystem. We again refer to Bronfenbrenner's notion that the influence o f familial processes on child ren's development also depends on the content of the familial microsystem. It is well known that parents' socioeconomic status is related to various familial processes like parent-child interactions, which in turn affect child ren's development (for an overview, see Bradley & Corwyn, 2002; Feinstein, Duckworth, & Sabates, 2004) . However, such studies usually do not consider the cultural content of these familial processes. This may not pose a problem in samples of families without migration background. In contrast, the cultural content of the familial environment is definitely of major importance in immigrant families since it probably often differs from the dominant culture o f the receiving society (see Diehl & Schnell, 2006) , which may also have consequences for children's development of societyspecific skills. For example, it does not only matter how often parents tell stories to their children but also which stories in which language. We have argued that this cultural content of the familial microsystem has to be taken into account in an analysis of immigrant children's society-specific skills. In our present study, we did this by explicitly focusing on immigrant parents' acculturation practices.\nWe have found that children of Turkish origin whose parents show stronger signs of acculturation to the receiving country score better in all three test domains. The association is largest with respect to Germanlanguage skills. This is hardly surprising since most o f the items that we used as indicators of parents' RC-acculturation practices are related to their German-language use or proficiency. However, we did not expect an asso ciation between parents' RC-acculturation and children's cognitive skills since cognitive skills are general and not society-specific skills. Of course, unobserved heterogeneity might be a reason for this association. For exam ple, immigrant parents who have better opportunities to learn a new lan guage may also have better opportunities regarding their involvement in the early education of their child. More research on these possible associa tions is needed in the future. Finally, it should be noted that the influence of parents' acculturation may be especially large in early childhood and may decline among older children when they spend more time in school and with friends.\nThe discussion on the impact of immigrant parents' RC-acculturation practices on their children's RC-specific skills already points to the most seri ous limitations of the present study: We only regarded one dimension of acculturation (behavioral acculturation) and only the acculturation to the receiving country and not the acculturation to the country of origin. Similarly, we only addressed children's RC-specific skills and not their COspecific skills. We chose this narrow focus because we wanted to concen trate on academic skills that are most closely related to later school success (Duncan et al., 2007) . This does not mean that CO-specific skills are unim portant. For example, it has been shown that fluent bilingual children have more self-esteem and higher educational aspirations than children of immigrants who are only proficient in the RC-language but not in the COlanguage (Portes & Hao, 2002) . Our focus on immigrant parents' accultura tion to the receiving country follows from our concentration on children's RC-specific skills. Here again, we do not want to indicate that parents' accul turation to their country of origin is unimportant. Several authors have argued that \"ethnic resources\" can be very valuable for immigrants and their families (Portes & Zhou, 1993; Zhou, 1997) . Finally, we want to acknowl edge that also other dimensions of immigrant parents' acculturation (values, beliefs, identifications) shape the home learning environment (Keels, 2009; Development of Cognitive, Language, and Cultural Skills Louie, 2006) . We concentrated on the behavioral dimension because its link to children's skill development is most straightforward and our data set is also restricted with regard to other dimensions. However, considering differ ent dimensions of acculturation would also be a very interesting topic for future research.\nSome further limitations of the present study should also be noted. Since we use a local sample we cannot make any statements about the \"absolute skill levels\" of children in Germany. Thus, we are not interested in exact skill levels but only in general associations (e.g., whether there is a positive asso ciation between parents' RC-acculturation practices and children's language skills), which we probably would also find similarly in other regions of Germany. The problem of nonrandom sample attrition has already been mentioned in the methods section. This is a main problem of all longitudinal studies. In our case, especially Turkish-origin children with low initial test scores are more likely to drop out of the study. Thus, our results are rather conservative regarding the size of the differences between children of native-born and Turkish-origin parents in the later panel waves. This is espe cially true with respect to the German-language skills: The vocabulary test was probably quite easy for the German children without migration back ground in the third panel wave, which might have resulted in a ceiling effect for this subpopulation. Thus, the catching up of the Turkish-origin children in this domain might be overestimated. A further clear limitation o f our study is that it includes only one immigrant group. Although Turkish immigrants in Germany are an especially interesting group because it is the largest immi grant group in Germany and also the most disadvantaged group in the German educational system, a comparison to other immigrant groups could have given additional insights.\nThe results of our study have some implications for the research on the academic skills of children o f immigrants. It is important to clearly distin guish between general and society-specific skills since different results can be expected depending on the type of skill. This means that tests that mix up verbal with nonverbal elements are problematic in this sense. Special attention and effort is necessary if the children have a different native lan guage than the test language-we consider the translation of test instructions and the use of bilingual testers essential to avoid lower test results because of language barriers (also tests on \"general skills\" usually require at least some minimal verbal instructions).\nIn addition, some socio-political implications may be derived from the results of this study. First, we replicated the finding from other studies that differences in academic skills between children of native-born and immi grant parents can be found early in life. Thus, interventions aiming for more equality in educational opportunity should especially target this early age period (see Heckman, 2006 ). Although we cannot generalize our results to other immigrant groups and other countries, it is not unlikely that some of our findings would also be found in other contexts: The greatest differences between children of immigrants and children without migration background are found in domains that are specific for the receiving society like language skills. Since RC-language skills are also highly important for children's later educational success, a clear implication would be to put a strong emphasis on language in early intervention programs. However, a strong emphasis on early RC-language learning does not imply that CO-language skills should not be maintained. It has been shown that children of immigrants who are proficient in the RC-language a n d in the CO-language (fluent bilingualism) have some advantages in comparison to monolingual children (Portes & Hao, 2002; St-Hilaire, 2002) . Also, bilingual education programs usually show advantages compared to monolingual programs (Goldenberg, 2008) . Bradley and McKelvey (2007) argue that the most important factor for suc cessful early intervention programs for children of immigrants is bridging the language and ways of understanding of the children's home and the lan guage and ways of understanding that are characteristic of schools (for a description of differences in practitioners' and immigrant parents' beliefs about early education, see Tobin & Kurban, 2010 ; for a discussion on cultur ally responsive educational settings, see Souto-Manning & Mitchell, 2010) . With the results of our study in mind, we would like to add that such pro grams should start as early as possible in order to give the children more time for adaptation to the different cultural environments."}, {"section_title": "R e s e a r c h Q u estion 3 : D o the differences b etw een children o f Turkish origin and", "text": "children o f native-born G erm an parents regarding their RC-specific skills still exist at the age o f 78 months?

In this article we additionally address the development of cultural skills in early childhood that may also be rele vant for later educational outcomes. Bourdieu (1977) argues that the educa tional system requires an \"initial familiarity with the dominant culture\" (p. 494). Several empirical studies have found an association between spe cific forms of cultural participation and cultural skills with children's educa tional outcomes (e.g., Aschaffenburg & Maas, 1997; Dumais, 2002; Scherger & Savage, 2010) . A very detailed study in this respect is the study of Sullivan (2001) who finds a strong significant association between pupils' cultural knowledge and their educational performance at age 16. This article clearly adds to the existing literature on educational inequal ity between children of immigrants and native-borns by focusing on the early period before school start that has been rather neglected in the litera ture so far. The use of longitudinal data allows tracing different growth tra jectories of children's academic skills by families' migration background. Until now, it is mostly unknown whether differences between children of immigrants and children of native-born parents already exist at a very early age and then remain stable or if they increase or decrease until school starts and whether this pattern is identical for different types of skills. Especially the development of cultural knowledge in early childhood has not been ad dressed in other studies so far. Explicitly considering the role of parents' RCacculturation for the development of academic skills by children of immi grants is also a new contribution of the present article. It allows investigating whether a high familial acculturation to the receiving society constitutes an advantage in school readiness for children of immigrants.\nThe outline of the remaining part of this article is as follows: The next section gives a very brief description of the German educational system and the situation of Turkish immigrants in the German context followed by an overview o f previous studies on differences in academic skills between children of immigrants and native-borns in early childhood. Next, we describe our theoretical framework and focus of the present work. We then present the data and method, followed by the results. The last section discusses the findings."}, {"section_title": "The German Context", "text": "In Germany, children usually start elementary school at the age of 6. The transition to different secondary school tracks is after Grade 4 (at 10 years of age) in most o f the German federal states. There is no mandatory preschool before elementary school, but 94% of all 3-to 6-year-olds in 2011 attended a \"Kindergarten\" (see Autorengruppe Bildungsberichterstattung, 2012, Tab. C3-1A) . This is a preschool for 3-to 6-year-old children that is not part of the school system and has no uniform curriculum. It is usually operated by the community or by nonprofit organizations and heavily subsidized so that the costs for parents are low (in some federal states even free of charge). The quality is generally regulated at the state level with a focus on structural features such as staff-to-child ratios, but the composition o f children (e.g., proportion of children from low socioeconomic status families) may greatly vary by region. Child care institutions for younger children (\"Kinderkrippe\") are far less often used-they are more expensive and less available.\nFocusing on children of Turkish origin in Germany is a well-suited example to study the early educational disadvantage of immigrant children since the educational inequality between children of immigrants and native-borns is particularly large in Germany (OECD, 2006) , with the greatest disadvantages for children of Turkish immigrants von Below, 2007) . They are in most cases the descendants of the so-called guestworkers. In the 1960s, the German industry was in need o f low-skilled labor and started to recruit guestworkers, many of them from Turkey. Most of these Turkish labor migrants came from rural areas and had little formal education (Crul & Vermeulen, 2003) . After the immigration stop in 1974 as a result of the oil crisis, a period of family reunion followed. In the 1980s and 1990s, a new migration upturn occurred when the next generation reached marriage age and quite a high proportion chose spouses from Turkey (Crul & Vermeulen, 2003) . About 2.5 million individuals of Turkish origin (including naturalized individuals) lived in Germany in 2010, consti tuting the largest migrant group in Germany (Statistisches Bundesamt Deutschland, 2011) . They have to face serious disadvantages in the German society, especially in the labor market. For example, they are more likely to be unemployed or to work in unskilled jobs in comparison to native-borns but also in comparison to other migrant groups (Kalter, Granato, & Kristen, 2007; Kogan, 2007) . Besides these disadvantages regard ing their socioeconomic situation, several studies report that Turkish immi grants are the least integrated migrant group in Germany. For example, the share of Turkish immigrants with a good command of German is lower than in other labor migrant groups (Diehl & Schnell, 2006; Nauck, 2001) . They are also least likely to have a German person among their best friends (Diehl & Schnell, 2006) or to consider a native-born German as a marriage partner for their children (Nauck, 2001 )."}, {"section_title": "Studies on Immigrant Children's Development in Early Childhood", "text": "Several scholars have used the data of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class (ECLS-K) to investigate the academic skills of chil dren at the beginning of their educational career. The ECLS-K consists of a nationally representative sample o f kindergartners throughout the United States that also includes children of immigrants (see U.S. Department of Education, 2001). Children were administered standardized tests on reading, math, and general knowledge. An English screening test was conducted with children of a non-English language background. If children failed this screening test, the reading and knowledge assessment was not administered but the math test was also available in Spanish (see U.S. Department of Education, 2001, Table 2 -2). In addition, teachers rated children's skills and behaviors in different domains.\nUsing the ECLS-K data, Crosnoe (2007) shows that children of Mexican immigrants have lower test results in math than children of U.S.-born parents but fewer symptoms of externalizing problem behavior. A large part of these differences can be explained by the parents' socioeconomic status and the home learning environment (Crosnoe, 2007) . In the study of Magnuson et al. (2006) , all children with mothers born abroad are collapsed into one category and compared to children of U.S.-born mothers. They find that chil dren of immigrant mothers have lower levels of English proficiency and lower math scores than children of native-borns while the reading test scores are comparable in both groups. However, only children who had passed the English screening test were administered the reading test: The group of immigrant children who took the reading test is therefore selective with respect to English language skills. The differences in English and math between children of immigrants and native-borns are strongly reduced when the socioeconomic background and further demographic variables are taken into account but remain significant (Magnuson et al., 2006) . Lahaie (2008) also finds that children of immigrants have lower test scores in math than children of native-borns. In addition, she can show that this is especially true for immigrant children whose parents both speak a lan guage other than English (Lahaie, 2008) . Rumberger and Tran (2006) differ entiate between language minority and non-language minority children. They report lower reading and math test scores of language minority chil dren with children from Spanish-dominant homes being particularly disad vantaged. However, the selectivity of test taking has to be considered again. Thus, the results of the teacher ratings that included all children are of special interest: The authors show that language minority children get lower ratings with respect to literacy and math skills by their teachers com pared to children from families where only English is spoken (Rumberger & Tran, 2006) . In contrast to the results in the academic domain, they find only very small differences with respect to social skills. In addition to the previous studies, Han (2006) also distinguishes between several regions of immi grants' origin. She finds pronounced differences in children's reading and math skills between these countries of origin: Children from Latin American countries tend to have lower test results than White children of native-borns while some groups, especially from Asian countries, tend to have higher test scores (Han, 2006) .\nA few studies also compare academic skills of children of immigrants and native-borns at an earlier age. In a sample of 4-year-old preschoolers from families with low income levels, De Feyter and Winsler (2009) find that immigrant children have lower test scores than nonimmigrant children with respect to cognitive and language tests but show fewer behavioral problems. However, the authors also describe a great variety in test results of immigrant children depending on their country of origin. In the German study Educational Processes, Competence Development and Selective Decisions in Pre-and Primary School Age (German acronym: BiKS), Dubowy, Ebert, von Maurice, and Weinert (2008) find differences between children of immigrant and native-born parents in different aca demic skill domains at the age o f 3 to 4. Children of immigrants show a lower test performance in all domains of this study (verbal skills, nonverbal skills, general knowledge) with especially pronounced differences in German lan guage skills. Also at an even younger age, disadvantages of immigrant chil dren have been observed: Using the data of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), Click, Batesa, and Yabikua (2009) analyze the cognitive development of 2-year-old children by their mother's age at arrival in the United States. The shortened form of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition (BSID-II) was used in this study, which includes tasks on memory, problem solving, and lan guage (Andreassen, Fletcher, & Park, 2007) . Children of U.S.-born mothers achieve better test results than all groups of children with foreign-born mothers (Click et al., 2009) . Taking into account social and demographic family characteristics strongly reduces these differences.\nSince most children of immigrants grow up with two (or more) lan guages, the literature on bilingualism is also of relevance here. Several stud ies show that bilingual children in preschool age have advantages regarding certain cognitive aspects compared to monolingual children (for an over view, see Bialystok, 2001; Adesope, Lavin, Thompson, & Ungerleider, 2010) . For example, bilingual children have an increased attention control and metalinguistic awareness compared to monolingual children (Bialystok, 1999; Campbell & Sais, 1995) . On the other side, bilingual chil dren are usually slower in developing vocabulary and often have a smaller lexicon in each language at an early age (see Bialystok, 2001 ). Thus, the dif ference between bilingual and monolingual children depends on the con crete type of skill under consideration and children's age.\nTo sum up, several studies show that children of immigrants have, on average, lower scores in academic tests compared to children of nativeborn parents in early childhood although there is a large variety between immigrant children from different countries of origin. These differences are usually strongly (but not fully) reduced by taking into account the socio economic and demographic characteristics of the families. However, the re sults seem to differ by skill domain: The strongest disadvantages for children of immigrants appear in certain verbal tests like vocabulary tests in the lan guage of the receiving country. Only small differences or even advantages for children of immigrants are found for some cognitive tests. Finally, it should be noted that all these cited studies share the problem of a possible cultural bias of the test situation (see the methods section for a discussion on test fairness).\nMost previously presented findings about the academic skills of immi grant children are from the United States. What can be expected for children of Turkish origin in Germany? Since the socioeconomic status of Turkish im migrants in Germany is, on average, lower than that o f native-borns (Kalter et al., 2007) , lower scores in academic skill tests can also be expected. The previously cited literature suggests that this difference may be larger in the domain of language skills than in the domain of nonverbal cognitive skills.\nThese expectations are in line with results of the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) for children in Grade 4 in Germany: Kristen (2008) shows that children of Turkish immigrants have lower test re sults in reading and math than children of German-born parents. These dif ferences are strongly reduced by taking into account the socioeconomic situation of the families. In the case of the math test, they completely disap pear when the language use at home is additionally considered. However, residual differences remain with respect to reading. The relevance of the familial language environment in the study of Kristen and in other studies (Dollmann, 2010; von Below, 2007) with school-aged children in Germany also suggests that parents' acculturation may be an important explaining fac tor also for the early academic skills o f children with a Turkish migration background."}, {"section_title": "The Development o f Academic Skills by Children of Immigrants", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Bronfenbrenner's Bio-Ecological Theory of Human Development", "text": "As a theoretical framework for the development of academic skills in early childhood, we use Bronfenbrenner's (1977) bio-ecological theory of human development. Bronfenbrenner states that interactions in the immedi ate environment on a regular basis (which are termed proximal processes) affect an individual's development. However, these influences \"vary system atically as a joint function of the characteristics of the developing person; of the environment . . . ; and the nature of the developmental outcomes under consideration\" (Bronfenbrenner, 1994 (Bronfenbrenner, , p. 1644 . Bronfenbrenner further dif ferentiates the ecological environment into several environmental systems that are nested in each other. The innermost system is the \"microsystem.\" It is within the microsystem that proximal processes produce development, but Bronfenbrenner again emphasizes that \"their power to do so depends on the content and structure of the microsystem\" (Bronfenbrenner, 1994 (Bronfenbrenner, , p. 1645 .\nWe concentrate on the family as the most important microsystem for children's development in early childhood. The application of two of Bronfenbrenner's main propositions constitutes the basis for our theoretical model: (a) Children's development is affected by the familial environment. However, this influence depends on the content of the familial learning envi ronment. (b) In addition, this influence may also vary by type o f developmen tal outcome under consideration.\nNext, we will apply this basic model of the familial influence on children's academic skills development to the specific situation of immigrant families. For this endeavour, we amplify the model with two additional concepts: the accultu ration strategies of im m igrants and the society-specif icity of skills.\nImmigrant Parents' Acculturation Strategies and Their Influences on Children's Academic Skill Development Berry (1997) has introduced a schema of acculturation strategies that is widely used in the description of immigrants' inclusion into the receiving society: Immigrants may or may not engage in activities that are directed toward the inclusion into the receiving society (e.g., make friends with indi viduals of the receiving country, speak the language of the receiving coun try) and/or in ones that are directed toward the inclusion into their own ethnic group (e.g., make friends with co-ethnics, speak the language of the country of origin).\nWe want to argue that these acculturation strategies of immigrants also affect their children's academic skills development. Various studies already show that students' acculturation can influence educationally relevant out comes (Coatsworth, Maldonado-Molina, Pantin, & Szapocznik, 2005; Col\u00f3n & S\u00e1nchez, 2010) . Regarding the influence of parents' acculturation, there is especially evidence for the link between parents' language use and child ren's language proficiency (Gathercole & Thomas, 2009; Marchman, Martinez-Sussmann, & Dale, 2004; Suarez-Orozco, Suarez-Orozco, & Todorova, 2008) .\nWe follow Bronfenbrenner's argument that the content of the microsys tem influences how familial processes affect children's development of aca demic skills. Immigrant parents' major acculturation strategy probably shapes the \"cultural content\" of the learning environment at home. This in turn will have an influence on the academic skill development of their chil dren as such academic skills are situated in the cultural norms and expect ations of the receiving country.\nAt this point it has to be noted that acculturation is a multidimensional concept. Schwartz, Unger, Zamboanga, and Szapocznik (2010) differentiate between three dimensions of acculturation: practices (e.g., language use), values (e.g., individualism-collectivism), and identifications (e.g., ethnic identity). We assume that especially parents' acculturation practices are rel evant with respect to children's development of academic skills in early childhood that Schwartz et al. also term behavioral acculturation. For exam ple, if a family has only little contact to individuals from the receiving society and if the parents only speak the language of their country of origin at home, then their child will probably be more competent in the language of the country o f origin but learn the language of the receiving country later than a child whose parents have a higher extent of behavioral acculturation to the receiving country. This sort of behavioral acculturation may be strongly structured by the opportunities that are available to the families (e.g., composition of the neighborhood, social institutions, etc.).\nLastly, the influence of immigrant parents' behavioral acculturation on their children's academic skill development may also depend on the type of skill under consideration. To come back to the previous example, the development of language skills is surely affected by the parental language use while the development of nonverbal cognitive skills may be not. More general, the society-specificity o f children's academic skills may influence how much their parents' acculturation strategy affects them (see B. Becker, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "The Society-Specificity o f Skills", "text": "The concept of the society-specificity of skills goes back to a differentia tion by Gary Becker (1975) , who distinguished two sorts of human capital: Specific hum an capital means skills or competencies that are useful only in the context of a single employer (e.g., within a certain firm), whereas gen eral hum an capital is useful in all contexts (in all firms). This differentiation can also be applied to other sorts o f skills and other than work-related con texts. For our research question, we distinguish between general and society-specific skills. The concept of the society-specificity of skills has already been widely used for research questions on immigrants' situation (e.g., Chiswick, 2009; Friedberg, 2000; Kalter, 2003) . General skills are useful in various types of contexts and can be easily transferred between societies without losing their value. In contrast, society-specific skills have different values in different societies and cannot easily and completely be transferred to other societal contexts. Here, we further distinguish between skills that are specific for the receiving country (RC-specific skills) and skills that are spe cific for the country of origin or for the ethnic community, respectively (COspecific skills).\nThe concept of the society-specificity of skills has already been applied to the topic of the educational attainment of children of immigrants (Dollmann, 2010; Kristen et al., 2011) . Following Bronfenbrenner's argument that the influence of the familial learning environment on children's devel opment may vary by type of developmental outcome, we assume that the impact of immigrant parents' acculturation also depends on the societyspecificity of the skill under consideration. We expect that parents' RC-specific acculturation practices (e.g., use of the RC-language, friends from the RC) positively affect their children's development of RC-specific skills (e.g., proficiency in RC-language, knowledge about customs and traditions of the RC) while CO-specific acculturation practices positively affect child ren's CO-specific skills (e.g., proficiency in the CO-language, knowledge about customs and traditions of the CO). In contrast, we do not expect that parents' acculturation practices play a role for the development of gen eral skills. The rationale behind this expectation is that these skills are, by definition, not specific to a certain culture and should therefore not be affected by the cultural content of a learning environment. For example, reading aloud to children has positive effects on children's development regarding their cognitive skills and language skills. However, for the devel opment of nonverbal cognitive skills (a general skill), only the frequency of parental reading to the child should have an impact, but not the language of the book. In contrast, for the development of language skills (a society-specific skill), the language in which the parents read to their child should, of course, matter a lot. To sum up, we hypothesize that immigrant parents' acculturation practices influence their children's academic skill develop ment-but only in the case of society-specific skills."}, {"section_title": "Focus o f the Present Work", "text": "In this article, we analyze the development of academic skills in different domains from age 3 to 6 by children of Turkish origin and children of nativeborn German parents in Germany with a special focus on the role of immi grant parents' acculturation practices. We do not intend to test the whole the oretical model that we described in the previous sections but rather focus on specific aspects. We concentrate on the development of \"academic skills\" in early childhood that are most likely linked to later academic achievement in the educational system (Duncan et al., 2007; Feinstein, 2003) . Concretely, we analyze the development of one general skill (cognitive competency) and two RC-specific skills (active vocabulary and cultural knowledge). COspecific skills are not addressed in this article. Regarding immigrant parents' acculturation, we concentrate on the behavioral acculturation to the receiv ing society. Thus, the acculturation to the country of origin and other dimen sions of acculturation (values, identification) are not addressed. This does not mean that we think these other dimensions of acculturation or children's CO-specific skills are not important. We rather opted for this narrow focus because we expect that parental RC-specific practices are most directly linked to children's RC-specific skills, which in turn are especially relevant for later school success in the receiving country (see Kristen et al., 2011) . However, we will discuss limitations of this focus later."}, {"section_title": "Data and Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data and Sample", "text": "We use the data of the project Preschool Education and Educational Careers Among Migrant Children, which is carried out at the University of Mannheim (Germany). This is a longitudinal study that follows 3-year-old children until the beginning of elementary school with an oversampling of families with a Turkish migration background.\nIn this study, we randomly selected Turkish-origin and nonimmigrant families with a 3-to 4-year-old child from the data of resident-registration of fices in 30 cities and communities of a local region in southwest Germany.1 A letter describing the study was sent to the families (Turkish-origin families received this letter in both German and Turkish). Thereafter, interviewers contacted the families to arrange a date for the interview at their homes. A computer-assisted personal interview was conducted with the parent who spends the most time with the child (this was the mother in about 95% of the cases). Turkish-origin families were contacted by bilingual interviewers, and the parents could choose their preferred language for the interview. After the parent interview, the standardized developmental test Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) was conducted with the child (German version, see Melchers & PreuiS, 2003) Altogether, we surveyed 627 families with a Turkish migration back ground and 610 German families without migration background in the first half of the year 2007. The response rates were 69% in Turkish-origin families and 63% in nonimmigrant families. The sample is not representative for Turkish-origin or nonimmigrant families with a 3-year-old child in Germany because of the local limitation of the study. But this does not pose a problem since the study was not intended to exactly describe the skill level of children in Germany but to test general association hypotheses. One year later, the same families were contacted once more for a follow-up and in autumn/winter 2009 for a third panel wave. In all, 548 German and 500 Turkish-origin families from the original sample took part in Wave 3-Considering all families with nonmissing data in at least one of the three panel waves leaves an analysis sample of 1,211 families with an average of 2.7 observations per family (the number of cases by migration back ground and panel wave is shown in Table 1) .\nA nonresponse analysis reveals that the proportion of children of Turkish origin, children with lower educated parents, and children with lower initial test scores is higher among the cases with missing observations compared to those with complete observations. This selective attrition may lead to an over estimation of a \"catch-up process\" because especially those children who are at risk of \"underperforming\" drop out more often. However, since we formulate the research question the other way around and analyze whether differences by migration status still exist at age 6, these estimates are probably rather con servative in this sense and tend to underestimate these differences."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "For our analysis of children's academic skill development in different domains, we use the results of different subtests of the developmental test Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children.

Table 1 shows the test results of children of native-born German parents and children of Turkish origin by panel wave. In Wave 1, when the children are, on average, 42 months old, we already observe differences in test scores by migration background: Children of Turkish origin score significantly lower in all three tested domains than children of native-born German pa rents. These differences are large in the case of the RC-specific skills (German-language skills and cultural knowledge) while the difference with respect to cognitive skills (a general skill) is small. The further develop ment of these differences varies in the three domains. With regard to cogni tive skills, children of Turkish origin catch up the little disadvantage and even slightly outperform the children o f native-born German parents although the difference in this domain remains small in general. However, large differences at age 6 remain regarding language skills and cultural knowledge. So, children of Turkish origin are at a clear disadvantage with respect to RC-specific skills at the time they enter elementary school, which is not the case for general cognitive skills. Table 2 presents the results of linear growth curve models when child ren's age is centered on 36 months. Models la, lb , and lc show the initial status in children's academic skills at 36 months and their rate of growth con trolling for several child and family characteristics. The constant represents the initial skill level of German children without migration background (when all control variables are zero), and the main effect o f age represents their rate of change (skill growth per month). The significant positive main effect of the Turkish origin in the domain of cognitive skills (Model la) in dicates that children of Turkish origin have a small advantage in this domain at the age of 36 months when all the control variables are considered. In contrast, they have a disadvantage in the domains of language skills (Model lb ) and cultural knowledge (Model lc). The interaction effect between the Turkish origin and children's age represents the difference in the growth rate between children of native-born and Turkish-origin parents. It is significantly positive in the case o f language skills, meaning that Turkishorigin children progress at a faster rate-but here the initial disadvantage has also been especially large. In contrast, this interaction effect is significantly negative in the case of cultural knowledge, which points to increasing differ ences in this domain."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Models la, lb , and lc also show that children of the third generation have better test scores compared to second-generation children at age 3 regarding their German-language skills but not in the other domains. However, they make faster progress regarding their cultural knowledge than second-generation children. Furthermore, we find several significant associations of the control variables with children's skills.\nThe RC-acculturation index is added in Models 2a, 2b, and 2c. As ex pected, the RC-acculturation practices show a significant positive association with children's German language skills and their knowledge about the Western culture-even if other parental resources (like education and class position) are taken into account. In a model without these other parental re sources, the coefficient of the RC-acculturation index is even stronger (re sults not shown). Contrary to our expectations, the RC-acculturation indicator is also positively associated with children's cognitive skills. A com parison of Models lb and 2b reveals that the advantage of third-generation children regarding their German-language skills is mainly due to the higher RC-acculturation of their parents-the third-generation effect is strongly reduced in Model 2b.\nIn the next step, we center children's age on 78 months to see whether differences between children of German native-borns and Turkish origin are still present at the time the children usually start elementary school (see Table 3 ).

It is small but signifi cantly positive in the case of cognitive skills, indicating that children of Turkish immigrants have a little advantage here (Model 3a). With respect to language skills and cultural knowledge, there is a large significant nega tive main effect of the Turkish origin, demonstrating pronounced disadvan tages of the Turkish-origin children in these skill domains at the beginning of their school career. In comparison to age 3, this disadvantage is strongly reduced in the case of the language skills (Model 3b vs. Model 2b). In con trast, it has remarkably increased in the case of the cultural knowledge (Model 3c vs. Model 2c). Finally, we examine whether the effect of immigrant parents' RC-acculturation practices changes over time. Models 4a, 4b, and 4c therefore include an interaction between parents' RC-acculturation practices and children's age. This interaction effect is not significant regarding children's cognitive skills (Model 4a). For children's German-language skills and cultural knowl edge, we see different algebraic signs: In the case of language skills, the effect of parents' RC-acculturation practices decreases over time while the opposite is true in the case of cultural knowledge. These different trends are also depicted in Figure 1 . Figure 1 presents the predicted development of children's academic skills from age 36 months to age 78 months by migration background and RC-accul turation practices controlling for various family and child characteristics. With respect to children's cognitive skills, there are only minor differences between the groups: Turkish-origin children whose parents have a high level of behav ioral acculturation to the receiving country have a little advantage over the other groups. Regarding the German-language skills, the group differences are much more pronounced, especially at a very early age: Children of native-born German parents score better than children of Turkish origin. Within the group of Turkish-origin children, those children whose parents have a higher level of RC-acculturation reach better vocabulary test scores. These group differences are very large at the age of 36 months and then decline over time. However, even at the age of 78 months, considerable group differences remain. The development is quite different in the case of children's cultural knowledge. Here, all children start at a low level at the age of 36 months though the children of native-born Germans already have a slight advantage. The children of German native-borns show a clear progress over the next few years whereas the children of Turkish origin only progress at a slow rate. This is especially true for Turkish-origin children whose parents have a low level of RC-acculturation practices."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The present study on the academic skill development of children of Turkish origin and children of native-born German parents in Germany "}, {"section_title": "638", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Notes", "text": "The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support granted by the German Research Foundation (DFG) within the project Preschool Education and Educational Careers Among Migrant Children.\nxAn initial differentiation between Turkish-origin and nonimmigrant families was done on the basis o f children's citizenship and the screening o f the children's and their parents' full names by Turkish native speakers in order to detect naturalized Turkishorigin families.
