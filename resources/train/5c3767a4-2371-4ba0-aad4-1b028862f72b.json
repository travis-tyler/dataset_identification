Multiple studies link indices of poor sleep to cognitive impairment and decline [1] , and more recent studies link sleep disturbance to AD biomarkers. We showed in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) that reports of shorter sleep duration and poorer sleep quality were associated with greater \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) deposition measured by positron emission tomography (PET) scans, an average of less than 2 years later [2] . Another study linked poorer actigraphic sleep efficiency and greater sleep fragmentation, and reports of frequent napping, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of A\u03b2 deposition [3] . Recently, a single night of total sleep deprivation increased PET measures of A\u03b2 in a study of healthy humans [4] , although in another study, partial sleep deprivation over five nights produced no measurable effect on CSF-derived AD biomarkers [5] . Furthermore, numerous studies link sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) to poor cognitive outcomes, and recent studies tie SDB to AD biomarkers [6, 7] .\nExcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is common among older people. Commonly a manifestation of SDB, EDS can also result from medication side effects and interactions, mood disorders, narcolepsy, insufficient sleep, and circadian rhythm alterations [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Like SDB, EDS has been tied to poor cognitive outcomes and identified as a possible marker of AD [13] [14] [15] [16] . Reports of greater sleepiness on the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale [17] were recently linked to greater A\u03b2 deposition in several brain regions on [ 11 C] Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET scans [18] , although this association was not replicated using CSF A\u03b2 measures [19] . In addition, a 2018 study tied reports of EDS on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale [20] to subsequent increases in A\u03b2 burden within particular brain regions [21] .\nNapping is a common behavior among older people and has been linked to both benefits to and decrements in cognitive performance [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Much less is known about the association of napping and A\u03b2 deposition, although studies have reported associations of self-reported napping with greater amyloid burden measured by CSF [3] and PiB PET scans [18] .\nWhereas prior studies have measured EDS or napping in temporal proximity to measures of amyloid burden (i.e. an average of less than 1.5 years apart) [3, 18, 19] or assessed EDSrelated change in A\u03b2 burden over a brief period (i.e. an average of 2.2 years) [21] , little is known about their association with temporally distal measures of AD pathology. We investigated the association of self-reported EDS and napping with A\u03b2 deposition, an average of 15.7 years later in community-dwelling older adults."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "We studied Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging Neuroimaging Study (BLSA-NI) participants.

Neuroimaging assessments began in the BLSA on February 10, 1994 and are ongoing. PIB PET scans began on June 9, 2005. We studied 124 BLSA-NI participants with self-report measures of EDS (n = 123; one participant had missing EDS data) or napping (n = 123; a different participant was missing napping data) and PiB PET scan data who were cognitively normal at sleepiness and napping assessment.

A diffeomorphic registration approach was used to compute a study-specific template from baseline 3-T MPRAGE images for the whole BLSA PiB sample [30] . We generated 1.5-T MPRAGE and 1.5-T SPGR templates based on the 3-T template with a patch-based image synthesis procedure [31] and used FreeSurfer (version 5.1, http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) to segment the 3-T MPRAGE image template [32] . We registered the corresponding MRI template to each participant's MRI with diffeomorphic registration [33] and transformed the FreeSurfer segmentation onto the PET scans. We calculated distribution volume ratio (DVR) images in native PET space with a simplified reference tissue model; cerebellar gray matter served as the reference region [34] .\nOur analysis focused on the mean cortical DVR (cDVR), an index of global amyloid deposition, defined as the mean of DVRs for the following cortical regions: frontal, cingulate, lateral temporal, parietal (including the precuneus), and lateral occipital; the sensorimotor strip was excluded.

At the same time that they provided data on sleepiness and napping, participants were asked \"Do you snore often and loudly?\", with response options of \"yes\" and \"no.\" A neuropsychological battery and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale [36] were administered at each visit for PiB PET participants. Clinical and neuropsychological data were reviewed at a consensus case conference if participants had \u22654 errors on the Blessed Information Concentration Test [37] or a score of \u22650.5 on the CDR.

Based on the distribution of napping frequency in the sample, we defined participants reporting napping rarely or never as non-nappers, and those napping 1-2 times per week or more as nappers (Supplementary Table 1 ). To determine the association of EDS and napping with subsequent amyloid deposition, we performed unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression analyses with either EDS or napping as the primary predictor and amyloid deposition (A\u03b2+ vs. A\u03b2\u2212) as the outcome.

PiB imaging occurred 15.7 \u00b1 3.4 (range 6.9 to 24.6) years later (i.e. at follow-up), when participants were aged 75.8 \u00b1 8.2 (range 55.7 to 93.4) years. Overall, 50.8% were women and 21.8% were non-White. They had 16.7 \u00b1 2.2 years of education and a BMI of 26.8 \u00b1 3.7. Approximately 24% had EDS and 29% were nappers. There was no association between EDS and napping (Fisher's exact p = 0.24; Supplementary Table 2) . A total of 43 participants (34.7%) were A\u03b2+ on PiB scans. Compared with those without EDS, those with EDS were older, and compared with non-nappers, nappers were older, more likely to be male, and had slightly more education. At the time of PiB imaging, six participants (4.8%) had cognitive impairment based on consensus diagnosis; three had MCI, two had AD dementia, and one was thought to have Lewy Body dementia.\nParticipants with EDS were more likely to be A\u03b2+ at followup (56.7%) than those without EDS (28.0%; chi-square p = 0.004). In unadjusted analyses, participants with EDS had more than three times the odds of being A\u03b2+ at follow-up, compared to Similarly, participants who napped were more likely to be A\u03b2+ at follow-up (45.7%), compared with non-nappers (29.6%), but this was at the trend level (chi-square p = 0.088).

This effect decreased and was nonsignificant after adjustment (OR = 1.86, 95% CI: 0.73, 4.75, p = 0.194).\nWe also examined the association between self-report of snoring at baseline (yes vs. no) and subsequent A\u03b2 status.

When we added ApoE \u03b54 to the adjusted model, this association decreased to the trend level of significance, but this may be because the \u03b54 allele promotes EDS or sleep disturbances that cause it (e.g. SDB) [42] . We also observed a trend-level association between napping and subsequent A\u03b2 status in unadjusted analyses. Thus, among cognitively normal older adults, EDS may be an important marker of risk for subsequent A\u03b2 deposition.\nOur findings are consistent with a prior study, in which higher scores on the Somnolence composite of the MOS Sleep Scale-which consists of items about daytime drowsiness/ sleepiness, difficulty staying awake, and taking napswere associated with greater A\u03b2 deposition on PiB PET across numerous brain regions in older adults without dementia [18] . In that study, there was an average of 0.69 \u00b1 0.98 years between sleep assessment and PET scans. A more recent study in cognitively normal persons showed that baseline EDS, measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, was associated with greater subsequent increases in A\u03b2 on PiB PET over an average of 2.2 years [21] . In the present study, sleepiness and napping data collection preceded PET scans by 15.7 \u00b1 3.4 years (minimum = 6.9, maximum = 24.6), indicating that EDS in cognitively normal older adults is associated with amyloid deposition at least 7 years, and perhaps more than a decade or two later. In contrast to other studies [3, 18] , we found no significant association between reports of napping and A\u03b2 status.\nOur results prompt at least four interpretations. First, EDS at baseline may have resulted directly from disturbed sleep that itself promotes A\u03b2 deposition ( Figure 1A ). As described above, SDB and shorter or poorer-quality sleep can promote EDS and have been linked to markers of AD pathology [2, 3, 6, 7] . Under this scenario, assessment of EDS could help identify persons at elevated AD risk. This would be important not only for prognosis, but also because treating causes of EDS could help prevent A\u03b2 deposition. Importantly, this interpretation assumes that our participants were free of A\u03b2 at EDS assessment. Although targeting sleep disorders has not yet been shown to reduce AD risk in humans, animal studies demonstrate that sleep deprivation increases A\u03b2 deposition [43, 44] , and link hypoxia-an important consequence of SDB-to A\u03b2 production [45] [46] [47] , providing support for this approach to AD prevention. The normal cognitive status of participants at baseline and the significant temporal separation of baseline EDS and napping measures from A\u03b2 status at follow-up enhance the plausibility of EDS occurring prior to amyloid deposition in our sample. Given the mean age at EDS assessment (60.1 years), a number of our PiB-positive participants were probably PiB-negative at that time. However, we cannot state this definitively without a baseline measure of A\u03b2.\nAlthough unlikely, given participants' mean age at our study baseline, the second interpretation is that baseline EDS resulted indirectly from A\u03b2 deposition. Indeed, A\u03b2 aggregation has been shown to disrupt sleep/wake patterns in an AD mouse model, and active immunization with A\u03b242 prevented both A\u03b2 deposition and sleep/wake disturbance in this model organism [48] . Thus, A\u03b2 deposition may promote EDS by limiting sleep duration or quality ( Figure 1B) . Furthermore, baseline A\u03b2 burden may have promoted SDB in our sample by affecting respiratory control, resulting in EDS. Although there are elevated rates of SDB in persons with AD, perhaps in part due to A\u03b2 deposition [49] , little is known about the effect of preclinical A\u03b2 deposition on respiration during sleep. In persons with EDS resulting from A\u03b2 deposition-related sleep alterations, a clinical sleep evaluation including polysomnography could identify existing specific sleep disturbances. As in the first interpretation, this could have prognostic utility and identify a need for therapies to improve sleep. The current consensus is that a feed-forward system exists in which disturbed sleep increases A\u03b2 deposition, which disturbs sleep, etc. [50] . Although there is not yet evidence that Overall N = 124; one participant was missing EDS data and another napping data, yielding n = 123 for each regression model. interrupting this cycle by treating disturbed sleep resulting from A\u03b2 deposition slows AD progression, this is an important area for investigation. The third possibility is that, rather than being a marker of risk for A\u03b2 deposition, EDS actually promotes A\u03b2 aggregation ( Figure 1C ). However, no pathway has been identified by which EDS itself might increase A\u03b2 aggregation, making this a less plausible explanation. The fourth possibility is that alterations in circadian rhythms may have played a role in all of the above scenarios. Circadian rest/activity rhythm alterations have been tied to an increased risk of MCI or dementia diagnosis [51] and preclinical amyloid deposition [52] in humans, and in an AD mouse model, deletion of the Bmal1 circadian clock gene disturbed A\u03b2 dynamics, increased ApoE expression, and promoted development of A\u03b2 plaques [53] . Because circadian alterations can manifest as sleepiness or napping, changes in circadian rhythms may have driven some of our results. Several other factors, including medications, psychopathology, narcolepsy, and insufficient sleep can result in EDS, as mentioned above. If they are also found to promote A\u03b2 deposition, targeting them directly may help prevent AD in addition to relieving EDS and enhancing daytime function. This study's primary strengths are its large sample of cognitively normal adults with PiB PET data, and the substantial interval between EDS and napping assessment and subsequent PiB imaging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study with these characteristics. Its primary limitations are its observational design and the absence of a baseline A\u03b2 measure, which limit us from drawing firm causal inferences. Another important limitation is that EDS and napping were measured at only one time point, and we did not capture trajectories of sleepiness or napping over the roughly 15 years between measurement of predictors and our outcome. In addition, our napping measure did not capture nap duration, which may affect observed associations. Finally, our assessment of EDS was limited to a single item with a yes/no response format. A validated self-report measure of EDS, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, or an objective measure of sleepiness, such as the multiple sleep latency test, would have been preferable. On the other hand, nondifferential misclassification of exposure (EDS), in which participants are as likely to misclassify themselves regardless of their subsequent disease (A\u03b2) status, would have biased results toward the null. Because systematic misclassification of EDS status based on A\u03b2 status is unlikely in a cognitively normal sample, the true association between EDS and A\u03b2 deposition is probably stronger than our results indicated. Actigraphy would be helpful to estimate napping (and rest/activity rhythms) in future studies, with sleep diaries to assess whether naps were intentional or, as in EDS, unintentional. Taken together, future observational studies with repeated objective measures of EDS and napping, baseline and follow-up measures of AD biomarkers, and further experimental human and animal research are needed to clarify the nature of the association of EDS and napping with A\u03b2 deposition and related AD biomarkers. Studies that include polysomnography or screen participants for SDB would help identify the role of SDB in the observed associations.\nIn conclusion, our findings provide further support for the literature on sleep disturbance as a risk factor for AD. They suggest that EDS-a common clinical phenomenon frequently resulting from disturbed sleep-identifies those with more than double the odds of A\u03b2+ status derived an average of ~16 years later. That EDS was measured with a single yes/no question in our study demonstrates the ease with which this risk might be assessed in a routine clinical encounter. Screening for EDS could help identify those at elevated AD risk, and further support for a causal role of sleep disturbance would recommend that sleep-related interventions be included in AD prevention efforts."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Material", "text": "Supplementary material is available at SLEEP online."}]
