[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "for the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 27 Memory impairment is the cardinal early feature of Alzheimer's disease, a highly prevalent disorder whose causes remain only partially understood. To identify novel genetic predictors, we used an integrative genomics approach to perform the largest study to date of human memory (n = 14 781). Using a genome-wide screen, we discovered a novel association of a polymorphism in the pro-apoptotic gene FASTKD2 (fas-activated serine/threonine kinase domains 2; rs7594645-G) with better memory performance and replicated this finding in independent samples. Consistent with a neuroprotective effect, rs7594645-G carriers exhibited increased hippocampal volume and gray matter density and decreased cerebrospinal fluid levels of apoptotic mediators. The MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) gene and pathways related to endocytosis, cholinergic neurotransmission, epidermal growth factor receptor signaling and immune regulation, among others, also displayed association with memory.

Impairment in episodic memory-involving the encoding and conscious recollection of experiences-is an early hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia. 1 Declines in episodic and other memory domains are also found in normal cognitive aging and many age-related disorders, including Parkinson's disease, diabetes and cancer. 2 With the rising incidence and burdens of dementia, a better understanding of its causes is crucial for risk stratification and the development of memory-sparing lifestyle and drug therapies. 3, 4 At present, the molecular mechanisms underlying memory performance are not fully understood. Epidemiological studies have linked many factors to memory, including the presence of vascular and metabolic disease, mental and physical activity and educational and occupational attainment. 5, 6 Episodic memory is estimated to have substantial heritability (30-60%) based on twin studies and is thought to be influenced by common and rare genetic variation in multiple pathways. 6 Although genetic studies have implicated numerous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in episodic memory performance, 7 significant heritability remains unexplained.\nRecently, there has been great interest in harnessing the power of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to gain additional mechanistic insight into complex neurological traits and diseases. 8 Extant approaches for maximizing the translational impact of GWAS findings include using large samples with adequate statistical power for discovery, 6 performing complementary analyses to detect broader trends of association within genes and pathways 9 and assessing for convergence of genetic associations across phenotypic modalities to understand their biological context. 10, 11 Here we integrated GWAS with molecular and neuroimaging data to identify and characterize novel predictors of episodic memory function in older adults."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study participants", "text": "Launched in 1992, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a nationally representative longitudinal study of 426 000 Americans aged 450 years. 12 Biennial interviews were used to collect detailed information on the health, social and economic status of participants.\nThe AddNeuroMed Consortium, 13 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), 14 Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS), 15 Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) 16 and Religious Orders Study (ROS) 17 include older adults representing clinical stages along the continuum from normal aging to AD who received longitudinal clinical evaluations.

The genomic inflation factor (\u03bb) was 1.007, indicating no substantial inflation of association (Supplementary Figure S2) .\nA genome-wide significant association with immediate recall was identified on chromosome 2 for rs7594645 (P = 3.11 \u00d7 10 \u2212 9 ; Figure 1 ). This SNP resides in an intron of FASTKD2 that is overlapped by MIR3130-1 and MIR3130-2 ( Figure 2a) . The rs7594645-G allele exhibited a modest additive effect associated with better episodic memory performance and explained an additional 0.5% of the phenotypic variance (Figure 2b ).\nSuggestive associations with immediate recall (P o5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 6 ) were also identified ( Figure 1 ; Supplementary Table S1 ). These included SNPs near FASTKD2 within DYTN (dystrotelin) as well as SNPs on additional chromosomes within LRRC38 (leucine-rich repeat containing 38), SRC (v-Src tyrosine kinase) and APOL2 (apolipoprotein L2). We also observed nominal associations with immediate recall (P o 0.05) for 14 of 25 memory-and AD-related candidate genes identified through literature review Table S2 ). These genes included BCHE (butyrylcholinesterase), BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), CR1 (complement receptor 1) and TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2), among others. Significant association after Bonferroni correction for 25 genes (P o 0.002) was observed for three of these genes, CAMTA1 (calmodulin binding transcription activator 1), DISC1 (disrupted in schizophrenia 1) and WWC1 (WW and C2 domain containing 1; also known as KIBRA).\nBecause of its well-known association with AD, 39 we further investigated the effect of the APOE \u03b54 allele in the GWAS sample. As the SNPs characterizing APOE \u03b54 (rs429358, rs7412) failed initial genotyping quality control, to perform additional analyses we imputed these SNPs in non-Hispanic Caucasian participants (n = 5288). We did not observe an association of APOE \u03b54 with immediate (P = 0.904) or delayed (P = 0.466) recall in this sample. However, APOE \u03b54 was associated with increased odds of selfreported diagnosis of AD by a doctor (P = 5.96 \u00d7 10\n, odds ratio 5.59, 95% confidence interval 3.50-8.91) among participants reevaluated 14 years later (n = 4491).\nGene-and pathway-based analyses of episodic memory To extend the GWAS findings, we performed complementary analyses at the gene and pathway levels. Using HYST to calculate summary gene-based P-values, we identified additional genomewide significant associations with episodic memory based on a Bonferroni correction for 23 672 genes (P o2.11 \u00d7 10 \u2212 6 ; Supplementary Table S3) . Top genome-wide significant associations included the genes LARS2 (leucyl-tRNA synthetase 2, mitochondrial; P = 5.56 \u00d7 10 \u2212 11 ) and MTOR (P = 2.50x10\n), which along with FASTKD2 40 encode proteins with critical roles in mitochondrial function. 41, 42 Numerous pathways exhibited enrichment of association (false discovery rate-corrected Po 0.05) with episodic memory performance (Table 2 ). These included multiple mechanisms related to immune regulation and cell adhesion as well as pathways related to cholinergic neurotransmission, endocytosis and epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB1) signaling, among others.\nReplication of FASTKD2 association with episodic memory For replication of our major SNP-based genome-wide significant finding, we analyzed independent samples from the HRS, AddNeuroMed, ADNI, IMAS, MAP and ROS cohorts. Because of heterogeneity of memory instruments and clinical populations, we initially analyzed within cohorts and then performed a replication meta-analysis involving 7761 participants that validated the association of rs7594645-G with higher immediate recall (P = 0.013; Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary Figure  S3) . In all the replication cohorts except ROS, rs7594645-G exhibited a positive direction of effect on episodic memory performance consistent with the discovery sample. The heterogeneity statistic (I 2 ) P-value was 0.71, indicating no significant heterogeneity across the replication studies. 43 Overall, a summary meta-analysis of rs7594645-G across the discovery and replication samples combined displayed a genome-wide significant association (P = 3.73 \u00d7 10 \u2212 9 , total n = 14 466)."}, {"section_title": "Association of rs7594645 with FASTKD2 mRNA expression", "text": "We assessed the functional impact of rs7594645 on FASTKD2 mRNA expression using two expression quantitative locus (eQTL) databases.

We observed that rs10490541-T was associated with decreased FASTKD2 mRNA expression in skin cells (P = 0.035), controlling for participant age, experimental batch and sample processing. 45 Using GeneNetwork, 46 we next analyzed published brain eQTL data for 187 healthy older adults. 47, 48 In this analysis, we identified a SNP (rs4578841) in strong LD with rs7594645 (D' = 1, r 2 = 0.13) that displayed significant association with neocortical FASTKD2 expression (P = 9.16 \u00d7 10 \u2212 4 ). Association of rs7594645 with CSF levels of pro-apoptotic factors FASTKD2 encodes a pro-apoptotic protein that is predominantly localized to mitochondria. 40, 49 Given the association of rs7594645-G with higher memory performance and lower FASTKD2 mRNA expression, we hypothesized that rs7594645-G would also be associated with decreased activation of apoptosis in the central nervous system. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed CSF levels of four proteins involved in fas-mediated apoptosis in 82 healthy control participants from ADNI (Supplementary Figure S4) . Controlling for age and gender, rs7594645-G carriers displayed decreased CSF levels of adiponectin (P = 5.85 \u00d7 10\n) and fas ligand (P = 0.012) and trended toward decreased levels of TNFR2 (P = 0.057) and TRAIL-R3 (P = 0.083), with a significant multivariate effect of genotype (P = 1.07 \u00d7 10 \u2212 4 ).\nAssociation of FASTKD2 with hippocampal structure Given the association of rs7594645-G with higher memory performance and the evidence of a functional molecular effect of this SNP, we hypothesized that FASTKD2 would also be associated with structural changes in episodic memory-related brain regions.

Signaling through its upstream activator and death receptor, fas/CD95 is known to mediate neuronal responses to traumatic brain injury 50 and may have roles in neurodegeneration related to amyloid-\u03b2, 51 methamphetamines 52 and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. 53 Rare FASTKD2 mutations have also been linked to infantile encephalopathy associated with electron transport chain complex IV deficiency, suggesting a possible secondary role in cellular energetics."}, {"section_title": "40", "text": "rs7594645 is an intronic variant in FASTKD2 that exhibited an effect size comparable to most SNP associations for complex behavioral traits. 54 There is substantial precedent for non-coding intronic or intergenic variants to exert functional effects through regulation of chromatin structure, transcription factor binding and splicing component recognition, among other mechanisms. [55] [56] [57] In addition, GWAS-implicated SNPs with modest effect sizes have highlighted druggable targets for type 2 diabetes, cancer and other diseases, demonstrating the potential biological importance of replicable and convergent associations. 57, 58 rs7594645 is located in a gene-dense region with extensive LD structure (Supplementary Figure S5) . In particular, rs7594645 is overlapped by two genes encoding microRNA molecules. MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that base pair with complementary sequences in protein-coding mRNAs to direct their degradation or translational repression. 59 The location of rs7594645 suggests that allelic variation in this region may regulate FASTKD2 expression through altering mRNA-microRNA interactions. Based on the UCSC Genome Browser, rs7594645 is also 3 base pairs downstream from a binding sequence for CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor), a highly conserved transcription factor required for neuronal development and synapse formation. 60 Genetic variation at rs7594645 or a nearby tagging SNP may alter CTCF-mediated transcriptional regulation of FASTKD2 to impact neuronal viability. Molecular characterization in brain tissue, cell cultures and animal models will be important to assess and clarify these hypothesized mechanisms and the broader functional architecture around FASTKD2 and its neighboring genes DYTN, MDH1B and MIR3130-1 and -2.\nBased on the Human Brain Transcriptome, a database of genome-wide transcriptome data from postmortem human brains, FASTKD2 is highly expressed in the hippocampus throughout adulthood. 61 Behavioral, imaging, and pathological studies have revealed the hippocampus to be crucial for episodic memory storage and retrieval. 62 We identified a protective effect of rs7594645-G on hippocampal volume and gray matter density in older adults. Consistent with an anti-apoptotic, neuroprotective effect, we also identified an association of rs7594645-G with decreased FASTKD2 mRNA expression and decreased CSF levels of proteins involved in apoptosis. These convergent findings at the molecular and neural system levels further support the observed effect of rs7594645-G on memory function and suggest that modulation of FASTKD2 and its functional pathways may be candidates for nootropic and/or neuroprotective drug development.\nThe overall allelic frequency of rs7594645-G in the discovery sample was 0.072. Among non-Hispanic Caucasian participants, which comprised 79% of this sample, the frequency of rs7594645-G was 0.064. Although rs7594645-G was relatively more common in African-American participants (minor allele frequency = 0.139), this difference did not appear to exhibit a confounding effect on the association of rs7594645 with episodic memory performance (Supplementary Table S5 ). In the replication samples, rs7594645-G exhibited an overall frequency of 0.068 and displayed a positive effect on episodic memory performance in all cohorts except ROS. Greater levels of education, among other potential differences, may have modified the effect of rs7594645-G on episodic memory performance in the ROS sample.\nNominal associations for several memory-and AD-related candidate genes were observed in the discovery sample, including WWC1, 63 DISC1 64 and the neurotransmission-or neurotrophicrelated genes BCHE, 28 BDNF 65 and CAMTA1. 66 Although in the discovery sample the APOE \u03b54 allele was associated with increased odds of self-reported diagnosis of AD by a doctor, no SNPs in APOE were associated with immediate recall. The APOE \u03b54 allele is the strongest known genetic risk factor for sporadic AD, 39 but its relationship to non-pathological cognitive aging is less clear. 67, 68 Alternative study designs might have detected effects of APOE on cognition, including cross-sectional analyses of older samples or other cognitive domains as well as longitudinal analyses to identify relative declines within individuals over time. 67, 69 Gene-and pathway-based analyses provide additional vehicles for characterizing complex genetic architectures, as variants of modest individual effect can collectively influence susceptibility through action within shared mechanisms.\n9,70,71 Through a genebased approach accounting for effects of multiple SNPs, we identified genome-wide significant associations of LARS2 and MTOR with episodic memory that were otherwise concealed through standard SNP-based analysis. Mutations in LARS2 have been implicated in Perrault Syndrome, a rare disease characterized by hearing loss and premature ovarian failure and proposed to be mediated by mitochondrial and apoptotic dysfunction. 42 The MTOR gene represents a major drug target for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders due to well-studied roles in amyloid and tau pathology. 72, 73 We also observed enrichment of association with episodic memory within the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway, which has been proposed as a target for treating amyloid-induced memory loss, 74 as well as other mechanisms related to cholinergic neurotransmission, endocytosis and the immune response. 75, 76 Although this represents the largest known GWAS of memory performance in older adults, with a bigger sample the suggestive loci we highlighted might have reached genome-wide significance. These included DYTN, which encodes a member of a protein family associated with schizophrenia and cognitive aging, 7 and APOL2, which functions with APOE in lipid pathways. 77 In addition, although the confirmatory and novel findings from this study validate its analytical design, alternative assessments of memory performance and clinical status might have yielded more sensitive phenotypic measures for GWAS.\nFuture extensions of this work using next-generation sequencing and related methods may reveal other associations with episodic memory, as novel SNPs, rare, structural and epigenetic variants and dynamic molecular changes in the transcriptome may all have a role in memory. 78 Studies of longitudinal change in episodic memory functioning may also elucidate additional mechanistic influences. Further, although it was beyond the scope of this study, characterizing gene-environment interactions will likely guide the optimized application of drug and lifestyle modifiers to preserve or enhance episodic memory.\nIn conclusion, this study discovered and validated a novel association of FASTKD2 with episodic memory function and hippocampal structure. Overall, these new findings identify potential targets to help improve risk stratification and therapeutic development in normal cognitive aging and dementia."}, {"section_title": "CONFLICT OF INTEREST", "text": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "The HRS is sponsored by the National Institute on Aging (grants U01AG009740, RC2AG036495 and RC4AG039029) and is conducted by the University of Michigan.
