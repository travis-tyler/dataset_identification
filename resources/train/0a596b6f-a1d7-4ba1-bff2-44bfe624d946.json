[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene are some of the most studied in relation to skeletal muscle traits and significant associations have been observed by multiple groups. One such paper by our group provided the first evidence of a genetic association with sarcopenia in men, but that finding has yet to be replicated in an independent cohort. In the present study, we examined multiple VDR polymorphisms in relation to skeletal muscle traits and sarcopenia in 864 men and women across the adult age span. In addition to VDR genotypes and haplotypes, measurements of skeletal muscle strength and fat-free mass (FFM) were determined in all subjects and a measure of sarcopenia was calculated. We observed significant associations between Fok1 and Bsm1 genotypes and skeletal muscle strength in men and women, though these associations were modest and no significant associations were observed for these polymorphisms and muscle mass traits nor for Bsm1-Taq1 haplotype with muscle strength. Fok1 FF genotype was associated with an increased the risk of sarcopenia in older women compared to f-allele carriers (1.3-fold higher risk). These results support previous findings that VDR genetic variation appears to impact skeletal muscle strength and risk for sarcopenia but the influence is modest."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Despite being considered a consequence of old age, sarcopenia has been reported in community-dwelling men and women below the age of 50 years [1] [2] [3] [4] , and nearly one in ten women aged 34-58 years (mid-life) has sarcopenia associated with compromised physical functioning [5] . Such variability in the losses of skeletal muscle mass and strength indicates a susceptibility for sarcopenia in some individuals. Variation in skeletal muscle traits among individuals can be attributed to environmental factors, genetic factors, or the interaction of both. Multiple investigations have shown that skeletal muscle strength and mass are highly heritable traits, indicating a strong genetic contribution [6] [7] [8] [9] . Despite this high heritability, few genes have been conclusively identified as contributing to skeletal muscle mass or strength [10] , and very few studies have examined sarcopenia in particular [10] [11] [12] [13] .\nThe vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) is among the targets of interest in explaining inter-individual differences in skeletal muscle traits and was one of the first to be studied in this context [14] . The receptor is expressed in skeletal muscle and vitamin D is required for skeletal muscle development [15, 16] . Vitamin D receptor levels are lower in skeletal muscles of older compared to younger individuals independent of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels [17] and low vitamin D levels have been associated with low muscle strength and muscle mass measures [18] . The VDR gene & Stephen M. Roth sroth1@umd.edu has multiple polymorphisms (e.g., FokI, BsmI, and TaqI) that have been examined in relation to skeletal muscle traits. The FokI polymorphism affects the translational start site of VDR [19, 20] . The BsmI and TaqI variants are in linkage disequilibrium [21] and significant haplotype associations with skeletal muscle strength have been observed [22] . Though some inconsistencies have been noted [23] [24] [25] , multiple papers have reported higher skeletal muscle strength and mass values in VDR FokI f/f compared to F/F genotype carriers [13, 22, 26] , with a twofold higher risk for sarcopenia in F/F genotype men in previous work from our lab [13] . Findings for the BsmI site are less consistent [26, 27] but both Barr et al. [28] and Onder [29] have reported a higher risk of falls in BB genotype compared to b-allele carriers. In a recent paper, Tan and colleagues [10] report the need to validate/replicate the genetic variants underlying sarcopenia in large human cohorts and state that further progress in understanding the genetic etiology of sarcopenia will provide valuable insights into important fundamental biological mechanisms underlying muscle physiology that will lead to improved ability to recognize individuals at risk for developing sarcopenia and our ability to treat this debilitating condition. In the present study, we sought to provide clarity on the existing literature on VDR genotypes and skeletal muscle traits and sarcopenia in particular by performing an extensive replication analysis in over 800 men and women. Furthermore, in addition to examining the VDR FokI polymorphism we extended our analyses to include the BsmI-TaqI haplotype."}, {"section_title": "Methods Subjects", "text": "The subjects, 489 men and 375 women aged 22-90 years, included in this study were investigated as part of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), an ongoing NIA-funded investigation of normal aging recruited primarily from population-based listings [30] .

Though we observed some significant associations between specific VDR polymorphisms and both skeletal muscle traits and sarcopenia, the data indicate a generally modest contribution of this gene with sarcopenia risk. When examined in relation to the existing literature on VDR genotype and skeletal muscle, the findings argue for continued study of the underlying biology but provide some uncertainty about the likely clinical significance of genotype testing currently in relation to predictive risk for sarcopenia.\nSubstantial evidence points to the importance of vitamin D in maintaining skeletal muscle structure. With advancing age, vitamin D appears to maintain the function of type II fibers, which contributes to preserving muscle strength and may reduce the risk of falls [15, 16] . Vitamin D supplementation appears important for restoring muscle strength and function in those with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, though any benefits in otherwise healthy elderly are uncertain [39] . VDR genotypes were some of the first to be examined in relation to skeletal muscle traits beginning in the 1990s, though inconsistencies have been observed likely owing to sample size and incomplete analysis of the several polymorphisms in the VDR gene. Initial studies focused on the BsmI polymorphism. While Geusens et al. [14] first reported higher quadriceps and grip strength in BsmI b/b compared to B/B genotype carriers, Grundberg and colleagues [40] and Wang et al. [41] found higher strength in B/B compared to b/b carriers. Subsequent studies identified the importance of VDR haplotype, encompassing the BsmI, ApaI, and/or TaqI polymorphisms [21] . For example, Windelinckx and coworkers [22] reported that BsmI/TaqI Bt/Bt haplotype homozygotes exhibited greater strength than bT haplotype carriers. Van Pottelbergh et al. [42] reported associations between TaqI/ ApaI haplotypes and lean mass in older men, with the highest lean mass observed in the At-At haplotype group. This relationship was not observed, however, in a group of younger men. In the present study, we found that BB genotype carriers exhibited lower quadriceps strength compared to b-allele carriers in both men and women, though no differences in FFM were noted. But in combination with the Taq1 polymorphism as a Bsm1-Taq1 haplotype, no associations were observed in females in the present study and no significant differences remained in men after accounting for differences in age across haplotype groups. In total, these findings point to a small contribution of this VDR haplotype to skeletal muscle traits that may not be clinically relevant.\nThe other polymorphism of focus in VDR is the FokI polymorphism, which is known to affect the translational start site of the gene [19, 20] thus making it a potentially functional polymorphism, though it is not in linkage disequilibrium with the BsmI or TaqI polymorphisms. In our previous work, we observed higher knee extensor strength in FokI f/f carriers compared to F/F carriers, but this difference was fully accounted for by higher FFM in the f/f carriers [13] . It was that same study that identified the significant association with sarcopenia, the risk for which was twofold higher in F/F genotype men. Similarly in the present study, the odds of sarcopenia were significantly, if moderately, higher in F/F women compared to f-allele carriers. Though no significant differences in sarcopenia risk were observed in men in the present study, men f-allele carriers exhibited significantly higher quadriceps strength compared to FF genotype carriers. Both Windelinckx et al. [22] and Hopkinson et al. [26] have also reported higher strength levels in FokI f/f compared to F/F genotype carriers. Thus, several studies have now provided evidence that the FokI polymorphism in VDR is associated with skeletal muscle traits, with the F-allele appearing to be a risk allele for reduced muscle strength and sarcopenia.\nThe present study is not without limitations. We were not able to address VDR genotype interactions with vitamin D levels in the present analysis, though this has recently been shown to be important in prostate cancer [43, 44] . Though the sample size was large in comparison to most gene association studies for skeletal muscle traits, much larger studies are common when investigating the genetics of other complex traits. Importantly, the present study replicates previous findings in an independent cohort and such replication is considered a gold standard for determining when a gene is important for a trait, especially for genes of generally weak influence [45] .\nThe present study extends the existing literature in this area by providing additional support for a modest role for VDR genotypes in altering skeletal muscle traits and sarcopenia risk. Such replication analyses are critical for identifying polymorphisms with potential clinical significance in genomic or personalized medicine. That said, the existing literature shows considerable variability in results owing to an incomplete understanding of the various interacting factors that influence the VDR genotype and skeletal muscle relationship. Future clinical studies should examine the interaction of vitamin D levels, which are known to contribute independently to muscle strength and function, with VDR genotype to determine the clinical importance of genetic screening of VDR polymorphisms as part of age-related skeletal muscle interventions."}]
