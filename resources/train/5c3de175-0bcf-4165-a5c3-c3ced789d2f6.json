The population-based prevalence and outcomes of amyloid positivity in a population without dementia are important for understanding the trajectory of amyloid positivity to clinically significant outcomes and for designing AD prevention trials.\nOBJECTIVE To determine prevalence and outcomes of amyloid positivity in a population without dementia.\nIn the prospective, population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging in Olmsted County, Minnesota, participants without dementia were randomly selected from the county population and were clinically and cognitively evaluated at baseline and every 15 months from August 1, 2008, to September 18, 2018. They were also invited to undergo carbon 11 -Pittburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.\nEXPOSURES Amyloid positivity (defined as a standardized uptake value ratio >1.42 on PET).\nPrevalence of amyloid positivity in the Olmsted County population without dementia and risk of progression from no cognitive impairment (ie, normal cognition for age) to incident amnestic MCI (aMCI) and from MCI or aMCI to incident AD dementia.\nOf 3894 participants, 1671 underwent PET imaging and were included in the study; 2198 did not undergo imaging, and 25 were excluded for other reasons. The mean (SD) age of participants was 71.3 (9.8) years; 892 (53.4%) were men, and 179 (10.7%) had prevalent MCI. The prevalence of amyloid positivity without cognitive impairment in the population without dementia increased from 2.7% (95% CI, 0.5% to 4.9%) in persons aged 50 to 59 years to 41.3% (95% CI, 33.4% to 49.2%) in those aged 80 to 89 years at baseline. Prevalence of amyloid-positive MCI in the population without dementia increased from 0% in persons aged 50 to 59 years to 16.4% (95% CI, 10.3% to 22.5%) in those aged 80 to 89 years. The incident aMCI risk increased more than 2-fold in participants without cognitive impairment who were amyloid positive vs those who were amyloid negative (hazard ratio [HR], 2.26; 95% CI, 1.52 to 3.35; P < .001). The risk of AD dementia was 1.86 (95% CI, 0.89 to 3.88; P = .10) for amyloid-positive participants with MCI vs amyloid-negative participants with MCI, 1.63 (95% CI, 0.78 to 3.41; P = .20) for participants with aMCI who were amyloid positive vs amyloid negative, and 2.56 (95% CI, 1.35 to 4.88; P = .004) for amyloid-positive participants who were either without cognitive impairment or had aMCI vs those who were amyloid negative. Global cognitive and memory domain z scores declined significantly in amyloid-positive individuals during follow-up. The mean (SD) follow-up time from baseline was 3.7 (1.9) years to incident aMCI and 3.8 (2.0) years to incident AD dementia.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Population-based prevalence of amyloid-positive status and progression rates of amyloid positivity provide valid information for designing AD prevention trials and assessing the public health outcomes of AD prevention and interventions."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "T he National Institutes on Aging-Alzheimer's Association and the International Working Group has established stages of preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) and defined mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (and its subset, prodromal AD) with elevated brain amyloid as the key biomarker for AD pathology. [1] [2] [3] [4] Our group has published frequencies of the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association biomarker groups in Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) participants who either had no cognitive impairment or had amnestic MCI (aMCI). [5] [6] [7] Whereas frequencies describe the proportion of individuals in a study who have a condition, prevalence represents the number of individuals in a defined population with a disease or condition. Prevalence of amyloid positivity in the population without dementia provides reliable and valid estimates of the burden of AD pathology, which are useful for sample size estimations in designing primary and secondary AD prevention trials in persons without dementia. Despite this, there are relatively few population-based estimates of amyloid positivity in the population without dementia. Jansen et al 8 reported the prevalence of amyloid positivity in persons without dementia from a metaanalysis of clinic-based, volunteer-based studies in hospital departments and population-based studies. Because of differences in study designs and recruitment strategies, the estimates are potentially prone to bias. Ossenkoppele et al 9 estimated amyloid positivity prevalence among persons with dementia, but because participants had dementia prior to the initiation of the study, the estimates cannot be used in estimating sample sizes for primary and secondary prevention AD trials. Our first objective was therefore to estimate the prevalence of amyloid positivity in a population without dementia. Current AD trials are focused on primary and secondary prevention in persons without dementia. Population-based studies on outcomes of preclinical AD, MCI due to AD, and prodromal AD are informative for estimating effect sizes, rates of progression, duration of trials, and interpreting the efficacy of clinical trial interventions. Our group has published studies on the progression in participants with preclinical AD in a small sample during a very short duration. 5, 10 Van Harten et al 11 examined the predictive role of preclinical AD for cognitive decline in memory clinic participants, and Hansson et al 12 assessed progression from biomarker-positive MCI (using tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid or amyloid \u03b2) to AD dementia in a small sample of memory clinic patients. Clinic-based studies, however, typically overestimate rates of progression because participants may have more advanced disease than the general population. Studies of cognitive decline have been conducted among Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants. 13 However, the ADNI cohort is a highly select convenience sample focused on the symptomatic phase of the disease, and it excludes participants with clinical evidence of cerebrovascular disease. 14 Therefore ADNI estimates may not represent the general population without dementia.

These findings are consistent with amyloid as a biomarker of AD dementia.\nValid and reliable population-based estimates of prevalence and outcomes are important for estimating what the impact of an approved anti-amyloid drug would be in a general population. Estimation of effect sizes from a populationbased, sample without dementia may lead to more realistic expectations for anti-amyloid agents. In contrast, estimates of effect sizes derived from clinic-based studies and volunteer participants are subject to selection bias and may lead to inflated estimates of time to event. Such studies may overestimate progression rates, because these participants may have a higher likelihood of a family history of dementia or may be more symptomatic and therefore may progress at a higher rate than the general population. On the other hand, clinical trial cohorts are likely to have less comorbidity than a populationbased study such as this one. This study focused on persons without dementia because current primary and secondary AD prevention trials are designed to prevent progression in persons without dementia. The unadjusted proportions in the age group 50 to 89 years were lower than prevalence because of differences in participation rates by age, sex, and education or because of oversampling of the people in the age group 80 to 89 years, who likely have more pathology, to ensure adequate power to detect significant differences in prospective studies.\nDespite the nonsignificant associations by sex for incident AD dementia, the higher prevalence of amyloid positivity in women and sex differences in risk of progression for amyloid-positive individuals who are either cognitively unimpaired or have MCI may have implications for reporting clinical trial results by sex. Although we did not find a significant interaction of amyloid positivity with sex, higher rates of progression in amyloid-positive women with MCI compared with men may be partly because of the higher prevalence of age, sex, and education using time from baseline as the time scale. At 3 years, the percentage free of aMCI was 88.0% of amyloid-positive participants who were initially cognitively unimpaired vs 96.2% of amyloid-negative participants who were initially cognitively unimpaired; the percentage free of AD dementia was 73.9% of amyloid-positive people who initially had MCI vs 90.8% of amyloid-negative people with the same condition; the corresponding rates for aMCI were 68.3% vs 90.8%, respectively, after censoring.\namyloid positivity in women, particularly among women \u03b54 carriers compared with men. This is consistent with amyloid as a mediator of the effects of ApoE \u03b54 and the reduced HRs after adjustment for ApoE \u03b54 allele in the models. The HRs for progression from amyloid-positive, cognitively unimpaired status to aMCI were higher in men than in women, consistent with our previous study on incident MCI. 30 We speculate that perhaps other factors (eg, vascular conditions) may play a greater role in progression at the preclinical AD stage in men, whereas amyloid may play a greater role in progression from preclinical or prodromal AD to AD dementia in women. 5, 6 These preliminary findings need to be validated in larger populationbased, prospective studies. However, they suggest that potential sex differences should be taken into account in clinical trial design. Our prevalence estimates are consistent with studies 8, 9, 31 reporting an increase in amyloid positivity with age and ApoE \u03b54 allele carriage. Jansen et al 8 reported a 10% to 12% prevalence of amyloid positivity in persons aged 50 to 59 years who had no cognitive impairment, which is higher than the 2.4% prevalence observed in this study, and that could be because of the large proportion of volunteers or to more accurate characterization from using both PET and cerebrospinal fluid amyloid test results in the previous study. Landau et al 13 reported\nfrequencies of amyloid positivity of 29% in persons without cognitive impairment, 42% in people with early MCI, and 62% in those with late MCI among participants of the ADNI study. Consistent with the highly selective ADNI cohort, these estimates are much higher than the population-based estimates in this study. These prospective findings suggest that clinic-based studies and studies based primarily on volunteers may overestimate progression. The Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle Study of Aging, which is based on volunteers and has a much higher proportion of ApoE \u03b54 carriers than the general population, reported 32 a 4.

The strengths of our study include the large sample size, high prevalence of amyloid positivity, and populationbased, natural history design.
