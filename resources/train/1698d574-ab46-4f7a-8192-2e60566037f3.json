[{"section_title": "An Analysis of the Financial Performance of Beginning Farmers", "text": "Over the next decade, the U.S. agricultural population will be experiencing a major structural change due to population dynamics. Half of all current farmers are expected to retire and be replaced by new and beginning farmers. Beginning farmers, by definition, have been operating a farm business for less than 10 years. Approximately 20 percent of family farms are currently classified as beginning farms. Beginning farmers need to develop managerial skills, secure financing to acquire capital, and operate a profitable business while reduce financial, production, price, legal, and human resources risk. Understanding the financial condition and needs of beginning farmers is important to ensure sustainability of the agricultural sector. Policymakers and various universities and organizations have responded to the needs of beginning farmers by offering educational programs and financial capital that will help them transition into agriculture. Understanding the predictors of financial performance and financial stress can help structure and target these programs to better address the needs of beginning farmers. Previous studies on beginning farmers have considered various aspects of financial performance, including profitability (return on assets), marginal income and solvency criteria, and net farm income per dollar assets (Adhikari, Mishra, and Chintawar, 2009;Ahearn and Newton, 2009; D'Antoni, Williams, 2007 andNewton and Ahearn, 2007). This study extends previous analyses to cover all five major financial ratios including liquidity, solvency, profitability, efficiency, and repayment capacity. Analyzing all financial ratios will give lenders, policymakers, and educators a better indication of the overall financial health of beginning as well as the successful farm strategies that can help beginning farmers transition into agriculture. The objective of this study is to examine the factors influencing the financial performance and financial stress of U.S farmers and for the group of beginning farmers. While lenders and educators are interested in the general financial performance of beginning farmers, they are even more concerned about financial stress when one of the financial ratios exceeds a critical value. Therefore, the analysis here concentrates on predicting financial performance in the context of financial stress. The data are from the Agricultural and Resource Management Survey from the U.S. Department of Agriculture making the results representative of all beginning farmers in the U.S. The survey includes detailed information on the financial condition of beginning farmers making it possible to calculate financial ratios and classify them based on the level of acceptable and critical values of financial performance. Probit models are estimated to determine the factors affecting financial performance for beginning farmers. Instead of using a continuous dependent variable, the five financial ratios are classified as being in the critical zone or not. This classification of financial ratios into critical/acceptable range is consistent with current lender practices of using credit scores to determine the credit worthiness of their applicants. Several factors are hypothesized to influence financial performance, including operator characteristics such as age, education, and household size as well as farm characteristics such as farm size, crop/livestock type, and the legal status of the farm. The results provide important insights into the factors affecting the likelihood that farmers will experience financial stress with several differences for beginning farms."}, {"section_title": "Models and Data", "text": "The analysis is based on data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) which is conducted annually by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Data for 2005-2008 are used; with the last year representing an economic recession. The ARMS data include detailed information on the financial condition and performance of U.S. farmers. The survey includes questions about the financial indicators included in the farm balance sheets and income statements. These financial indicators are used to calculate the financial ratios used in this study. There are five measures of the financial performance of U.S. farms represented by the respective financial ratios: liquidity (current ratio), solvency (debt-to-asset ratio), profitability (return on assets ratio and operating profit margin ratio), efficiency (operating expense ratio), and repayment capacity (term debt coverage ratio). Table 1 shows the formulas used to calculate these financial ratios. Each financial ratio is classified as being in the critical zone (dummy variable equal to 1) if it exceeds or is below a critical threshold, indicating that farmers experience financial stress. For example, a current ratio of less than 1 is considered being in the critical zone, and similarly a debt-to-asset ratio that exceeds 55% is considered being in the critical zone. While additional financial ratios are available to represent each of the five financial measures, only those financial ratios that have clear guidelines about being in the critical zone are included in this analysis. Probit models are estimated to determine the factors affecting financial performance for beginning farmers. Instead of using a continuous dependent variable, the five financial ratios are classified as being in the critical zone or not. This classification of financial ratios into critical/acceptable range is consistent with current lender practices of using credit scores to determine the credit worthiness of their applicants. Several factors are hypothesized to influence financial performance, including operator characteristics such as age, education, and household size as well as farm characteristics such as farm size, crop/livestock type, and the legal status of the farm. The analysis is conducted for all farmers in the U.S. and then for the group of beginning farmers. Beginning farmers are classified as those with 10 years or less of experience. Specifically, the farm operators answered the following question: \"In what year did the operator begin to operate any farm operation?\" Their answer was used to calculate the years of experience. Descriptive statistics are shown in table 2. The results show that a larger proportion of beginning farmers are in the critical zones for their liquidity (29% of farmers and 38% of beginning farmers being in the critical zone for the current ratio) and solvency (3% of the farmers vs. 8% of the beginning farmers being in the critical zone for the debt-to-asset ratios). The proportion of farmers being in the critical ratios for the profitability, efficiency, and repayment capacity is similar for the beginning farmers compared to the general farmer population. These results indicate that financial management strategies that aim to improve the liquidity and solvency for beginning farmers will tend to improve their overall financial condition."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Probit models are estimated for whether or not each of the financial ratios falls in the critical zone. Table 3 reports the results for all farms and table 4 shows the results for beginning farmers. Most farmer and farm characteristics are found to affect the likelihood of the financial ratios being in the critical zone. Age is found to negatively affect the likelihood of financial ratios being in the critical zones, and therefore older farmers are generally in a better financial condition. Higher educational levels are associated with lower likelihood of being in the critical zones for the two profitability ratios (ROA and operating profit margin ratios) and with higher likelihood of being in the critical zone for the financial efficiency ratio. Hobby farms are generally more likely to be in the critical zone for all ratios except for their solvency represented by the debt-to-asset ratio. In other words, hobby farms (representing rural residence/lifestyle farms) are more likely to be in a vulnerable financial condition than their farm peers. Likewise, livestock farms are more likely to be in the critical zones for their profitability, efficiency, and repayment capacity ratios but less likely to be in the critical zones for their liquidity (current ratio). Farm size also affects the financial performance of farms. Larger farms, reflected by their higher gross value of sales, are less likely to be in the crucial zones for their profitability, efficiency, and repayment capacity ratios but more likely to be in the critical zone for their solvency ratio. These results show that larger farms are more likely to take on larger amounts of debt to leverage up and run their operations and as a result to improve on the rest of their financial indicators. Similar results are found for government payments, which are shown to help the financial performance of farms making them less likely to be in the critical zones for all financial ratios except for their solvency. Therefore, government payments are helping farmers to be more leveraged and improve on the rest of their financial performance. In comparison to 2008, previous years are associated with lower likelihood of farms being in the critical zones for their ROA, operating profit margin, operating expense, and term debt coverage ratios. These results indicate that the economic recession of 2008 has been associated with higher likelihood of farmers experiencing profitability, efficiency, and repayment capacity issues. The evidence shows that the recession has negatively impacted farm performance making farms more likely to experience financial stress. The probit models for the financial ratios being in the critical zones are also estimated separately for beginning farmers. Most of the results for the beginning farmer group are similar to the ones for all farmers, with a few exceptions. In contrasts to the results for all farmers, in the group of beginning farmers, most of the personal and farm characteristics do not affect the probability of farmers experiencing liquidity and efficiency problems. Also, being a hobby farm and receiving more total off-farm income generally do not have significant effects on the financial ratios being in the critical zones. These results may be due to the fact that most beginning farmers are more likely to be hobby farms and have higher off-farm incomes, making them more homogenous group. Another difference in results is that for the beginning farmers groups, the dummy variables indicating prior years no longer have significant effects on the likelihood of farmers experiencing financial stress. These findings show if farmers are grouped in homogenous groups such as beginning farmers, their performance over the years seems to be more stable. Overall, the results show that the personal characteristics such as operator's age and education, and farm characteristics such as the farm being a hobby farm, livestock farm, and farm size/income measured by gross value of sales, government payments and off-farm income significantly affect the likelihood of farmers experiencing financial stress as measured by their financial ratios falling into the critical zones. Interestingly, the legal structure of the farm (sole proprietorship or not) and the household size do not affect the likelihood of experiencing financial stress. These results differ based when the analysis is performed for the group of beginning farms, with fewer characteristics affecting their financial performance and stress, possibly due to the fact that the beginning farmer group is more homogenous."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Policy Implications", "text": "This study examines the financial performance and stress experienced by beginning farms in the U.S. Using USDA's ARMS data, probit models are estimated to examine the personal and farm characteristics that affect whether or not the financial ratios fall into the critical zones. The results show that several characteristics influence the likelihood of experiencing financial stress, with important differences for beginning farms. The results indicate important differences between beginning farmers and their peers in terms of their financial performance. The descriptive statistics show that beginning farmers have lower liquidity and solvency and about the same profitability, efficiency, and repayment capacity compared to the rest of the farm population. These results indicate that financial management strategies that aim to improve the liquidity and solvency for beginning farmers will tend to improve their overall financial condition. The results from the probit models on the predictors of financial stress for beginning farmers show that beginning farmers who are older are less likely to have liquidity and repayment capacity issues perhaps because they already have accumulated financial assets. Larger farms are more likely to have liquidity and solvency issues but they are also more likely to be profitable, efficient, and able to repay their debt. Livestock farms are more likely to be efficient but also more likely to experience profitability issues. Overall, the findings indicate that compared to the rest of the farmers, beginning farmers have different likelihood of experiencing financial stress depending on their operator characteristics, farm enterprise, size, and organization. These differences among farms are helpful for agricultural lenders to assess the credit worthiness of farmers in transition. Understanding the predictors of financial performance for beginning farmers can help in designing educational programs based on the particular needs of farmers to help them transition into agriculture. With about half of the current farmers planning to retire in the next decade, it is of crucial importance to offer financial management training to the next generation of farmers with goals of achieving high profitability, financial efficiency, and adequate repayment capacity.
