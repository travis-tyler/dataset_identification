HSLS:09 is a nationally representative study of a cohort of students who were ninth-graders in fall 2009. The study focuses on understanding students' trajectories from the beginning of high school into higher education and the workforce. The core research questions for the study explore secondary to postsecondary transition plans and the evolution of those plans; the paths into and out of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields of study and careers; and the educational and social experiences related to these shifts in plans or paths. The 2013 Update and the High School Transcript Study allow researchers to begin analyses of high school outcomes and immediate postsecondary plans and experiences, bolstered by the rich data gathered in prior rounds. Students were first surveyed in fall 2009 as ninthgraders and were surveyed again 2.5 years later, in 2012, when most were spring-term eleventh-graders. In the summer and fall of 2013, students or their parents responded to a survey about the student's high school completion status, postsecondary education and work plans, college application experiences, and work experiences. In addition, school personnel in base-year schools and other schools identified during data collection supplied high school transcripts for HSLS:09 students from all schools that these students had attended. These transcripts were reviewed for completeness, courses were coded into a uniform set of codes, and information on credits and grades was standardized. Therefore, this report examines an array of critical measures: high school completion, plans for postsecondary education or work in fall 2013 (the academic year after most students have graduated from high school), and coursetaking patterns both overall and in STEM fields specifically. The findings are presented for all study respondents (including those who graduated early or did not complete high school as of 2013) as well as for subgroups of students by sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and other characteristics. Because this report is descriptive in nature, readers are cautioned not to draw causal inferences based on the presented results. It is important to note that many of the variables examined in this report may be related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships among the variables have not been explored. The variables examined here are also just a small number of those that can be examined in these data; they were selected to demonstrate the range of information available from the studies. These findings are examples of estimates that can be obtained from the data and are not designed to fully INTRODUCTION explore any particular issue. The release of this report is intended to encourage more indepth analysis of the data using more sophisticated statistical methods. Comparisons made in the text were tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences were larger than might be expected as a result of sampling variation. All differences reported are significant at the p < .05 level. There were no adjustments for multiple comparisons. National estimates (averages and percentages) reported in the text that are summed across reported categories are based on the underlying unrounded estimates. The findings highlighted in the bullets do not report all statistically significant differences among estimates. Further information about the dataset and the methodologies employed in collecting and processing the data can be found in the technical appendix to this report (appendix A) and, with greater detail, in the HSLS:09 2013 Update and High School Transcript Data File Documentation (DFD) (Ingels et al. 2015), available at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsls09/."}, {"section_title": "Study Design", "text": "HSLS:09 is a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of approximately 20,000 ninth-graders. More specifically, the study is based on fall-term ninth-graders in 944 schools with a ninth and an eleventh grade in fall 2009. The sampled schools encompass both public schools, including charter schools, and private schools providing instruction in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia. More information about the sample design, including classification of ineligible cases, can be found in the Technical Notes and Methodology section (appendix A). A first follow-up of HSLS:09 occurred in spring 2012, when most sample members were in the eleventh grade. A second follow-up is planned for 2016, when most sample members will be 3 years beyond high school graduation. The number and timing of future follow-ups beyond 2016 is yet to be determined, although the expectation is that the cohort will be followed at least to age 30, with a questionnaire administration and a postsecondary education transcript collection in 2025-26. The 2013 Update (survey) occurred in summer and fall 2013, when most sample members had already graduated from high school. Either sample members or their parents could have completed the questionnaire; question wording was adapted so that parents were responding about their children's activities and plans. Although the goal of the survey was to gather objective information about students, analysts should be sensitive to the fact that, for a subset of items, certain subjective responses may differ between parents and their children. In addition, because the survey was administered over a period that both preceded and overlapped with the traditional start of college classes in the fall, a number of questions were designed to elicit the anticipated or realized activities of respondents on November 1, 2013. The tables and figures in this report indicate when the data gathered correspond to November 1 activities or activities at the time of the interview itself."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION 3", "text": "In 2013 and 2014, high school transcripts were gathered from all high schools that students had attended-including schools known from prior rounds, schools identified by the student or parent during the 2013 update survey, or schools discovered during the request for transcripts from known schools. Coursetaking records from transcripts were keyed and coded using the School Courses for the Exchange of Data (SCED), a common classification system that places courses into standard 12-character codes reflecting their course content and subject matter (National Forum on Education Statistics 2014). 1 HSLS:09's use of SCED marks the first implementation of this code frame on any NCES transcript study. Course credits, course grades, and other measures drawn from transcripts were standardized to ensure comparability across schools. A file identifying course offerings at base-year schools was also created.

All of the studies monitor the transition of national samples of young people from the high school to postsecondary years, including further education, participation in the work force, and the assumption of other adult roles. The core research questions for HSLS:09 explore secondary-topostsecondary transition plans and the evolution of those plans; the paths into and out of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and the educational and social experiences that affect these shifts. The HSLS:09 base-year administration took place in the 2009-10 school year, with a randomly selected sample of fall-term ninth-graders in 944 public and private high schools with both a ninth and an eleventh grade. Students took a mathematics assessment and survey online. In addition, students' parents, school administrators, and mathematics and science teachers as well as the school's lead counselor completed surveys on the phone or on the Web. The first follow-up of HSLS:09 took place in 2012 when most sample members were in the spring term of the eleventh grade. Dropouts, newly homeschooled, and transfer students were followed, as well as those who remained in the base-year school. All sample members were eligible to complete both a questionnaire and a mathematics assessment. In addition A-2 APPENDIX A: TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY to a student questionnaire and mathematics assessment, surveys were also given to parents, administrators and counselors. The 2013 Update survey took place between June and December 2013. The survey, which could be completed by either the sample member or a parent, was designed to gather basic information about the sample member's high school completion status or plans, postsecondary education and work plans, and the college application and financing process. Questions were adapted so that parent respondents were providing information about their child's activities and plans, although some subjective questions (e.g., about the reasons for choosing a college) were also asked and may systematically differ across parents and children. Because the survey was administered over a number of months that preceded and overlapped with the traditional start of college classes in the fall, a number of questions were anchored to November 1, 2013, and designed to elicit the anticipated or realized activities of respondents on that date. Between fall 2013 and spring 2014, high school transcripts were gathered from all schools that students had attended-including schools known from prior rounds, schools identified by the student or parent during the 2013 update survey, or schools discovered during the request for transcripts from existing schools. Coursetaking records from transcripts were keyed and coded using the School Courses for the Exchange of Data (SCED), a code frame that classifies courses into standard 12-digit codes reflecting their course content and placement within subjects. 4 HSLS:09's use of SCED marks the first implementation of this code frame on any NCES transcript study. Course credits, course grades, and other measures derived from transcripts were standardized to ensure comparability across schools. In addition, student records were matched to external data sources to obtain data on SAT and ACT scores, Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) data, and GED completion data. A second follow-up interview will take place in 2016, when most sample members will be 3 years beyond high school graduation. The number and timing of future follow-ups beyond 2016 is yet to be determined, although the expectation is that the cohort will be followed at least to age 30, with a questionnaire administration and a postsecondary education transcript collection in 2025-26."}, {"section_title": "APPENDIX A: TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY", "text": "A-3"}, {"section_title": "A.2 Instrumentation", "text": "2013 Update. The goal of the 2013 update was to efficiently collect information on sample members' status with respect to high school completion, postsecondary applications and enrollment, financial aid applications and offers, and employment. Two instrument design strategies were used to maximize the response rate. First, the instrument was designed to last about 15 minutes, approximately half the length of the previous HSLS:09 instruments. Second, either the sample member or a parent could respond to the interview. Given this design, an effort was made to select primarily factual questions that sample members and parents would respond to consistently. The data file includes a variable indicating whether the sample member or the parent was the respondent. The instrument was designed for selfadministration via the Web or computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). In addition to the full-length version of the instrument, a 5-minute abbreviated version was developed for CATI, Web, and paper-and-pencil self-administration for a small subset of hard-to-reach sample members. In addition to the 2013 update questionnaire, data from prior-round student and parent questionnaires are used in this report, specifically as row variables in tables. Student questionnaires were administered in the base year and first follow-up and gathered a wide range of data such as demographic information (e.g., sex, race/ethnicity); language background; and school experiences in the current and previous school year (including math and science experiences and course enrollment). There was also both a base-year and first follow-up parent survey, the latter conducted with a subsample of parents. 5 The parent questionnaire identified household members and their roles and characteristics, and obtained demographic data and information on immigration status and language use, socioeconomic status (education, occupation, income), the student's educational history (including grade retention and change of schools), family interactions, parental involvement in the cohort member's learning, and plans and preparations for postsecondary education. In all row variables used in this report, data are derived from the 2012 student and parent surveys. The one exception is the school sector variable, which uses data from both the base year and first follow-up to classify students' enrollment patterns with respect to school sector. High School Transcript Study. High school transcript and school catalog keying and coding was completed using a keying and coding system for data entry. Course catalogs for base-year schools were keyed and coded to collect data for a course offerings data file used in assigning individual student courses to an appropriate SCED code (the course offerings file is also provided for analytical use as part of the study database). Information coded from transcripts includes course name, course subject as coded using a SCED (five-digit) subject code, sequence and rigor using SCED definitions, credits awarded, credit type, term type, grade level, grade received, location where course was taken, and multiple other attributes such as whether the course was an AP or a career/technical education course. Course credit and course grades were standardized to ensure comparability across schools. Courses were coded using version 2.0 of the SCED, a secondary school course classification system (http://nces.ed.gov/forum/SCED.asp). The SCED is a 12-digit code made up of four elements: course subject, level of rigor, available credit, and sequence. The subject code accounts for the first five digits of the full SCED code. The first two digits indicate the subject area (e.g., mathematics or social studies), and the complete five-digit code provides the specific definition of the course subject. There are 23 subject codes and 1,672 total five-digit codes. See Ingels et al. (2015) for detailed information on the use of SCED in HSLS:09. Rigor identifies the level of difficulty, which is captured using one of the following five options: B -basic or remedial; G -general or regular; E -enriched or advanced; H -honors; and X -no level of rigor. Available credit captures the number of Carnegie units earned for completing the course. A course that meets daily for a year is coded as one Carnegie unit. Other courses, such as physical education, may only meet for half a year or every other day and would be coded as 0.5 Carnegie units or other amount consistent with the school term and school course credit policies. Sequence refers to the order in which related courses are taken. In the SCED, courses can only be in sequence if the same five-digit subject code is used for the related courses. For example, Accounting I and II are consecutive courses taken in the accounting department and are in a sequence because both courses are coded using the same subject code (12104 -Accounting). Spanish I and II would not be in sequence, although they are related, because there are different subject codes for these courses (06101 -Spanish I and 06102 -Spanish II). Sequence is reported as two characters to capture the placement of the course in the sequence and the total number of courses in the set (e.g., part 'n' of 'm' parts). In the accounting example above, the sequence would be 1 of 2 for the Accounting I course to indicate it is the first of two courses in a series. Other HSLS:09 instruments. Although not utilized in the analyses in this brief report, HSLS:09 also contains questionnaire data from several other sources including a APPENDIX A: TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY A-5 school administrator survey (base year and first follow-up), a counselor survey (base year and first follow-up), and surveys of mathematics and science teachers (in the base year only). Further information about all HSLS:09 questionnaires may be found in chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year to First Follow-up Data File Documentation (DFD) (Ingels et al. 2014)."}, {"section_title": "A.3 Sample Design", "text": "Base year and first follow-up. In the base-year survey of HSLS:09, students were sampled through a two-stage process. First, stratified random sampling and school recruitment resulted in the identification and contacting of 1,889 eligible base-year schools. A total of 944 of these schools participated in the study, resulting in a 56 percent weighted (or 50 percent unweighted) school response rate. The target population at the school level was defined as regular public schools, including public charter schools and private schools in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia, providing instruction in both ninth and eleventh grade. HSLS:09 baseyear school and student samples are nationally representative and also state representative for a subset of 10 states. The target population of students was defined to include all ninth-grade students who attended the study-eligible schools in the fall 2009 term. In the second stage of sampling, students were randomly selected from school enrollment rosters, with 25,206 eligible selections (or about 27 students per school). All students who met the target population definition were deemed eligible for the study. Of the 25,206 students eligible for the base year, 25,184 were eligible for the first follow-up (22 were deceased). Table A-1 includes eligible sample sizes (as well as corresponding participation rates) for the full complement of baseyear and first follow-up questionnaires/assessments. 2013 Update and High School Transcript Study. Of the 25,206 students eligible for the base year, 25,168 were eligible for the 2013 Update and the High School Transcript Study (a total of 38 were deceased). Not all cases were fielded: sample members were excluded from fielding when neither base-year nor first follow-up data were collected for them, or were out of scope for a given round in accordance with one of four out of scope categories described below. These unfielded cases are classified as nonrespondents and appear in the sample denominator for calculation of response rates. Fielded cases are those for which an interview is pursued; in contrast, no attempt is made to interview unfielded cases. While HSLS:09 begins with a study-eligible base year sample (including only cases with data from at least one prior round), some sample members will not prove to be \"in scope\" in a particular round of data collection. Out of scope cases can be temporarily out of scope, say out of scope for the 2013 Update but not necessarily for the second follow-up-or they may be permanently out of scope, as is the case in dealing with sample members who died in the course of a longitudinal study. Out of scope cases fall into one of four possible statuses: 1. Students who are eligible (fall 2009 9th graders) but incapable of meaningful participation (defined in terms of test-taking and questionnaire-response). These students are questionnaire-incapable. They cannot participate, owing to either a language barrier or a severe disability. Nonetheless, some may change status in later rounds (for example, a student may become fluent in English over time). The number of sample members who were deemed incapable of meaningful participation was 548 for the base year, 251 for the first follow-up, and 88 for the 2013 update. 2. Students who are inaccessible-(these students are temporarily out scope, that is, their status is always re-assessed in the following round). Any of several factors can render sample members inaccessible, though chiefly the following: out of the country, incarcerated, hospitalized or otherwise incapacitated, thus making for unavailability during the field period. 3. Students who have died-deceased students are permanently out of scope. 4. Study withdrawals-some sample members refused to participate and, additionally, requested that they not be contacted again. While no attempt is made to interview study withdrawals, their nonparticipation counts against the study's response rate, that is, counts as an automatic refusal for each successive round. In calculating response rates, there are two types to consider. The unconditional response rate is the response rate calculated with no exceptions for the temporarily out of scope, unfielded cases; only the deceased are removed from the study denominator. The unconditional response rate supports statistical description and estimation. The conditional response rate removes all four categories of temporary out of scope students from the denominator. The conditional response rate is a measure of the methodological success of the study, of what its data collection effort was able to accomplish. For purposes of studying population parameters as estimated in this First Look report, the unconditional response rate is of prime importance. However, for interested readers, conditional response results are reported in the HSLS:09 Data File Documentation (Ingels et al. 2015).  Table A-1 provides a summary of the weighted student unit response rates for each round of data collection. The 2013 Update data collection ended with a 73.1 percent response rate. For transcripts, an 87.1 percent response rate was achieved. Unweighted participation rates restricted to the released or fielded sample may be found in the Data File Documentation (Ingels et al. 2015).

When appropriately weighted, the HSLS:09 is generalizable to the U.S. population of ninth-graders who were attending schools with both a ninth and eleventh grade in fall 2009. Estimates in figure 1 and tables 1 through 9 were produced using the longitudinal first follow-up to transcript collection weight (W3W2STUTR). This weight is appropriate for analysis involving first follow-up data and transcript data; nonrespondents to the first follow-up and/or 2013 update are given a zero weight and do not count toward estimates.

"}, {"section_title": "A.7 Imputation", "text": "Imputation addresses the potential concern related to missing values in the data supplied by respondents. Advantages of using imputed values include the ability to use all study respondent records in an analysis (complete-case analysis), which affords more power for statistical tests. Additionally, if the imputation procedure is effective (i.e., the imputed value is equal to [or close to] the true value), the analysis results are likely less biased than those produced with the incomplete data file. (On A-12 APPENDIX A: TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY both the benefits and techniques of imputation, see, for example, Little and Rubin 2002.) To alleviate the problem of missing data from a respondent record, statistical imputation methods were employed for the 2013 Update and High School Transcript Study that were similar to those used for the HSLS:09 base year and first follow-up. Five key analysis variables were identified for single-value imputation from the 2013 Update and High School Transcript Study data: whether the respondent has a high school credential (S3HSCRED), the type of high school credential earned (S3HSCREDTYPE), whether the respondent was taking postsecondary classes as of November 1, 2013 (S3CLASSES), whether the respondent was working for pay as of November 1, 2013 (S3WORK), and the date that a dropout or alternative completer last attended high school (X3LASTHSDATE). Additional variables were considered for this list but were excluded because of either a high item response rate or they were deemed to be of little analytic importance. Stochastic methods were used to impute the missing values. Specifically, a weighted sequential hot-deck (WSHD; statistical) imputation procedure (Cox 1980;Iannacchione 1982) using the final 2013 update student analysis weight (W3STUDENT) was applied to the missing values for the variables listed above. The WSHD procedure replaces missing data with valid data from a donor record (i.e., item respondent) within an imputation class. In general, variables with lower item nonresponse rates were imputed earlier in the process. Regardless of the method, indicator variables (flags) were created to allow users to easily identify the imputed values. Further information on imputation procedures and quality checks can be found in chapter 6 of the HSLS:09 2013 Update and High School Transcript Data File Documentation (DFD) (Ingels et al. 2015)."}, {"section_title": "A.8 Disclosure Risk Analysis and Protections", "text": "The disclosure treatment methods used to produce the HSLS:09 2013 Update and High School Transcript Study public-use data files include variable recoding, suppressing, and swapping.

Other variables were recoded from continuous to categorical values. Thus, rare events or characteristics have been masked for certain variables. Other variables were classified as high risk and were suppressed from the public-use file. The suppressing technique entailed removing the response from the public-use file (i.e., reset to a \"suppressed\" reserve code).

There were no adjustments for multiple comparisons. The conclusions stated in this report are supported by a two-tailed test of statistical significance, specifically, Student's t test. Whether the statistical test is considered significant is determined by calculating a t value for the difference between a pair of means or percentages and comparing this value to published tables of values, called critical values. The alpha level is an a priori statement of the probability that a difference exists in fact rather than by chance. The t statistic between estimates from various subgroups presented in the tables can be computed by using the following formula: where x1 and x2 are the estimates to be compared (e.g., the means of sample members in two groups), and SE1 and SE2 are their corresponding standard errors. This formula is valid only for independent estimates.

Procedures such as Taylor Series approximations, balanced repeated replicate (BRR), and Jackknife Repeated Replication, which can be found in advanced statistical programs such as SUDAAN, AM, or WESVAR, produce similar results.

The section subsection (A11.2) describes transcript-derived variables and coursetaking variables, such as credits earned and GPA in various subjects, used as column variables in figure 1 and tables 1 through 9. Specific SCED codes corresponding to course classifications are included in this subsection. The third subsection (A11.3) describes measures relating to postsecondary education and work experiences used as column variables in figures 2 and 3 and tables 10 through 13. All analyses for the current report use the public-use versions of all variables.

Versions of the questionnaires with routing logic and flow charts representing how respondents were assigned questions can be found in appendix A of the HSLS:09 Base-Year to First Follow-up Data File Documentation (DFD) (Ingels et al. 2014) and appendix A of the HSLS:09 2013 Update and High School Transcript Data File Documentation (DFD) (Ingels et al. 2015)."}, {"section_title": "A.11.1 Student Background Characteristics", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sex (X2SEX)", "text": "X2SEX updates the base-year variable X1SEX. Sex of the sample member is taken from the base-year student questionnaire; if missing, it is supplemented by the parent questionnaire or school-provided sampling roster. If the sex indicated by any of these three sources was inconsistent, X1SEX was coded based on a review of student name records. Sex information was gathered also from new respondents in the first follow-up."}, {"section_title": "Race/Ethnicity (X2RACE)", "text": "First follow-up race/ethnicity is an update of base-year race (X1RACE). It is a composite rendering of the racial and ethnic group to which a student belongs, based on separate questions about race and Hispanic ethnicity. The categories of X1RACE were collapsed into non-Hispanic Asian; non-Hispanic Black; Hispanic; non-Hispanic White; non-Hispanic more than one race; and other non-Hispanic races (i.e., non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native, and non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander). Race/ethnicity is based on data from the student questionnaire, if available; if not available from the student questionnaire, it is based on, in order of preference, data from the school-provided sampling roster or data from the parent questionnaire. Race information was gathered also from new respondents in the first follow-up."}, {"section_title": "Socioeconomic Status Quintile (X2SESQ5)", "text": "Socioeconomic status (SES) is a measure of the family's relative position in American society. The continuous SES index score is based on five components: education of each parent or guardian or education of the single parent/guardian, where applicable (X2PAR1EDU, X2PAR2EDU); the occupational prestige score of each parent or guardian or the prestige score of the single parent/guardian, where applicable (as determined from occupation codes X2PAR1OCC6 and X2PAR2OCC6); and family income (X2FAMINCOME). In this report, SES is reported in quintiles (fifths) of an SES index score (the index is a continuous measure that is also available for analytic use). The quintile measure divides the weighted (population-estimated) SES distribution into five equal groups. Quintile 1 corresponds to the lowest one-fifth of the population, and quintile 5 to the highest. To determine the quintile cut-points, the weighted distribution of the SES index score was divided at the 20th, 40th, 60th, and 80th percentiles. For this report, the middle three quintiles were combined to form one category."}, {"section_title": "Parents' Highest Education (X2PAREDU)", "text": "Indicates the highest level of education achieved by either parent. X2PAREDU is constructed from two composite variables (X2PAR1EDU and X2PAR2EDU) which are pulled from the first follow-up parent questionnaire, and, if missing, are imputed from the base-year parent questionnaire and the first follow-up student questionnaire. Categories for completing a high school diploma, GED, or alternative credential, and for completing a certificate or diploma from a school that provides occupational training, were recoded into a single category of \"high school.\" The top two categories (\"Master's degree\" and \"Ph.D./M.D./Law/other high-level professional degree\") were also recoded into a single category (\"Master's degree or higher\")."}, {"section_title": "Mathematics Assessment Quintile (X2TXMQUINT)", "text": "Both base-year and first follow-up respondents were given an HSLS:09-specific mathematics assessment. The assessment was designed to provide a measure of student achievement in algebraic reasoning at two points in time (ninth grade and when the majority of students were in eleventh grade). The test framework covers a cross-section of understandings representative of the major domains of algebra and the key processes of algebra. The test and item specifications describe six domains of algebraic content and four algebraic processes: \u2022 Algebraic Content Domains: Both in the base year and first follow-up, the assessment was built as a two-stage test, with a router (completed by all students) and a second-stage assignment of one of three forms of variable difficulty. The scores used to describe students' performance on the mathematics assessment are based on Item Response Theory (IRT). The IRT model uses patterns of correct, incorrect, and omitted responses to obtain ability estimates that are comparable across the low-, moderate-, and high-difficulty test forms. The first follow-up math quintile score (X2TXMQUINT) is a norm-referenced measure of achievement. The quintile score divides the weighted (population estimate) achievement distributions into five equal groups, based on the continuous math score (X2TXMTSCOR). Quintile 1 corresponds to the lowest achieving onefifth of the population, and quintile 5 to the highest. To determine the quintile cutpoints, the weighted distribution of the standardized scores was divided at the 20th, 40th, 60th, and 80th percentiles. See chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year to First Follow-up Data File Documentation (DFD) (Ingels et al. 2014) for more information on the design of the assessment, the modeling of scores using IRT, and the derivation of the mathematics quintile variable.

Courses in computer and information sciences have a two-digit SCED subject code of 10, and engineering and technology courses have a two-digit SCED subject code of 21.
