[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "CpG dinucleotides are under-represented in the DNA genomes of vertebrates (Cooper and Krawczak, 1989; Simmonds et al., 2013) . Cytosines in the CpG conformation may become methylated, and this methylation is used as a mechanism for transcriptional regulation (Medvedeva et al., 2014) .\nMethylated cytosines have a propensity to undergo spontaneous deamination (and so conversion to a thymine). Over evolutionary time, this has reduced the frequency of CpGs in vertebrate genomes (Cooper and Krawczak, 1989) . However, loss of CpGs in promoter regions would affect transcriptional regulation, and so CpGs are locally retained, resulting in functionally important 'CpG islands' found in around half of all vertebrate promoter regions (Deaton and Bird, 2011) .\nSingle strand RNA (ssRNA) viruses infecting vertebrate hosts reflect the CpG dinucleotide composition of their host in a type of mimicry (Simmonds et al., 2013) . It was hypothesised that this is because vertebrates have evolved a CpG sensor which flags transcripts with aberrant CpG frequencies (Atkinson et al., 2014; Gaunt et al., 2016) . This idea was strengthened by the discovery that the cellular protein Zinc-finger Antiviral Protein (ZAP) binds CpG motifs on viral RNA and directs them for degradation (Takata et al., 2017) , and further supported by observations that CpGs can be synonymously introduced into a viral genome to the detriment of virus replication without negatively https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/vevolu impacting transcriptional or translational efficiency (Gaunt et al., 2016; Tulloch et al., 2014) . Current understanding is therefore that ssRNA viruses mimic the CpG composition of their host at least in part to subvert detection by ZAP. ssRNA viruses also under-represent the UpA dinucleotide, but to a far more modest extent (Simmonds et al., 2013) , and the reasons behind UpA suppression are less well understood. A consequence of dinucleotide bias is that certain codon pairs are under-represented (Kunec and Osterrieder, 2016; Tulloch et al., 2014 ) (so, for example, codon pairs of the conformation NNC-GNN are among the most rarely seen codon pairs in vertebrates (Tats et al., 2008) ). Whether the two phenomena of CpG suppression and codon pair bias (CPB) are discrete remains controversial (Futcher et al., 2015; Groenke et al., 2020; Kunec and Osterrieder, 2016) .\nThe Coronaviridae have a generally low genomic cytosine content (Berkhout and van Hemert, 2015) , but as with other ssRNA viruses, nonetheless still under-represent CpG dinucleotides to a frequency below that predicted from individual base frequencies of cytosine and guanine (Woo et al., 2007) .\nThe Coronavirus family comprises four genera -the alpha, beta, gamma and delta-coronaviruses.\nHuman-infecting coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified belonging to the alpha and beta genera (Hu et al., 2015) . Alphacoronaviruses infecting humans include HCoV-229E and the more recently discovered HCoV-NL63 (van der Hoek et al., 2004) . Betacoronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005) , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV (Rota et al., 2003) , Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV (Zaki et al., 2012) and the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 (Lu et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) . Prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV had the strongest CpG suppression across human-infecting coronaviruses (Woo et al., 2007) . The reason(s) for this are uncertain, but loss of CpG from a virus genome upon zoonotic transfer into the human host has previously been reported for influenza A virus (Greenbaum et al., 2008) , potentially indicating an advantage of reduced CpG content for infection of the human respiratory tract. All human-infecting coronaviruses are thought to be derived from ancestral bat viruses, though intermediate hosts may have facilitated zoonotic passage in some cases (Banerjee et al., 2019) .\nDuring replication, coronaviruses synthesise transcriptionally active negative sense sub-genomic RNAs which are of varying length. Sub-genomic RNAs are synthesised by the viral polymerase copying the genome up to a 5' leader sequence (Liao and Lai, 1994) which is repeated upstream of most open reading frames (ORFs) in the coronavirus genome (such repeats are referred to as transcription regulation sequences (TRSs)); this complementarity allows viral polymerase jumping from the 5' leader sequence to directly upstream of ORFs preceded by a TRS (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998) . The negative sense sub-genomic RNAs serve as efficient templates for production of mRNAs (Sawicki et al., 2007) . Generally, only the first ORF of a sub-genomic mRNA is translated (Perlman and Netland, 2009) , although leaky ribosomal scanning has been reported as a means for accessing alternative ORFs for several coronaviruses including SARS-CoV (Schaecher et al., 2007) .\nSARS-CoV-2 was recently reported to have a CpG composition lower than other members of the betacoronavirus genus, comparable to certain canine alphacoronaviruses; an observation used to draw inferences over its origin and/or epizootic potential (Xia, 2020) . Here we show that coronaviruses have a broad range of CpG composition which is partially host and tissue tropism dependent, and that there is no difference in CpG content across coronavirus genera. There is however a striking disparity in CpG composition between SARS-CoV-2 ORFs, with the Envelope (E) protein ORF and ORF10 over-representing CpG dramatically. E ORF and ORF10 also have higher UpA dinucleotide composition and lower CPB scores than other ORFs. E ORF displays CpG suppression in all human-infecting viruses except SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a potential correlation between CpG presentation and disease severity in human-infecting coronaviruses."}, {"section_title": "Sequences.", "text": "For a comparison of GC content versus CpG ratio, all SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences of high coverage (as defined on the GISAID website) were downloaded from GISAID (www.gisaid.org) on 26 March 2020 (1163 sequences in total) and aligned against the SARS-COV-2 reference sequence (Accession number NC_045512) using Simmonics software (Simmonds, 2012) SSE v1.4 (pre-release download kindly provided by Prof. Peter Simmonds, Oxford University). All sequences represented human isolates except for one sequence of bat origin (hCoV-19/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013; EPI_ISL_402131) and one sequence from a pangolin (hCoV-19/pangolin/Guangdong/1/2019; EPI_ISL_410721). All complete genome sequences of all coronaviruses were downloaded from NCBI on the 16 April 2020 (3407 sequences in total). Sequences were then aligned and sequences less than 10% divergent at the nucleotide level, identified using the 'identify similar/ identical sequences' function in SSE v1.4 were removed from the dataset. Sequences were annotated into animal groups and genera based on their description in the NCBI database. The trimmed dataset (Table S1) included 215 complete genome coronavirus sequences. Individual groups were made for sequences originating from the following hosts: bat (n = 109), avian (35), camelid (3), canine (7), feline (9), human (7), mustelids (5), rodents (8), swine (13), ungulates (10) and 'other' (which included bottle-nosed dolphin (2), hedgehog (2), rabbit (2), beluga whale (1), civet (1) and pangolin (1)). Groups were loosely defined based on taxonomic orders, with some exceptions made to examine our specific research questions. Bats are of the order Chiroptera; multiple avian orders were grouped together (Galliformes, Anseriformes, Passeriformes, Gruiformes, Columbiformes and Pelicaniformes); even toed (Artiodactyla) and odd toed (Perissodactyla) ungulate orders were grouped, with camelids analysed separately due to their association with MERS-CoV (Azhar et al., 2014) ; Canidae (canine) and Pantherinae (feline) sequences of the Carnivora order were analysed separately, as canines have previously been suggested as an intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2 (Xia, 2020) and cat infections with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported (Shi et al., 2020) ; humans were the only representatives from the Primate order; all remaining Carnivora, with the exception of a single civet sequence, belonged to the Mustelidae (mustelids); rodents belong to the Rodentia order; and swine belong to the Artiodactyla order; whales are also Artodactyla but swine https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/vevolu gene, which when considered alone, has a CpG O:E ratio approaching 1 (Fig. 3A) , and is the ORF with the third-highest CpG O:E ratio after E ORF and ORF10. The usual coding plasticity afforded to nucleotides in the third position of a codon is nullified when overlapping reading frames are present, and so the CpG spike at this gene boundary is not surprising. Thus, although the SARS-CoV-2 genome exhibits high CpG suppression overall, there are local heterogeneities associated with individual ORFs, most notably E.\nOn the origins of the high CpG content of E ORF of SARS-CoV-2.\nTo determine whether the high CpG content of E ORF is evolutionarily conserved (ORF10 is poorly conserved and only encoded by a subset of SARS-like coronaviruses, so it was not analysed), attempts to identify the E ORF by nucleotide alignment for the set of 215 coronavirus sequences was undertaken, compared with E ORFs already annotated in NCBI. Of the 215 sequences, E ORF was identifiable in 178, with the remaining sequences too divergent to be confident of gene assignment.\nCpG composition for E ORF for the 178 sequences was measured and plotted according to host.\nAmino acid conservation within the short ORF of E could bias levels of CpG; for example, amino acids encoded by codons containing C and G in combinations other than CpG could be disproportionately represented. To account for this possibility, CpG O:E ratios were corrected for amino acid composition across this region (Fig. 4A) . A diverse distribution of CpG content was evident in viruses from every host group except ungulates, with bats in particular displaying a notable range from total suppression to overrepresentation. Otherwise, most viruses from most species still maintained some level of CpG suppression in E ORF. The exceptions with high CpG O:E ratios in E ORF were avian coronaviruses and notably, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, other human-infecting coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43) all strongly underrepresented CpG in E ORF, while MERS-CoV E ORF had an intermediate CpG O:E ratio of 0.6.To confirm E ORF over-represented CpG relative to the rest of the genome in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, ratios for E ORF: genomic CpG O:E were calculated (Fig. 4B) . In non-bat non-avian host genomes, E ORF usually displayed CpG suppression in line with or stronger than that seen at the genome level, whereas SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 starkly contrasted with this, displaying far less CpG suppression in this region. This could be linked with their recent emergence from bat reservoirs, as genome composition is more likely to be optimised for replication in that host, and the CpG composition of E ORF for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV falls within the E ORF CpG heterogeneity apparent across bat-derived sequences.\nAs another check of whether differential codon usage might explain the CpG composition disparity in E ORF, we calculated codon adaptation index (CAI) scores baselined against the human transcriptome. While SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 E ORFs had CAI scores that were lower than those for other coronavirus E ORFs, the differences were small and did not explain the large differences in CpG ratios (Table 1) .\nTo investigate the evolutionary history of E ORF CpG composition in the human-infecting coronaviruses, a phylogenetic reconstruction of all 7 human coronavirus and 96 bat coronavirus E https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/vevolu genes was performed to determine whether CpG ratios in this region were ancestrally derived. As expected (Cotten et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2020) , the human viruses were interspersed among the bat viruses, reflective of their independent emergence events (Fig. 4C) . The CpG compositions of the human coronavirus E ORFs, although diverse, were similar to the CpG compositions of their phylogenetically proximal bat relatives, demonstrating that CpG composition in E ORF is an ancestrally derived trait selected prior to emergence in the human population."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We have examined the CpG O:E ratios of all the currently available complete genome sequences of coronaviruses and uncovered a noteworthy diversity. Generally, the CpG O:E ratio of coronavirus genomes from a single host species varied considerably. For bats, which serve as a coronavirus reservoir (Banerjee et al., 2019) and which had the largest number of representative sequences, the (Atkinson et al., 2014; Gaunt et al., 2016) . This highlights the importance of CpG as a pathogenassociated molecular pattern (PAMP), and so this diversity in CpG expression within the Coronaviridae is striking. If coronaviruses also produce a protein with anti-ZAP activity, it is possible that this has variable efficacy between strains, explaining the ability of coronaviruses to fluctuate CpG composition considerably. Alternatively (or in addition), this may be host driven; we show that average CpG suppression varies with host species (Fig. 2C ) and, as previously suggested (Xia, 2020), this may be linked with ZAP expression levels. We have demonstrated that CpG variation is not related to viral taxonomic grouping ( Fig. 2B ) but we did find an association between viral CpG composition and primary replication site, with respiratory coronaviruses having a lower CpG composition than enteric ones (Fig. 2E) . This is the opposite of what has been previously suggested (Xia, 2020), though this proposal was not supported by any comprehensive investigation. Nevertheless, our meta-analysis was subject to the sampling preferences of many labs who have performed surveillance for coronaviruses and many of the tissue tropism assignments we made have not been verified by experimental infections. Another limitation of this analysis is that only sequences of greater than 10% divergence were included, and while this overcomes some sampling bias we cannot assume that datapoints are independent (which is why statistical comparisons are not included). Notably, tissue tropism can be defined by much smaller divergences; for example, a deletion in the spike protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (a porcine coronavirus) altered the tropism of the virus from enteric to respiratory, while nucleotide identity was preserved at 96% (Cox et al., 1990; Rasschaert et al., https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/vevolu 1990). Further study on tissue tropisms of coronaviruses, as well as tissue expression profiles and antiviral activities of ZAP are needed to validate these analyses.\nLoss of CpG motifs during adaptation to the human host has been previously described for influenza A virus (Greenbaum et al., 2008) , highlighting the importance of CpG composition for host adaptation.\nFor SARS-CoV-2, we determined a genomic CpG O:E ratio of 0.408, which is similar to the human genome CpG O:E ratio of 0. 2-0.4 (McClelland and Ivarie, 1982; Sved and Bird, 1990; Tomso and Bell, 2003) . Mimicry of the CpG composition of the host by ssRNA viruses is considered a mechanism to subvert detection by the innate immune response (Simmonds et al., 2013; Takata et al., 2017) and speculatively this may indicate that SARS-CoV-2 was genetically predisposed to make a host switch into humans. Similarly, the genomic CPB score of 0.048 indicates that SARS-CoV-2 uses codon pairs which are preferentially utilised in the human ORFeome, which may mean that the virus was well suited for translational efficiency in humans at its time of emergence.\nIn coding regions which do not have overlapping ORFs, there is no requirement at the coding level for CpG motifs to be retained (Kanaya et al., 2001) . E ORF and ORF10 are not known to be in overlapping reading frames; conversely, ORF9b overlaps with the ORF for nucleocapsid (N). Some CpG retention in this region is therefore inevitable and may explain the high CpG composition of ORF9b. This nevertheless leaves open the question of why CpG motifs are retained in the E ORF and ORF10 regions (if this is not an ancestrally derived evolutionary hangover; as CpGs have not been lost from these regions between 2013 and now ( Fig. 3D) , this seems unlikely). CpG motifs may serve various non-exclusive purposes, including providing secondary structure (Rima and McFerran, 1997) , intentionally stimulating ZAP activity (by analogy with multiple viruses intentionally triggering NF-kB (Hiscott et al., 2001) ), or providing m5c methylation sites (Dev et al., 2017; Khoddami and Cairns, 2013; Squires et al., 2012) .\nIt is also possible that CpG enrichment serves as a strategy for regulating translation. Conceivably, the high CpG content at the 5' end of the E ORF transcript destines this for degradation via ZAP or CBP-associated mechanisms (Groenke et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2007) more rapidly than other viral transcripts. This could be intentional, or an evolutionarily accepted trade-off to preserve a higher importance role for CpGs. Alternatively, E ORF and ORF10 proteins may only be required late during infection (parallels with which can be drawn from the differential temporal expression and translational efficiencies of transcripts of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (Irigoyen et al., 2016)), by which time an as-yet unidentified inhibitor of ZAP (or other CpG/CBP sensor(s)) may render CpG suppression unnecessary, as suggested for human cytomegalovirus (Lin et al., 2020).\nORF9b and ORF10 do not have their own TRSs and so whether or how these open reading frames are accessed is currently controversial; nevertheless, peptides from both have been identified by mass spectrometry from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (Davidson et al., 2020) . The ORF9b AUG transcription initiation site, which has a strong Kozak context (Kozak, 1986) , is the first AUG after and characterised method for accessing alternative ORFs used by coronaviruses and other viruses (Chenik et al., 1995; Firth and Atkins, 2010; Irigoyen et al., 2016; Lin and Lo, 1992; O'Connor and Brian, 2000; Ryabova et al., 2006; Schneider et al., 1997; Senanayake and Brian, 1997; Wise et al., 2011) . There is a lack of evidence that ORF10 is accessed via production of its own subgenomic RNA (Kim et al., 2020) ; possibly, this ORF is accessed via leaky scanning from the leader immediately preceding the N ORF. However, visual inspection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome indicated that the AUG encoding ORF10 is 24 AUGs downstream from the one initiating N ORF, making this hypothesis speculative at best. Whether the anomalous CpG composition of ORF10 is somehow involved in priming its transcription remains to be determined.\nThe transcript encoding E ORF incorporates an additional ~3.4kb of RNA and ORF10, if accessed from the transcript produced from the TRS upstream of N ORF, is present on a transcript of approximately 1.6kb in length. Whether the described CpG enriched regions are relevant as PAMPs in these contexts is currently unclear from what is known about ZAP recognition of CpG motifs. It is also worth noting that the body TRS sequence ahead of the E gene is relatively weak in SARS-CoV-2, as it is in SARS-CoV (Marra et al., 2003) , suggesting that this subgenomic mRNA may be of relatively low abundance. Of the SARS-CoV-2 transcripts which use a canonical TRS for synthesis, the donor site upstream of E ranked seventh when comparing sequencing read frequency across this site (behind reads spanning the TRS sites upstream of N, spike, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF3a, ORF8 and M ORF respectively) in Vero cells infected at a low MOI for 24 hours, indicating that E ORF is of lower abundance than most other transcripts (Kim et al., 2020) . It is therefore possible that E ORF is of sufficiently low abundance for a high CpG frequency to be physiologically inconsequential. Similar logic can be applied to ORF10, which is just 117 nucleotides in length.\nSynonymous addition of CpGs into a virus genome has been suggested as a potential novel approach to vaccine development by us and others (Atkinson et al., 2014; Burns et al., 2009; Gaunt et al., 2016; Moratorio et al., 2017) . Here we explore the evolutionary space occupied by coronaviruses in the context of their CpG composition and find that SARS-CoV-2 has a low CpG composition in comparison with other coronaviruses, but with CpG 'hotspots' in genomically disparate regions. This highlights the potential for large scale recoding of the SARS-CoV-2 genome by introduction of CpGs into multiple regions of the virus genome as a mechanism for generation of an attenuated live vaccine. Introduction of CpG into multiple sites could also be used to subvert the potential of the virus to revert to virulence through recombination. A challenge of live attenuated vaccine manufacture is to enable sufficient production of a vaccine virus that has a replication defect.

One was PEDV and one was a recombinant of PEDV and TGEV No access to paper but virus name is 'porcine respiratory virus strain OH7269' Isolated from 42-day-old turkeys with poult enteritis complex. Viral antigen was detected in the intestinal tissues. The first report of MERS isolated the virus from sputum of a patient with pneumonia; In general, patients infected with MERS usually develop pneumonia 1 of 30 bats was positive for RdRp in the intestinal specimen, but not in respiratory specimen. Shared 99% identity with SARSr-BatCoV Rf1 ; Refer to 38) DQ412042.1 5 of 95 bats were found to be RdRp-positive in intestinal specimens, none in respiratory specimens 1-day-old chicks were challenged with 3575/08 intranasally. H&E staining showed abnormalities of tracheal and kidney tissues. Viral RNA was detected in lung and kidney samples. Isolated from a dog with mild respiratory infection FECV (or FRECV) were shown to be associated with epizootic catarrhal enteritis which caused diarrhea, lethargy, anorexia and vomiting in ferrets. FECV-N gene was detected in faeces and saliva. FECV RNA and antigen were detected in the cytoplasm of enterocytes at the villi tips in the jejunum, not found in the large intestine, lymph nodes, spleen, esophagus, stomach, and parotid salivary glands. PEDV highly virulent strain PC22A passaged 100 times in Vero cells; sample and replication site refer to original sample and paper Associated with FIP so should be enteric, but lung sample recorded on NCBI The lab had been isolating a lot of viruses from fresh intestines and faecal samples, but they did not detect this strain. This strain was isolated during their attempt to isolate other viruses from the nasal swab.\nNasal swabs collected from swine presenting with ILI; PMID link is presumptive based on author names Nasal swabs collected from swine presenting with ILI; PMID link is presumptive based on author names Detected CoV RdRp only in the intestinal tissues of 53 bats. In CoV N IHC, N antigen was detected in 5 lung samples which also showed positive viral RNA in the intestines. Isolated from trachea and kidneys collected from a chicken with severe respiratory signs and diarrhea. Post mortem examination showed abnormalities in trachea and kidneys; Virus was detected in tracheal and oropharyngeal swab of 1-day-old chicks which were infected oculonasally Isolated from chickens with respiratory disease. Chickens infected with L1148 at low passage showed ciliostasis and lesions at the kidney. Virus at high passage (>80) lost its replication at kidney, but the virus was still detected in trachea (IHC) and oropharyngeal swab (RT-PCR) This virus isolate was detected in oral swab. The authors collected a lot of oral swabs, but only a few of other samples and we don't know if the other samples were from the same bat. Since the virus was isolated from oral swab, it might suggest the virus to be respiratory. Related publication PMID -31076983 Porcine haemagglitining encephalomyelitis virus; PHEV propagates via neural circuitry and replicates in nerve cells of CNS Sequences are derived from an outbreak of diarrhoea in pigs, though sample collection type and replication site are not described; this is presumptive based on knowledge of PEDV Infected horses had diarrhea. N gene was detected in faecal sample and negative in nasal swab Authors suggest the virus to be enteric because the nucleotide sequence shared >90% identity with FRECV MSU-2. Refer to 120) KX512809.1 for details of FRECV 1 of 18 pigeon samples tested were positive for HKU30 CoV 5 of 10 quail samples tested were positive for HKU30 CoV Isolated from guinea fowl with peracute enteritis; H&E staining showed lesions in duodenum and intestines. Viral antigen was also found in duodenum and lower intestinal tract by IHC Newborn piglets infected with GDS04 via oral feeding developed mild diarrhea at 1-4 dpi and showed severe watery diarrhea, vomitting and dehydration at 5-12 dpi. Tissues from two GDS04-infected piglets showed the virus detection in 2/2 hearts, 2/2 livers, 2/2 spleens, 2/2 kidneys, 2/2 stomachs, and 1/2 lungs. Lesion was only detected in intestinal tract, not any other organ. Five 3-day-old piglets infected with SeACoV showed acute vomiting and watery diarrhea at 27-40 hpi; Another strain of SeACoV (SADS-CoV) was detected only in intestinal tissues of sick pigs (n=3); Infection of SeACoV in C57BL/6J mice showed the presence of N gene in intestinal, stomach and spleen tissues at 1 dpi, but replication of virus was detected only in 3 dpi spleen tissues (not intestines) by IHC staining of dsRNA, virus M and NSP3 (replication in mice might be different) A lot of studies suggest dual tropism of A59. Mice infected with A59 showed hepatitis, mild encephalitis and demyelination Chickens were inoculated by the eye drop method with K2. Infected chickens showed respiratory problems and nephritis. Virus was successfully re-isolated from trachea, lung, cecal tonsil, kidney and bursa.\nChickens infected with IS-1494 showed depression, ruffled feathers, nasal discharge, coughing and mild watery diarrhea. Gross examination and H&E staining found abnormalities in trachea, lungs and kidney. Viral RNA was detected in trachea, lung, faeces, cecal tonsil, proventriculus, spleen and kidney The first paper reported NL63 isolated the virus from nasopharyngeal aspirate of a patient with bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis; Patients infected with NL63 usually develop respiratory diseases Isolated from a chicken with swollen kidney; Chickens were inoculated with IBS130/2015 intraoculary. Infected chickens developed lesions in trachea, lungs and kidneys. Viral antigen was detected in trachea, kidney, lung, jejunum and cecal tonsil, but not in proventriculus. Viral RNA was also found in all the organs tested including proventriculus.\nHeart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, brain, and intestinal tissues were collected from 3 HKU9infected bats. 2 bats showed HKU9 gene expression in kidney, heart, lung and intestinal tissues whereas the remaining bat showed the presence of HKU9 only detected in kidney, heart and intestinal tissues. All the tissues exihited similar levels of HKU9 except one of the bats had about 10000-fold higher levels of HKU9 in intestinal tissues than the other tissues.; Refer to 5) EF065516.1 for more isolates of HKU9 3-day-old suckling BALB/c rats were intracerebrally inoculated with 20 \u03bcl of volume grinding supernatant of ZC45 intestinal tissue. Brain, lungs, intestine, and liver tissues were removed from infected rats on 14 dpi. Varying degrees of inflammation were observed in H&E staining of those tissues, but inflammation in brain tissues was the most evident. N protein antigen was shown in brain and lung tissues (highest level in brain) by western blotting. qRT-PCR detected the highest levels of virus in lung tissues.\nAnother HKU4 isolate. Refer to 69) NC_009019.1 and 5) EF065516.1\nAnother HKU4 isolate. Refer to 69) NC_009019.1 and 5) EF065516.1 Another HKU5 isolate. Refer to 75) EF065512.1 and 5) EF065516.1 Another HKU5 isolate. Refer to 75) EF065512.1 and 5) EF065516.1 Isolated from tracheal samples. The authors by including the upper part of the ceca (containing the cecal tonsils), this increased the isolation scores greatly. Isolated from a chicken with nephritis, depression, and slight respiratory signs. Twenty-day-old chickens inoculated with HH06 exhibited depression, coughing, sneezing, dyspnea, and diarrhea. Necropsy of the infected chickens also showed abnormalities in kidney and respiratory tract. Isolated from quails with acute enteritis. Short-lived diarrhea appeared in the parents and offspring developed diarrhea on day 2-4 of life Isolated from a pheasant with tracheitis and nephritis. Virus was detected in the oropharyngeal swab of chickens infected with this pheasant I0623/17 virus. No virus detected in cloacal swab. Viral replication was also found in the trachea and lung, but not kidney, of the infected chickens.\nLHB/110617 was isolated from a chicken with respiratory disease. LHB/110615 (isolated by the same group), which has 99.7% sequence identity with LHB/110617, showed high virus titre in trachea sample (minimal virus was detected in kidney sample) Isolated from a chicken with respiratory problems Isolated from chickens with nephritis CoV infection was associated with hedgehogs with green and yellow faeces.\nThere are other HKU23 strains isolated from faecal samples 229E-related HKU4-related This is the most closely related bat sequence to SARS-CoV-2; sample collected in 2013 (RaTG13) In general, respiratory tract specimens showed the highest positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 In the same study, 6 more pangolins were tested positive and the virus was isolated from intestines (2),lungs (2), blood (1) and scale (1).\nNC_002645.1 is a laboratory-adapted strain; Another 229E strain was isolated from the nasopharyngeal swab of a patient with fever and respiratory infection; 229E causes common cold and occasionally associated with more severe respiratory infections in children Refer to 5) EF065516.1; Another study by the same group showed 29 of 99 alimentary samples were positive for RdRp, none detected in the respiratory samples Another HKU9 isolate by the same group of 5) EF065516.1. Refer to 5) EF065516.1 and 70) MG762674.1 5 of 43 Scotophilus bats were positive for RdRp and they were all detected in anal samples RdRp was detected in the alimentary specimen of 36 bats, but not in respiratory specimen; Refer to 5) EF065516.1 for more isolates of HKU2 by the same group, HKU12 was found in 4 of 365 thrushes tested (not sure whether it is from throat or cloacal swab); A HKU12 strain was isolated from rectal swab in another study by the same group HKU13 was detected in 2 of 127 munias tested (not sure whether it is from throat or cloacal swab); 6 more HKU13 strains were isolated from rectal swab in another study by the same group HKU16 was detected in 3 of 35 CoV-positive bird specimens HKU17 was detected in 7 of 35 CoV-positive bird specimens HKU18 was detected in 1 of 35 CoV-positive bird specimens HKU19 was detected in 5 of 35 CoV-positive bird specimens HKU20 was detected in 1 of 35 CoV-positive bird specimens HKU21 was detected in 1 of 35 CoV-positive bird specimens Related publication PMID -26433221\nSequence analysis of the partial spike gene showed that this virus strain is more closely related to FRSCV (CoV detected in ferrets with systemic pyogranulomatous inflammation) than FRECV. Heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, brain, and intestinal tissues were collected from 3 GCCDC1infected bats. The presence of GCCDC1 was only detected in intestinal tissues. "}]
