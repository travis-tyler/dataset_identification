[{"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "I owe thanks to so many people who, without their help and support, I could not have completed this dissertation, not to mention graduate school as a whole. First, I want to express how incredibly indebted I am to the National Science Foundation's Division of Science Resources Statistics (which in early 2011 became the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics), without which this entire project would not exist. The NSF, in conjunction with the USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service, provided financial support for this research under a cooperative agreement  to Don Dillman, who I have worked for as a research assistant under these funds. Not only did the NSF's financial support make this work possible, but the SRS Division also provided me with access to the datasets I used in this project. Additionally, the SRS Division's encouragement of and interest in this research, and in particular the feedback I received from Nimmi Kannankutty and Jeri Mulrow, gave me a sense that my dissertation research was important and meaningful, something that means more to me than I can express. I also feel incredibly indebted to my committee. I want to thank the chair of my committee, Monica Johnson, whose help and feedback throughout my entire graduate career, and especially for this dissertation, has been excellent. I am so grateful for Monica's commitment to working with me in the past few years, even though my research did not end up being very closely aligned with her own. I also am so very thankful for her support and understanding during the lengthy period of time in which I struggled to make progress after taking exams. I am so appreciative that Monica was willing to encourage me through this period in which I felt certain I did not have what it takes to finish my Ph.D. I also want to express my gratitude for another of my committee members, Don Dillman, whose relationship with NSF provided me with the incredible opportunity to conduct this dissertation research. Not only that, but I also feel so very lucky to have been first hired by Don in the summer of 2008, because this moment dramatically changed the trajectory of my graduate career. I want to thank Don not only for making this dissertation project happen, but also for, in general, believing in me and providing me with opportunities I had never fathomed. Without his encouragement, I don't think I would have had the confidence to make it this far. I also want to express my gratitude for Julie Kmec, my other committee member. Julie's guidance has been an integral part of my graduate career from day one, and I owe much of my sense of what makes a good researcher to things I learned from her. I am so appreciative of Julie's help in conceptualizing and improving this project along the way. Not only that, but I also feel very indebted to her willingness to brainstorm with me as I struggled to find a dissertation topic, and her encouragement when I was directionless and doubtful. I would also like to acknowledge my interviewees, whose participation made this project a success. I am also incredibly grateful for the help of Rita Koontz, Lindsey Trimble, Joe King, Thom Allen, Jessanne Price, and Jaime Colyar, without whom I would not have been able to pull off and complete the interview process! I feel so lucky to have had so much help and support from so many people. I also owe thanks not just to those who have helped me with my dissertation specifically, but to those who have contributed to my entire graduate training. I am grateful for many faculty members in the WSU Sociology department, past and present, with whom I have interacted throughout my graduate career. They have taught me so much over the years, and I am thankful to have had the opportunity to learn from so many talented people. I am also incredibly indebted to the many wonderful friends and role models I have found among my fellow graduate students in the WSU sociology program. I have gained so much, both professionally and personally, from relationships with them. Most importantly, I am thankful for Lindsey Trimble, who has been here with me every step of the way and provided more support than I can v describe. Her encouragement and empathy throughout this journey has made it all much more bearable, and I feel so lucky to have found such a wonderful friend. I also am so thankful for my parents, siblings, siblings-in-law, and nephews and niece. Their love, support, and pride in my accomplishments have sustained me through so much. I realize that my singleminded dedication to my education (which we all know began much earlier than grad school) has gotten in the way many times. But they have nonetheless stood by me even though I could have been a much better daughter, sister, and aunt than I have been. I need to give special thanks to my brother, Brandon. He instilled in me the desire and appreciation for learning which has come to define me, and the drive to give all I have to making the most out of my educational opportunities. Without him as a role model, I simply would not have had many of those opportunities, and I certainly would not be where I am today. Last, but certainly not least, I am so thankful for Paul, Chaco, and Rosie. I cannot say how much appreciation I feel for my little family. I came to WSU on my own, not knowing if Paul would be able or willing to follow me the next year. But with no hesitation, he sacrificed bigger and better opportunities, in a place he would have found much more pleasant, just so that we could all be together again. I feel forever indebted to Paul for this amazing act of selfless devotion. He, along with Chaco and Rosie (our two incredibly eccentric, often frustrating, but always entertaining, dogs) have kept me grounded and helped me realize what really matters. I made it through this process with their support, and look forward to moving on to the next adventure with them. 1. INTRODUCTION ........................................................................................................................ "}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "\"It is widely acknowledged that American research universities are experiencing a period of profound change\" (Brint 2005: 23). Among other changes, many commentators note that institutions of higher education have become more attuned to economic forces. One consequence of this is an increased emphasis on ways universities can compete and stand out among the other choices available. Brint (2005) argued that some universities take a familiar path toward recognition, which involves strengthening their standings in traditional disciplines. Conversely, others are attempting to gain recognition by following new, \"cutting edge\" paths. One of the most popular new directions arising out of this process is the encouragement of \"interdisciplinary creativity.\" Indeed, within the academic and scientific communities, interdisciplinary research has become very popular in recent years. Many researchers and institutions of higher education praise interdisciplinarity as a problem-solving tool that is necessary as today's scientific problems become increasingly complex (Klein 1990;Lattuca 2001). A variety of stakeholders, including those in the academic, private industry, government, and non-profit sectors have invested a great deal in interdisciplinary research endeavors. As these different organizations continue to promote interdisciplinarity, it is important for the scientific community to critically examine interdisciplinary research so that we may better understand what it is, who uses it, and how it affects those who use it. As of yet, there is limited research examining the process and outcomes of interdisciplinary research (Jacobs and Frickel 2009;Klein 1990;Lattuca 2001). Although the word \"interdisciplinary\" is used quite frequently, there is no consensus on a precise definition of the term, and no agreement about how to measure and identify interdisciplinary research (Wagner, Roessner, and Bobb 2009). Additionally, we lack understanding about the effects of interdisciplinary research on the careers of individuals who conduct it. Furthermore, despite numerous speculations, we do not know much about who is using it, for example, whether women or men are more likely to pursue interdisciplinary research. This dissertation is an effort to begin to address some of these issues. Its purpose is to answer important questions about this popular movement within the academic and scientific communities. I do not address whether interdisciplinarity is a superior/inferior mode of conducting research (for examples of this research see Hacket and Rhoten 2009;Birnbaum 1981a;Birnbaum 1981b), or what effects it has on knowledge creation and scientific advancement. Rather, I seek to understand interdisciplinary research from the perspective of individuals who use it. In this dissertation I examine interdisciplinarity as it relates to individuals who are either nearing the completion of their doctoral degrees or have recently earned their doctorates. This research focuses on recent doctorate recipients for several reasons. First, if interdisciplinary research continues to expand and becomes increasingly integrated into the research process (which its popularity suggests it might), new doctoral graduates will likely play an important role in shaping the future of this movement. Furthermore, since these individuals are some of the first scholars to be trained during this time when interdisciplinary research has become an important part of academic research, they are in a unique position to evaluate the nature of this process. Additionally, recent doctoral graduates' career paths have likely been influenced by the interdisciplinary movement more so than any prior cohorts of doctoral recipients. Therefore, these individuals' experiences with interdisciplinary research are the most valuable in our attempts to study the impacts of this movement. This dissertation consists of three sets of analyses, which together advance knowledge not only about what constitutes interdisciplinary research, but also how it is measured, and how it affects those who use it. The first set of analyses addresses the following questions: how do doctoral researchersboth those who consider themselves to be interdisciplinary and those who do not-define interdisciplinary research? Do they distinguish between interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research? How can we best identify doctoral candidates who conduct interdisciplinary research? The second set of analyses explores the following questions: what is the impact of conducting interdisciplinary research on doctoral graduates' early career outcomes? Do interdisciplinary researchers' career placements and opportunities differ from those of non-interdisciplinary researchers? And finally, the third set of analyses addresses these questions: do men and women pursue interdisciplinary research at different rates? What implications does interdisciplinary research have for sex differences in early career outcomes? Can interdisciplinary research serve to reduce existing sex segregation in the scientific labor force? What is Interdisciplinary Research? Defining interdisciplinary research is not straightforward because there are numerous definitions of the phenomenon. In general, the literature on interdisciplinary research tends to assume that there is an underlying disciplinary structure to science and knowledge creation (Wagner et al. 2009), and characterizes interdisciplinary research in contrast to this structure. The Centre for Educational Research and Innovation held the first international conference on interdisciplinarity in 1970, and was one of the first entities to offer a comprehensive definition of the concept. Their definition has influenced current conceptualizations of interdisciplinarity (Klein 1990). They defined interdisciplinarity as follows: Interdisciplinary: An adjective describing the interaction among two or more different disciplines. This interaction may range from simple communication of ideas to the mutual integration of organizing concepts, methodology, procedures, epistemology, terminology, data, and organization of research and education in a fairly large field. An interdisciplinary group consists of persons trained in different fields of knowledge (disciplines) with different concepts, methods, and data in terms organized into a common effort on a common problem with continuous intercommunication among the participants from the different disciplines (OECD 1972: 25-26). This definition is broad, therefore allowing for a variety of different types of interdisciplinarity. However, many recent definitions are more specific and less inclusive, or focus only on certain aspects of this broader definition. A common characteristic of many of these specific definitions of interdisciplinary research is that they stress the integrative nature of interdisciplinary research and its problem-solving orientation. The National Academy of Sciences' definition, which is also used by the National Science Foundation, exhibits these qualities. In a report entitled Facilitating Interdisciplinary Research, the National Academies defined interdisciplinary research as a mode of research by teams or individuals that integrates information, data, techniques, tools, perspectives, concepts, and/or theories from two or more disciplines or bodies of specialized knowledge to advance fundamental understanding or to solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline or area of research practice (National Academies 2004:2). The National Academies' report also identified four powerful \"drivers\" of the increasing emphasis on interdisciplinary research. These include the \"inherent complexity of nature and society, the desire to explore problems and questions that are not confined to a single discipline, the need to solve societal problems, and the power of new technologies\" (2004: 2). Definitions that focus on the integrative and problem-solving nature of interdisciplinary research often stress how interdisciplinary research provides a more comprehensive perspective that is corrective of the narrow focus of disciplinary approaches (for examples see Klein and Newell 1996;Wagner et al. 2009;Klein 1990;Lattuca 2001). Menand (2010) explained that the case for interdisciplinarity is based on the idea that singlediscipline approaches are holding knowledge back. Most proponents of interdisciplinarity argue that single-discipline research is problematic because it constrains the range of questions asked, methods used, and answers that are considered legitimate (Lattuca 2001). In contrast, they see interdisciplinarity as a problem-solving approach that has the potential to transform research in a way that transcends the limitations and constraints that single disciplines create. Many believe that interdisciplinary research is more likely to lead to breakthroughs in scientific knowledge (Wagner et al. 2009). Others are less enthusiastic about the potential of interdisciplinary research. Skeptics question whether interdisciplinarity is as revolutionary as proponents suggest (Jacobs and Frickel 2009;Menand 2010). Jacobs and Frickel (2009) explained that the assumptions about the inherent potential of interdisciplinary research have not been tested empirically. Similarly, Menand (2010) insisted that interdisciplinarity is not transformational, but rather is a reinforcement of existing, disciplinary arrangements. According to Menand, interdisciplinarity is simply \"disciplinarity raised to a higher power\" (2010: 96). Observers note that there is a great deal of uncertainty and ambiguity surrounding the various definitions of interdisciplinarity, and a lack of consensus among various authors (Jacobs and Frickel 2009;Klein 1990). Some scholars, despite their work cataloging the various definitions, remain uncommitted to one definition (Wagner et al. 2009). And since scholars of interdisciplinarity tend to be isolated from each others' work, there is no common identity or definitions (Klein 1990). The lack of consensus about the definition of interdisciplinarity has prevented researchers from truly examining this trend and its implications, and may also be hindering the potential of interdisciplinarity to truly transform research in the ways its proponents claim it can. Another source of confusion surrounding the definition of interdisciplinarity is other, related terms that are also used, including \"multidisciplinarity\" and \"transdisciplinarity.\" Some scholars make clear distinctions between each of these terms in order to distinguish between the degree to which the multiple fields involved are connected through the research process (Jacobs and Frickel 2009). Although the specifics of the definitions are different, most of those who make distinctions between the terms argue that multidisciplinary research is not quite integrative, interdisciplinary research is truly integrative of the various disciplines, and transdisciplinary research is so integrative that is moves beyond disciplines (Klein 1990;Jacobs and Frickel 2009). Multidisciplinary research is considered to be additive in that the multiple disciplines work in juxtaposition with each other without integrating. Multidisciplinary approaches add diversity by using perspectives from multiple disciplines, but each discipline retains its original identity (Wagner et al. 2009). Interdisciplinary research, on the other hand, is viewed as more integrative of the different disciplines than the additive methods of multidisciplinary research (Klein 1990). The integrated synthesis is believed to be different and superior to a mere summation of disciplines (Wagner et al. 2009). Transdisciplinary research consists of processes that move beyond the notion of disciplines completely (Klein 1990). Transdisciplinary approaches are comprehensive frameworks with an overarching synthesis; examples include theoretical concepts such as feminism or sustainability (Wagner et al. 2009). When relying on these distinct definitions, Klein (1990) argued that most research that is referred to as interdisciplinary is actually multidisciplinary, and transdisciplinary approaches are rare. However, despite the fact that the literature is full of disputes about the distinctions between these terms and hierarchies, Klein (1990) contended that the hierarchies may be ill-advised because there is not any well-developed theory behind the distinctions. Indeed, these distinctions are not explicitly operationalized in the literature. Also, although interdisciplinary research theorists make these distinctions, it does not appear as if these distinctions are salient to most researchers. All of these debates highlight the need for more research to understand the nature of interdisciplinary research. In particular, we need more insight into how average researchers define and think about interdisciplinary research, rather than relying on theoretical arguments which may be disconnected from the practice. Without identifying how interdisciplinary research is defined within the academic community, we cannot fully understand or study this movement. Furthermore, without an explicit and agreed-upon definition, the interdisciplinary movement may not be capable of achieving its goals. For the sake of simplicity, and because there is no clear definition and operationalization of the distinct terms, in this dissertation I use the term \"interdisciplinary\" in a general sense to refer to all research that uses multiple disciplines (expect in cases where I explicitly contrast it to other forms such as multidisciplinary)."}, {"section_title": "Career Consequences of Interdisciplinary Research", "text": "There is no doubt that large portions of the academic community now hold interdisciplinary approaches in high regard. Many organizations are promoting interdisciplinary research, but we know little about how this affects the individuals who conduct it. Despite its popularity, there is a widespread assumption that interdisciplinary researchers face a number career obstacles, particularly within academia (Lattuca 2001;Pfirman et al. no date;National Academies 2004). Numerous commentators suggest that the barriers interdisciplinary scholars face is a result of the disciplinary structure of research and academic departments (Lattuca 2001;Pfirman et al. no date;Hart and Mars 2008;National Academies 2004). For example, interdisciplinary researchers may be disadvantaged in obtaining academic positions, since they may not \"fit\" well within single-discipline departments, and joint appointments are rare (National Academies 2004). Indeed, most academic job postings are not seeking interdisciplinary scholars (Borrego and Newswander In press). Furthermore, many also assume that interdisciplinary scholars are disadvantaged in tenure and promotion processes (Lattuca 2001;National Academies 2004). Lattuca's (2001) research found that academics believed it was risky to conduct interdisciplinary research before receiving tenure, since tenure assessment is based on discipline-specific standards. Despite these common assumptions, to date there has been little systematic examination of interdisciplinary researchers' career prospects. Furthermore, the popularity of interdisciplinary research suggests that in some contexts, interdisciplinary approaches may not be frowned upon (Brint 2005). This implies that interdisciplinary researchers' prospects may not be as dismal as they are made out to be. All of this uncertainty illustrates that this literature is in great need of rigorous, large scale analyses to determine if and how interdisciplinary scholars' careers differ from those of their non-interdisciplinary counterparts."}, {"section_title": "Gendering Interdisciplinary Research", "text": "Many commentators also assume that interdisciplinary research is a gendered phenomenon (Jacobs and Frickel 2009;. That is, many believe that women are more likely to participate in interdisciplinary research, and that women are more interested in interdisciplinary science than traditional scientific research. Indeed,  found that women are more likely than men to participate in a variety of activities associated with interdisciplinary science research. These authors also suggested that interdisciplinary research may be a promising method of attracting women into STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). Women continue to be underrepresented in the STEM fields in all levels of education (National Center for Education Statistics 2009;England et al. 2007;Charles and Bradley 2002). This has consequences for occupational sex segregation, which contributes to the sex gap in pay (Bayard et al. 2003; Petersen and Morgan 1995;Cotter et al. 1997). Many academic institutions, government agencies, and non-profit organizations express concern for these disparities, and invest a great deal of resources in efforts to increase women's participation in the STEM fields. If women are indeed more interested in interdisciplinary science than traditional science, then encouraging them to conduct interdisciplinary research may be an effective way at reducing sex segregation, as well as the inequalities that result from it. However, existing research as not adequately determined if women are more likely to conduct interdisciplinary research. Furthermore, no prior research has examined whether interdisciplinary research has the potential to alleviate sex segregation. Additionally, if interdisciplinary research has negative consequences for individuals' careers, as many suggest, then promoting women's involvement in interdisciplinary science may not be an effective means for reducing other labor market inequalities that exist between men and women. More research is needed to understand the complex relationship between sex, interdisciplinary science research, and career prospects. Using the Survey of Earned Doctorates and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients to Understand"}, {"section_title": "Interdisciplinary Research", "text": "The debates described above make it clear that research has yet to give us a clear picture of the nature and consequences of interdisciplinary research. Many scholars call for more research to assess the impacts of interdisciplinarity. In this dissertation, I address this lack of knowledge in several ways. I first focus on the issues involved in defining and measuring interdisciplinary research. I also examine the effects of interdisciplinary research on the early careers of individuals who pursue it. Additionally, I determine whether there are sex differences in the likelihood of conducting interdisciplinary research, and whether it plays any role in shaping sex inequalities in the early careers of doctoral recipients. All of the analyses in this dissertation are centered on an indicator of interdisciplinary research from the National Science Foundation's Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). This survey, and its followup, the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), are the most comprehensive, representative, and detailed sources of data on doctoral graduates in the United States. Furthermore, the SED is the first dataset to attempt to identify doctoral students who conduct interdisciplinary research. This makes these sources of data invaluable for the examination of interdisciplinary research at the individual level. The SED has been conducted annually since 1957 by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in order to collect data on the number and characteristics of individuals who earn research doctoral degrees from all accredited U.S. institutions (NSF no date). All doctoral students are asked to complete the survey, making it a near-complete census of doctorate earners. Its results play an important role in helping academic institutions as well government agencies in policy planning relevant to higher education. The SED collects information about individuals' research and degrees, academic institutions, educational finances, post-graduation plans, and demographics. The NSF also sponsors the SDR, which is a nationally-representative longitudinal sample survey of individuals who have earned research doctorates in the science, engineering, and health fields (NSF no date). This survey is conducted every two years to understand and predict trends in employment outcomes of doctorate recipients in the United States. The primary sampling frame for the SDR comes from respondents of the SED. This allows researchers to consider factors related to doctorate earners' educations (as collected in the SED) when examining employment outcomes identified through the SDR. Aggregate data from these two surveys, which are useful in understanding key trends, are published by the NSF in a variety of reports. However, due to the sensitive nature of some of the individual-level information contained in these datasets, researchers wishing to analyze the data must enter into a licensing agreement with the NSF. The research reported in Chapters 3 and 4 of this dissertation utilized restricted-access data obtained through a licensing agreement between the NSF and Washington State University. The SED is valuable for understanding interdisciplinary research because it collects information about the fields of study its respondents use in their dissertation research. The SED asks doctorate earners to write in the name of the field of their dissertation research, and then enter in a corresponding three-digit code from a provided list of fields. Before 2001, respondents could only indicate one field to describe their research. Beginning in 2001, respondents were given the option of reporting both a primary as well as a secondary field, if applicable. The question that was introduced in 2001 read as follows: Using the Specialties List (page 7), please write the name and number of the primary field of your dissertation research."}, {"section_title": "Name of Field", "text": "\n\n\n"}, {"section_title": "Number of Field", "text": "If you had a secondary field for your dissertation research, list the name and number.\nIn 2004, the wording of this question was slightly changed. The new question incorporated the term \"interdisciplinary:\" Please write the name of the primary field of your dissertation research.\nIf you had a secondary field for your dissertation research, list the name and number.\n"}, {"section_title": "Name of field", "text": "Using the list on page 7, choose the code that best describes the primary field of your dissertation research.\n\nUsing the list on page 7, choose the code that best describes the primary field of your dissertation research.\n"}, {"section_title": "Number of field", "text": "If your dissertation was interdisciplinary, list the name and number of your secondary field.\nWhen this new version, which is still currently used, was introduced in 2004, respondents could then also indicate two additional fields (for a total of four fields, if applicable). The NSF has identified these two questions as possible indicators of interdisciplinary research (Falkenheim 2010). That is, if respondents indicate two or more fields for these questions, this could suggest that their dissertation research is interdisciplinary. However, because there is no consensus on how to best define and measure interdisciplinary research, the usefulness of these two indicators has remained unknown. This uncertainty about whether these two questions are accurate indicators of interdisciplinary research led the NSF to encourage and support the interviews which are analyzed in the first project of this dissertation. The results of these interviews, which are discussed in more detail in a technical report delivered to the NSF (Millar and Dillman 2010a), provide insights into the accuracy of these interdisciplinary indicators, as well as allowed me to explore how individuals define and think about interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research. Thus, knowledge gained from these interviews shaped the analyses of the SED and SDR data contained in the second and third projects of this dissertation. The NSF has made concerted efforts to promote and understand interdisciplinary research, and with this aim, the NSF's Division of Science Resources Statistics, in association with the United States Department of Agriculture, provided funding for this research through a cooperative agreement with the Social and Economic Sciences Research Center at Washington State University.\nIf your dissertation was interdisciplinary, list the name and number of your secondary field.\nTherefore, on behalf of NSF, these interviews also aimed to evaluate how respondents interpret and respond to these questionnaire items in order to better understand whether and how they capture interdisciplinary research processes. I address the following questions: Are the dissertation research field(s) questions of the SED adequate indicators of interdisciplinary research? Do the two versions of the question elicit different types of responses? Does the use of the term \"multidisciplinary\" in this question yield different types of responses? Does the use of a pre-established list of fields from which respondents must choose from affect how they respond to these items? Answering these questions is important from a methodological as well as a substantive standpoint. We need clear guidelines for how to accurately identify interdisciplinary researchers in order to study and understand the interdisciplinary movement. As of yet, there is has been little broad-scale research examining the state of interdisciplinary research in the academic community as well as its effects on knowledge production. Many commentators mention how an increasing number of universities are adopting interdisciplinary approaches or encouraging interdisciplinary research. However, no research to date has systematically identified these institutions or what they are doing in terms of interdisciplinary advancement. We cannot understand its scope or its impacts until we determine what it is, and in turn, how to identify and measure it. Additionally, beyond a purely methodological argument for understanding interdisciplinary for the sake of simply advancing knowledge of the movement, identifying what it is and how to measure it is critical for universities and funding organizations to be able to successfully promote it. These organizations will not be able to effectively support and encourage high-quality interdisciplinary research without having a way to communicate with others from a variety of backgrounds about it, nor will they be able to identify and track it. This is related to the first goals of this chapter, which are to better understand what interdisciplinary research is. Together, these research goals of exploring the meaning as well as the measurement of interdisciplinary research will not only better allow researchers to understand the nature and consequences of the interdisciplinary movement, but they also have the potential of better equipping the movement itself with the tools it needs to effectively accomplish its goals of moving beyond traditional disciplinary approaches and advancing fundamental understanding about complex scientific problems."}, {"section_title": "Frequency of Interdisciplinary Research and Trends over Time", "text": "Before explaining the primary analyses of this project, it is useful to examine some basic trends in the reporting of multiple fields of dissertation research (in other words, interdisciplinary research) on the SED. 1 From 20011 From -2008.9% of doctoral recipients reported multiple fields of dissertation research. Table 1.1 documents the number of respondents who reported multiple dissertation fields each year from 2001 to 2008. The percent of respondents who reported two or more fields was only 24% in 2001, but was almost 29% in 2008. However, there was not a clear linear trend upward during this time frame. Although the proportion who reported two or more fields is significantly lower in 2001 than any of the following years, the highest percentage of respondents who reported two or more fields was in 2005 (30%). After this, there is more similarity in the rates of interdisciplinarity. It does not appear that the change in question wording in 2004 had much effect on the percent reporting two or more fields. As mentioned earlier, the SED includes a coded list of fields of study from which individuals can select when reporting the fields of their dissertation research, as well as the field in which their doctoral degree is awarded. This list groups the different fields of study codes into 12 broader field categories or knowledge domains, which are listed in the first column of The field category with the highest proportion of interdisciplinary dissertations is communication, in which nearly 36% of doctorates report multiple fields of research. The next highest rate of interdisciplinary dissertation research, 33.8%, is found in the life sciences. The lowest incidence of interdisciplinary research is for the computer and information sciences fields; only 18.3% of doctorates in these fields report interdisciplinary dissertations. Mathematics doctorates are also relatively less likely to report interdisciplinary dissertations; the rate for math is 21%. The third lowest rate of interdisciplinary research is in psychology, which is 21.8%. It is also interesting to examine the types of fields that are reported together among those respondents who indicate multiple fields of dissertation research. According to the SED data, about 64% of the doctorate recipients who reported multiple research fields from 2001-2008 reported a secondary field that is closely related to their primary dissertation field, and 36% report a distantly related secondary field. 3 This suggests that a majority of respondents who conducted interdisciplinary dissertation research reported two similar fields of research. Figure 1.1 displays the percent of 3 I classified each secondary field of research by how closely related it is to its corresponding primary field of dissertation research. If the secondary field is in the same knowledge domain/field category (as defined by the SED's taxonomy) as the primary field (e.g. cellular biology combined with molecular biology), then these two disciplines could be considered to be \"closely\" related. If the fields are from two different field categories (e.g. biology combined with sociology) then they are considered to be \"distantly\" related. Those who report a primary field that is classified in the \"other fields not elsewhere classified\" (miscellaneous) category are not included in any of these analyses. This miscellaneous category contains a variety of fields that are not related to each other in any meaningful way, so it does not make sense to compare them, as a group, to other fields. These calculations do not consider whether respondents' fields of dissertation research are closely or distantly related to the field in which they earned their degree. interdisciplinary dissertations that use two distantly related fields, as opposed to two closely related fields, broken down by year. This figure shows that the percent of interdisciplinary dissertations in which the secondary field was distantly related to the primary field increased in 2004. From 2001-2003 the rate was around 31-32%, but from 2004 onward the rate was 38 or 39%. This is notable because the question wording changed in 2004 to include the term \"interdisciplinary,\" which suggests that the two versions of the question perform differently as potential indicators of interdisciplinary research. It seems as if the inclusion of the term \"interdisciplinary\" in the question after 2004 incited more people to report distantly related fields of dissertation research. Chapter 2 addresses whether the two versions of the dissertation research field question actually do perform differently as interdisciplinary indicators."}, {"section_title": "The Analyses in this Dissertation", "text": "This dissertation is divided into five chapters. This chapter, Chapter 1, provides background information and introduces the project. Chapters 2 through 4 contain three independent papers that form the core analyses of this dissertation. Chapter 5 provides a summary of the findings and implications of this research. This dissertation as a whole aims to increase our understanding of the interdisciplinary trend from the perspective of recent doctoral graduates. The first analysis, contained in Chapter 2, examines the complexities of defining interdisciplinarity among interdisciplinary and non-interdisciplinary doctoral candidates. This chapter also evaluates methods of identifying whether individuals are involved in interdisciplinary research. There is a great deal of ambiguity and lack of consensus within the literature about how to best define interdisciplinary research (Klein 1990;Jacobs and Frickel 2009). Similarly, there is no established method of identifying interdisciplinary researchers. Therefore, I conducted a series of 30 qualitative cognitive interviews with doctoral candidates who are nearing the completion of their degrees at Washington State University in order to better understand the meaning of both interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research, and to evaluate the potential of the SED dissertation research field(s) questions as indicators of interdisciplinary dissertation research. The analyses in Chapter 2 provide insight into the complex nature of interdisciplinarity by showing the myriad ways that both \"interdisciplinary\" and \"multidisciplinary\" can be conceptualized and utilized by doctoral researchers. This has implications for how we continue to study this process, as well as how supporters of it promote its success. Also, this chapter's analysis of the SED's interdisciplinary indicators provides in-depth information about the strengths and weaknesses of SED for identifying interdisciplinary research. These results provide insight into ways to improve our study of interdisciplinary research, and are also helpful in shaping the second and third projects in this dissertation. The second analysis, in Chapter 3, examines individual-level early career outcomes of conducting interdisciplinary dissertation research. Within the literature there is a general consensus that conducting interdisciplinary research may be detrimental to career advancement, especially for graduate students and junior academic faculty (Lattuca 2001;Pfirman et al. no date;National Academies 2004). Despite this consensus, there has yet to be any systematic research to examine the consequences of interdisciplinary research on individuals' career success. Using data from the SDR, the follow-up to the SED, I determine whether and how interdisciplinary dissertation research may affect individuals' outcomes such as employment, employment in academia, job type, salary, and having research grant funding among individuals obtaining research doctorates in the sciences and social sciences in the United States in [2004][2005]. The results of this chapter provide interesting insights into several ways in which interdisciplinary researchers' early career paths may differ from other doctoral graduates, which may have implications for future career success. The third analysis of this dissertation, contained in Chapter 4, examines whether there are sex differences in the tendency to do interdisciplinary research, and what consequences interdisciplinary research may have for sex-based labor market inequalities among doctoral graduates in the sciences.  proposed that interdisciplinary research may be a gendered phenomenon, in that women may be more drawn to interdisciplinary research than men. While they did not comprehensively test this assumption, they also suggested that interdisciplinarity may be a pathway for women to enter into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (collectively, STEM fields). This could have important implications for women's participation in these fields in which they continue to be underrepresented. Furthermore, if interdisciplinary research does affect career outcomes, it is important to know if these effects differ for men and women. Using the SED, I determine if women indeed are more likely to conduct interdisciplinary dissertation research. Using the SDR with matched SED data, I also examine whether interdisciplinary research differentially affects early career outcomes of men and women who earn doctorates in the STEM fields. These outcomes include employment, type of employment, obtaining federally-funded research grants, type of work done as one's primary work activity, working as a STEM-scientist, and the sex composition of one's job category. This chapter provides valuable insight into whether interdisciplinary research has the potential to change existing patterns of sex segregation and sex-based inequalities within the scientific academic labor market. As a whole, this dissertation provides a great deal of information about interdisciplinary research from the perspective of new and soon-to-be doctoral graduates. As universities and the scientific community in general continue to encourage interdisciplinary endeavors, these individuals' career trajectories should be of much interest to those studying the interdisciplinary movement, the changing nature of science and higher education, or labor market inequalities."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER TWO WHAT CONSTITUTES INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH? AN EXAMINATION OF HOW DOCTORAL STUDENTS DEFINE AND IDENTIFY AS INTERDISCIPLINARY 4", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In recent years, the scientific and academic communities have shown increased interest in interdisciplinary research and lauded interdisciplinarity as a method of improving our ability to answer complex scientific questions (Klein 1990;Lattuca 2001). Researchers, advocates, academic institutions, and scientific foundations have made concerted efforts to promote interdisciplinary scholarship. However, there are few investigations into the process of interdisciplinary research (Jacobs and Frickel 2009;Klein 1990;Lattuca 2001). Moreover, there is no consensus about how to measure interdisciplinary research (Wagner, Roessner, and Bobb 2009). This chapter reports results from a series of 30 interviews which were designed to address some of the unanswered questions pertaining to interdisciplinary research. In this analysis, I examine how doctoral candidates conceptualize and define interdisciplinary research, and how they determine whether their research is interdisciplinary or not. Additionally, this chapter adds to the methodological debates about measuring interdisciplinary research by examining the use of a questionnaire item from the National Science Foundation's Survey of Earned Doctorates as measure of interdisciplinary research. This analysis contributes to the scholarly examination of interdisciplinary research in several ways. First, it demonstrates how interdisciplinary research is conceptualized by average doctoral students. We are aware that proponents of interdisciplinary research often utilize a specific conceptualization of interdisciplinary research that makes it distinct from other, related forms of research using multiple disciplines, such as multidisciplinary research. However, it appears that these words are used more casually in the broader academic population. We know little about how relevant these specific definitions and distinctions actually are to everyday researchers. This chapter begins to address this, using interviews with students who are involved in interdisciplinary research as well as students who are not. By better understanding what \"interdisciplinary\" means to average researchers, this study also advances our understanding about how to best identify those who conduct this form of research. This chapter also demonstrates the usefulness of one method of measuring individuals' involvement in interdisciplinary researchers through a self-administered questionnaire. By exploring the ways in which this questionnaire item from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) is both successful and unsuccessful in identifying interdisciplinary research, these interviews provide a basis for improving measures of interdisciplinarity for future survey use. Additionally, they allow insight into ways in which the SED data can be utilized to advance understanding about the individual impacts of interdisciplinary research conducted at the doctoral level.\nInterdisciplinary research has become notably popular in the scientific community (Jacobs and Frickel 2009;Klein 1990;Lattuca 2001). Many academic institutions and scientific foundations are actively promoting the use of interdisciplinary methods, and numerous researchers view interdisciplinary approaches as necessary for solving some of today's complex scientific problems. However, despite its popularity, we know very little about how the conduct of interdisciplinary research affects the scholars who use it Lattuca 2001). Many academic researchers express favorable opinions about interdisciplinary research (Menand 2010), but there appears to be widespread consensus among commentators and researchers studying interdisciplinarity that conducting interdisciplinary research may be detrimental to career advancement, especially for graduate students and junior academic faculty (Lattuca 2001; no date; Pfirman and Martin 2010; National Academies 2004). However, no research to date has systematically examined the effects of conducting interdisciplinary research on individuals' career outcomes, largely because there are few data sources appropriate for addressing such questions. The most promising source of data that is currently available for studying this topic is the National Science Foundations' surveys of doctoral graduates. These surveys, the Survey of Earned Doctorates and its follow-up, the Survey of Doctorate Recipients, are comprehensive and representative examinations of doctoral graduates in all accredited institutions of higher education within the U.S. They are valuable resources that allow us to better understand the individual-level effects of interdisciplinary research in a way that is not possible with other existing data. Using these data, I take an initial step toward understanding of the consequences of conducting interdisciplinary research. In this chapter, I assess how conducting interdisciplinary research for one's dissertation affects a variety of early career outcomes among individuals who obtained research doctorates in the sciences and social sciences in the United States from 2004-2005. These analyses are the first to use nationally-representative data when studying interdisciplinary scholars, and also the first to compare the outcomes of individuals who conduct interdisciplinary dissertation research to those who do not. The results of this chapter shed light on an important aspect of this trend toward the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of science, and provide a basis for future work to extend our knowledge of the consequences of interdisciplinary research on those who conduct it.\nResearchers are increasingly relying on interdisciplinary methods (Jacobs and Frickel 2009). However, we know little about who conducts interdisciplinary research and what consequences it has for individuals' careers. The results contained in the previous chapter illustrate how interdisciplinary research affects the early career paths of doctoral recipients in the sciences and social sciences. In this chapter, I expand on this work by examining whether the effects of interdisciplinary dissertation research are different for men and women with doctorates in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields (collectively referred to as STEM fields). Sex differences in participation in interdisciplinary research, as well as sex differences in the impact of interdisciplinary research on career outcomes, could play an important role in shaping the future of gender inequalities within the academic and scientific labor markets. Female doctorate earners continue to face a variety of obstacles within the \"hard\" sciences. Women are still less likely than men to pursue undergraduate as well as advanced degrees in many of the STEM fields. Despite women's increased participation in graduate education, they continue to be underrepresented within these fields (National Center for Education Statistics 2009; Charles and Bradley 2002). Also, those who do obtain STEM degrees face a variety of challenges within the academic/scientific labor market (Astin and Cress 2003). Some researchers have suggested that women may be more attracted than men to interdisciplinary science research, due to stereotypical ideas about sex differences in learning styles, interaction styles, and preferences for certain types of work activities . They argue that interdisciplinary research may be a way to increase women's participation within the STEM fields. If women are in fact more likely to pursue interdisciplinary research, and doing interdisciplinary research encourages women to pursue degrees and jobs within the STEM fields, then interdisciplinary research may help alleviate the continuing inequalities between males and females. However, it is also possible that interdisciplinary research may have the opposite effect. Numerous scholars argue that interdisciplinary research is detrimental to academic careers. In this case, then, pursuing interdisciplinary science research may exacerbate existing sex inequalities. This chapter aims to understand what potential interdisciplinary research may have for either alleviating or worsening sex inequalities during the early careers of STEM doctorate earners. Using data from the National Science Foundation's Survey of Earned Doctorates and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients, I conduct two related sets of analyses in order to examine a number of questions. The first analysis uses data from doctoral graduates in all fields to determine if women are more likely than men to conduct interdisciplinary dissertation research, and if there is any relationship between conducting interdisciplinary research and earning degrees in the STEM fields, specifically. The second study relies on post-graduation data on doctorate earners in the STEM fields to determine if interdisciplinary research is associated with sex differences in early career outcomes. I examine whether the effects of interdisciplinary dissertation research on career placement vary for men and women. I also determine whether interdisciplinary dissertation research has any impact on existing labor market inequalities between men and women STEM doctoral graduates. Finally, I address whether conducting interdisciplinary research affects men's and women's likelihood of working in STEM-related jobs, as well as the sex composition of doctoral graduates' job categories. The analyses in this chapter are the first to use nationally-representative data on doctoral graduates to address the relationship between sex and interdisciplinary research. The results of this research will help scholars better understand the individual-level implications of the increasing push toward interdisciplinary science, and will provide a basis for future studies to explore how interdisciplinary research may affect longer-term sex differences in career success."}, {"section_title": "Background and Research Questions", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Defining Interdisciplinary Research", "text": "Some researchers seem to utilize a very general definition of interdisciplinary research, while others are use more explicit definitions and distinguish interdisciplinarity from other, related forms of research (Jacobs and Frickel 2009). There is quite a variety of definitions, but a common characteristic of many of the specific definitions of interdisciplinary research is a focus on both the integrative nature of interdisciplinary research and its problem-solving orientation. The National Academy of Sciences' definition exhibits these qualities. In a report entitled Facilitating Interdisciplinary Research, the National Academies defined interdisciplinary research as a mode of research by teams or individuals that integrates information, data, techniques, tools, perspectives, concepts, and/or theories from two or more disciplines or bodies of specialized knowledge to advance fundamental understanding or to solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline or area of research practice (National Academies 2004:2). Observers note that there is a great deal of ambiguity surrounding the various definitions of interdisciplinarity (Jacobs and Frickel 2009) and a lack of consensus among various authors. Klein (1990) argued there is uncertainty about the meaning of interdisciplinarity, and no unified body of discourse about it. Furthermore, other related terms such as \"multidisciplinary\" add to the ambiguity of this topic. Some scholars make clear distinctions between these terms in order to distinguish the degree to which the multiple fields are connected (Jacobs and Frickel 2009). Although definitions vary, most scholars see multidisciplinary as additive; it refers to disciplines working in juxtaposition with each other, but not necessarily integrating. Multidisciplinary approaches add breadth by using perspectives from multiple disciplines, but the disciplinary elements retain their original identity (Wagner et al. 2009). However, interdisciplinary research is more integrative of the different disciplines than the additive methods of multidisciplinary research (Klein 1990). These scholars argue that this integrated synthesis is different and superior to a mere summation of parts (Wagner et al. 2009). Although many theorists who focus on these issues see these distinctions as important and meaningful, it seems as if many others tend to use the term interdisciplinary to refer to any research of this nature, or use interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary interchangeably. Based on these ambiguities in defining these concepts, these interviews sought to answer the following questions: Are respondents familiar with the idea of interdisciplinary research? How do they conceptualize and define the concepts of interdisciplinarity and multidisciplinarity? Do they distinguish between the two terms? Do doctoral candidates make the same distinctions between interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research as are made by scholars of interdisciplinarity? How do doctoral students characterize their research in relation to the terms interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary? It is important to understand how individual researchers define these concepts for a number of reasons. First, without a thorough understanding of how interdisciplinary research is defined, our ability to measure it and study its effects is severely limited. It is clear that interdisciplinary research has begun to impact academic research, but as of yet we have been unable to determine what exactly has changed, and to what extent interdisciplinary approaches are being used, because we still lack a nuanced understanding of what it is we are looking at. Furthermore, from a more practical standpoint, without an agreed-upon understanding of what interdisciplinary research is and how it operates, the potential of the interdisciplinary movement itself is limited. Interdisciplinarity will not be able to substantially transform research, or address the problems it claims to address, without an agreed-upon set of goals and methods for achieving them. Without widespread recognition of the components and objectives of interdisciplinary research, the quality of interdisciplinary endeavors suffers. It seems as if larger organizations, such as universities and funding agencies, may play an important role in shaping how individual researchers understand and think about interdisciplinarity. These organizations are using words such as \"interdisciplinary\" in greater frequency. However, many of these organizations do not outwardly explicate what interdisciplinary research means to them. For example, many funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have set aside grants to promote interdisciplinary research, but there is not always consistent and clear information provided to applicants about what constitutes acceptable interdisciplinary research proposals. 5 If various individuals who are attempting to work on interdisciplinary projects have not been provided with clear and consistent information about how to bridge disciplinary divides and advance research beyond the traditional disciplines, there is little chance that these individuals will be able to effectively cross those disciplinary boundaries and work together in a way that proponents of interdisciplinary research claim they must."}, {"section_title": "Measuring Interdisciplinary Research", "text": "With all the confusion surrounding the definitions of interdisciplinarity and other related terms, it comes as no surprise that there is no general consensus about how to best identify or measure interdisciplinary research. The NSF recently commissioned a project to better understand the state of available indicators of interdisciplinary research (Wagner et al. 2009). The advisory panel for this project recommended that the measurement of interdisciplinary research should ideally incorporate aspects of three components related to the process of conducting research: the inputs into interdisciplinary research (e.g. antecedent conditions), the processes of conducting interdisciplinary research (e.g. collaboration), and the outputs of research (e.g. discoveries or educational outcomes). The report concluded that no existing measures are adequate for assessing interdisciplinarity at all three of these stages. Clearly, to capture all of these elements it is necessary to use multiple measures of different concepts and think about the multiple steps involved in the process. However, among those who have attempted to utilize this three-stage measurement process, there is ambiguity in the three-stage model, calling into question its usefulness. Most research is not specifically focused on the measurement of these three components of the interdisciplinary process. Many authors use much less detailed and less extensive items to measure interdisciplinarity. The most common method of identifying interdisciplinarity is the bibliometric approach, such as citation analysis (Wagner et al. 2009). These methods evaluate interrelationships of disciplines in the form of scholarly output. Citation analysis consists of examining authors, articles, or journals for the extent to which published research cites articles from other disciplines. Experts agree that reliance on bibliometric measures alone is problematic (Wagner et al. 2009). These measures do not address the complexity of interdisciplinary research. Citation analysis gives a sense of the degree of interdisciplinary work being done at the level of fields/disciplines, but does not provide a good way to assess individual researchers' self-identified interdisciplinary involvement. Other research attempts to measure the degree to which individuals or teams are interdisciplinary (Birnbaum 1981b). A variety of methods are used to determine if individuals' research is interdisciplinary. For example, some surveys simply ask researchers whether their research is interdisciplinary, or if it is on the edges or intersections of multiple fields, or ask respondents to list the fields of their research Mansilla 2006). Other methods include asking respondents about the time they spend devoted to interdisciplinary research or whether they are involved in research with scholars in different disciplines . Another approach is to ask individuals who they cite in their research , or whether their research uses methods from different disciplines (Hulme and Toye 2006). Others have considered whether individuals have joint academic appointments as an indirect measure of interdisciplinarity (Hart and Mars 2008), or whether they teach interdisciplinary classes or participate in interdisciplinary workshops, conferences, or other informal meetings of individuals from multiple disciplines (Lattuca 2001). All of these indicators suggest there are a great variety of ways in which researchers have determined if individuals are interdisciplinary or if their research is interdisciplinary. This diversity confirms that there is not an agreed-upon measure of interdisciplinarity. However, many of these indicators are similar in the sense that they are aimed at identifying individual researchers (or articles) that are in some way utilizing knowledge from multiple established fields. These measures often rely on individual respondents' own interpretations of interdisciplinary research. The fact that there are no standard indicators, and also that the measures are dependent upon different definitions of interdisciplinary research, suggests that the theoretical distinctions between various degrees of integration involved in multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary work are blurred in the practice of actually studying these processes. Another attempt to measure this phenomenon is the item contained in the SED. The SED is a near complete census of individuals earning doctoral degrees at all accredited institutions of higher education within the United States. Each year this survey is implemented to obtain a variety of data that allow us to assess trends in the receipt of doctoral degrees. The comprehensive nature of this survey makes it a valuable source for understanding wide-scale effects of interdisciplinary doctoral research. The interdisciplinary indicator on the SED is embedded within a question asking for respondents' field(s) of dissertation research. Beginning in 2001, respondents have had the option of reporting both a primary as well as a secondary field, if applicable. Both versions of the question that have been used since 2001 are displayed in Figure 2.1. In some ways these two items are similar to other measures of interdisciplinary research alluded to above. They aim to identify individuals whose research utilizes knowledge from multiple fields. They also require that respondents rely on their own definitions of interdisciplinary (especially in Version B of the question, which explicitly mentions this term). Respondents likely interpret \"interdisciplinary\" in different ways, and this may cause inconsistencies in how different individuals answer the question. It is also possible that the two versions of the question elicit different types of responses, and that the use of other terms such as multidisciplinary would yield yet another type of response. Using the Specialties List (page 7), please write the name and number of the primary field of your dissertation research."}, {"section_title": "Version B (Used from 2004-Present):", "text": "Please write the name of the primary field of your dissertation research."}, {"section_title": "Interview Methods and Respondents", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Targeting and Recruiting Participants", "text": "The target population for theses interviews was doctoral candidates at the main campus of Washington State University (WSU) who were nearing completion of their graduate program. 6 Interviewing doctoral students for this project is advantageous for several reasons. First, they are the ideal population for studying responses to the SED questionnaire, which is administered to individuals who are about to complete or just completed their doctoral degrees. Students are preferable to individuals who have already completed their degrees because they have not yet been asked to complete the actual SED, which could affect how they respond to the questionnaire items. Interviewing doctoral candidates is also useful because this population of future doctorates is \"coming of age\" and receiving scholarly training during this period of heightened awareness of, and advocacy for, interdisciplinary research. They stand in a unique position to assess the nature of interdisciplinary research, and thus their insights should be of interest as the structure of academic research is supposedly becoming more interdisciplinary. There was no available sampling frame limited only to Ph.D. students about to complete their degree, so with the assistance of university staff, I obtained a list of all doctoral students who had registered for the Fall 2010 semester on the Pullman campus of WSU. In order to narrow this list down to only those students who were nearing completion of their programs, the staff member who assisted with recruitment assessed individuals' eligibility (that is, determined if they were actively involved in dissertation writing or research) during the recruitment procedures. In order to examine how the interview participants respond to the SED question of whether their dissertation research uses a secondary field (that is, if their research is interdisciplinary), I sought to include both researchers who are likely as well as unlikely to report interdisciplinary research. WSU has a formal interdisciplinary doctoral program, which is entitled the \"Individual Interdisciplinary Degree Program\" (IIDP doctoral students would define their dissertation research as interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary: very likely to find interdisciplinary students, somewhat likely to find interdisciplinary students, and unlikely to find interdisciplinary students. Programs that were classified as very likely to include interdisciplinary students were those whose websites specifically mentioned the terms interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary, or those in which nearly all of the prior graduates in those fields indicated two fields on the SED questionnaire. Somewhat likely programs consisted of those in which a moderate number of prior graduates listed multiple fields on the SED (between 30-60%) and programs whose websites had less explicit references to interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary work, such as indicating students are encouraged to explore research in other departments. Programs that were unlikely to contain interdisciplinary students were those with websites which contained no references to any activities associated with interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary work and that had few prior graduates who listed a secondary field on the SED questionnaire. The goal was to recruit 20 individuals who were from departments that were very or somewhat likely to have interdisciplinary students and 10 respondents from departments that were unlikely to have interdisciplinary students, while also including respondents from a diverse range of programs as well as equivalent numbers of men and women. In order to recruit respondents, I organized the sampling frame by department/program, and then the university staff member who assisted in recruitment randomly selected individuals from each of the targeted departments. She contacted selected individuals through telephone and/or email and informed them that our research team was conducting interviews on behalf of the NSF in order to evaluate questions that are used in the SED. She refrained from informing individuals that the interviews were primarily focused on the responses to the item about interdisciplinary research. She explained that the interviews would last approximately forty-five minutes to one hour and that participants would be given an honorarium of $30.00 in appreciation for their time and assistance."}, {"section_title": "Respondents", "text": "The final interview sample consisted of 30 respondents. Ten of these respondents were from programs classified as unlikely to contain students conducting interdisciplinary research. Thirteen participants were selected from programs identified as very likely to produce interdisciplinary researchers, and seven respondents were chosen from programs thought to be somewhat likely to have interdisciplinary students. Thirteen of the respondents were students in the biological, agricultural, or natural resource sciences. Another six were from programs in the physical sciences, engineering, computer science, and math fields. Eight respondents were students in social sciences, communication, and education programs, and three were from the humanities. The sample contained 15 women and 15 men. According to participants' responses to the ethnicity and race indicators on the SED questionnaire (numbered B5 and B6, see Appendix A) and their verbal discussions about these items, eight respondents identified as Asian, 21 identified as white, one identified as Latina, one identified as American Indian, and one respondent described herself as \"multi-racial.\""}, {"section_title": "Interview Protocol and Methods", "text": "The interviews took place between July 20 and August 27, 2010. Each lasted between 40 minutes and one hour and 15 minutes. I conducted all 30 interviews while two graduate student research assistants served as note-takers. One note-taker was present during each interview in order to record the critical elements of the interviews. Each interview was also recorded with a digital audio recorder. The note-takers used their personal notes as well as the audio recordings to compile a summary of each interview after it was completed. These summaries as well as respondents' questionnaire responses (discussed below) were used in the analyses that follow. Each interview began with respondents learning about the nature of the study and providing written consent for their participation. We then discussed the cognitive interview process, which requires that participants complete a questionnaire and speak aloud as they do so. I asked participants to speak aloud everything they read, and to explain their thoughts and reactions aloud as they respond to the paper questions. This process not only provided a written record of respondents' answers, but also allowed for more insight into the written responses. Participants then completed a practice questionnaire to illustrate this process before beginning the actual interview. The body of the interviews consisted of four steps, which are illustrated in Figure 2.2. Step 1: In the first portion of the interviews, respondents completed a shortened version of the SED questionnaire. It included questions about the dissertation title, fields of dissertation research (the question of interest, used to assess whether respondents are interdisciplinary or not), department, educational institution, information about the current doctoral degree and past degrees earned, and several demographic questions. The list of fields that is attached to the SED was provided with the questionnaire. I utilized two versions of this questionnaire, Version A and Version B (see Appendices A and B). The two versions of the questionnaire differed only in terms of the question of interest, the item asking about the field(s) of respondents' dissertation research (numbered A2 on these questionnaires). Version A contained the dissertation research fields question as it was worded in the 2001-2003 SED, and Version B used the current version of the question, adopted in 2004 (see Figure 2.1 above for these two forms of the question). Both versions were used in order to understand if participants' interpretations and response processes are affected by the differences in the wording of the two question versions. Each participant was randomly assigned to receive either Version A or Version B of the SED questionnaire. As respondents completed the SED questionnaire, I used probing questions to fully understand how they responded to the question about their field(s) of dissertation research.  Step 2: After respondents completed the SED questionnaire, I asked them to examine and complete the alternate version of the dissertation research question. Respondents who had completed Version A of the question in Step 1 now received Version B, while respondents who initially completed Version B in Step 1 received Version A (these alternate questions, as they were presented to respondents, are included in Appendix C). Depending upon whether individuals' responses to the two versions of the question were the same or different, I then used a variety of probing questions to determine how respondents answered the alternative version of the question differently (if at all) than the version they originally received. The purpose of Steps 1 and 2 of the interviews was to understand how each individual responded to both versions of the question. I encouraged participants to compare and contrast the differences and comment on whether they interpreted the two versions differently or similarly. I use the results of Steps 1 and 2 to assess the adequacy of both versions of question A2 as indicators of interdisciplinary research. Step 3: Next respondents completed a third and final version of the question asking for the field(s) of dissertation research. This question, Version C, was the same as Version B except that it uses the term \"multidisciplinary\" instead of \"interdisciplinary\" (this version of the question is shown in Appendix D). I questioned participants about whether they interpreted this question differently from Version B. Additional probing was used as needed to understand how individuals interpreted, compared, and answered all three versions of the question. The purpose of including this additional version of the question was to understand whether using \"multidisciplinary,\" as opposed to \"interdisciplinary,\" affects the way individuals interpret and answer the question. I used these results as a method of assessing the distinctions respondents make between the two terms. Step 4: In this final step participants completed an additional questionnaire which collected information about respondents' conceptualizations of the terms interdisciplinarity and multidisciplinarity, how these terms relate to their research, and their opinions about interdisciplinary research. This \"evaluation questionnaire\" (see Appendix E) contained an item (Q1) asking individuals to what extent the terms interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary are similar or different. Questions Q2 and Q3 ask respondents to define these two terms based on their own interpretations (and explain any differences they see between them, if applicable). Respondents were then asked (in question Q4) whether their dissertation research is interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, both interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary, or neither interdisciplinary nor multidisciplinary (based on their definitions). They were also asked this same question in reference to their doctoral degree (Q9). The evaluation questionnaire also contained items to assess whether in fact respondents' research and/or degree programs have characteristics commonly associated with interdisciplinarity, and if respondents believed these items to be reasons why their research is interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary. For example, respondents noted whether or not their research uses theories or methods from multiple disciplines, if they rely on multiple disciplines to formulate their research questions, if they have presented their work at interdisciplinary conferences, or plan to publish research in journals that speak to multiple disciplines (see Q5 and Q10 of the evaluation questionnaire in Appendix E for a complete list of items). Question Q17 of the questionnaire presented respondents with definitions of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary which are based on the common ideas shared by scholars of interdisciplinary research. This question asks respondents whether their research is interdisciplinary and/or multidisciplinary, based on these definitions. After respondents answered Q17, I verbally asked them whether they were familiar with these particular definitions. In the results that follow, I first discuss findings obtained through Step 4's evaluation questionnaire before analyzing the performance of the two versions of the SED research field(s) question (from Steps 1 and 2). First, I examine the respondents' definitions of the terms multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary, along with any distinctions they made between these two terms. Then I present results showing how respondents identified as either multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, both interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary, or neither. Discussing the findings from the evaluation questionnaire first provides more context from which to then interpret participants' responses to the SED research field(s) questions, which are discussed in the final results section of this chapter. 8"}, {"section_title": "Respondents' Definitions for-and Distinctions between-Interdisciplinary and Multidisciplinary", "text": "\"Interdisciplinary\" and \"Multidisciplinary\" are Similar, but Distinct One question of interest was whether respondents consider the terms interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary to have similar meanings. There were several sources of data for answering this question. First, Q1 of the evaluation questionnaire asked respondents how similar or dissimilar the two words are in meaning. Table 2.1 documents the distribution of valid responses to this question. 9 This table shows that the most common response is that the terms are \"very similar.\" Over 75% of respondents said the terms were similar to some degree (either somewhat similar, very similar, or exactly the same). Only one respondent indicated that they are completely different, and one other 8 In the presentation of results, I indent text which describes particular interview events specific to individual respondents. In traditional qualitative research, indented text is used to signify verbal responses obtained from participants. These interviews differed from traditional interviews in several respects. First, they combined the use of paper questionnaires as well as verbal inquiries. Also, important information is embedded not only in what respondents said and wrote, but also in their actions. Therefore, the material contained in the indented text of this chapter may contain both verbal and/or written quotes from respondents as well as descriptive material obtained from the note-takers' summaries of the interview events. The portions of these indented descriptions that are in quotation marks represent direct verbal or written responses from participants. respondent indicated they are very different. Overall, these responses suggest that a large majority of the interview participants view the two terms as being similar in some fashion. Using these definitions and distinctions, I classified respondents as making no distinction between the terms, clearly distinguishing between the two terms, or incompletely/unclearly distinguishing between the two terms. Incompletely/unclearly distinguishing between the two terms means that the respondents indicated they believed the two terms were different in some way, but they were unable to completely or clearly explicate how they differ during the course of the interview. Only one respondent believed the two terms are exactly the same and did not make any attempt to distinguish between them. The other respondent who is classified as making no distinction between multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary in Table 2.2 attempted to distinguish between the two terms, but she was unable to produce any ideas about how the two words differed: On Q1, respondent 22 marked that the two terms are \"very similar\" in meaning, but verbally noted that she was unsure if they mean \"exactly the same thing.\" On question 2 she wrote \"more than 1 academic discipline work together\" *sic]. She contemplated question 3 for awhile, trying to think of a difference between interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary. She ultimately decided that she \"doesn't really know,\" and wrote \"none\" as her answer. This respondent seemed to be trying to think of a distinction simply because she figured that two separate words must have some difference in meaning. 10 However, after trying to come up with a difference, she realized she did not know how they differed, and thus ceased her attempt to distinguish between them. She ultimately concluded that she believed the two terms meant the same thing. Another three respondents incompletely or unclearly distinguished between multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research. These respondents attempted to differentiate between the two terms, but could not do so completely or clearly (but maintained their opinion that there was a distinction to be made, unlike respondent 22). Two of these three respondents \"gave up\" trying to explicate the distinctions because they realized they did not have a clear idea of how they differed. For example, respondent 4 indicated that the two terms are \"somewhat different\" in question 1, but had great difficulty in defining how they differed: Respondent 4 defined interdisciplinary research by saying that \"it means that there are multiple fields that are incorporated into the work. For example, a physicists [sic] that does research in the neuroscience field.\" She defined multidisciplinary as meaning \"there are *sic] more than one field involved in the research. For example, a physicist, a biochemist, and a neuroscientist work together on a project.\" Attempting to clarify the distinction, the interviewer asked if collaboration between multiple researchers was what distinguished multidisciplinary research from interdisciplinary research. The respondent did not clearly reply, saying it is hard to answer because \"they are similar.\" The interviewer rephrased the question, and this time the respondent agreed that multidisciplinary refers to multiple researchers collaborating, but then went on to say that there is also collaboration in interdisciplinary work as well, thus leaving the distinction between the two forms unclear. She seemed to be having great difficulty trying to explain her ideas about how they differed, remarking that \"this is hard!\" before giving up. Finally, a majority of respondents (n=25) clearly distinguished between the two terms. These respondents were able to explicate different definitions for interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research. In the next section I outline the different ways in which these respondents defined, and thus distinguished between, the two words."}, {"section_title": "How Respondents Define and Distinguish between Interdisciplinary and Multidisciplinary Research", "text": "First, I examined whether respondents defined interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary in a manner that is similar to how scholars of interdisciplinarity define them (as discussed in the introduction), and whether respondents make explicit distinctions between the two terms, as these scholars do. Only two respondents provided definitions that closely matched the definitions and distinctions found within the literature about interdisciplinarity. For example, Respondent 2 wrote that interdisciplinary research is \"the merging of multiple disciplines of study\" while multidisciplinary research \"performs more of a side by side method of study.\" He added verbally that interdisciplinary research uses \"techniques, methods, and theories from multiple disciplines to achieve one goal\" while multidisciplinary research uses two fields, but \"does not inter-mix the theories and methods\" from each of the fields. This respondent was part of the University's formal interdisciplinary doctoral degree program, and indicated that students in this program must take coursework that discusses the nature of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research. This coursework that focused explicitly on the topic likely influenced this respondent's knowledge of these specific definitions. Two additional respondents, who also identified themselves as interdisciplinary, provided definitions that were somewhat similar to the established definitions of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research; their definitions were unique but in some way implied the integrative nature of interdisciplinary research, which, according to those studying the interdisciplinary movement, is a defining factor separating it from multidisciplinary research. For example, Respondent 12 wrote that in interdisciplinary research \"the work is done utilizing knowledge from both fields (more than one field) at the same time.\" She then defined multidisciplinary research as \"involving more than one field in the PhD research, but not necessarily for the same paper/project.\" Another respondent's definitions were somewhat similar to the established definitions, except that he associated the integrative nature with multidisciplinary instead of interdisciplinary. Thus, only five of the 30 respondents conceptualized the two terms in a manner consistent with the common definitions found within the literature about interdisciplinarity. The remaining 25 respondents' definitions and distinctions were not consistent with the distinctions made between interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research in this literature. Nevertheless, a majority made distinctions between the two terms (as discussed above), and there were some common themes among these responses. First, eight respondents distinguished between interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary based on the similarity of the fields that are being combined in each. An example of this type of distinction is as follows: Respondent 11 wrote that interdisciplinary research is \"working in 2 or more fields that are related\" while multidisciplinary \"means more than 1 but not necessarily related.\" He verbally provided examples for each, saying that a combination of food science and crop science is interdisciplinary: crop science entails \"how to produce food\" while food science looks at how to \"assemble those raw ingredients into making food.\" Thus, \"they're very related.\" He then said that an example of multidisciplinary research is combining \"an agricultural business degree with a foreign language degree.\" In both of these examples, he acknowledged that the two fields would \"complement each other\" but in interdisciplinary work the fields are more \"by nature done as one\" because they are so similar. Each of these respondents remarked that one form (either interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary, it varied by respondent) involves combining related disciplines or subfields of a common discipline, while the other form involves the combination of more disparate fields. Additionally, four respondents distinguished between interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research in terms of how many fields are involved in each. For example, Respondent 8 wrote that interdisciplinary research is the \"interplay between two or more disciplines.\" For question 3, which asked how multidisciplinary differs from interdisciplinary, she indicated that interdisciplinary \"generally means fewer than 4 disciplines. It's an issue of volume. *Greater than+ 4 disciplines = multidisciplinary.\" When I asked if the process is the same in both forms, the respondent replied that it is the same. These four respondents believed the difference between the two is that multidisciplinary research utilizes more fields than interdisciplinary research, although many agreed that the process is similar in both forms. Another three participants distinguished between the terms by pointing to the use of collaboration. They believed that the distinction was that multidisciplinary research inherently involves collaboration between multiple researchers while interdisciplinary research can be pursued by an individual. For example, Respondent 14 wrote that \"interdisciplinary is one person [has] expertise in several fields.\" She further explained by describing this as a \"jack of all trades.\" Then she defined multidisciplinary as \"a collaborative effort, experts from several fields working together to solve problem from multiple angles.\" Another three respondents made a distinction that was based on viewing one form as a process that results in a new, emerging discipline: Respondent 13 wrote that in interdisciplinary research the goal is to focus \"on the major area A, but utilizing some methods, skills, backgrounds, ideas from another area B.\" He distinguished this from multidisciplinary, in which he indicated \"there might be no major area or minor area. The objective is to study a new area involving both of the traditional areas.\" He gave the example of biochemistry, which involves two traditional areas of biology and chemistry, but together they form a new area of biochemistry. These responses seemed to be picking up on the creation of \"interdisciplines,\" or new fields that are a combination of multiple traditional fields. There were a few other definitions that did not match any of the other themes previously discussed. They included a respondent whose definitions were very specifically in relation to her experience in her department. According to this respondent (R16), the primary difference between interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary is in which departments the other disciplines are used-in interdisciplinary research, one ventures to other departments to use those disciplines, whereas in multidisciplinary research a person uses other disciplines but is still conducting research in the department from which they are earning their degree. Another unique distinction was made in reference to how much knowledge an individual has about the multiple disciplines. This respondent (R20) believed multidisciplinary refers to individuals who have degrees in each of the multiple fields, while in interdisciplinary research an individual just uses multiple disciplines without formal training in them."}, {"section_title": "The Salience of the Distinctions Made Between Interdisciplinary and Multidisciplinary", "text": "Although many of the respondents were able to clearly distinguish between the two terms, this does not necessarily mean these distinctions were very great or necessarily very meaningful. For example, as they were defining the two terms, two respondents (Rs 19 and 20) indicated that they were not sure about the differences between interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research, even though they were able to clearly explicate separate definitions. This suggests that these respondents' distinct definitions were not very salient to them, and that they were constructing these ideas about distinctions on the spot. Additionally, although most respondents provided separate definitions for both interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research, they tended to view the two terms similarly (as suggested by their responses to Q1, discussed above). Table 2.3 shows that 12 of the 25 respondents who made a clear distinction between interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary (as well as one other who was unable to make a clear distinction between the two terms) admitted at some point in the interview that the two terms are used interchangeably, or that they interpret the two words to mean the same thing. For example, Although she had earlier provided clear and distinct definitions for interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary, when respondent 8 was asked about her impressions of the definitions provided in question 17 of the evaluation questionnaire, she said it \"seems arbitrary\" to say which one is integrative and which one is not integrative. When the interviewer asked if she sees a difference between the definitions, the respondent replied that the terms \"are used interchangeably.\" Many of these individuals remarked that they interpreted the two words to mean the same thing when they compared Version C of the dissertation research field(s) question to Version B, but then later provided distinct definitions for multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary on the evaluation questionnaire. The sequence of events through which these individuals remarked that they interpret the terms in the same way suggests that the distinctions they made between the two terms might not be very meaningful. As they answered Versions B and C of the A2 question, these respondents were trying to make the point that they would answer these questions similarly, despite the change in wording. It was only later in Step 4, when they were asked explicitly about the distinctions (if any) they saw between the terms, that they proceeded to distinguish between them. For example, Respondent 25 paused to contemplate the meaning of \"multidisciplinary\" when he was answering Version C. He then decided that he would interpret multidisciplinary the same as interdisciplinary, and answered the question the same as Version B. In Step 4 he distinguished between the two terms. Cases such as this suggest that even though many people made distinctions between the two terms, the distinctions are not meaningful enough to affect how they responded to the two words when they were presented in a practical context (such as in this questionnaire). In some instances it appeared as if respondents had not previously considered how the words may differ. Clearly, several individuals had never thought about precise definitions for interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research until they were explicitly asked about whether the terms had any difference in meaning. Four respondents initially interpreted the words to mean the same thing, but then remarked that there must be different meanings because there are two separate words. For example,"}, {"section_title": "During", "text": "Step 3, respondent 22 said she would interpret the research field(s) questions the same regardless of whether they said interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary. But when asked how similar the two terms are, she said she is unsure if they are exactly the same because \"no two words mean exactly the same thing.\" She tried to distinguish between them, but had no actual idea about how interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research may differ. Also, several respondents appeared to be using the roots of the words (inter-and multi-) to try to distinguish between them, suggesting that they did not have a preconceived notion of the difference between the two terms and tried to deduce their meanings only when explicitly asked in the interview. For example, Respondent 10 read the multidisciplinary version of the dissertation research field(s) question (Version C) and remarked \"that word\u2026*means+ a lot of disciplines.\" When defining this term in Step 4, she said \"from the word multi-, means many\u2026more than two.\" So the distinction she made between multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary is that multidisciplinary involves more fields than interdisciplinary. In practical terms, many of the respondents saw the two words as very similar to each other, and it seems as if they would react similarly to a questionnaire item regardless of whether it uses interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary. It was only in this context, in which both of the terms were presented together and respondents were explicitly asked about their definitions, that some individuals began to think carefully about how the definitions of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary could differ. Thus, in many instances it seems as if the research process stimulated the distinctions that some respondents made between the two words. The examples just discussed illustrate how several respondents appeared to be trying to concoct a distinction even though they did not actually know whether or how the two words differ."}, {"section_title": "Inconsistent Use of Distinct Definitions of Interdisciplinary and Multidisciplinary Research", "text": "Although many individuals clearly distinguished between interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research, 14 respondents were inconsistent or contradictory in the use of their definitions for each of the terms throughout the interview. Table 2.3 above also shows whether respondents were inconsistent with their definitions, organized by whether they labeled themselves as interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, or neither. An example of these inconsistencies is as follows, where the respondent made remarks that directly contradicted her initial distinctions and definitions of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research: Respondent 1 initially defined multidisciplinary research as research consisting of two completely different fields (while interdisciplinary research is about finding intersections between supposedly more similar fields). However, later in the interview she remarked that multidisciplinary research refers to two similar fields. She then admitted the distinctions (which she initially had no trouble making) were \"getting confusing\" as she thought about it more. Others tended to blur the distinctions they originally made as the interview progressed. Respondent 21 maintained his distinct definitions for each term, but he was inconsistent in how he explained the differences: Respondent 21 made a distinction between interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research based on the relatedness of the multiple fields. He indicated that interdisciplinary refers to research that combines two related subfields while multidisciplinary refers to research that combines more disparate fields. However, in separate places within the interview he used the same example of combining psychology and communication to illustrate both interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research. These inconsistencies did not just occur among those who provided incomplete or unclear definitions or distinctions to begin with; 12 of the respondents whose original definitions and distinctions between multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research were clear made inconsistent remarks in their use of these definitions and distinctions throughout the interview. This suggests that although many people may indicate that the two terms as somewhat distinct, these distinctions are not necessarily put into use. This provides further evidence that many respondents did not have clear, distinct definitions for each term before the interview process began."}, {"section_title": "Respondents' Familiarity with the Concepts of Interdisciplinary/Multidisciplinary Research", "text": "All of the respondents had some idea of what interdisciplinary and/or multidisciplinary research is, regardless of whether or not they identified themselves as interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary or not. Every participant was able to define the term interdisciplinary. These definitions varied in terms of details, and respondents used their own unique words, but through participants' discussions of the terms, I determined that all interviewees clearly recognized that it is research that uses multiple disciplines or fields of study. The term \"interdisciplinary\" was more familiar to some respondents than the term \"multidisciplinary.\" All respondents were familiar with the term interdisciplinary, but seven respondents made some explicit reference to the fact that they were unfamiliar or less familiar with the term multidisciplinary (Table 2.3 also indicates whether respondents were less familiar with the term multidisciplinary). For example, After reading the multidisciplinary version of the dissertation field(s) of study question (Version C), respondent 5 remarked that \"multidisciplinary is not a word I am familiar with.\" She went on to say that she, and people in her department, always use the term interdisciplinary, and she likes this term [interdisciplinary] better."}, {"section_title": "Respondents' Familiarity with Scholarly Definitions of Interdisciplinary and Multidisciplinary Research", "text": "Question Q17 of the evaluation questionnaire provides definitions of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research that are consistent with the distinctions commonly made among scholars who study the interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary movement. After respondents answered this item, I proceeded to verbally ask them questions about these particular definitions of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research, hoping to determine whether the participants were familiar with these definitions and to understand their opinions of them. Table 2.4 categorizes respondents based on their familiarity/ unfamiliarity with these definitions of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary. Of the 20 respondents who were asked this question directly, only one respondent indicated that she \"may have\" seen these definitions before. However, the definitions of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary that she provided earlier in the interview were not similar to these definitions. Thus, it was unclear whether or not she legitimately recognized the definitions; if she had indeed seen them before they did not appear to have any influence on how she conceptualized the terms. Therefore, in this table she is classified as \"maybe familiar\" with the definitions. Three others who were asked if they had encountered these definitions previously indicated that the definition of interdisciplinary research seemed very familiar to them but they had not heard this definition of multidisciplinary research. None of these three individuals had mentioned any distinctions based on integration of disciplines when they defined the two terms earlier in the questionnaire. Finally, most individuals (80% of those who were asked) indicated that they had never seen either of the words defined in this manner, and were unfamiliar with these definitions. This is not surprising given that only a few of the respondents' own definitions of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary were similar to these definitions. This suggests that although scholars of interdisciplinarity may carefully distinguish between the terms, most doctoral students, even those involved in interdisciplinary research, are not familiar with the distinctions scholars make between interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research. Ten respondents were not directly asked about their familiarity with these definitions. In five cases this was because the respondents indicated that these definitions were similar to how they conceptualized the terms before I was able to ask them if they were familiar definitions. 11 Thus, there were several respondents who made some indication that they were familiar with the definitions. Four of these respondents were among those whose definitions were similar to these definitions, so I am confident that these participants have actually encountered these definitions before. The other respondent claimed the definitions were similar to how she defined them, but she had been unable to provide a clear definition of the terms earlier in the interview. Due to this I was unable to determine if in fact the definitions were legitimately similar to how she defined the terms, so she is classified as \"maybe familiar with the definitions.\" The data in Table 2.4 confirm that a majority of respondents were indeed unfamiliar with the distinct definitions scholars use for interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research."}, {"section_title": "Respondents' Impressions of the Definitions Used by Scholars of interdisciplinarity", "text": "As noted above, to some respondents, the multidisciplinary definition used by scholars was less familiar than the interdisciplinary definition. Additionally, when asked about their impressions of these definitions, many respondents expressed some concern with the way multidisciplinary research is defined. Twelve of the 30 respondents experienced some degree of confusion, uncertainty, or dislike for the definition of multidisciplinary research. For example, four respondents said they disagreed with the notion that multidisciplinary research does not integrate perspectives from multiple disciplines: Respondent 9 disliked the two definitions, saying that multidisciplinary research does integrate the different disciplines, and his definition of multidisciplinary is broader. Six other respondents explained that they did not understand the non-integrative aspect of this definition for multidisciplinary research. This part of the definition seemed nonsensical or confusing to these participants: After reading the definitions, respondent 19 said he is not sure \"why someone would use multiple perspectives but not integrate them.\" He also remarked that he was \"not clear on the definition or purpose of multidisciplinary research.\" Because of this, he indicated that he was not sure what multidisciplinary research \"looks like\" and was unsure why someone \"would not want to integrate\" two perspectives. Two other respondents seemed confused by the function or purpose of multidisciplinary research, but did not mention the non-integrative aspect of the definition specifically. An example was respondent 18, who wondered \"what is the point of multidisciplinary research?\" if it is not to solve problems? Clearly, the multidisciplinary definition was very unfamiliar and has no relationship to how many respondents view these concepts. Fewer respondents had trouble with the definition of interdisciplinary research. Many said that it made sense, or that it was similar to their ideas. However, two participants seemed somewhat skeptical that it is possible to move \"beyond the scope of a single discipline,\" which is the supposed goal of interdisciplinary research. For example, Respondent 3 remarked that he did not understand how something can be \"bigger than a discipline.\" He pondered this for some time before admitting that \"in a methodological sense\" he could imagine something larger than a single discipline, but seemed to remain skeptical. Thus, although some respondents appeared to be familiar with the interdisciplinary research definition, to a few its scope was exaggerated. Also, another respondent, number 27, remarked that he was unclear about what it means to \"integrate perspectives.\" He had difficulty imagining what it means, exactly, to integrate, and whether that was something that was relevant for defining the terms. Also, respondent 21 said he was \"more confused by the definition of interdisciplinary\" than multidisciplinary, although he did not elaborate. These examples suggest that the definition of interdisciplinary may be somewhat abstract. This series of examples illustrates that these \"official\" definitions that scholars of interdisciplinarity use are not necessarily related to how many doctoral students think about multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research. Very few of the respondents actually made the distinctions between interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research in the same fashion as these definitions do (focused on the extent to which the disciplines are integrated or not). In fact, this distinction seemed nonsensical to a number of respondents."}, {"section_title": "Interdisciplinary vs. Multidisciplinary Wording of the Dissertation Research Field(s) Question", "text": "Another way of assessing whether the interviewees distinguished between interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research is to compare their answers to Versions B and C of the dissertation research field(s) question. A majority of respondents provided the same response in both Versions B and C. This gives additional support to the other findings which suggest that for most individuals, the two terms operate similarly (despite the fact that most respondents distinguished between them). However, seven individuals' responses to Versions B and C of the dissertation research question were different. One respondent listed only one field for the multidisciplinary version of the question but two fields for the interdisciplinary version of the question. Six respondents did the opposite, listing one field on the interdisciplinary version but two fields on the multidisciplinary version. For example, Respondent 16 only wrote one field for Version B because she could not find her secondary field on the list. However, when answering Version C, she decided to use the \"chemistry, other\" category as a secondary field. When the interviewer pointed out how she had listed only one field in Versions A and B, but two in Version C, the respondent remarked that the term multidisciplinary had \"triggered *her+ to think about all of the disciplines\" she works with. Since her definition of interdisciplinary was very specific, the term multidisciplinary seemed more applicable to her situation. Participants such as R16 more freely indicated a secondary field when the question said \"multidisciplinary.\" This implies that \"interdisciplinary\" may be more restricting to those people who distinguished between these two questions."}, {"section_title": "Respondents' Identification as Interdisciplinary or Multidisciplinary", "text": "After discussing the definitions of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary with respondents, Q4 of the evaluation questionnaire asked them whether they considered their dissertation research to be interdisciplinary and/or multidisciplinary. Table 2.5 shows the distribution of responses to this item. Nineteen respondents answered Q4 by indicating that their dissertation research was either interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, or both. Another respondent initially answered that his dissertation research is neither interdisciplinary nor multidisciplinary, but later on in the questionnaire realized that he uses multiple fields in his research. At this point he then verbally changed his answer to question 4, stating he is interdisciplinary. Thus, I categorized him as interdisciplinary in the tables. Each of these twenty participants provided information in Q5 that confirmed they are involved in activities that are commonly associated with interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary research (such as using methods or theories from multiple disciplines). This suggests that individuals' self-reports of conducting interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary research (or not) are valid. Over half of these 20 respondents identified as interdisciplinary, while only 25% identified only as multidisciplinary. This further suggests that the term interdisciplinary is more common than the term multidisciplinary. Ten respondents indicated that their research was neither interdisciplinary nor multidisciplinary. In each of these interviews, I verified the validity of these responses by verbally discussing the items in Q5 (which these respondents were instructed to skip when answering the questionnaire), asking these individuals if they participated in any of these activities. These respondents confirmed that they did not perform many of these activities. Some explained that while they have cited some research from other fields, this was in a limited fashion and was not extensive enough to make their work truly interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary. Nearly all respondents (28) provided the same response to question 9 (about their doctoral degree) as they did for question 4 (about their dissertation research). Respondent 14 indicated that her research was interdisciplinary, but her degree is not because she is only getting a doctorate in one of the fields that she uses in her research. Another respondent (R25) indicated that his research was not interdisciplinary but his degree is interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary. Using additional questions, I ascertained that this participant legitimately did not appear to be conducting interdisciplinary research. However, his responses indicate that his identification of his degree as interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary is problematic. He was confused by the fact that his program is housed in the same department as another program. He felt his degree was interdisciplinary because of this, since he has taken classes in both subjects. Yet as the interview progressed and I questioned him further about the nature of his degree, it became apparent that the degree this participant would be earning was indeed distinct from the other program in his department, and that his interpretation could be misleading. Since most respondents' answers to question 9 mirrored their responses to question 4, and this participant's response to Q9 was problematic, I rely only on question 4 responses to categorize the participants as interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary or not. A majority of the students who indicated that their research is interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary were forthcoming about this status when they answered Versions B and C of the dissertation research field(s) question. While answering these questions, many respondents made statements about whether or not the terms interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary were applicable to their research. However, six of the respondents who verbally remarked that they did not consider their research to be interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary when answering the dissertation research questions (although some of them included two fields in their responses) later said that their research was in fact interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary (when they were explicitly asked in question 4 of the evaluation questionnaire). In these cases, it seems as if the respondents did not think of themselves as interdisciplinary until they had had the opportunity to think about their research and how they define the terms interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary. For example, Respondent 7 hesitated when he read the portion of Version B of the dissertation research field(s) question which states \"if your dissertation research was interdisciplinary\u2026\" He remarked \"by interdisciplinary I guess they mean collaborating or using techniques outside the field.\" He decided he would not put down a second field on this version of the question, reasoning that his response in the first box of the question covers a \"multitude of techniques\" used in his research. Since he had provided two responses in Version A, the interviewer asked him if he felt that the word \"interdisciplinary\" made the secondary field portion of the question inapplicable to him. He agreed. Later, after defining the terms interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary, he indicated that his research is in fact interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary. It is clear that some of these respondents had not carefully considered these issues prior to the interviews. Several actually remarked that they had not thought about the definitions of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary before. For example, Respondent 26 reported two fields in each version of the dissertation research field(s) question. Verbally he commented that in some ways he considers his research to be interdisciplinary, but he generally does not label it as such. He said that calling it interdisciplinary or not was like \"splitting hairs,\" implying the terminology did not mean much to him. After he defined the term interdisciplinary in question 2 of the evaluation questionnaire, he said that he was \"starting to wonder\" whether his research was interdisciplinary after all. He then commented that he does not \"think about these issues\" often. In question 4, he responded that his research was in fact interdisciplinary. Thus, it is not surprising that these respondents lacked a clear preconceived notion of whether their research was interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, or neither."}, {"section_title": "How Definitions of \"Fields\" and \"Subfields\" Affect Identification", "text": "Throughout the interviews, I noticed that some individuals' notions of what constitutes a field of study or a discipline affected whether they identified as interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary or not. This resulted in variation in how different respondents determined whether their research was interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary or not. Some participants commented that using multiple subfields or multiple related fields is multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary research, while others believed that the two fields must be disparate in order for the research to be considered interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary. It is difficult to distinguish between what constitutes multiple \"subfields\" or multiple \"related fields,\" as these distinctions are somewhat subjective. In fact, one respondent (R1) said just that, noting that what different people consider separate disciplines is subjective. She described using two fields that she believes are two separate entities but felt that others might consider them to be two subfields of a broader category. Thus, I only classified respondents as using subfields to define their research as interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary if they explicitly indicated that one or more of their fields are subfield(s). Subfields as interdisciplinary: Some respondents considered subfields or specialties within a broader discipline to be distinct entities, and they believed that working with many of these is interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary. Twelve of the interview subjects mentioned that working with multiple subfields of a larger discipline constitutes either multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary research. Seven of these 12 respondents identified as interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary based on the fact that they work with what they consider multiple subfields of a larger discipline, or that their specialty is a subfield of the larger discipline they study. For example, An environmental scientist (respondent 5) labeled herself as interdisciplinary, listing both environmental science and urban/regional planning, the second of which she considered a subfield of environmental science. This respondent also noted that her discipline, environmental science, is an interdisciplinary field, which may have affected her opinion that her subfield made her work interdisciplinary. Other respondents who identified as interdisciplinary based on the use of subfields also believed their primary fields were interdisciplines, suggesting that in some cases studying an interdiscipline caused respondents to report a subfield as a secondary field in the A2 questions. However, others who reported being interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary with the use of subfields were not housed in interdisciplinary fields. For example, Respondent 16 indicated her research is in both organic and biological chemistry, which she described as two subfields of chemistry. She believed that using multiple subfields of chemistry made her research multidisciplinary, but she did not think that chemistry was an interdiscipline. Related fields as interdisciplinary: Another six respondents labeled themselves as interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary using two similar or closely related fields, which they did not describe as subfields. For example, Respondent 11 wrote both crop science and food science in his response to the A2 questions. He described these fields as separate entities, but said that they are very related and \"by nature\" they tend to be combined in research. Disparate fields only as interdisciplinary: In contrast, among the remaining 12 respondents, many implied or directly said that in order for research to be considered interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary it needs to involve two completely disparate fields of study, such as a biological science and a social science. Several of these individuals worked with multiple subfields of a discipline but did not consider this to be interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary research. For example, Respondent 15 described her research as using behavioral psychology and social psychology. She did not consider this to be interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary, and said that she would have to be working with another field outside of psychology altogether in order to be considered interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary. Although these 30 interviews to not allow for definitive conclusions, the data suggest that individuals' opinions about what types of field or subfield combinations constitute interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary research were somewhat dependent upon their areas of study. Many of the life sciences students viewed research involving multiple subcategories of a life science discipline or two life science fields as interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary. In contrast, many of the social science and humanities respondents argued that working with multiple subfields of these areas does not alone comprise interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary research. This disparity seems to reflect the way these different fields are viewed and organized by the university and the scientific community in general. There is a lot of emphasis on interdisciplinary research within the biological and environmental sciences at this university, and elsewhere. This perhaps has influenced how life science doctoral students define their own work. The fields of study list which is presented in the SED illustrates this type of disparity quite well. On the list, the life sciences are broken up into very distinct, specific categories, but for many of the social sciences there is only one or two entries on the list that to encompass the entire field (examples include sociology, anthropology, and criminal justice). There was no evidence that the list itself actually affected people's perceptions of whether they were interdisciplinary or not (this is discussed in more detail below), but rather, the list seems to be reflective of common conceptualizations of the fields within the academic community. Many of the life science interview subjects provided convincing arguments for why their work with multiple subfields/related fields is legitimately interdisciplinary. For example, respondent 9 explained that these days, there is an intrinsic multidisciplinary nature to much of the biological research. He argued that while there are distinct fields within biology, nearly all biological researchers have to be knowledgeable of many different areas of study and a variety of methods, so in a way biology has become an inherently interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary discipline. On the other hand, some of those in the social sciences and humanities who did not believe using multiple subfields or related fields constitutes interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary research were very convinced of the reasons this is the case. For example, a historian argued that using multiple different subfields of history is not interdisciplinary because the subfields are still a part of history. She said these subfields all use the same methods, and the only difference between them is that they are focused on different areas or time periods. Contrasting these two perspectives, it seems as if determining whether a field or subfield of research is distinct from other similar fields/subfields might be related to how diverse a discipline is in terms of its subject matter, perspectives, and methods. There is a much greater diversity of methods and subjects within the biological sciences than in history, which may explain the divergent ideas about whether using multiple subfields constitutes interdisciplinary research. If one believes that interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary research must combine two disparate fields, then using the dissertation research field(s) question from the SED as an indicator of interdisciplinary research likely results in an overestimation of the prevalence of interdisciplinary research among doctoral students. Many of the interview respondents who identified as interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary did so based on the use of fields that are closely related. Fewer combined fields that are quite distinct from each other (e.g. not within the same over-arching discipline, such as combining a life science field with an education field). In the following analysis of the dissertation research questions, I consider students' self-identifications as conducting interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary research or not valid, regardless of how closely related their fields are to each other."}, {"section_title": "Using the SED's Fields of Dissertation Research Questions as Measures of Interdisciplinarity", "text": "This section examines how well the two versions of the SED's dissertation research field(s) question serve as measures of interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary research. I analyzed whether the number of fields participants indicated in both versions of this question was consistent with whether they described their dissertation research as interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary-that is, if respondents who identified as interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary researchers listed two fields, while those who did not identify as such only listed one field. 12 As noted above, respondents' categorizations of their dissertation research as interdisciplinary and/or multidisciplinary, or neither, appeared valid. Thus, I am confident in using these self-identified statuses as a benchmark for assessing the validity of the responses to the A2 questions as indicators of interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary research. Students' responses to each of the two versions of the SED question about the field(s) of their dissertation research are \"accurate\" if the number of fields they listed was consistent with how they identified their dissertation research (interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary or not). \"Accurate\" means that a respondent listed two fields if he/she conducts interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary research, or that respondents listed one field if they do not conduct interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary research. If the number of fields listed is consistent with respondents' identifications as interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary or not, then this suggests that the A2 questions are accurate (valid) measures of interdisciplinary research, while inconsistent responses represent cases in which the questions do not accurately indicate interdisciplinary research. I categorized participants' answers based on two factors: whether their responses were accurate (consistent with whether they conduct interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary research), and whether they provided the same response to both versions of the question. Table 2.6 outlines the number of fields reported by each respondent in all versions of the question, organized by whether respondents indicated they conducted interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary research. Also, Table 2.7 summarizes respondents' answers to the two versions of the question according to their accuracy/ inaccuracy as a measure for interdisciplinary research. "}, {"section_title": "Both Questions Answered Similarly and Accurately", "text": "Fifteen participants' responses to both versions of the SED question matched their later descriptions of their research as interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary: those who listed two fields said they conduct interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary research (n=9), while those who listed one field said they do not do this type of research (n=6). Also, these respondents listed the same number of fields in each version of the SED question. Thus, in half of the cases, both questions performed \"accurately\" as a measure of interdisciplinary research, and they both performed similarly to each other. Another five respondents also provided the same answers to both versions of the question, but these answers were inconsistent with their later descriptions of the interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary status of their research. Each of these respondents indicated only one field in both versions of the question, but in Step 4 of the interview they described their research as interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary. These five respondents are cases of \"underreporting\" or \"false negative\" reports of interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary research on both question versions. There were a variety of explanations as to why these five participants only provided one field in the SED questions although they considered their research to be interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary. One respondent did not indicate her secondary field because it was not on the list of fields. Another respondent did not write two fields because he did not consider his research to be interdisciplinary until later in the interview. Respondent 9 appeared to be \"satisficing\" throughout the interview process by putting forth the least possible effort, which resulted in incomplete responses: When answering the dissertation research field(s) question, respondent 9 wrote one field and mentioned another that he could also include, but he reasoned that just indicating one was \"good enough.\" It wasn't until answering the multidisciplinary version of the question (which he felt best applied to him) that he made a concerted effort to completely answer the question, which involved indicating both of his fields. Respondent 14, in contrast, misinterpreted both versions of the question, resulting in incomplete responses that were inconsistent with her later description of her research as interdisciplinary: When answering Version A, respondent 14 did not write a second field. She explained that she interpreted \"secondary field\" to be asking if she had a minor field. When responding to Version B, she indicated her primary field, and then read the second part of the question. In response to this she said \"no, it's not applicable, at least in the primary field of it.\" She thought this part of the question was asking if her primary field was an interdisciplinary field. Thus, there was no common theme behind each of these incorrect responses. There was no evidence that any of the false negative reports were associated with conducting interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary research to a lesser extent than other interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary respondents."}, {"section_title": "Questions Answered Differently, with an Inaccurate Response to One Version of the Question", "text": "The remaining ten respondents answered the two versions of the dissertation research field(s) question differently, so that only one version matched their later identification as interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary or not. Six of these respondents wrote only one field on either Version A or Version B (and two fields on the other) but later clearly identified as interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary. Thus, these six cases are other forms of underreporting, or \"false negative\" reports of interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary research. For a variety of reasons, these six individuals did not interpret one of these questions in a way that coincided with their own descriptions of their research. Three of these respondents only reported one field on Version A, but more accurately answered two fields on Version B. The phrase \"secondary field,\" without the term interdisciplinary, caused some confusion for these respondents as they answered Version A. For example, In one instance, the error on Version A was partially a result of the unclear meaning of \"secondary field,\" but also seemed to be partly due to the fact that the respondent did not carefully look at the list when answering the question the first time, and thus did not realize her secondary field was an option. After later discovering this, she noted she would have added that field to her response if she had known it was on the list. However, she also indicated that the term interdisciplinary helped her interpret the question (Version B) better, which implies that Version A may have been unclear to her. Another three respondents accurately indicated two fields in Version A, but only one field in Version B. Each of these three participants answered this way for different reasons. One respondent only indicated one field on Version B because of how he interprets and responds to the word interdisciplinary: Respondent 24 received Version B of the dissertation research field(s) question first. When reading the part of the question that asks for a secondary field if the research is interdisciplinary, the respondent commented that \"all of American studies [his primary field] is interdisciplinary.\" He decided to leave this portion of the question blank, even though he indicated he was interdisciplinary. When answering Version A, he decided to report a second field, even though he was disturbed that he was only allowed to indicate one secondary field (he indicated he has many). When asked about why he answered differently to the two versions, he said that the use of the term interdisciplinary in Version B lead him to think \"more formally,\" whereas Version A seemed \"less formal\" and \"has more play\" to it. Because he was not allowed to indicate more than two fields on either version, he felt that if he were to only write one of his secondary fields on Version B, the more formal version, then it would be inaccurate. But he did not feel like this was inaccurate to do on Version A because the question seemed less formal. Another respondent included just one field on Version B because her primary field, neuroscience, is an interdiscipline, so the question confused her by only referring to interdisciplinary research when asking about the secondary field: Respondent 4 reported her primary field, neuroscience, and a secondary field (cellular biology) on Version A. She explained that her research \"could also be considered molecular and cellular biology, if they want another name for it.\" She selected the code for cellular biology for her secondary field, but noted that she usually just thinks of her research as neuroscience. Then on Version B she only wrote neuroscience. When she read the part of the question which asks for a secondary field if the dissertation is interdisciplinary, she replied that her dissertation research is interdisciplinary because neuroscience is considered to be an interdiscipline. This seemed to confuse her, because her primary field itself is interdisciplinary but she did not think she should write a second field given how the question was worded. She decided to not include a secondary field because her research is just within neuroscience. Respondent 7's inconsistent responses were more a product of the wording of the part of the question asking for the primary field than the wording asking about a secondary field. In Version A, the question refers respondents to the list of field codes before asking them to fill in the name of their primary field. On Version B, respondents are asked to fill in the name of their primary field, and then asked to look at the list to find a code that represents it. This difference caused Respondent 7 to write slightly different responses in the two versions of the question for his primary field. Since his answer on Version B, which did not refer him to the list first, was more narrowed down to his specific research topic, He decided not to include a second field, noting that his response to the primary field question \"covers a multitude of techniques\" he uses in his research. When asked about the different answers to the two versions of the question, the respondent spoke about how Version A restricted him to the list of predetermined fields and that he could more accurately describe what he does in Version B. Finally, four respondents incorrectly listed two fields on Version A of the question but only one field on Version B. These four cases represent the only \"false positive\" or over-reports of interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary research in the interviews. These individuals did not identify as interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary, and this was reflected in their responses to the question with that term. When these respondents answered Version B, they indicated that this secondary field question did not apply to them because their research is not interdisciplinary. However, without this word in Version A, the meaning of \"secondary field\" was left up to individual interpretation. These respondents interpreted the question differently than they did Version B, and thus wrote in a secondary field. For example, Respondent 12, who answered Version B first, listed economics as her primary field on Version B, and left the second part blank. She indicated that her research is not interdisciplinary and she does not have a secondary field. When answering Version A, however, she listed economics as a primary field and econometrics as a secondary field. When she was asked about the differences in responses, she remarked that the first question she answered contained the word interdisciplinary and this \"changed the meaning of the question.\" Through later questioning it was clear that respondent 12 was not an interdisciplinary researcher, and the response she gave in Version A was misleading as a measure of interdisciplinary research. Another respondent felt that the phrase \"secondary field\" in Version A of the question referred to her secondary area of emphasis from her preliminary examinations. Although she does not incorporate this field in her dissertation research, she nevertheless reported it as a secondary field because this phrase was similar to how her department refers to examination areas. Another respondent had only intended to write one general field, zoology, but when he saw how detailed the list was (including much more narrow and specific categories than he expected), he felt the surveyors wanted him to be more detailed than he envisioned: Respondent 19 read the first question stem of Version A, flipped back to the list and remarked \"Whoa!\" as he was surprised about how many fields were on the list. He commented that the list of life sciences was \"very specific\" and he seemed concerned because he felt his research could be classified in two or three of these categories (some of which he felt were more specific components of more general categories on the list). Thus, he listed two fields on Version A which he felt were both subcomponents of the larger field he originally intended to use. But when answering Version B he did not include a second field, saying he does not consider his research to be interdisciplinary. While there was not a large number of respondents who provided \"false positive\" reports of interdisciplinary research, the fact that all four of these reports occurred with Version A suggests that this version is less clear than Version B. The wording of Version A is less specific than Version B, in that it just asks for a secondary field without defining this as something specific to interdisciplinary researchers. This generic phrasing did cause a few respondents to indicate they were unsure of what was being asked of them on this version of the question. However, in contrast, two respondents explicitly stated that they preferred the wording of Version A. Also, a majority of respondents provided the same answer to both questions, indicating that in general the two questions have a somewhat similar meaning. In fact, several respondents stated that they believed the two versions of the question were eliciting similar information. Nevertheless, the numbers show that the second version of the question is slightly more \"accurate\" as an indicator of interdisciplinary research than the first version. Accounting for all responses, Version A yielded an \"accuracy\" rate of 60% and Version B elicited \"accurate\" responses 73% of the time. The introduction of the \"interdisciplinary\" wording improved the performance of the question in terms of whether reporting two fields corresponds to conducting interdisciplinary research. Interestingly, Version C of the question, which serves as a comparison to Version B, had the highest accuracy rate as an indicator of interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary research. Ninety percent of respondents' answers to this version coincided with their descriptions of their research as interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary or not. This is somewhat surprising given that several respondents indicated that they were unsure of the meaning of multidisciplinary research or that they had not heard this term before. However, Version C of the question was presented to respondents after they had already seen Versions A and B; its position in the sequence was always last. This order may have resulted in the greater accuracy rate for Version C. Perhaps respondents were better able to answer Version C accurately after having the additional time to think about their responses as they answered the other two versions of the question before receiving Version C."}, {"section_title": "Effects of the List of Fields of Study on Responses", "text": "I also examined whether respondents' answers to the to dissertation research fields questions were affected by the contents of the fields of study list that is provided with the questionnaire. One concern expressed by the NSF was that respondents might report multiple fields not because they are interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary, but because they cannot find one field on the list that accurately describes their research; in other words, the list might be producing false positive reports of interdisciplinary research. There was no evidence of this in the interviews. Participants' decisions whether to report one or two fields was never a result of not being able to find their field on the list. However, in several instances the list altered responses in other ways. First, one respondent did not expect his two fields to be listed separately: Respondent 11 had two fields and automatically wrote both of them in the primary field box. When he saw that these two fields were presented separately on the list, he split them apart and wrote one as a primary field and the other as his secondary field. When the interviewer asked about this, he indicated that before looking at the list he was concerned that it would not break his fields down into two areas, but he was pleased to see that it did, noting it was \"accurate after all.\" He did consider them to be two distinct, different fields, and later discussions revealed that he considers them separate fields that he uses together in an interdisciplinary way. Another respondent (R16) did not write multiple fields (which she intended to do) because she could not find her secondary field on the list. Another respondent (R19) was only planning to write one, broad primary field, but ended up listing two fields in Version A because the list was much more detailed and specific than he expected it to be (see above). This resulted in a false positive report of interdisciplinary research for this respondent on Version A. This case illustrates how it is possible that the list can prompt individuals to write more fields than they perhaps normally would think to include. But the reason behind this was not that the respondent could not find his primary field, rather, it was because he found multiple fields on the list that applied to his research. However, respondent 19 was the only interview subject who made comments suggesting that the list was too detailed. It seems as if most of the other respondents were thinking at a greater level of specificity than this respondent when asked about their research fields."}, {"section_title": "Effect of \"Interdisciplines\" on Question Responses", "text": "Twelve respondents identified their primary fields as interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary in nature; that is, they felt these fields alone were interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary regardless of whether they are combined with other fields. This sample did not include enough people who are in established interdisciplines to allow for any definitive conclusions about this issue, but I noted if these respondents answered differently than others. Overall, there were no major differences in how these respondents answered the dissertation research field(s) questions compared to the other respondents who indicated they are interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary. Most of the participants earning degrees in interdisciplinary subjects did not specifically mention that their fields were interdisciplines at the time they were completing the various versions of the dissertation research field(s) question. Rather, most later indicated they viewed their fields as interdisciplines when answering an item (Q10-a) in the evaluation questionnaire. However, two of the respondents who said that their fields are interdisciplinary in nature were somewhat troubled or confused by the use of the word \"interdisciplinary\" in Version B of the question. These respondents only listed one field for this version of the question, but noted that this one field in and of itself is interdisciplinary. For example, a neuroscience student (respondent 4) wrote neuroscience as the primary field of her dissertation research, and no secondary field, on Version B. As discussed previously, when she read the second part of the question, she commented that her dissertation research is interdisciplinary because neuroscience is considered to be an interdiscipline. She did not feel her research used other fields outside of neuroscience, so in this sense of listing multiple fields as an indicator of interdisciplinarity, she felt as if her research was not interdisciplinary. This question confused her and made her uncertain about whether her research should be considered interdisciplinary or not. This example suggests that in some cases of people working in established interdisciplines, the dissertation research field questions may not picking up on actual interdisciplinary research through the method of counting multiple fields. However, others who considered their fields to be interdisciplines did not have this problem and listed two fields without hesitation. Several of these respondents were among those who listed a subfield as a secondary field and believed that working with multiple subfields or a subfield of a larger discipline constitutes interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary research. This suggests that perhaps individuals in interdisciplinary fields felt the need to include a more specific subfield as a secondary field in response to the A2 questions because they recognized that the question wanted them to list a secondary field in order for their research to be considered interdisciplinary."}, {"section_title": "Inadequacy of the SED for Respondents in Interdisciplinary Degree Programs", "text": "One of the respondents (R2) was involved in the university's Individual Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program (IIDP). Another respondent (R20) was in the process of transferring into this program. Both of these students had difficulty answering each version of the dissertation research field(s) question, as well as the question which asks respondents to list the primary field of study for their doctoral degree (question A4, part c of the SED questionnaire, found in Appendix A). When answering the fields of dissertation research question, respondent 2 indicated that he does not have \"one primary field\" and did not want to \"rank them.\" He had trouble deciding which of his three fields he should write. He settled on the department in which his research assistantship is based, but seemed troubled by the fact that this would imply that he uses this field more than his other two, or that it would imply he considers this field more important than the other two. Respondent 20 had similar difficulty. She said she was confused by the question asking for her primary field. Since she is interdisciplinary, she believes she does not have one primary field. Both of these respondents faced similar troubles when naming the field of study for their degree in question A4. They each wrote \"interdisciplinary\" as their response for this question. Respondent 2 indicated this would \"be a problem\" when he realized he was also supposed to report a field code to correspond to his answer. He ended up selecting a generic code (Social Sciences, Other -699), which was different than any of the three codes he contemplated using in question A2. He opted to use this new code because he said that would be inaccurate to just list one of the fields he uses as the field of study for his degree. Respondent 20 selected the code that corresponds to the field of study for her current department as her response to A4, but since she is in the process of leaving this program to move into the interdisciplinary program, she explained that this was \"misleading.\""}, {"section_title": "How the Timing of When Respondents Were Referred to the List of Fields of Study Affects Responses", "text": "As alluded to briefly above, another difference in the construction of Versions A and B of the dissertation research field(s) question is when respondents are directed to consult the list of fields of study. Version A instructs respondents to use the list as they write the name of their primary field. Version B first asks respondents to write the name of their primary field, and then afterwards refers them to the list to find a code that corresponds to the field they wrote. This difference affected how individuals respond to the two versions of the question. When answering Version A, most of the interview respondents proceeded to examine the list before writing the name of their field, and therefore wrote the field title as it appeared on the list. However, on Version B, respondents tended to write the name of the field as they typically describe it, and then find a code that best matched their description. For example, Respondent 16, who received Version B initially, questioned whether to write her specific field, \"organic chemistry,\" or just a more general response of \"chemistry.\" She decided to just write chemistry. When she looked at the list and saw that it broke the field of chemistry down into subfields, she selected the code for organic chemistry, her specialty. Next, when answering Version A, she immediately remarked that in this version she would write \"organic chemistry\" as opposed to just \"chemistry\" because it referred her to the list first. Several respondents commented that Version A was easier to answer because, by asking them to refer to the list first, this question was clearer about how detailed respondents' answers should be. For example, Respondent 12, who answered Version B first, seemed troubled because she wrote a very specific description of her research area, and then realized that the list had more general categories. She remarked at this point that it would help if the question instructions prompted her to refer to the list before writing her answer. When she later responded to Version A, she said this form was more \"straightforward\" because it specifically asks her to look at the list from the beginning. Other respondents preferred the sense of freedom that Version B allowed them in naming their primary field in the manner they chose. Respondent 15 felt that Version B permitted her to provide more detail about her research fields. When answering Version A, she wrote \"experimental psychology\" in the box because that was how it appeared on the list. Then on Version B, she wrote \"behavioral psychology,\" which was not on the list. She used the code for experimental psychology, which she said is a more general, broader category which includes behavioral psychology. When asked if she thought it was helpful for the question to refer to the list first, she replied that \"it depends\" on what the researchers are trying to get from the question. She elaborated that if the researchers are only going to look at the codes respondents report, then it might be helpful to just refer people to the list first. But she believed that being able to write a title that is not on the list (as she did in Version B) \"gives more information.\""}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "This chapter sheds light on how doctoral student researchers define and think about interdisciplinary research. These results suggest that doctoral candidates are familiar with the term \"interdisciplinary,\" and generally understand that it refers to research that crosses or encompasses multiple disciplines. Given this familiarity, it is not surprising that the respondents' self-identifications as interdisciplinary or not seemed legitimate. All of the individuals who indicated they conduct interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary research appeared to be involved in activities associated with conducting interdisciplinary research. Several respondents were less familiar with the term \"multidisciplinary,\" suggesting that \"interdisciplinary\" is more commonly used. Respondents tended to view the two terms as somewhat similar to each other; however, nearly all made some distinction between the two words when asked to define them. Although all respondents were familiar with the general meaning of the word interdisciplinary, there was quite a bit of variation in their specific definitions of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research. Very few respondents recognized the definitions and distinctions used by many scholars who study interdisciplinary research. In fact, when presented with these scholars' definitions of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research, several respondents demonstrated some degree of confusion or disagreement with them. This suggests that in some ways the interdisciplinary research scholars may not be in touch with how the average researcher conceptualizes this type of research process. Some respondents made distinctions between the two terms based on the similarity of the fields being used together. Others suggested the distinction was related to the number of fields involved in each form of research. Others believed that collaboration (as opposed to working alone) distinguished multidisciplinary research from interdisciplinary research. This variety confirms that defining these terms is not a simple task, which is consistent with the variety of definitions and methods of measurement that exist throughout the academic community. It is also important to note that although most respondents provided separate definitions of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary, in many cases these distinctions did not appear to be very salient or meaningful. Some respondents were inconsistent in their use of distinct definitions, and some admitted that the two terms are basically the same or interchangeable. This suggests that only in the context of being asked about both terms simultaneously did respondents actually begin to think about how the two terms may differ. This provides further evidence that many researchers do not conceptualize these terms in ways consistent with the commentators who are studying the interdisciplinary movement and shaping how it is being defined. These results provide important insight for researchers wanting to better understand and measure this phenomenon. This study demonstrates that it is reasonable to expect that doctoral candidates are familiar with the term interdisciplinary, but that each individual may define the word in a unique way. This confirms that although many individuals claim to conduct interdisciplinary research and speak well of its potential, these researchers are not necessarily conversing about the same specific processes. The fact that respondents were largely unfamiliar with scholars' definitions of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research, and the fact that they defined the terms in a variety of ways, suggest that interdisciplinary research scholars' efforts to promote a specific definition has not influenced the way the broader academic community perceives the term. The findings that there is no common, agreed upon measure, and that many researchers' conceptualizations are very different from those found in the literature, have a number of important implications. First, this diversity of definitions makes measuring and studying the concept challenging. Any use of the term interdisciplinary, such as in a survey questionnaire, will evoke a variety of responses from different respondents. Researchers must recognize that individuals will interpret the question in different ways, which will affect the accuracy of reporting. Indeed, these interviews also illustrate a variety of ways in which the SED dissertation research field(s) questions were interpreted by the interviewees. The wide variety of diverse definitions, as well as the difficulty this raises for measuring and identifying interdisciplinary research, suggests that researchers interested in understanding the effects of the interdisciplinary movement have a long way to go before we are able to comprehensively examine and understand this movement's impact. Much of the literature examining the movement that already exists does so in very different ways, and there is nothing holding all of this literature together. It is ironic that while interdisciplinary research is meant to break down barriers between disconnected entities, different entities' understandings of interdisciplinary research continue to be unique, and there is a lack of consistency in defining the term across these boundaries. This suggests that this movement is not yet set up to truly meet its goals. Without a common definition and purpose to unify interdisciplinary researchers and organizations, interdisciplinary research cannot truly break down the boundaries it aims to dismantle. Funding organizations and institutions that aim to promote interdisciplinarity are likely going to play a critical role in advancing the cohesion of the interdisciplinary movement. But, if everyone is speaking a different language when it comes to defining what constitutes interdisciplinary research, it will be difficult for these organizations and institutions to effectively promote interdisciplinary advancement. Thus, not only is there a need for a better understanding of what interdisciplinary research means, but also a need for the development of ways to study and understand the current status of the movement. Being able to identify what is happening will help lead future efforts to increase the effectiveness of interdisciplinary endeavors. These interviews begin an examination of one method of identifying interdisciplinary researchers through the examination of the SED questions. This chapter shows that the SED dissertation research field(s) questions are somewhat successful as measures of interdisciplinary research. Respondents' answers to these questions were consistent with their descriptions of their research as interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary in a majority of cases. However, neither version of the question was completely accurate. Both renditions obtained several \"false negative\" reports of interdisciplinary research, and Version A obtained some \"false positive\" reports. Version B is slightly more accurate as an indicator of interdisciplinary research than Version A, which is likely due to the fact that the \"secondary field\" wording of Version A is vaguer without the use of the term \"interdisciplinary.\" However, the fairly high rates of false negative reports to both versions of the question reveal that the question \"undercounts\" interdisciplinary doctoral students, and thus could be improved to be a more accurate indicator of interdisciplinary research. Most of the interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary respondents identified themselves as such when they were presented with the questionnaire items using these terms. This suggests that in many cases the dissertation research question prompts respondents to recognize their status as interdisciplinary or not. However, in some cases interdisciplinary/ multidisciplinary respondents did not answer the A2 questions in a way that was consistent with their descriptions of their research. There were a variety of reasons for these inconsistencies, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific problem behind all of these errors. In many cases, these inconsistent responses resulted from behaviors unique to individual respondents, such as uncommon interpretations of the questions or personal reactions to certain terms used in the questions. Therefore, it appears as if the questions could use more clarity to help improve respondents' interpretations. This analysis of the use of the SED questions as indicators of interdisciplinary research provides other researchers with helpful insights for improving the measurement of interdisciplinary research at the individual level. The results indicate that if surveyors have a broad, general idea of interdisciplinary research that they are trying to measure (i.e., research that encompasses multiple disciplines), then the variation in ways respondents interpret the term interdisciplinary may not present much of a problem. However, if one is trying to capture a very specific definition of interdisciplinary research, then simply using the word \"interdisciplinary\" without additional defining material is likely to result in greater measurement error. Therefore, future attempts to measure interdisciplinary research in survey questionnaires should account for the variety of definitions that exist. The easiest way to address this may be to provide a definition for respondents to use when answering the question. Furthermore, since some individuals did not seem to recognize that the questions asking for the field(s) of their research were also indirectly asking if their research is interdisciplinary, it may be helpful to construct separate questions and not imbed a question about interdisciplinary research into another indicator about fields of study. This would better clarify the purpose of each question for respondents. An example of how these questions could be constructed is illustrated in Figure 2.3. Alternatively, instead of simply asking respondents if their research is interdisciplinary, researchers might benefit more from a series of indicators to understand in what ways respondents' research is actually interdisciplinary. These questions could determine if individuals participate in a variety of activities commonly associated with interdisciplinary research. This would provide a greater level of understanding about respondents' practices, which would better allow scholars to make sense of the variety of ways in which individuals define the term interdisciplinary.

(By interdisciplinary we mean research that integrates information, data, techniques, tools, perspectives, concepts, and/or theories from two or more disciplines)."}, {"section_title": "Yes", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "No", "text": "Not sure Nevertheless, the fact that the second version of the question appears to be a reasonably accurate indicator of interdisciplinary research means that the SED and its follow-up, the Survey of Doctorate Recipients, show great potential as important datasets for examining the individual-level effects of interdisciplinary research. This conclusion provides a rationale for the development of quantitative studies of interdisciplinary SED respondents, such as those contained in Chapters 3 and of this dissertation. These interviews illustrate interdisciplinarity is a complex phenomenon, and more work must be done to better understand the variety of ways in which individual researchers conceptualize so-called interdisciplinary knowledge so that we can move forward in understanding it and advocates can effectively promote it. This research provides some clues as to how individuals think about these issues, but it is important to recognize that these interviews were only conducted at a single university. It is quite likely that individuals' ideas about interdisciplinarity are shaped by the institutional context within which they are embedded (Brint 2005;Lattuca 2001). Several characteristics of WSU could have affected these results. For example, WSU has a formal interdisciplinary doctoral program, as well as several NSF IGERT grants, which are specifically targeted toward training graduate students in interdisciplinary research. The presence of these explicitly interdisciplinary activities on campus could have increased students' awareness and understanding of interdisciplinary research. It is possible that in other schools without these traits, students may not be as familiar with interdisciplinarity. Nevertheless, these interviews have provided tremendous insight into the ideas of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research. These results offer important knowledge which can help guide future researchers in identifying the various processes involved in interdisciplinary research and determining how ideas about it may differ in varying contexts. This will provide a better basis from which to develop a common understanding of the term. This analysis also lays the groundwork for improving methods of identifying and measuring interdisciplinary research, and establishes key insights into the usefulness of an existing indicator, which has the potential to expand our understanding of how interdisciplinarity affects individual careers."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER THREE BENEFICIAL OR DETRIMENTAL?

These scholars note that the departmental structure of universities and the academic career are obstacles to those wishing to conduct interdisciplinary research (Lattuca 2001;  Indeed, one study by Borrego and Newswander (In press) found that only 6% of academic job announcement advertisements explicitly seek interdisciplinary candidates. Those who do manage to obtain joint appointments face challenges of their own. Hart and Mars (2008) found that those with joint appointments must undertake a variety of extra tasks to \"selfadvocate\" and justify their work, which has implications for their chances of success. Hart and Mars concluded that such scholars have \"two houses but no home\" (2008: 31). Others also point out that interdisciplinary faculty members are often expected to do \"double duty,\" and may often not get credit for interdisciplinary activities (National Academies 2004). All of this suggests that conducting interdisciplinary research may be detrimental for one's career success. Indeed, several studies indicate that new scholars recognize this risk. Some are wary of conducting interdisciplinary research because it is not well-regarded by hiring and tenure committees, which tend to evaluate research within the context of particular disciplines (Lattuca 2001;National Academies 2004). In her qualitative study of 38 interdisciplinary academics, Lattuca (2001) found that most respondents believed junior faculty should concentrate on disciplinary research and teaching, and that it is only safe to conduct interdisciplinary research after receiving tenure. There are other ways in which interdisciplinary researchers may be disadvantaged. For example, it is difficult to publish interdisciplinary research in traditional disciplinary journals . Furthermore, publications in interdisciplinary journals may face a citation penalty. Levitt and Thelwall (2008) found that within the life sciences, health sciences, and physical sciences, research published in single-discipline journals is cited about twice as often as research published in multidiscipline journals. The expectation that interdisciplinary researchers will face obstacles getting hired and promoted in disciplinary departments is consistent with the tendency for occupations to enact processes of social closure. Social theorists, beginning with Max Weber, have argued that occupations utilize methods of social closure in order to preserve the occupational status, and thus rewards, for those in professional occupations (Weeden 2002;Weber [1922] 1968). These theorists discuss how occupations create barriers to restrict access. Social groups defined by these occupations \"try to monopolize advantages and maximize rewards by closing off opportunities to outsiders they define as inferior or ineligible\" (Weeden 2002: 58;Weber 1968). Educational credentials are one mechanism through which social closure operates. Educational credentialing uses \"familiar symbols or markers of knowledge\" to restrict movement into an occupation (Weeden 2002: 61). By restricting the supply of \"qualified\" individuals into a profession, social closure enables those within an occupational group to maintain high status and therefore reap the rewards of the value placed on this high status, elite group. Traditional, discipline-specific doctoral degrees may be an example of this type of credential, which would place those whose degrees are based in interdisciplinary studies at a disadvantage for entering the scientific/academic occupations. If exclusionary boundaries are built, which is often done in processes of social closure, they can be used to signal to outsiders that those who are within the boundary are considered more legitimate, better trained, and of higher quality than those outside the boundary (Weeden 2002). Such boundaries may exist in an effort to exclude interdisciplinary scholars, which would explain why they are thought to have difficulty succeeding within the disciplinary structure of science and academia. The notion that interdisciplinary research may be detrimental for career advancement is somewhat surprising given the great deal of support the scientific community seems to have for interdisciplinary research. Some evidence suggests that the institutional context may play an important role in determining whether interdisciplinarity may be valued or not. For example, Brint (2005) discussed how many universities are beginning to reconfigure their missions through emphasizing interdisciplinary creativity as opposed to the traditional disciplinary specialization model of universities. Methods of emphasizing interdisciplinarity include efforts to recruit prominent interdisciplinary researchers and investing in interdisciplinary developments. These trends suggest that in some environments, employers may be more receptive to alternative career trajectories. Indeed, in her interviews with interdisciplinary researchers, Lattuca (2001) found that some conducted interdisciplinary research despite of the notion that it is risky, and others believed interdisciplinary experience is helpful in the promotion process. Lattuca attributed these individuals' positive assessments of their prospects to the institutional context; those who believed that interdisciplinary research is beneficial were more likely to be in universities that explicitly expressed support (and provided financial assistance) for interdisciplinary research. These examples suggest that in some contexts, interdisciplinarity is viewed as essential, rather than frowned upon. However, there is very little data behind these claims. Lattuca's study was limited to only 38 respondents, and many commentators do not have data to back up their observations. These contradictory interpretations of the value of interdisciplinary research for one's career success call for a more systematic analysis. Much of the literature on interdisciplinary research is limited to observational studies or non-systematic/non-random survey sampling, and these works fail to address how the outcomes of interdisciplinary scholars may differ from those of non-interdisciplinary scholars. Using nationally-representative data on doctoral graduates within the sciences and social sciences, this chapter compares the early career outcomes of individuals who conduct interdisciplinary research for their dissertation to the outcomes of those who do not. With these data, I begin to develop a fuller understanding of career outlooks for a new and increasingly popular segment of the research and academic communities.\n"}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "Given the common notion that interdisciplinary researchers face a variety of obstacles, we might expect interdisciplinary doctoral graduates to be unemployed at a higher rate than noninterdisciplinary doctoral graduates. Therefore, the first question examined in this chapter is whether doctoral graduates who conducted interdisciplinary dissertation research are less likely than others to be employed. Furthermore, much of the discussion about the disadvantages of interdisciplinary research focuses on the academic labor market. No prior research has examined interdisciplinary scholars who work outside of academia, so there is nothing to suggest whether they are similarly disadvantaged in this employment sector. However, because common definitions of interdisciplinary research suggest that it is problem-focused, interdisciplinary researchers might be more highly valued in the nonacademic labor market where they would be less involved in producing research solely for academic outlets. Therefore, I also determine whether doctoral graduates who conducted interdisciplinary dissertation research are less likely than others to be employed in academia. In addition to examining whether interdisciplinary researchers have a lower likelihood of making their way into the academic labor market, I also explore career differences among those who do become employed within academia. Prior literature often argues how interdisciplinary researchers face obstacles in obtaining tenure and receiving promotions within the academic employers. The data used in this analysis are not equipped to address outcomes such as receiving tenure at this time, but they are useful for examining whether interdisciplinary researchers hold different types of positions than their disciplinary counterparts within academia. This research determines whether conducting interdisciplinary doctoral research results in a decreased likelihood (compared to those conducting single-discipline research) of obtaining a tenure track position, as compared to non-tenure track positions and postdoctoral positions. Based on the past literature, I expect that interdisciplinary researchers may be less likely to be in full-time tenure track positions, and instead may be concentrated in part-time adjunct positions or in temporary positions such as postdocs. Postdoctoral appointments, many of which are in academia, are generally not as desirable as a permanent, tenure track professorial positions. The number of postdocs has grown substantially over several decades, partially because the supply of Ph.D. earners has exceeded the availability of permanent appointments for doctorate holders (Zumeta 1985). Research suggests that many individuals who take postdoc positions do so because permanent positions are not available, or because they hope it will make them more marketable in the very competitive academic job market (McGinnis, Allison, and Long 1982;Zumeta 1985). There is evidence that researchers can become \"stuck\" in postdocs instead of moving on to permanent employment, that postdocs feel that their job prospects are limited, and that competition for academic jobs has increased (Akerlind 2005;Nerad and Cerny 1999;Singer 2004;Coggeshall et al. 1978). Additionally, research suggests that postdoctoral appointments do not have any long-term benefits for those who complete them. Zumeta (1985) found that those who complete postdocs have overall lower lifetime earnings than those who do not. Even when Zumeta examined just at those individuals who work in academia (which typically pays less than private industry), individuals who completed postdoctoral appointments still had lower earnings. Additionally, although in earlier decades those who completed postdocs obtained an advantage in the competition for research-based academic positions, Zumeta found that within the more recent cohorts included in his analysis, those who completed a postdoc did not have any greater likelihood of getting a research faculty position, nor did they have any advantage for getting jobs at top-rated universities. All of this suggests that obtaining a postdoctoral position may not necessarily be advantageous, and in some cases can be disadvantageous. If interdisciplinary researchers cannot find a job closely related to their doctoral training, they may seek out other positions that are less related to their area of expertise. Thus, I also examine whether those who conducted interdisciplinary dissertation research are more likely than others to have a job that is not closely related to the field of their doctoral degree. We might expect this to be the case given the assumptions that interdisciplinary researchers have greater difficulty finding jobs. If interdisciplinary research is in fact devalued, it also might lead to differences in income and research support. I determine whether conducting interdisciplinary doctoral research affects individuals' salaries, resulting in lower pay for these individuals as compared to single-discipline researchers. Additionally, this chapter examines whether the likelihood of having federally-funded research grants is affected by interdisciplinary research. Given the literature suggesting that those who conduct interdisciplinary doctoral research are disadvantaged, we might expect that they may be less likely to have these types of grants supporting their work. The report does highlight some indirect indicators. For example, it indicates that 35% of the NSF's RFPs contain the word \"interdisciplinary.\" However, the report also acknowledges that 80% of the grant proposals NSF receives are unsolicited by RFPs. So, relying simply on this measure is not very meaningful. The information contained in this report seems to imply that while there are extensive efforts to promote interdisciplinary work at NSF, Regardless of the findings of these analyses, the results have important implications for those who conduct interdisciplinary research as well as organizations in which they seek employment. This chapter provides the first large-scale analysis using representative data from which we can assess the employment prospects for interdisciplinary scholars, and therefore suggest ways in which we can guide employers and educational institutions in addressing inequities, should they exist."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": "I use two related sources of data for this chapter: the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Survey of Earned Doctorates and Survey of Doctorate Recipients. The Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) is a census of all individuals receiving research doctoral degrees (in all fields) from accredited U.S. Data collected through the SED each year are added to a database of all doctorate earners, the Doctorate Records File. This file is the primary sampling frame of the second survey used in these analyses, the Survey of Doctorate Recipients. The Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) is a longitudinal interdisciplinary proposals are not necessarily given preferential treatment, and there is no indication that a majority of NSF funds go to interdisciplinary projects. The sample used for these analyses includes only those 2006 SDR respondents who completed the SED in 2004 and 2005, which means that the sample is limited to recent doctoral recipients. This restriction is based on the availability of the indicator used to measure interdisciplinary research, which I discuss below. The sample only includes individuals who were not missing data for this question used to identify interdisciplinary researchers. These restrictions result in a sample which consists of 2,244 cases. 16 The sample size used for each of the analytical models tested varies based on the number of cases within this sample of 2,244 individuals with available data for the other measures used."}, {"section_title": "Dependent Variables", "text": "I use a variety of indicators derived from SDR questions to construct dependent variables used in the analyses of this chapter. Employment: I examine whether interdisciplinary dissertation research affects the likelihood of being employed 1-2 years after the receipt of the doctoral degree using a dichotomous variable with a value of 1 for those who reported being employed, and a value of 0 for those who were not employed. Employment in academia: I determine whether interdisciplinary research affects respondents' likelihood of working in academia (post-secondary educational institutions) as opposed to other types of employers. This is a dichotomous measure with a value of 1 for respondents who reported being employed by an academic/post-secondary educational institution, either public or private. It has a value of 0 if respondents reported being employed by any non-educational institutions, including private forprofit organizations, private non-profits, and federal/state/local government employers). Those who are not employed are excluded from these analyses. Type of employment in academia: Next I examine whether interdisciplinary researchers who are employed in academia are concentrated in different types of positions than non-interdisciplinary researchers. This indicator is a trichotomous variable representing three possible job types within academia: tenure track positions (coded as 2), postdoctoral positions (coded as 1), and non-tenure track positions (coded as 0). Job not related to degree: I also determine whether interdisciplinary doctoral research affects the likelihood of employment in a job not related to one's degree. This is a dichotomous variable with a value of 1 for respondents who reported that their jobs are \"not related\" to their degrees, and a value of 0 for respondents who indicated that their jobs are either \"somewhat related\" or \"closely related\" to the field of their doctoral degree. Those who are not employed are not analyzed in these models. Income: I also examine whether interdisciplinary dissertation research affects respondents' income. The SDR asks respondents to report their annual income from their primary job, and then to report the number of weeks for which the salary is based. In order to account for the variation in the number of weeks that individuals' salaries are based upon, I divided the annual salary variable by the number of weeks to create a standard, weekly income variable. This continuous measure ranged in value from less than one dollar to $54,000 per week. Since this variable was highly skewed, I use the natural log of these weekly values in the multivariate models to determine if interdisciplinary researchers are paid less than their disciplinary counterparts. Those who were not employed did not report income information, and are not included in these analyses. Federal grant funding: Finally, I determine whether interdisciplinary doctoral research affects the likelihood of obtaining federal grant funding after individuals complete their doctoral degrees. This is a dichotomous measure with a value of 1 for respondents who reported working with federal grant support 1-2 years after doctoral receipt, and a value of 0 for those without this type of grant support.\nEmployment in academia: This is a dichotomous variable with a value of 1 for respondents who reported being employed in academia (either public or private institutions of higher education). All Research grant: This variable denotes whether respondents' work is supported by federallyfunded research grants. It equals 1 for those who do have grant funding 1-2 years after doctoral receipt and 0 for those who do not. Primary work activity: This variable represents whether those employed within academia spend more of their work time on research or teaching. This variable is coded as 1 for those who indicate research as their primary work activity and 0 for those who indicate teaching as their primary activity. Other activities are not included in this variable. STEM scientist job: The SDR asks respondents to report a three-digit \"job category\" code (from a provided list) that best represents their job type. I use a dummy variable with a value of one for respondents who report jobs that are in the categories of life scientist, physical/chemical scientist, computer scientist, engineer, and mathematical scientist. This variable equals 0 for other, non-STEMrelated jobs. Sex composition of job category: I use data from the SDR to construct an indicator of the sex composition of each respondent's job category. As mentioned above, the SDR asks respondents to report a \"job category\" number from a provided list that best represents their job. I used data from all SDR respondents at all stages in their careers (not just the sample of recent graduates I use in these models) to calculate the percent of male respondents in each of these job categories. I then attached the appropriate sex composition value to each respondent who reported a job category. This sex composition variable is a continuous measure that represents the proportion male within respondents' job categories. It ranges in value from 0.22 to 1.0 in this sample. Since the entire SDR sample is representative of all doctorate earners in the included fields of study in the U.S., the job categories of these sampled individuals should adequately represent those of the nation's doctoral recipients in these fields. I refer to these classifications as \"job\" categories since this is the title used on the SDR. But, it is important to note that these categories are not specific to each individual's job, and are more closely aligned with occupational categories. However, they are not completely similar to the 3-digit Census occupational categories which are traditionally used to measure occupational sex composition. computer sciences, and mathematics. The SDR also includes individuals who earned degrees in the social sciences and psychology, but since my focus is on the STEM fields, they have been excluded from all of these analyses. I also use the three individual-level education-related variables that may be associated with interdisciplinary research. These include whether respondents received tuition remission during graduate school (1=two-thirds or more of their tuition waived; 0= less than two-thirds of tuition expenses waived) and whether respondents received educationally-related forms of financial support during graduate school (1 for respondents whose primary source of financial support was educationallyrelated and 0). The last of these variables is the number of years individuals spent in graduate school. This variable ranges in value from 2 to 55 for this sample. Since 99% of the sampled cases reported 15 or fewer years, I recoded all outlier values of 16 or greater to be equal to 15. To control for factors associated with respondents' doctoral institutions, I use the same educational institution indicators I used in Study 1. The first of these is schools' Carnegie Classifications (1= \"research extensive\"; 0=other types of schools). The second is the indicator of schools' selectivity in admissions to account for school prestige. This variable, as mentioned above, comes from the 2005 IPEDS data. It is a continuous variable indicating for each school the proportion of undergraduate applicants that are rejected admission. The values of this measure for this sample range from 0 (no applicants are rejected for admission) to 0.91 (91% of applicants are rejected). The third variable indicates whether schools award doctoral degrees in formally-defined interdisciplinary degree programs, which was also derived from IPEDS data. This variable equals 1 for schools that award interdisciplinary doctoral degrees and 0 for those that do not. In the models examining the proportion male in respondents' job categories, I add in controls for other factors that might be associated with respondents' likelihood of working in male-dominated job categories. The first of these is a dummy variable representing whether respondents are employed in academia. The next control variable is a dichotomous variable indicating whether respondents work for public employers (as opposed to private employers). I include this variable because public employers' employment practices are regulated to a greater extent than private employers', which means they may have more egalitarian policies than private organizations. I also include a variable that accounts for the number of individuals employed by respondents' employers, since larger employers are more likely to have formalized hiring policies and safeguards against sex discrimination. This variable ranges in value from 1 (10 or fewer employees) to 8 (25,000 or more employees). These models also account for whether one's primary work activity is research (1=research-related work activities; 0=teaching), since this activity is more common among men. To account for job type, these models include a dummy variable representing whether respondents work as a STEM scientist or not. I also account for whether respondents work part time with a dummy variable that equals 1 for those who work less than 35 hours per week."}, {"section_title": "Key Independent Variable", "text": "The key independent variable of interest in this chapter is whether individuals conducted interdisciplinary dissertation research. I identified interdisciplinary research using the SED question which asks respondents to report the field, or fields, of study for their dissertation research. Since 2004, this question has asked respondents to identify the primary field of their research, and then to list a secondary field \"if *their+ dissertation research was interdisciplinary.\" I consider any respondents who listed multiple fields to have conducted interdisciplinary dissertation research. In the 2001-2003 SED, respondents were also given the option of reporting both a \"primary\" and a \"secondary\" field of dissertation research, if applicable. However, this earlier version of the question does not specify that the research should be \"interdisciplinary.\" Both versions of the question used since 2001, which give respondents the option of including multiple fields, are potential indicators of interdisciplinary research. However, not much is known about how to best measure interdisciplinary research, and thus whether these questions perform well as indicators of interdisciplinarity. In order to verify that these two questions were suitable indicators of interdisciplinary research, I conducted a series of cognitive interviews with doctoral candidates to evaluate the use of these questions for identifying interdisciplinary researchers (see previous chapter). The results of these interviews suggest that the second version of the question, which contains the term \"interdisciplinary,\" is a more accurate indicator of interdisciplinary status. 17 Therefore, the analyses in this chapter are limited to only those individuals who were asked the second question version (administered in 2004 and 2005). However, it is important to recognize that the interview results also showed that this indicator is a conservative measure that may undercount the number of individuals conducting interdisciplinary dissertation research. 17 Version B of the question appeared to be an accurate indicator of interdisciplinary research (or noninterdisciplinary research) in a majority of the interviews. Version A was not quite as accurate. Both versions of the question obtained some \"false negative\" reports of interdisciplinary research, but Version A also obtained some \"false positive\" reports of interdisciplinary research. Therefore, I opted to limit these analyses only to those cases which responded to the more reliable indicator. Because this measure is only available for 2004 and 2005 doctoral graduates, this chapter's evaluation of career outcomes is limited to those within one to two years post-graduation. While this time frame does not allow for a definitive examination of all relevant career outcomes, I am able to examine some key differences that may exist as doctoral graduates begin their careers, which can have implications for future differences as well. The indicator used to denote interdisciplinary dissertation research in these analyses is a dichotomous variable with a value of 1 for individuals who reported multiple fields of dissertation research (labeled interdisciplinary), and a value of 0 for respondents who provided only one field of research (labeled non-interdisciplinary). The second models also contain several other variables related to respondents' educations, as these may be associated with conducting interdisciplinary research. These indicators are derived from the SED questionnaire responses. Two of these indicators represent whether individuals reported receiving financial support in graduate school. One form of financial support is tuition remission; this is a dichotomous variable with a value of 1 to denote respondents who had two-thirds or more of their 18 There were very small numbers of both Native American and Native Pacific Islander respondents in the sample."}, {"section_title": "Control Variables", "text": "Therefore, rather than exclude them from analyses, I opted to group them together in the construction of the race/ethnicity variables. 19 Field of degree is reported separately from field(s) of dissertation research in the SED questionnaire. Field of degree represents the field in which the degree was awarded. In most cases, this field is the same as the primary field of dissertation research, but the two variables do not necessarily coincide in all cases. 20 The SED groups all of the life sciences, including biological, biomedical, health, agricultural, and natural resource sciences, together in one \"life sciences\" category. This category is large and diverse category, so to better account for this diversity, I used the SED's subgroups to divide these fields into two categories: the agricultural/natural resource sciences and biological/biomedical/health sciences. tuition waived, and a value of 0 if they had less than two-thirds of their tuition expenses waived. The other variable indicates whether respondents received educationally-related forms of financial support during graduate school. It has a value of 1 for respondents whose primary source of financial support was educationally-related, such as a research or teaching assistantship or a grant. I assigned a value of 0 to respondents whose primary source of support was not educationally-related, such as using personal I also used the IPEDS data to construct a variable indicating whether respondents' doctoral institutions include formally-defined interdisciplinary degree programs. The purpose of this variable is to account for the varying level of support institutions may provide to individuals conducting interdisciplinary doctoral research. If a school offers interdisciplinary degree programs, then this may be an indicator that it provides more support than other schools may to individual students pursuing this type of research. The IPEDS system uses a classification of degree fields that includes a series of codes that are assigned to programs that are labeled as interdisciplinary and/or multidisciplinary. Using these data from the 2004 reports (which would be applicable to both 2004 and 2005 graduates), I constructed a variable that indicates whether each institution granted doctoral degrees in one of these interdisciplinary and/or multidisciplinary classification codes (1= school awarded doctoral degrees in at least one of these fields; 0= school did not award any doctoral degrees in these fields). The models predicting the effects of interdisciplinary research on respondents' income include several job-related control variables. To account for job type, these models contain a dummy variable with a value of 1 if the respondent reported working in a non-science related job and a value of 0 for science-related and scientific jobs. This variable serves to account for respondents who may be employed outside the sciences (which would be unexpected for this sample). These models also control for the number of hours respondents reported working per week. This is a continuous variable representing the number of hours, ranging from four to 98 hours, which is the cut-off value used in the dataset. Additionally, when examining the outcome of receiving federal grant funding, I control for job tenure by including two dichotomous indicators representing of the number of years individuals have been employed in their current job. The first of these represents individuals who have been in their current jobs for 2-3 years and the second variable accounts for those who have been employed in their current position for 4 or more years. Respondents with a job tenure of zero to one years are included in the omitted category. 22\nThe series of multivariate models predicting interdisciplinary dissertation research include a variety of control variables. The second model includes a series of dummy variable controls for the broad field categories in which individuals earned their degrees (not their dissertation research fields), since the likelihood of conducting interdisciplinary research is affected by respondents' field of study (see introduction, Chapter 1). These field categories, which are based off of the categories included in the SED's taxonomy, include: biological/biomedical sciences (the omitted category), agricultural and natural resource sciences, physical sciences, engineering, computer sciences, mathematics, psychological sciences, social sciences, humanities, education, business, and communication. 28 Respondents who earned degrees in fields that are only classified as \"Other\" on the SED are excluded from these multivariate models. 29 It is also important to account for other education-related variables that could be associated with whether respondents conduct interdisciplinary dissertation research. The first of these is an indicator of whether respondents received tuition remission during graduate school (a dummy variable with a value of 1 to denote respondents who had two-thirds or more of their tuition waived, and a value of 0 if they had less than two-thirds of their tuition expenses waived). The next variable indicates whether respondents received educationally-related forms of financial support during graduate school. This variable has a value of 1 for respondents whose primary source of financial support was educationally-related, such as a research or teaching assistantship or a grant. I assigned a value of 0 to respondents whose primary source of support was not educationally-related, such as using personal savings or family members' contributions. I also account for the number of years individuals report spending in graduate school. This variable is a continuous indicator ranging in value from two to 17. Several respondents in the sample had values for this variable that were quite high. Since 99% of the 28 The SED groups all of the life sciences, including biological, biomedical, health, agricultural, and natural resource sciences, together in one \"life sciences\" category. This category as a whole is by far the largest and most diverse category contained in the SED taxonomy. In order to better account for this diversity, I used the SED's subgroups to divide these fields into two categories: the agricultural/natural resource sciences and biological/biomedical/health sciences. I use biological/biomedical/health fields as the reference category for all of the fields of study indicators, and include a separate indicator for agricultural and natural resource sciences. cases in the sample had values of 17 or fewer years, I recoded all outlier values that were 18 or above as 17. Research suggests that institutions of higher education vary in the extent to which they may promote or support interdisciplinary research (Brint 2005;Lattuca 2001;, and rates of interdisciplinary dissertation research vary across schools (Falkenheim 2010). Also, the types of schools from which women and men earn their doctoral degrees differ to some degree (NSF 2009). Therefore, I also account for several characteristics associated with the educational institutions from which respondents earned their doctoral degrees. The first of these variables is derived from the 2005 Carnegie classification of each institution, which is included in the SED data. I constructed a dichotomous variable with a value of 1 for \"research extensive\" schools (formerly referred to as \"Research I\" universities), and a value of 0 for other types of institutions. Additionally, I account for school prestige using an indicator of schools' degree of selectivity in admissions. This variable is derived from data collected by the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), which is the primary source of data on postsecondary educational institutions in the United States. I divided the number of individuals admitted to each institution by the number of those who applied to each institution at the undergraduate level, as reported in the 2005 IPEDS data. 30 I then reverse-coded this indicator of the proportion of applicants who were selected for admission, so that higher proportions represent more selective admissions policies. The values of this measure range from 0.0 (no applicants are rejected for admission) to 0.95 (95% of applicants are rejected). 30 I use data on undergraduate admissions and application numbers because similar data are not available for graduate admissions and applications. I use data from 2005 for all cases despite the year in which respondents earned their degrees since selectivity in admissions is unlikely to vary considerably over such a short time period. I also used the IPEDS data to construct a variable indicating whether respondents' doctoral institutions include formally-defined interdisciplinary degree programs. This variable is included in order to account for the varying level of support institutions may provide to individuals conducting interdisciplinary doctoral research. Using IPEDS data from the 2004 reports (which are likely to be applicable to all graduates in these data), I constructed a variable that indicates whether each institution granted doctoral degrees in one of IPEDS' interdisciplinary and/or multidisciplinary degree classification codes (1= school awarded doctoral degrees in at least one of these fields; 0= school did not award doctoral degrees in these fields)."}, {"section_title": "Method of Analysis", "text": "In order to assess the relationship between conducting interdisciplinary research for one's doctoral dissertation and the career outcomes explained above, I use multivariate regression analyses. I perform logistic regression models for the binary outcome variables, including employment, employment in academia, whether respondents' jobs are not related to their degrees, and federal grant support. I employ multinomial logistic regression to examine the placement within different job types among those employed in academia, and OLS regression to model the effect of interdisciplinary research on income, a continuous variable. All models include a normalized sampling weight to account for the different probabilities for selection into the sample and survey nonresponse. Variance inflation factors (VIFs) for all models are within normal limits, indicating that the results were not affected by multicollinearity. I use listwise deletion to exclude cases that have missing data for any of the variables used in the analyses. I report models using listwise deletion because overall, there is very little missing data in this sample. The primary reason for this is that the SDR already includes some imputed values for missing data (NSF no date). I also ran each of the multivariate models using multiple imputation to account for missing values, and these models were all substantively similar to their counterparts I report in this chapter. 22 Since the sample I use is limited to recent doctoral graduates, respondents who report being in their current job for more than 3 years must have been employed in this position before completing graduate school. A vast majority of respondents (over 93%) have been in their current position for three or fewer years. For each outcome, I estimate several models. The first, baseline models include the indictor for interdisciplinary dissertation research as well as controls for individual demographic variables. The second models add in variables associated with individuals' educations. These controls include the series of variables accounting for each of the broad field of study categories, measures related to respondents' educational finances, and the years respondents spent in graduate school. The third models add in institutional-related factors associated with respondents' doctoral education, as well as job-related controls when appropriate. This multiple-step approach allows me to see if the effects of interdisciplinary research change with the addition of potentially endogenous control variables. Table 3.1 displays weighted means and proportions for the variables used in the analyses. I provide descriptive statistics for the full sample as well as broken down by interdisciplinary research status, and test for significant differences between these two groups. Twenty-nine percent of individuals in this sample reported interdisciplinary dissertation research. The descriptive numbers show that interdisciplinary researchers have a higher rate of employment in academia than non-interdisciplinary researchers. However, interdisciplinary researchers also hold tenure track academic positions at a lower rate than their non-interdisciplinary counterparts. Table 3.1 also shows that fewer interdisciplinary respondents than non-interdisciplinary respondents obtained their doctoral degree from a research extensive (\"R1\") university. There are some significant differences in the demographics of interdisciplinary and non-interdisciplinary respondents.\nThis study uses both X 2 tests and multivariate logistic regression models to determine the effect of respondent sex on the likelihood of conducting interdisciplinary research. I also use X 2 tests to assess the relationship between interdisciplinary research and earning a degree in a STEM field. When executing the multivariate models, I checked for potential collinearity problems by examining the variance inflation factors (VIFs), and these were within acceptable limits. I used listwise deletion for cases that had missing data on any variables included in the logistic regression model.\nStudy 2 employs multivariate regression models to address each outcome. I employ multinomial logistic regression to examine the three-category dependent variable (type of job within academia), OLS regression to model the continuous dependent variable (sex composition of job category), and logistic regression for the remaining outcomes, which are coded as binary variables. In order to determine whether interdisciplinary research differentially affects the outcomes of interest among men and women, each model uses the series of dummy variables representing female interdisciplinary researchers, male interdisciplinary researchers, and male non-interdisciplinary researchers, with female non-interdisciplinary researchers as the omitted category. 34 I use the post-estimation \"test\" command in STATA to compare the effects of all the different sex/interdisciplinary research status combinations to each other. These tests allow me to assess the relationship between each pair of sex-interdisciplinary research status combination without estimating multiple models with different omitted categories. I use a multi-step approach to modeling each outcome to determine the effect of sex and interdisciplinary research before and after controlling for potentially endogenous variables. 34 I also conducted separate models for men and women for each outcome in order to directly see the effect of interdisciplinary research for men and women separately. The results of the pooled models and sex-specific models are substantively similar, so these sex-specific models are not included in the tables. For each pair of sexspecific models, I performed z tests to assess whether the coefficients for interdisciplinary dissertation research were significantly different across the two models (Paternoster et al. 1998). These results indicate that the interdisciplinary research coefficient from each of the male-only models is significantly different from its comparable interdisciplinary research coefficient in the female-only models. The baseline models examine the effect of interdisciplinary research and sex while controlling for individual demographics. 35 The second models add in measures accounting for the field of doctoral degree, and other individual-specific educational. In the third models I include measures related to respondents' educational institutions as well as job-relevant controls, where appropriate. All models include a normalized sampling weight to account for the different probabilities for selection into the sample and survey nonresponse. To assure that the models were not affected by multicollinearity, I examined variance inflation factor (VIF) values for all models, and these were all within acceptable limits. I use listwise deletion to exclude cases that have missing data for any of the variables used in the analyses, since the SDR has imputed values for missing data in most cases and because there is very little missing data contained in this sample. Models using multiple imputation to account for missing data show substantively similar findings as those presented in herein. Table 4.7 contains descriptive statistics for all of the variables used in the Study 2 analyses. This table shows there are significant differences between men and women in a number of the outcome variables examined in this study. Women are more likely to be employed in academia, but less likely than men to be employed. Women are more likely than men to be employed part-time, and less likely to be employed full-time. Women are also less likely than men to conduct research as their primary work 35 I also ran models that just included the sex/interdisciplinary research status combination variables, without demographic controls. The results of these models are substantively similar to those that include other individual demographic variables. So, for the sake of space and continuity with Chapter 3, I have omitted these results from the tables. activity or to work in a STEM-field based job.

The first model includes controls for respondent demographics. In the second model, l add in the field of study indicators, and controls for individuals' educational characteristics. The third model also accounts for educational institution-related variables. All three models indicate that there is no statistically significant relationship between conducting interdisciplinary dissertation research and the likelihood of being employed after graduation. Thus, contrary to popular notions, interdisciplinary doctoral graduates are no less likely than their non-interdisciplinary counterparts to find a job. However, since employment in this sample is very high overall (96% of all respondents are employed), the fact that there is not much variation between interdisciplinary and non-interdisciplinary respondents is not surprising. Interestingly, however, receiving a degree from a university that has formal interdisciplinary doctoral degree programs positively affects respondents' likelihood of being employed, net of other relevant variables. Also, somewhat surprisingly, there is a negative relationship between the selectivity of doctoral institutions and the likelihood of employment. Female respondents are significantly less likely than males to be employed, and individuals with small children are less likely than those without small children to be employed, net of other factors. Academic job: Table 3.2 also contains coefficients from three models regressing having a job in academia (vs. all other sectors) on the interdisciplinary dissertation research indicator and control variables. All three of these models show that, holding other factors constant, conducting interdisciplinary research increases one's likelihood of obtaining a position within academia, as opposed to other employment sectors. This effect is not diminished by the addition of factors associated with respondents' educations and doctoral institutions, including graduate tuition remission, educationallyrelated financial support in school, or earning a degree from an R1 university, all of which have significant effects on the likelihood of academic employment. The odds ratio (e \u03b2 ) of the coefficient for interdisciplinary research in the third, fully saturated model is 1.28, which means that the odds of working in an academic job are 28% higher for interdisciplinary researchers than for noninterdisciplinary researchers. These findings are surprising and unexpected, given prior work which suggests that interdisciplinary researchers are disadvantaged in academia. This notion had caused me to expect that interdisciplinary researchers would be less likely to work in this sector than in other sectors, such as government or private for-profit organizations. Other notable findings from model 2 include the relationship between field of study and obtaining an academic position. Engineering, computer science, and physical science respondents are all significantly less likely than biological science respondents to work in academia. This is not surprising given that many of these fields have large non-academic labor markets, relative to other fields. Being older, female, non-married/partnered, and of non-U.S. citizenship are all associated with a greater likelihood of working in academia, net of other controls. Given the unexpected positive association between interdisciplinary research and academic employment, I explored this relationship further. I conducted a supplemental analysis of respondents' likelihood of obtaining a position in academia as opposed only to private for-profit organizations, the next most common employer of the sampled individuals (results not shown). This model excludes those working in government and non-profits, each of which consists of a smaller proportion of all respondents. This analysis confirms that interdisciplinary researchers are even more likely to obtain academic positions when the only other alternative considered in private for-profit organizations. Interdisciplinary researchers have 45% greater odds of working in academia (as opposed to private, forprofit organizations) than non-interdisciplinary researchers. The unexpected positive relationship between interdisciplinary research and academic employment makes my next research question especially important. These findings suggest that it is important to examine what types of jobs interdisciplinary researchers obtain within academia. Type of job within Academia: Table 3.3 contains the results of three multinomial logistic regression models of the effect of interdisciplinary doctoral research (along with control variables) on the likelihood of having a non-tenure track position or a postdoctoral position within academia (as opposed to holding a tenure track position). Each of these models show that, among those employed in academia, there is no statistically significant effect of interdisciplinary doctoral research on the likelihood of working in a non-tenure track position, as opposed to holding a tenure track position. Thus, interdisciplinary respondents are no more or no less likely than others to be non-tenure track. However, these models reveal that, net of other factors, interdisciplinary doctoral graduates are significantly more likely than non-interdisciplinary respondents to be in a postdoctoral position, as opposed to a tenure track position. After accounting for all relevant controls, those who conducted interdisciplinary doctoral research have 52% greater odds than those who did not conduct interdisciplinary research of being in a postdoc academic position as opposed to a tenure track academic position. An additional model (not shown) which changed the reference category for the multinomial model indicates there is no statistically significant relationship between interdisciplinary research and the odds of employment in a non-tenure track position as opposed to a postdoctoral position. Other notable results from these models include a strong relationship between field of study and the odds of obtaining different types of academic jobs, net of other factors. Engineering, computer science, math, and social science graduates are all significantly less likely than biological science graduates to hold both non-tenure track and postdoctoral positions, as opposed to tenure track positions. This is likely the result of the fact that many of the biological sciences now seem to require further training post-doctorate before moving onto permanent employment. It is important to note that the strong effect of field of study on the likelihood of postdoctoral employment does not diminish the effects of interdisciplinary research on postdoctoral employment. Thus, interdisciplinary respondents are not pursuing postdoctoral employment simply as a result of being in fields that are more likely to require postdocs. Models 2 and 3 also show that there is a statistically significant, positive relationship between the number of years spent in graduate school and the likelihood of being in a non-tenure track or postdoctoral position rather than a tenure track position. Also, net of other factors, respondents who earned their doctoral degrees at more highly selective schools also have an increased likelihood of being in a postdoctoral position as opposed to a tenure track position. 23 Non-U.S. citizens are more likely, net of other variables, to be employed in either postdoc or non-tenure track positions than tenure track positions, while married/partnered and older respondents are less likely to be employed in either of these types of employment, compared to tenure track positions. Figure 3.1 displays predicted probabilities for each of the academic job types, based on whether respondents reported interdisciplinary dissertation research or not. These probabilities are based off of the results of model 3, and thus account for all relevant control variables. The predicted probability for having a tenure track position is 0.36 for those who conducted non-interdisciplinary research for their dissertation, but is only 0.29 for those whose research was interdisciplinary. Conversely, the predicted probability for employment in a postdoc position is 0.40 for non-interdisciplinary respondents but is 0.46 for interdisciplinary respondents. The predicted probability of employment in a non-tenure track position is 0.25 for interdisciplinary respondents and 0.24 for non-interdisciplinary respondents (this difference is not statistically significant). These results help explain the unexpected finding that those who conducted interdisciplinary doctoral research are more likely to be employed within academia. Although interdisciplinary research is associated with academic employment, these individuals are more likely to be in temporary postdoctoral positions than in permanent tenure track positions. It is not immediately apparent why interdisciplinary researchers are more likely to go into postdoctoral positions, and whether this is a signal that they are disadvantaged. I explored another available measure from the SDR (analyses not shown), which asks respondents to indicate the primary reason they took their postdoctoral position. Slightly more interdisciplinary respondents than noninterdisciplinary respondents indicated they took a postdoc position because no other work was available, which would suggest that they had more difficulty finding a permanent position. However, this difference was not statistically significant, and overall, few respondents indicated that this was the primary reason for pursuing postdoctoral training. Interdisciplinary respondents were also slightly more likely to report completing a postdoc in order to gain additional training in a field different from that in which they earned their doctoral degree, but again, this difference was not statistically significant. However, I did find that interdisciplinary researchers were significantly more likely to have completed more than one postdoctoral position. Although firm conclusions about what exactly drives interdisciplinary researchers into postdoctoral positions at a higher rate than non-interdisciplinary researchers are not possible at this time, the fact that they are more likely to complete more than one postdoc could be evidence that they are in the process of becoming \"stuck\" in postdoctoral appointments. This could be because they cannot find other work, or that they feel they need more training than others do to make themselves marketable. It is also possible that interdisciplinary research may take more time, especially if these individuals are collaborating with others from various backgrounds, which could prolong the postdoctoral training process. Job not related to degree:  Income: Next I examined whether conducting interdisciplinary dissertation research affects respondents' weekly income from their primary job. Table 3.4 contains the results of three models predicting logged weekly income. The first of these models regresses income on interdisciplinary research as well as demographic controls. Model 2 includes additional measures of educational finances and years in graduate school, as well as the field of study indicators. Model 3 adds in institutional controls as well job-related controls. These models show that there is no significant association between interdisciplinary research and one's weekly income, net of all of these other factors. Thus, although many argue that interdisciplinary researchers face many obstacles, there is no evidence that this argument is relevant to earnings, at least at this stage in the career. Model 3 also indicates that engineering and computer science graduates have significantly higher incomes than biological science respondents, net of other factors. Being a non-U.S. citizen is associated with lower income, while hours worked per week has a positive effect on weekly earnings. Model 3 does show that being employed as a postdoctoral researcher has a significant, negative effect on income, all other factors considered. Since interdisciplinary researchers are more likely than others to be employed as postdocs, I examined whether the negative effect of postdoctoral positions on income was different for interdisciplinary and non-interdisciplinary researchers (models not shown). These analyses show that the negative effect of postdoctoral employment on income is the same for both interdisciplinary and non-interdisciplinary respondents. 24 24 I conducted separate models for interdisciplinary and non-interdisciplinary respondents. I used a z test to compare the coefficients for postdoc job across models. This test indicated there was no significant difference in the effect of postdoctoral jobs between those who conducted interdisciplinary dissertation research and those who did not. Federal research grants: The last outcome I examine is having federally-funded grant support for one's work after doctoral receipt. The results of these models are found in Table 3.5. Just as with income, each of these models show that there is no significant association between conducting interdisciplinary dissertation research and having federal grant support after graduation, net of controls. Thus, although interdisciplinary researchers may be less likely to obtain certain types of positions, as the earlier analyses illustrated, they are not disadvantaged in terms of obtaining grants during their early careers. It is also notable that they are not more likely than non-interdisciplinary respondents to be supported by federal grants. Federal agencies providing grants have made concerted efforts to encourage interdisciplinary grant proposals, which may be shaping interdisciplinary researchers' perceptions of their chances for obtaining funding. In the interviews conducted for Chapter 2, some interdisciplinary researchers were aware of these agencies' efforts to encourage interdisciplinary proposals, and they believed this meant they have an increased likelihood of obtaining funding (Millar unpublished data), although available information suggests this is probably not the case (NSF 2008). The third grant shows that respondents employed in academia are significantly more likely to have grant support. Females, older respondents, and black respondents are all less likely to obtain federal grants (compared to males, younger respondents, and white respondents, respectively). Several fields of doctoral study (mathematics, psychology, and social sciences) all have a significantly lower likelihood of obtaining federal grants than do doctoral graduates in the biological sciences.\nEmployment in academia: The first outcome I examined is employment in academia. Table 4.8 displays the results of models regressing academic employment on the different combinations of sex and interdisciplinary research status, with female non-interdisciplinary respondents as the omitted category. The first model includes controls for individual demographics. This model indicates that interdisciplinary research has no significant effect on women's likelihood of getting an academic job. That is, there is no significant difference between interdisciplinary women and non-interdisciplinary women in the likelihood of working within academia. These findings hold in model 2, which adds in the education-related measures, as well as in model 3 which includes controls for educational institution characteristics. These models do indicate, however, that non-interdisciplinary men are significantly less likely than non-interdisciplinary women to be employed in academia, net of all controls. Using the \"test\" command in STATA, I compared each pair of sex-interdisciplinary research status coefficients in model 3. These comparisons indicate that there is no significant difference between the coefficients for interdisciplinary men and interdisciplinary women (\u03a7 2 = 0.00, p = 0.996). This means that there is no meaningful difference in the likelihood of academic employment for these two groups, net of controls. Furthermore, these test results indicate that interdisciplinary men have significantly greater odds than non-interdisciplinary men of working in academia, net of control variables (\u03a7 2 = 8.53, p = 0.004). Thus, conducting interdisciplinary dissertation research increases men's likelihood of holding an academic job, but does not affect women's likelihood of holding an academic job. In terms of this outcome, interdisciplinary research affects men in such a way that their likelihood of academic employment becomes more similar to that of women, as opposed to more similar to non-interdisciplinary men. Figure 4.1 charts the predicted probabilities of holding an academic job for each sex/interdisciplinary research status combination, accounting for all measures contained in model 3. This figure illustrates how women's likelihood of academic employment is typically higher than that of men's, but that men who conduct interdisciplinary research are just as likely as women to work in academic positions, net of controls. Type of academic employment: Next I examine whether interdisciplinary dissertation research has any effects on the types of positions men and women hold within academia. Table 4.9 shows the results of models predicting type of job among STEM graduates who work in academia. All three models, along with additional tests to compare each pair of sex-interdisciplinary research status coefficients, show that interdisciplinary research has no effect on the likelihood of non-tenure track employment for either men or women. However, it does have a significant, positive effect on the likelihood of postdoctoral employment (as opposed to tenure track employment) among women with STEM degrees, net of all controls. That is, women who conduct interdisciplinary dissertation research are significantly more likely than other women to be employed in a postdoctoral position. Conversely, there is no significant difference between the coefficients for interdisciplinary and non-interdisciplinary men (\u03a7 2 = 0.35, p = 0.556). Thus, interdisciplinary men and non-interdisciplinary men are equally likely to be employed in postdoctoral positions as opposed to tenure track positions, net of controls. This suggests that the earlier results showing interdisciplinary men are more likely than non-interdisciplinary men to be employed in academia is not a result of men being driven into postdoctoral positions. Also, although all men are more likely than non-interdisciplinary women to be employed in postdoctoral positions (as shown in Table 4.9), there is no significant difference between interdisciplinary women and either interdisciplinary men (\u03a7 2 = 0.28, p = 0.597) or non-interdisciplinary men (\u03a7 2 = 0.01, p = 0.919) in the likelihood of postdoctoral employment. 36 Within this sample of STEM doctorate recipients, the positive effect of interdisciplinary research on the likelihood of working as a postdoc is limited only to women, and operates in a way that makes interdisciplinary women just as likely as any men to be in postdoc positions. Figure 4.2 illustrates these findings, net of control variables found in model 3. It shows that non-interdisciplinary women's predicted probability of employment in a postdoc is significantly lower than each of the other groups', but that interdisciplinary women's predicted probability is not meaningfully different from the probability of postdoc employment for either group of men. The results of these first two analyses suggest that interdisciplinary research's effects on doctoral graduates' early careers are complex. Interdisciplinary dissertation research does not simply affect either men or women, or necessarily have the same type of effect for different outcomes. In these first two analyses, interdisciplinary research increases only men's likelihood of being employed in academia, but only increases women's likelihood of employment in postdocs within academia. "}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusions", "text": "This chapter provides several important insights into the early career patterns of interdisciplinary doctoral graduates in the sciences (including the life sciences, physical sciences, social sciences, mathematics, computer and information sciences, and engineering). Some of these analyses suggest that doctoral graduates who conducted interdisciplinary research for their dissertation are not necessarily disadvantaged compared to their non-interdisciplinary counterparts, which is contrary to popular perceptions. Specifically, I find that there is no statistically significant differences in the likelihoods of being employed, having a job that is not related to one's degree, obtaining federallyfunded grants, and the amount of weekly income between these two groups of doctorate holders. Thus, in the case of these types of job placements and occupational rewards, there does not appear to be any disadvantages for interdisciplinary researchers, at least not in this point of the career. However, there are many other ways in which it is plausible that interdisciplinary research could negatively affect individual career outcomes. A good deal of the concern about interdisciplinary researchers' career impediments focuses on troubles in the processes of hiring, promotion, and receiving tenure within academia. I examined several outcomes related to these processes at early points in the scientific career. This chapter shows doctoral graduates who conduct interdisciplinary research do have somewhat different career placement patterns than non-interdisciplinary graduates, which could have implications for later inequalities. Although much of the past research has focused solely on employment patterns within academia, this research is the first to assess the likelihood of employment in academia in relation to other employment sectors. These results show that interdisciplinary researchers are actually more likely than non-interdisciplinary researchers to be employed in academia, which is contrary to the literature. However, I also find that among those employed in academia, interdisciplinary doctoral graduates are significantly more likely to be in postdoctoral research positions, as opposed to tenure track positions. Thus, these results indicate that interdisciplinary researchers do not face a decreased likelihood (compared to other researchers) of being able to obtain a position within academia, but the most common positions they acquire early in the career are temporary postdoctoral appointments. Although a firm conclusion cannot be reached with these data at this time, these trends suggest a possibility that interdisciplinary doctoral graduates may have more obstacles than non-interdisciplinary researchers. Indeed, additional analyses confirm that interdisciplinary researchers are more likely than noninterdisciplinary researchers to have held multiple postdoctoral appointments, suggesting that they may have trouble finding permanent employment even after completing one postdoctoral appointment. It may be that the nature of interdisciplinary research is more complex, and that this necessitates additional training for individuals who pursue it. It is also possible that those who conducted interdisciplinary research pursue multiple postdocs because they sense that their credentials will be less marketable and less well-received compared to more traditional, disciplinary-focused researchers. Additionally, it is plausible that these interdisciplinary graduates could face more long-term disadvantages such as lower income, as illustrated by Zumeta (1985). Future research must follow-up on this cohort of individuals when additional data become available in order to determine whether interdisciplinary doctoral graduates face long-term disadvantages from completing postdocs. Overall, the results of this chapter suggest a mixed picture for the outlook of interdisciplinary researchers, and call into question how these doctoral graduates fare at later points in the career. This research is just the first step in understanding the career patterns of interdisciplinary researchers, and begs for future analyses of later stages in the career. Once more time has passed and future rounds of SDR data follow up on these respondents, I can reassess the career outcomes, including employment sector, tenure status, income, and grant support, to determine what differences may exist between interdisciplinary and non-interdisciplinary scientists after some time has passed. It is important to keep in mind that these analyses do not include graduates from non-scientific fields, including the humanities, education, business, and communication. It is certainly possible that an analysis of individuals from these fields would result in different findings. Therefore, although the data I use speak to the scientific community as a whole (in the United States), I cannot extend these results to other doctoral graduates. Future research must find other ways to examine interdisciplinary researchers within these other types of fields. I expect that interdisciplinary research is perceived differently in the humanities than in the sciences, which suggests different implications for this unexamined group. In fact, Brint (2005) showed how interdisciplinary movements within the humanities stem from different motives than interdisciplinary movements within the sciences. Interdisciplinary advancements in the sciences stem from desires for technological innovation and economic competition with other nations. On the other hand, in the arts and humanities, the new emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches is a result of demographic changes in the student body of universities. As a result of this, universities encouraged interdisciplinary efforts to democratize the higher education experience and as a way of recognizing new forms of expression and cultural/social analysis that were not addressed before the diversification of student bodies. Given these differences, I would expect there to be a greater potential for disadvantage for interdisciplinary researchers in the humanities, where interdisciplinarity is not connected to government-sponsorship, prosperous private industries, and support from those eager to influence powerful sectors of the economy. Nevertheless, this chapter is important in that it is the first attempt at a rigorous quantitative analysis of career outcomes of interdisciplinary doctoral graduates. It contributes to the literature by using a nationally-representative sample of doctoral graduates in the sciences, and by comparing interdisciplinary respondents to their non-interdisciplinary counterparts. It is only through analyses such as these that we can begin to truly understand the facts about interdisciplinary researchers' career outcomes on a large scale and in relation to the outcomes of doctoral graduates as a whole.\nThis analysis provides numerous insights into the ways in which sex and interdisciplinary research are related, and how this relationship affects certain aspects of doctorate earners' early careers. Using nearly complete data on all doctorate earners in the U.S. from 2004-2008, the first study 39 Neither of these variables alone brings out the effect, but rather the combination of the two of them together does. To verify that this new finding was not the product of the reduction in sample size that occurs when I add in the two additional control variables, I re-ran models 2 and 3 on the same sample that is used in model 4 (n=1176). These models (not shown) have the same substantive findings as the versions of models 2 and 3 shown in Table   4.15. This confirms that the significant difference between interdisciplinary and non-interdisciplinary women that appears in model 3 is not the result of the reduction in sample size that occurs with this model. confirms that women are slightly more likely to report conducting interdisciplinary dissertation research than men. Additionally, this relationship is slightly stronger among STEM doctoral graduates. However, in contrast to some speculations that women may be much more inclined to this type of science research (i.e. , the sex difference in the reporting of interdisciplinary doctoral research is not large enough to lead us to expect that interdisciplinary research will play a critical role in changing the sex composition of fields of doctoral study. Indeed, among women doctorate earners, I found only a weak relationship between conducting interdisciplinary research and earning a degree in a STEM field. Furthermore, because the indicator of interdisciplinary research used in these analyses does not temporally precede the decision to enroll in STEM doctoral programs, and because there are no data on individuals who drop out of these programs, I cannot determine whether conducting interdisciplinary research causes women to earn Ph.D.s in STEM fields. The evidence I do have casts doubt on the likelihood that interdisciplinary research can serve an important role in leading women in large numbers into STEM fields. However, more research is needed to determine if interdisciplinary research affects women's decisions to begin and stay in doctoral programs in the STEM fields. In the second study of this chapter, I examined how interdisciplinary doctoral research may affect differences in early career outcomes among men and women who earn Ph.D.s in STEM fields. The first of these analyses provide greater insight into the results in the previous chapter, which examined the effects of interdisciplinary dissertation research on early careers of graduates in the sciences and social sciences. This study of STEM graduates specifically finds that interdisciplinary research significantly increases men's likelihood of employment in academia, but has no significant effect among women. These analyses indicate that women, as a whole, are more likely than men to be employed in academia, but men who conduct interdisciplinary dissertation research are just as likely as women to have academic jobs 1-2 years after degree completion. The positive effect that interdisciplinary research has on men's odds of academic employment can be interpreted as either an advantage or a disadvantage compared to other men. If one assumes that academic employment is more prestigious than non-academic employment, then these men are benefiting from interdisciplinary research, while women are already advantaged compared to men and receive no additional benefit from conducting interdisciplinary doctoral research. However, if one uses income as a gauge for determining advantage/disadvantage, then the interpretation of these findings may be different. Academic jobs often pay less than private sector jobs (especially in the STEM fields, which I examine), and prior research suggests that this may be why I find that women are more highly concentrated in these lower-paying academic jobs (Aanerud et al. 2007). From this perspective, then, the positive effect interdisciplinary research has on men's likelihood of academic employment may be interpreted as a disadvantage. Either way, in this instance, interdisciplinary research operates in a way that makes men's outcomes more similar to those of women. The finding that women are more likely to hold academic positions than men (regardless of interdisciplinary status) is somewhat surprising given the results of some prior studies, which I reviewed earlier, that indicate women are less likely to be employed in academia (Hornig 2003;Long 2003). However, there are a number of reasons why this inconsistency may exist. Prior studies used older data, and thus women's odds of obtaining academic positions may have increased since the early nineties. Efforts to increase women's presence in academic STEM positions, such as the NSF ADVANCE program, may have had an impact over the last decade. Furthermore, prior studies focus on academic employment at all stages of the career, while this study is limited to just recent graduates. We would expect lower levels of sex inequality early in the career, and greater sex differences in later stages of the academic career as women face more obstacles in promotion. Also, Aanerud et al.'s (2007) findings that women have some advantages in fields with strong non-academic labor markets suggests that women's advantage in academic employment may be a result of men seeking more lucrative positions in the non-academic sector. This would imply that academic employment is actually a disadvantage in certain fields, and thus interdisciplinary research's positive effect on men's likelihood of academic employment is a detriment to their career opportunities. I also find that conducting interdisciplinary dissertation research increases women's likelihood of being employed as a postdoctoral researcher, as opposed to holding a tenure track position within academia. The data suggest that both interdisciplinary and non-interdisciplinary men are more likely than non-interdisciplinary women to be employed as postdocs 1-2 years after doctoral receipt. However, women who conduct interdisciplinary research are just as likely as men to be employed in these positions. In contrast to the findings regarding employment in academia, in this instance interdisciplinary research affects women rather than men. However, in both cases the results indicate that interdisciplinary research serves to decrease differences between the sexes. The previous chapter cited evidence which suggests that postdoctoral positions may not necessarily be advantageous for long-term career outcomes. Given this, it is surprising that men would be more likely to hold these positions, and it is difficult to determine whether the positive effect interdisciplinary research has on women's postdoctoral employment probability should be seen as advantageous or not. However, Reskin (1976) found that the types of postdocs women obtain are different than those held by men. Her study showed that men are awarded prestigious postdoctoral appointments based on achievement, and these positions are associated with later advantages. On the other hand, she discovered that women received lower status appointments, likely because of discrimination, and that these did not provide the same advantages as the positions given to men. This difference may explain the current findings. That is, it is possible that the postdoctoral positions women are receiving as a result of interdisciplinary research are not as advantageous as those awarded to most males. However, it is too early to use the SDR data to determine what implications postdoctoral appointments hold for men's and women's later career success. This chapter also explored whether interdisciplinary dissertation research affects any existing sex inequalities among STEM doctorate earners. I find that interdisciplinary research does not play any role in either alleviating or worsening sex differences in employment, generally speaking. However, women who conduct interdisciplinary research are slightly more likely than other men and women to be employed part-time, which can have negative consequences for income, benefits, prestige, and other outcomes. Thus, in this instance interdisciplinary research serves to harm women but has no effect on men. I also find that interdisciplinary research has no effect on either men's or women's likelihood of having federal grant funding for their work. However, interdisciplinary research does play an indirect role in alleviating the gap between men and women in the likelihood of spending a majority of one's work time on research as opposed to teaching within academia. Interdisciplinary research is associated with a greater likelihood that women spend more time on research. However, this effect is a product of the fact that interdisciplinary research increases women's likelihood of postdoctoral employment, which may not turn out to be an advantage. It is unclear whether interdisciplinary research has any effect on the sex differences in work activities after the postdoc stage of the career. Overall, then, I find no compelling evidence that interdisciplinary research plays a role in alleviating sex inequalities among STEM doctoral graduates, and in some instances it seems it may be harmful for women's prospects. This chapter also illustrates that interdisciplinary research has no effect on either men's or women's likelihood of being employed as a STEM-based scientist. Furthermore, there is actually no difference between men and women in the likelihood of having STEM-related jobs, net of all controls. This seems to contradict popular notions suggesting women are underrepresented in these fields. While it is clear from these analyses that women are less likely to earn doctoral degrees in these fields, once women have earned STEM Ph.D.s, they are not any less likely than men to obtain employment in a related field, at least at this early stage in the career. This may signal that women have made some advances in recent years, possibly as a result of efforts, such as the ADVANCE program, to increase their presence in these positions. Also, it is reasonable to assume that the sex gap in the likelihood of employment in STEM science work would be lower among those who earn doctorates in these fields, as compared to men and women who only earn bachelor's degrees in the sciences. Finally, this study shows that for both men and women, conducting interdisciplinary dissertation research is negatively associated with the proportion of males within one's job category. That is, those who do interdisciplinary dissertation research are less likely than those who do not to be employed in male-dominated job categories. This provides further evidence that encouraging interdisciplinary research is not an effective strategy for improving women's representation male-dominated spheres. In fact, it actually has the opposite effect, despite the hopes of some scholars of interdisciplinarity . This research provides an important examination into the ways interdisciplinary doctoral research interacts with established sex differences within the STEM fields. This chapter is only the beginning of many analyses that should follow when future data are available. Because these data are limited to recent doctoral graduates, I am only able to examine differences in men's and women's early careers. When these individuals are surveyed at later points in the career, it will be possible to determine whether interdisciplinary dissertation research has any long-term effects on sex inequalities among STEM doctoral graduates. However, for future analyses to be most useful, it is also important that more data be collected on individuals' involvement in interdisciplinary research throughout the career, not just whether they conducted interdisciplinary research for their dissertations. Nevertheless, the analyses presented here offer some indication that interdisciplinary research is not inconsequential for women's labor market outcomes. However, it also does not appear to play any dramatic role in reducing sex inequalities in the STEM labor market for doctorate holders. Most notably, it actually reduces women's likelihood of employment in male-dominated job categories, which stands in direct contrast to the hopes interdisciplinary advocates express. Future research should explore what explains this relationship so that we may be better able to understand if and how interdisciplinary research could possibly play a role in alleviating sex inequalities among doctoral STEM graduates. If the idea that interdisciplinary research is more attractive to women continues to gain popularity, organizations will undoubtedly place more emphasis on trying to use interdisciplinary approaches to increase women's involvement in STEM fields. But it is important to recognize that interdisciplinary research's ability to assist women's movement into STEM fields will only be successful if interdisciplinary problem-solving techniques are considered valid, gender-neutral approaches to science. Proponents must be careful of typecasting interdisciplinary approaches as \"feminine,\" which prior research indicates would only serve to decrease their legitimacy, as well as the legitimacy of interdisciplinary practitioners, within the larger scientific community."}, {"section_title": "Sex Segregation in Higher Education", "text": "Despite the fact that women have surpassed men in college attendance rates and receipt of degrees at every level of higher education (Buchmann, DiPrete, and McDaniel 2008;NCES 2009), the rate at which women are integrating into traditionally male-dominated fields has slowed (England and Li 2006;Jacobs 1995). Women are still outnumbered in fields such as the physical sciences, math, engineering, and computer science, and are more likely to be in traditionally female-typed fields such as education (NCES 2009;Charles and Bradley 2002;Bradley 2000). Sex segregation at the bachelor's level leads to sex segregation in the labor market and in graduate education. Although the proportion of doctorates awarded to women has greatly increased over the last several decades, the fields which men and women pursue have not changed dramatically. The disciplines with the highest proportions of female doctorate earners are the same today as they were in the early seventies (England et al. 2007). Thus, women are underrepresented in the STEM fields in the labor market for doctorate earners. Most of the literature that focuses on women's underrepresentation in the STEM fields stresses this as problematic because positions in these fields tend to be higher paying than those in traditionally female-dominated fields. This body of literature highlights how field of study affects the sex gap in pay. For example, college major at the bachelor's degree level has been shown to be a significant determinant of the differences in starting salaries between men and women (Bobbitt-Zeher 2007;Gerhart 1990;Marini and Fan 1997;Brown and Corcoran 1997;Shauman 2006), and research consistently concludes that the concentration of men and women into different fields of study, and thus occupations, contributes to the sex gap in pay (Bayard et al. 2003;Petersen and Morgan 1995;Cotter et al. 1997). Additionally, sex segregation in undergraduate majors leads to similar patterns of segregation in the earning of advanced degrees, and within the academic labor market. The presence of female faculty in the STEM fields can affect whether female students pursue undergraduate majors in these fields. Research shows that the percentage of women who pursue undergraduate degrees in the STEM fields is affected by the percentage of women within the faculty in these fields (Sonnert, Fox, and Adkins 2007). Thus, in this way, major segregation is self-perpetuating."}, {"section_title": "Inequality in the Doctoral and STEM Labor Markets", "text": "Among doctorate earners, field of study is also associated with the sex gap in pay (Bellas 1997;Astin and Cress 2003). Academics who are in fields with higher proportions of women earn less than those in fields with higher proportions of men (Bellas 1997). However, even after accounting for field of study, researchers still observe a salary gap between male and female doctorate earners in the sciences (Ginther 2001;Astin and Cress 2003). Salary is not the only way in which female doctorate earners are thought to be disadvantaged compared to males. Most research on sex differences among Ph.D. earners focuses solely on individuals who pursue positions within academia. This research shows that women are less likely than men to obtain positions within academia (Hornig 2003), although it does not address whether women are less likely to seek positions within academia. Women are also underrepresented in the upper academic ranks (Hornig 2003) and less likely to be promoted and receive tenure than men (Long, Allison, and McGinnis 1993). However, tenure status may be somewhat dependent upon field; Aanerud et al. (2007) found that women with Ph.D.s in fields with strong non-academic labor markets, such as electrical engineering and computer science, have chances of getting tenure that are equal or greater than men's. Women are also less likely than men to obtain positions within research universities (Astin and Cress 2003), which are generally considered to be more prestigious positions. Among doctoral-level scientists and engineers specifically, women are less likely than men to be fully employed in academia (Long 2003) and are less likely to obtain tenure track positions (Long 2003;Kuh 2003). Female scientists and engineers are also underrepresented at research universities, compared to their representation in the pool of Ph.D. graduates who are available for these positions (Kuh 2003). Furthermore, women who are employed in research universities are less likely to have tenure track positions than those in non-research universities (Kuh 2003). They also spend more time than their male counterparts teaching (Astin and Cress 2003), which can have negative consequences for research productivity. These women also report experiencing more stress associated with their jobs (Astin and Cress 2003). This evidence suggests that some sex-based inequalities among academics can be attributed to sex segregation based on field of study. However, other research shows that inequalities exist even among men and women within the sciences. Thus, simply urging women to pursue STEM fields will not eradicate all labor market inequalities, because other factors also contribute to sex gaps in earnings and other outcomes. However, the fact that women are underrepresented in these positions is a trend that is of great concern to universities, federal agencies, and a variety of organizations seeking to alleviate obstacles to women's success in these fields. The most notable effort to combat women's underrepresentation in STEM fields is the National Science Foundation's (NSF) program, ADVANCE: Increasing the Participation and Advancement of Women in Academic Science and Engineering Careers. Since 2001 ADVANCE has invested more than $135,000,000 to increase women's participation in STEM fields by addressing aspects of institutional structure and academic culture that differentially affect women (NSF 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Women and Interdisciplinary STEM Research", "text": "There is some evidence that women may be more likely than men to pursue interdisciplinary science research.  preliminary analyses found that female scientists are more likely than male scientists to engage in four practices which are related to interdisciplinarity: crossfertilization (adopting tools, concepts, etc. from other disciplines), team collaboration (working in teams to share or create tools, concepts, etc. across disciplines), field creation (engaging in research in domains that intersect multiple fields), and problem orientation (engaging in topics that draw on multiple fields or serve multiple stakeholders or interests outside academia.  noted that there is a common assumption that women are more attracted to interdisciplinary science than men, and that women may be more interested in interdisciplinary science than they are in traditional scientific pursuits. Other research suggests that increasing the interdisciplinary nature of engineering or computer science education may attract students who otherwise would not choose these majors, which could have implications for increasing the presence of women in these fields (Wachter 2005;Beck, Buckner, and Nikolova 2007;Beraud 2003). This assumption that interdisciplinarity is more inviting for women, particularly in the sciences, could have important implications for women's movement into STEM fields. Research suggests that cultural beliefs about gender affect men's and women's self assessments of their competence and abilities in gender-typed tasks (Correll 2004). This results in women underestimating their abilities when it comes to male-typed tasks (for example, math and science), which in turn affects young women's aspirations for related careers. These types of cultural beliefs about gendered abilities are also operating to shape societal perceptions of gender appropriate careers in general. Indeed, other research examining the factors that explain why students leave the sciences suggests that these fields are often inhospitable to women. Seymour and Hewitt (1997) found that male peers create an unwelcoming and sometimes hostile atmosphere for women in the sciences, suggesting that they view women's presence in these fields as inappropriate. Seymour and Hewitt also outlined the various ways in which STEM fields foster a competitive, \"weeding out\" culture during undergraduate education. The female students they interviewed resisted this competitive pedagogy. The authors noted that while this approach to education is disadvantageous to both men and women's retention in these fields, is particularly harmful for women because they are less accustomed to this stereotypically \"male\" approach to learning. Other research suggests that this \"chilly climate\" that is subtlety hostile or exclusionary toward women persists in graduate school and in the labor market (Ferreira 2003;Nerad and Miller 1996;Bystydziendski and Bird 2006). Efforts to counteract these elements that may deter women often include fostering more collaborative environments. This approach is similar to techniques promoted by interdisciplinary research. Indeed,  discussed how current efforts to attract women into STEM fields rely on techniques that are also promoted in interdisciplinary research, such as providing cooperative learning and working environments, framing science in its social context, focusing on the practical applications of science, and approaching problems holistically. These authors discuss prior literature to explain why women might be more likely to engage in the various forms of interdisciplinary research they studied. They suggested that sex differences in learning styles, preferences for interaction styles, and preferences for certain types of work activities might explain why women are more likely to pursue interdisciplinary activities. They concluded that interdisciplinary science has great potential for engaging individuals who are not interested in (or perhaps feel unwelcome in) traditional disciplinary science. Based on this assumption, they argued that interdisciplinary science could serve as a strong entry point into scientific studies for women, but they did not explicitly examine whether interdisciplinary research is an effective way of increasing women's participation in these fields. However, there is a general consensus among academics and researchers studying the interdisciplinary research movement that those who conduct interdisciplinary research face obstacles to success in traditional academic careers (Lattuca 2001;Pfirman et al. no date;National Academies 2004). Thus, if those who conduct interdisciplinary research do not have the same opportunities for success as non-interdisciplinary researchers, using interdisciplinary research as a tool to encourage women to pursue and excel in the male-dominated sciences may not be able to truly help women enter into and succeed in the fields in which they are underrepresented. It is important to understand the consequences of using interdisciplinarity as a means of encouraging women to pursue science careers. If interdisciplinary research results in more negative career outcomes than traditional science, then female scientists are being pushed into a less prestigious niche. This tendency is supported by prior literature, which suggests that when women begin moving into traditionally male-dominated occupations, men stay in the best jobs while women are \"ghettoized\" into the lower status positions within the occupation (Reskin and Roos 1990). That way, the occupation as a whole does not truly integrate, and women's ability to benefit from the rewards of the occupation are limited. For example, Cohen and Huffman's (2007) examination of female managers found evidence consistent with this ghettoization process: in some cases the increased presence of women in managerial positions was a result of \"title inflation,\" in that positions were reclassified as managerial without the increase in authority and wages typically characteristic of managerial positions. Cohen and Huffman's results showed that in these instances where women worked in managerial positions that lacked the authority and high status of traditional managerial positions, their ability to accrue advantages for their female employees was limited. In contrast, women in management positions with legitimate authority and status were able to have a positive effect on the wages of the women working for them. However, if interdisciplinary researchers' outcomes are similar to traditional disciplinary scientists, then encouraging women to pursue interdisciplinary science could be a useful way to promote integration. Although Reskin and Roos (1990) claimed that true integration is rare, there are some instances in which research documents women moving into male-dominated occupations without being \"ghettoized\" into lower-status jobs. For example, Wright and Jacobs (1994) found that as more women entered into computer work occupations, a male-dominated field, they became more dispersed across different types of jobs within this occupation and the sex gap in pay declined. Jacobs (1992) determined that women entering into management positions similarly reduced the sex gap in pay among managers. These studies suggest that in some cases it is possible for women to integrate into male-dominated positions without being relegated to lower-status, lower-paying jobs. If interdisciplinary research is beneficial, or not harmful, for shaping career outcomes, it may indeed be an example of a way for women to integrate into doctorate-level science occupations. The results of the previous chapter showed that interdisciplinary research does have an impact on some early career outcomes. Specifically, I found that doctoral graduates in the sciences and social sciences who conduct interdisciplinary dissertation research are more likely than those who conduct single-discipline research to obtain employment in institutions of higher education as opposed to other types of employment, such as positions in private sector for-profit, non-profit, and governmental organizations. Additionally, among those who are employed within academia, interdisciplinary doctoral graduates are more likely than others to hold postdoctoral research positions as opposed to tenure track jobs. Although it is too soon to say with certainty, these early career differences may contribute to later inequalities between interdisciplinary and non-interdisciplinary researchers. This chapter expands on the prior analysis by determining if the effect of interdisciplinary dissertation research on early career placement is different for men and women earning doctorates in the STEM fields. Additionally, I explore whether sex differences in other career outcomes are affected by conducting interdisciplinary doctoral research. I also determine whether conducting interdisciplinary research increases women's likelihood of employment as STEM scientists as well employment in job categories with higher proportions of men. For the sake of simplicity, from this point forward I separate the discussion of the research questions, data, methods, and results into two separate studies. The first study uses the Survey of Earned Doctorates data to answer the questions of whether women are more likely than men to conduct interdisciplinary doctoral research and if there is a relationship between conducting interdisciplinary research and earning doctoral degrees in the STEM fields. The second study uses data from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients in order address whether interdisciplinary dissertation research has different effects on the early career outcomes of men and women in STEM fields."}, {"section_title": "Study 1 Research Questions", "text": "If women are indeed more attracted to interdisciplinary science than to traditional science, this may be a way to encourage women to pursue the sciences Wachter 2005;Beck et al. 2007;Beraud 2003).

Furthermore, they were unable to directly compare rates of interdisciplinary activities of men and women in the same stages of the career. Therefore, the analyses contained herein improve upon this prior study by using a comprehensive, representative source of data on men and women, both interdisciplinary and non-interdisciplinary, all of whom are at the same stage in their careers. These data allow me to better determine whether female doctorate earners are more likely than their male counterparts to conduct interdisciplinary dissertation research (as opposed to research that is limited to one discipline), as   Additionally, I analyze whether conducting interdisciplinary dissertation research is associated with a greater likelihood of women earning doctoral degrees in the traditionally male-dominated science and technology fields. Even if women are more likely than men to report interdisciplinary research, if they are conducting interdisciplinary research in fields that are all highly female-dominated, then this is unlikely to be a mechanism for increasing women's presence in science."}, {"section_title": "Study 1 Data and Methods", "text": "To determine whether women are more likely than men to conduct interdisciplinary research, and whether conducting interdisciplinary research is associated with women's likelihood of earning a doctoral degree in the male-dominated STEM fields, I employ data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates. The Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), a survey sponsored by the NSF, is a census of all individuals receiving research doctoral degrees (in all fields) from accredited U.S. institutions. It is administered annually to assess trends in doctoral education. The SED questionnaire contains items asking about individuals' education, including field(s) of dissertation research, field of degree, institution granting degree, and information about educational finances. It also collects data on post-graduation plans and a variety of demographic indicators. The SED response rate is approximately 92%, and survey administrators attempt to collect limited information for nonrespondents based on information available in public records. The SED's near complete coverage of all doctorate earners in the United States make it unrivaled in its ability to provide a complete picture of the relationship between sex and interdisciplinary dissertation research."}, {"section_title": "132", "text": "The following analyses are based upon data from the 2004 through 2008 waves of the SED. 26 These are all of the available years of data that include the question I use to identify interdisciplinary dissertation research (discussed below). I limit these analyses to just those cases with no missing data on this question as well as the indicators for respondent sex and field of degree, leaving 206,447 respondents. However, the number of cases included in the multivariate models is slightly lower due to restrictions placed on these models and missing data for other included variables."}, {"section_title": "Key Measures", "text": "Interdisciplinary Research: The primary dependent variable of interest is whether individuals conduct interdisciplinary dissertation research. This variable is based upon the SED question which asks respondents to report the field, or fields, of study for their dissertation research. Since 2004, this question has asked respondents to identify the primary field of their research, and then to list a secondary field \"if *their+ dissertation research was interdisciplinary.\" I consider any respondents who listed multiple fields to have conducted interdisciplinary dissertation research. 27 Therefore, this variable has a value of 1 for those who reported multiple fields (interdisciplinary dissertation research) and a value of 0 for those who reported one field (non-interdisciplinary research). STEM degree: The other outcome I examine in this study is earning a degree in a STEM field. In order to distinguish between degrees in the traditionally male-dominated sciences and other fields, I use data from the SED question which asks respondents for the field of their doctoral degree. This variable is derived from a separate indicator than that asking for the field(s) of dissertation research, which is the basis for the indicator of interdisciplinary research discussed above. The question for field of degree only allows respondents to indicate one field, while the question asking for field(s) of dissertation research allows respondents to report multiple fields. A small number of individuals (less than 1%) report fields of dissertation research that are STEM fields but report earning a degree in a non-STEM field. These individuals are not counted as earning a STEM degree. However, it is interesting that women are slightly more likely than men to report STEM research when not earning a STEM degree. This variable has a value of one for respondents who earned degrees in the life sciences, physical/chemical sciences, computer sciences, engineering, and mathematics fields. It equals 0 for other, non-STEM fields (psychology, the social sciences, humanities, education, communication, and business). Respondent sex: This is a dichotomous variable with a value of 1 for females and a value of 0 for males."}, {"section_title": "Study 1 Results", "text": "Descriptive statistics for the SED variables used in this analysis are displayed in Table 4.1. Fortysix percent of doctorate earners through 2004-2008 were women. However, women are less likely than men to earn degrees in STEM fields (42% of women vs. 64% of men), which is consistent with the literature that suggests women are underrepresented in these fields. The variables for each of the field of study categories show that the degree to which women are underrepresented varies quite a bit among the different STEM field categories. Women are less likely than men to earn degrees in all of the STEM field categories, except for in the biological sciences. Twenty-three percent of women earned a degree in a biological/heath field, while only 17% of men did. Conversely, while 23% of men earned engineering doctorates, only 7% of women earned engineering degrees. To assess whether women are more likely than men to report conducting interdisciplinary dissertation research, I compared the rates at which both men and women reported interdisciplinary research. Table 4.2 contains a cross-tabulation of respondent sex and interdisciplinary status using data on doctoral graduates in all fields of study. This table shows that approximately 28% of men report conducting interdisciplinary research, and approximately 29% of women report conducting interdisciplinary research. Although this difference is minimal, it suggests that, in accordance with  expectation, women are slightly more likely than men to conduct interdisciplinary dissertation research. A X 2 test confirms that this relationship is statistically significant, but it is not a substantial difference. 31  Table 4.3 shows the same cross-tabulation, but is limited only to respondents who earned degrees in the STEM fields. This table illustrates that the relationship between sex and interdisciplinary research is somewhat stronger within the STEM fields than it is in all fields combined. Among all fields, the percent of women who conduct interdisciplinary dissertation research is only one percentage point larger than the percent of men who report interdisciplinary research. However, within the STEM fields, there is a difference of 3 percentage points between the proportion of interdisciplinary women and the proportion of interdisciplinary men.  Because the difference between the proportions of men and women who conduct interdisciplinary dissertation research is relatively small, multivariate models are helpful for determining whether respondent sex affects the likelihood of conducting interdisciplinary research while controlling for other variables which may affect individuals' likelihoods of conducting interdisciplinary research. These models are displayed in Table 4.4. Model 1 regresses interdisciplinary research on the variable for respondent sex. Like the X 2 test in Table 4.2, this analysis indicates that women are more likely than men to conduct interdisciplinary dissertation research. This relationship holds in model 2, in which I add in the field of study indicators and other educational controls. Model 3 shows that women are still significantly more likely to report interdisciplinary dissertation research than men, net of field of study, institutional, and educational characteristics. 32 These models suggest that the higher rate of interdisciplinary dissertation research among women is not simply due to the fact that women and men are concentrated in different fields of study. The odds ratio for the variable representing female respondents in model 3 is 1.08, which indicates that women have 8% greater odds of reporting interdisciplinary research than do men. This difference is very slight, but is consistent with  analyses which suggested women are more likely to conduct interdisciplinary research. I next examine whether conducting interdisciplinary research is associated with women's (and men's) likelihood of earning a doctoral degree in a STEM field. Table 4.5 displays two cross-tabulations of interdisciplinary research and earning a STEM degree (separate analyses for women and for men). The first tabulation indicates that while only 41% of women who do single-discipline dissertation research receive degrees in one of the STEM fields, 44% of women who do interdisciplinary research earn doctorates in the STEM fields. This difference is statistically significant, and suggests that among women, there is a modest association between conducting interdisciplinary dissertation research and earning degrees in the traditionally male-dominated sciences. 33 The cross-tabulation for men shows a similar pattern. Sixty-three percent of men who do non-interdisciplinary research earn STEM degrees, but 65% of men who do interdisciplinary research earn STEM degrees. This difference is slightly smaller than that for women (two percentage points as opposed to three percentage points), and the X 2 test value is only 29.49 as opposed to 80.80 for women, suggesting this relationship may be slightly stronger among women than among men. The relationship between interdisciplinary research and earning a STEM degree shown in Table   4.5 may be influenced by the fact that the largest STEM field, biological/health sciences, also has the highest proportion of interdisciplinary dissertations (see Introduction, Chapter 1) and is also the only STEM field with more female than male graduates. Thus, I re-examined this association between interdisciplinary research and STEM degrees while excluding respondents in the biological/heath fields. This analysis is displayed in Table 4.6. Table 4.6 shows that once biology graduates are excluded from the cross-tabulation, the relationship between interdisciplinary dissertation research and getting a degree in a STEM field is weakened among women. This difference is only significant at p < 0.10, which is not very meaningful with such a large number of cases. Among men, when biology graduates are excluded, the direction of the relationship reverses; Table 4.6 shows that without biological fields, fewer interdisciplinary men than non-interdisciplinary men earn STEM degrees. The smaller difference between interdisciplinary and non-interdisciplinary women and the change of the results among men both imply that the special case of biology students, who are more likely than other STEM graduates to conduct interdisciplinary 33 Logistic regression models for this research question show a significant relationship between interdisciplinary research and earning a STEM degree, net of controls. However, because these data are not suited for determining whether interdisciplinary research has a causal effect on earning a STEM degree, I do not report these models. research, influenced the relationship between interdisciplinary dissertation research and STEM degrees that was shown in Table 4.5. Thus, there is no strong, definitive association between conducting interdisciplinary dissertation research an earning a doctoral degree in a STEM field. This casts doubt that encouraging women to pursue interdisciplinary science research would have any substantial effect on increasing the number of women earning doctoral degrees in the male-dominated STEM fields. These results from this first set of analyses suggest minimal sex differences in participation in interdisciplinary research. Women are slightly more likely than men to report interdisciplinary dissertation research, but this difference is not substantial. Also, there does not seem to be any meaningful relationship between conducting interdisciplinary dissertation research and earning a STEM degree among women. Nevertheless, 31% of all women STEM doctorate earners do conduct interdisciplinary research, and therefore I now turn to other analyses to determine how interdisciplinary doctoral research may affect these women's career outcomes, relative to other women as well as to men in the STEM fields."}, {"section_title": "Study 2 Research Questions", "text": "A substantial proportion of recent doctoral graduates, about 29%, report conducting interdisciplinary dissertation research. This segment of the doctoral degree population deserves further examination. In this study I determine whether conducting interdisciplinary research differentially affects the early career outcomes of men and women who earn doctoral degrees in the STEM fields, or if it has any implications for sex-based labor market inequalities among these doctoral graduates. If interdisciplinary research has different effects for women and men, this could have implications for either reducing or exacerbating existing sex inequalities in the scientific fields. Given that prior literature suggests that both women and interdisciplinary researchers face obstacles within academia, we might expect female interdisciplinary graduates to be especially disadvantaged. However, some researchers have suggested it is also possible that interdisciplinary research is an effective method for providing women with a route into male-dominated fields that may allow them to succeed despite numerous obstacles. The previous chapter illustrated that interdisciplinary doctoral graduates in the sciences and social sciences are more likely than others to obtain jobs within academia, and are more likely to be employed as postdoctoral researchers than tenure track faculty within the academic employment sector. I discussed how there is a potential for future disadvantages to result from the fact that interdisciplinary graduates obtain academic positions primarily as a result of their increased likelihood of being postdoctoral researchers. This study determines whether this relationship between interdisciplinary research and type of employment is different for men and women who earn STEM doctoral degrees. The first questions I seek to answer are whether the effects of interdisciplinary research on employment within academia, and type of job held within academia, differ for men and women with STEM degrees. If obtaining a postdoctoral position is a signal of future career obstacles, we might expect that women who conduct interdisciplinary research are especially likely to be of postdoctoral status, as opposed to having tenure track positions. Additionally, prior literature suggests that women in the academic STEM labor market do not fare as well as men in a number of ways. Therefore, in this study I also seek to determine whether interdisciplinary dissertation research plays any role in alleviating or exacerbating existing sex inequalities among STEM graduates. The specific sex inequalities I examine include the likelihood of being employed, having federally-funded research grants, and whether one's primary job activity is research as opposed to teaching. I also determine whether conducting interdisciplinary dissertation research differentially affects men's and women's likelihood of working as a STEM field scientist. Although the SED results in Study 1 suggest there is no strong association between conducting interdisciplinary research and earning a STEM degree, in this analysis I am able to determine if interdisciplinary research has an effect on working in a STEM scientist job after degree receipt. Similarly, the final question I seek to answer is whether interdisciplinary research is associated with the sex composition of respondents' job categories. By addressing these two questions, I am able to assess whether interdisciplinary research shows any promise for helping to reduce sex segregation and increase women's involvement in the STEM fields after earning their doctoral degrees."}, {"section_title": "Study 2 Data and Methods", "text": "In order to analyze whether interdisciplinary research differentially affects men and women in terms of the labor market outcomes described above, I use data from another survey that is a follow-up to the SED, the Survey of Doctorate Recipients. The Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) is a longitudinal sample survey of individuals who have received doctoral degrees in the United States in science, social science, engineering, or health fields. The SDR is administered bi-annually to understand trends in employment opportunities and labor market outcomes for individuals with doctoral degrees in the included fields of study. The SED, which I described above, is the primary sampling frame for the SDR. This allows researchers to match up SED responses (from when individuals completed their doctorate) to respondents' later data in the SDR in order to use initial educational information in combination with later employment data. The SDR with matched SED data provide a unique opportunity to assess how interdisciplinary dissertation research relates to sex differences in early labor market outcomes. No other available source of data can address these issues with a nationally-representative sample. I use the 2006 wave of the SDR, which is the most recent wave that is available for analysis, along with its matched data from the SED. The 2006 SDR sample consisted of 42,955 cases. The sampling design utilized stratification procedures to ensure large enough numbers of respondents representing certain combinations of demographic characteristics and fields of degree were included (NSF no date). The response rate was 78%. These analyses are based on a sample that includes only those 2006 SDR respondents who earned degrees in the STEM fields and completed the SED in 2004 and 2005. This sample excludes SDR respondents who earned degrees in psychology or other social sciences, and it is limited to recent doctoral recipients. I only examine the most recent graduates in the 2006 SDR because these are the only years available for analysis that include the specific indicator on the SED which I use to measure interdisciplinary research (discussed above in Study 1). This means that the results of this analysis are only applicable for the early career, 1-2 years out of graduate school. The sample only includes individuals who were not missing data for this question used to identify interdisciplinary researchers as well those who are not missing data for the variable indicating sex. These restrictions result in a sample which consists of 1,649 cases.

Both groups of women are just as likely to be employed, net of control variables. Similarly, there is no significant difference between the coefficients for the two groups of men (\u03a7 2 = 2.16, p = 0.142), meaning that interdisciplinary research does not have any significant effect on men's likelihood of being employed either. Thus, although men with doctoral degrees in STEM fields are more likely than women with STEM doctoral degrees to be employed, interdisciplinary dissertation research does not play any significant role in either reducing or increasing this sex disparity. I also estimated two additional sets of models, shown in Table 4.11, which examine part-time and full-time employment separately, since women are often more likely than men to be employed part-time, which has implications for numerous other sex disparities. The models predicting full-time employment (as opposed being employed part-time or not employed) indicate that, similar to the models shown in Table 4.10, that both groups of men are significantly more likely than noninterdisciplinary women to be employed full-time, net of controls. Tests for the differences between coefficients in the model show that both groups of men are also more likely than interdisciplinary women to be employed full-time (male non-ID: \u03a7 2 = 12.20, p = 0.001; male ID: \u03a7 2 = 11.51, p = 0.001). However, although there are sex differences between the likelihood of full-time employment, there is no significant difference between interdisciplinary and non-interdisciplinary women in the likelihood of full-time employment, and there is also no significant difference between the coefficients for both groups of men (\u03a7 2 = 0.69, p =0.405). Thus, interdisciplinary research does not significantly increase or decrease either men's or women's odds of full-time employment. The models in Table 4.11 predicting part-time employment tell a slightly different story. In this sample, part-time employment is much less common, overall. These models indicate that there is no significant difference between non-interdisciplinary women and either group of men in the likelihood of part-time employment. However, interdisciplinary women are slightly more likely than noninterdisciplinary women to be employed part-time, net of controls (p < 0.10). Thus, while interdisciplinary research does not increase or decrease women's likelihood of being employed overall, as shown in Table 4.10, it does increase their likelihood of part-time employment to some extent. This suggests that in this case, interdisciplinary research serves to disadvantage women. a Robust standard errors in parentheses. Analyses include normalized sampling weight to account for survey sampling design. b Native American and Pacific Islander respondents were dropped from these models due to the fact that there was no variation in the outcome variables in this small number of respondents. *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05, \u2020 p < 0.10 Tests comparing coefficients in model 3 indicate that interdisciplinary women's likelihood of part-time employment is also significantly higher than that of non-interdisciplinary men (\u03a7 2 = 4.53, p = 0.033), net of controls. However, there is no significant difference between interdisciplinary men and either interdisciplinary women (\u03a7 2 = 1.98, p = 0.159) or non-interdisciplinary men (\u03a7 2 = 0.11, p = 0.741). Thus, interdisciplinary research has no significant effect on men's odds of part-time employment. Figure   4.3 illustrates the predicted probabilities of part-time employment for each group, net of controls in model 3. This figure illustrates how interdisciplinary women's likelihood of part time employment is significantly higher than non-interdisciplinary women. \nMale Noninterdisciplinary * * Interdisciplinary females' likelihood of being employed part-time is significantly higher than that of noninterdisciplinary females and non-interdisciplinary males. Federal grant funding: Table 4.12 displays the results of three models predicting the likelihood of receiving federal grants for one's work after doctoral receipt. These models show that noninterdisciplinary men are significantly more likely than non-interdisciplinary interdisciplinary women to have research grants, net of controls. Also, interdisciplinary women's likelihood of having grant support is not significantly different from that of non-interdisciplinary women. Thus, interdisciplinary research does not affect women's likelihood of having grant money. However, there is no significant difference between non-interdisciplinary men and interdisciplinary women in the likelihood of receiving grants (\u03a7 2 = 0.51, p = 0.474). Also, there is no significant difference between the two groups of men in the likelihood of receiving federal grants (\u03a7 2 = 0.33, p = 0.566). Men are more likely than noninterdisciplinary women to receive grant funding, net of controls. But there is no significant effect of interdisciplinary research on either men's or women's likelihood of receiving federal grant support. These analyses examining grant funding suggest that interdisciplinary research does nothing to either significantly worsen or to alleviate existing sex inequalities among STEM doctorate holders. These results contrast with earlier findings which showed that interdisciplinary research operates to decrease sex gaps in academic employment as well as employment as a postdoctoral researcher within academia, as well as the finding that interdisciplinary research increases women's likelihood of part-time employment. Research-based work: Women in academia are also less likely than men to conduct research as their primary work activity, and more likely to spend most of their time performing teaching duties. Table 4.13 shows a series of models to examine whether interdisciplinary dissertation research plays any role in alleviating or exacerbating this sex difference. The results show that both groups of men are more likely than non-interdisciplinary women to conduct research as their primary job activity, net of all controls. This is consistent with traditional accounts of sex disparities in work activities. However, models 1-3 indicate that women who conduct interdisciplinary research are more likely than non-interdisciplinary women spend most of their work time researching instead of teaching, net of controls. In fact, in these models, women who performed interdisciplinary dissertation research are no different than men in their likelihood of conducting research. Furthermore, there is no significant difference between interdisciplinary and non-interdisciplinary men in the likelihood of spending most of one's work time on research. In the case of this outcome, then, interdisciplinary research has no effect for men, but it does appear to increase women's time working on research to the extent that it eliminates the differences between men and women. However, because I established there is a relationship between interdisciplinary dissertation research, sex, and working in a postdoctoral position, in model 4 I add in a control for working in a postdoc job. Since postdoctoral appointments are typically research-based, it is not surprising that this variable has a strong, positive effect on the likelihood of research being one's primary work activity, net of other factors. Once this model accounts for postdocs, there is no longer any significant difference between interdisciplinary and non-interdisciplinary women in the likelihood of doing research for one's job. Also, both interdisciplinary women and non-interdisciplinary women are less likely than noninterdisciplinary men to research (\u03a7 2 = 4.91, p = 0.027, for the difference between the femaleinterdisciplinary and male-non-interdisciplinary coefficients). This is illustrated in Figure 4.4, which shows that both groups of women have a lower probability of doing research as a primary work activity, and there is no meaningful difference between the probabilities of the two groups of women. The explanatory factor driving the earlier results is that interdisciplinary dissertation research increases women's likelihood of working in a postdoc position. * Female interdisciplinary respondents' probability of conducting research as their primary work activity is significantly lower than that of male non-interdisciplinary respondents. Female noninterdisciplinary respondents' probability of conducting research is significantly lower than the probabilities of both interdisciplinary and non-interdisciplinary males. There is no significant difference between interdisciplinary and non-interdisciplinary women's probabilities of conducting research as a primary work activity. Thus, so far, the only direct effects that interdisciplinary research has had for women's outcomes is increasing their likelihood of postdoctoral employment and their likelihood of part-time employment. The only effect interdisciplinary research has had for men is increasing their likelihood of academic employment. All of the results to this point suggest there are no clear or consistent advantages of interdisciplinary research for either men or women. STEM-scientist job: Next I determine how interdisciplinary research may affect women's and men's likelihood of involvement in traditionally male-typed work. The first study of this chapter examined the relationship between interdisciplinary dissertation research and earning STEM doctoral degrees. Here I focus on whether conducting interdisciplinary research for one's dissertation affects women's and men's likelihood of employment in STEM-based scientist jobs and job categories with higher proportion of males.  Percent male in job category: The results pertaining to the sex composition of respondents' job categories, however, are more complex. In models 1-3 (shown in Table 4.15), there is no significant difference between non-interdisciplinary and interdisciplinary women in the proportion of males in one's job category. However, the model 3 coefficients for the two groups of men are significantly different (\u03a7 2 = 9.19, p = 0.003). This means that for men, there is a negative association between interdisciplinary dissertation research and the proportion male in one's job category, net of controls. That is, men who conduct interdisciplinary dissertation research tend to work in less heavily maledominated job categories. Model 4 adds in controls for conducting research as one's primary work activity and working in a STEM-field job. Once the model accounts for these factors, conducting interdisciplinary dissertation research also has a significant, negative effect on the proportion male in one's job category for women, net of other factors. Furthermore, non-interdisciplinary men work in heavier male-dominated job categories than non-interdisciplinary women, and the coefficients for non-interdisciplinary men and interdisciplinary women are significantly different (\u03a7 2 = 26.70, p = 0.000), suggesting that both groups of women tend to work in job categories that are less male-dominated (net of controls). Additionally, interdisciplinary women have a lower expected proportion of males in their job categories than interdisciplinary men (\u03a7 2 = 6.27, p = 0.012). It is not surprising that all women are less likely than men to be in highly male-dominated job categories. However, these results suggest that conducting interdisciplinary research is associated with working in job categories that are less male-dominated, further disadvantaging women. Contrary to what some literature suggests, then, conducting interdisciplinary research seems to hurt, rather than help, women's chances for moving into maledominated areas, even among this group of doctoral graduates who earned degrees in the STEM fields.    * The estimated proportion of males in female interdisciplinary respondents' job categories is significantly lower than that of all other types of respondents. The estimated proportion male in female non-interdisciplinary respondents' job categories is significantly lower than that of noninterdisciplinary male respondents. The estimated proportion male in male interdisciplinary respondents' job categories is significantly lower than that of male non-interdisciplinary respondents. Furthermore, the effect of interdisciplinary research on the sex composition of respondents' job categories is actually slightly larger for women than it is for men. 38 It is somewhat odd that the negative effect of interdisciplinary research on men's job category sex composition is apparent in the initial models, but that the negative effect for women only appears after controlling for research-based jobs and STEM jobs. 39 This suggests that in the reduced models (models 1-3), the negative effect of interdisciplinary research on the proportion male in women's job categories was not observed because the variable representing female interdisciplinary researchers may have been also representing the effects of these other, related factors as well. Instead of just representing the negative effect of interdisciplinary research for women's job category sex composition, the female-interdisciplinary indicator seemed to be picking up on the effects of conducting research as a primary job activity and working in a STEM-scientist job, both of which have significant positive effects on the percent male in one's job category before accounting for sex and interdisciplinary research (analysis not shown). Thus, when I did not control for these other variables that have positive effects on the likelihood of being in male-dominated job categories, this clouded the negative effect that interdisciplinary research has on the percent of males in women's job categories."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER FIVE CONCLUSION", "text": "The goal of this dissertation was to develop a better understanding of interdisciplinary research, a popular topic that is not well understood. The previous three chapters presented a variety of analyses examining different aspects of interdisciplinarity to better describe it and its consequences for those who pursue it. Although each of these chapters has its own unique focus, together they offer important insights about the nature of interdisciplinary research. This final chapter provides an overview of the main findings. I also address the implications of this dissertation as a whole, which can guide future examinations of interdisciplinary research."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Results", "text": "In Chapter 2, I reported results based on interviews with 30 doctoral candidates who are nearing the completion of their degrees at Washington State University. The purpose of these interviews was to better understand the concepts of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research from the perspective of average doctoral researchers. These respondents included both interdisciplinary as well as noninterdisciplinary researchers from a wide variety of fields of study. Additionally, these interviews served to evaluate indicators of interdisciplinary research that are used on the Survey of Earned Doctorates. These interviews illustrate both the salience and the complexity of the concept of interdisciplinary research. All of the respondents were familiar with the concept of interdisciplinary research and were able to identify examples of it, either from their own work or the work of others they have observed. However, despite this widespread familiarity with the concept, the interviews showed that interdisciplinary research is also a complex process that lacks a precise, commonly-recognized definition. The respondents all provided their own unique definitions of the term, and there was a good deal of variation in the content of these interviews. These findings confirm others' observations that there is no widely-recognized definition of interdisciplinarity (Klein 1990;Jacobs and Frickel 2009). Also, even though most respondents were able to explicate ways in which \"interdisciplinary\" and \"multidisciplinary\" research differ, these distinctions were often inconsistent or contradictory throughout the interview process. This suggests that despite the widespread familiarity with interdisciplinarity in general, the specifics of what it entails and how it may or may not differ from multidisciplinarity are not commonly understood. This finding calls into question the usefulness of these distinctions to everyday researchers, and suggests that Klein's (1990) concerns about the lack of theoretical basis for these distinctions should be carefully considered. This first study also examined the accuracy of two versions of the dissertation research field(s) question from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) as indicators of interdisciplinary dissertation research. Since 2001, this question has allowed respondents to report a secondary field of research, if applicable. The first version of the question, used from 2001 to 2003, asked respondents, \"if you had a secondary field of dissertation research, list the name and number.\" The revised version which was adopted in 2004 used the following wording: \"If your dissertation research was interdisciplinary, list the name and number of your secondary field.\" The interviews revealed that both versions of the question are somewhat valid measures of interdisciplinary research. However, both versions failed to detect interdisciplinary research in several instances. Only the original version, which did not include the term \"interdisciplinary\" specifically, produced false positive reports of interdisciplinary research. It is reasonable to assume that the current version, which includes the term \"interdisciplinary,\" performed better as an interdisciplinary indicator because it is more explicit in its focus on interdisciplinarity. Chapter 2's results play an important role in establishing the meaning, as well as the complexity, of interdisciplinarity among everyday researchers. This study highlights the variety of ways that interdisciplinary research is conceptualized by individuals, both interdisciplinary and not, who are not scholars studying the interdisciplinary research movement. By illustrating the diversity of individuals' definitions of the term, this research better enables us to identify future steps that must be taken to develop a common definition, or to uncover ways in which the variety of definitions may have different uses or implications for recognizing the consequences of interdisciplinary research. Future research should continue to explore the complexities of this topic in a variety of contexts so that we are able to establish the common elements that influence the various conceptualizations. Developing a common definition of interdisciplinarity will assist researchers who want to study it, and will better assist those who wish to promote it or use by offering concrete goals. Constructing a fuller understanding of the term interdisciplinary will also encourage the development of improved measures of it. Many of the prior efforts to measure interdisciplinarity focus on larger units of analysis, such as fields (Wagner, Roessner, and Bobb 2009). In contrast, this research confirms the usefulness of measuring interdisciplinary research at the individual researcher level. This study highlights the ways that a general indicator such as that contained in the SED is valuable, but also illustrates the potential that more explicit, specific survey indicators may have. Establishing that the most recent version of the dissertation research field(s) question from the SED is a reasonably accurate indicator of interdisciplinary dissertation research opens up many possibilities for using the SED and related data to examine interdisciplinarity. Given that there are so few sources of data available to study this process, these data are especially intriguing for exploring the role interdisciplinary research may play in shaping doctoral graduates' labor market experiences. In the second study of this dissertation, found in Chapter 3, I used data from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), the follow-up to the SED, to assess what impacts conducting interdisciplinary research may have on the early careers of doctoral graduates in the sciences and social sciences. Chapter 3 shows that those who conduct interdisciplinary dissertation research are more likely to be employed in academia 1-2 years after graduation than those whose research is noninterdisciplinary. This finding is surprising given the assumption that interdisciplinary researchers face career impediments within academia (Lattuca 2001;Pfirman et al. no date;National Academies 2004). However, this study also indicates that among those working in academia, individuals who conducted interdisciplinary dissertation research are more likely to be in postdoctoral positions, as opposed to tenure track positions. This early career difference in type of employment within academia may have implications for more long-term disparities between interdisciplinary and non-interdisciplinary doctoral graduates (Zumeta 1985). However, additional follow-up data are needed to fully explore this possibility. Other findings from this analysis demonstrate that there are ways in which the early careers of interdisciplinary doctoral graduates are no different from those of non-interdisciplinary graduates. I did not detect any significant differences between these two groups in terms of being employed, having a job that is unrelated to their doctoral degrees, being funded through federal grants, or in weekly income. These findings are inconsistent with the argument that interdisciplinary researchers are disadvantaged, but at the same time they suggest there is no clear advantage to conducting interdisciplinary dissertation research. However, it is important to recognize that I only examine these outcomes at the earliest stages of these individuals' careers. It is plausible that as interdisciplinary scholars attempt to advance throughout their careers, they may face increasing obstacles. Chapter 3 makes an important contribution by being among the first studies to explicitly examine how interdisciplinary research impacts individuals who conduct it and compare their outcomes to those who do not conduct interdisciplinary research. This study thus establishes a much-needed focus on the effects of interdisciplinary research on the individual, and opens up many possibilities for future research to expand our knowledge on this topic. Additional studies should follow-up on the individuals surveyed in the SDR in order to determine whether interdisciplinary dissertation research has effects on later career outcomes, and explore whether the increased likelihood of postdoctoral employment I observed has any effects on later career success. Furthermore, these results suggest that there is value in collecting additional data to learn how participation in interdisciplinary research beyond the dissertation may factor into individuals' careers. In the final analysis of this dissertation, I used both the SED and SDR to demonstrate how respondent sex and interdisciplinary research interact to affect early career outcomes among individuals earning degrees in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. Prior research suggests women may be more likely to participate in interdisciplinary science research, and that interdisciplinary research may play a role in increasing women's presence in STEM fields . The analyses of the SED data in this chapter suggest women are more likely than men to report interdisciplinary dissertation research, but the difference is very slight. However, within the STEM fields specifically, this relationship between sex and conducting interdisciplinary doctoral research is somewhat stronger. This provides some support for the notion that women may be more attracted to interdisciplinary science than traditional science, but there is not a dramatic difference. Chapter 4 also shows that among STEM graduates, some of the findings from Chapter 3's analysis of early career outcomes are sex-specific. Namely, interdisciplinary research's positive effect on the likelihood of academic employment is only significant for men, while its positive effect on the likelihood of employment as a postdoctoral researcher is only significant for women. This discovery adds further complexity to the earlier results. It suggests that interdisciplinary research does not necessarily operate in the same ways for men and for women, and that its effect on early career outcomes can be vary across different situations. This highlights the need for additional research on the topic. Also, it does not appear as if interdisciplinary research plays much of a role in alleviating any existing sex inequalities in the early labor market experiences of STEM doctoral graduates. Interdisciplinary research does not affect the sex gap in the likelihood of employment 1-2 years past doctoral receipt. However, it actually increases women's likelihood of part-time employment, which is associated with a variety of negative outcomes. Additionally, interdisciplinary research has no effect on the gap in obtaining research grants. It does increase women's likelihood of conducting research as opposed to teaching, but this difference is explained by the fact that interdisciplinary doctoral research steers women into postdoctoral positions, which are research-based. I also find that interdisciplinary research does not increase women's likelihood of employment in STEM scientist jobs. This study also indicates that interdisciplinary research may have a detrimental effect on women's entry into male-dominated spheres. I find that conducting interdisciplinary doctoral research is negatively associated with employment in male-dominated job categories. Thus, contrary to  expectations, encouraging women to conduct interdisciplinary research does not appear to increase their likelihood of working in STEM jobs in their early careers, and actually decreases their likelihood of working in male-dominated job categories within the STEM fields shortly after doctoral receipt. Future research must follow-up on these analyses. We must determine the long-term consequences of the disparities discovered in this research. This entails examining future waves of the SDR data, as well as collecting additional data on interdisciplinary research in other contexts. Furthermore, it is important to develop a better understanding of how exactly interdisciplinary research affects men and women in different ways."}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "In this dissertation I have provided an analysis and discussion of numerous issues related to interdisciplinary research. These studies are timely as interdisciplinarity is becoming a more important fixture in research. If this movement continues to increase its influence on research processes, it is critical that we understand as much as possible about interdisciplinary research, including what it is and what types of implications it has for those who utilize it. This dissertation as a whole contributes to the literature a more detailed and thorough focus on interdisciplinarity as experienced at the individual-level. Much of the past research on the efforts to construct indicators of interdisciplinary research approach this concept from a more aggregate level, such as examining the rate of interdisciplinary publications by field of study (Wagner et al. 2009). Furthermore, praise for interdisciplinary research is often framed in terms of its contributions to science or knowledge, broadly speaking (Jacobs and Frickel 2009;Menand 2010;Klein 1990). Conversely, each of the studies in this dissertation addresses interdisciplinary research through an examination of the individuals who may be conducting it. It is important that we consider what effects interdisciplinary research has not only for science and higher education, but also for those involved in the process. Additionally, each of the studies in this dissertation examines interdisciplinary research among individuals who have recently obtained, or are about to obtain, doctoral degrees. The role interdisciplinary research plays in these individuals' educations and careers is important, since this cohort of doctorate earners is among the first to be trained during a time of a heightened emphasis on interdisciplinary research. Furthermore, they will likely be integral in shaping the future of the interdisciplinary movement. All three of the analyses in this dissertation revolve around a single indicator of interdisciplinary research, the dissertation research field(s) question contained in the SED. Studying the same indicator of interdisciplinary research across all three of these analyses provides continuity across analyses, and better highlights the strengths and weaknesses of my approach. Furthermore, by examining interdisciplinary research using both interview and survey data, I provide multiple perspectives through which researchers can better view the nature and consequences of interdisciplinary dissertation research. Using data from two nationally representative surveys makes these results relatively far-reaching in scope. Also, by conducting interviews, I was able to explore certain issues in much more detail than survey data can allow. The strengths of both of these methods have allowed for the development of a more nuanced picture of interdisciplinarity from the perspective of doctoral candidates and recent graduates. However, because this dissertation focuses only on a specific type of interdisciplinary research within a specific population, it is important that future research determine how these findings apply to other situations. My interviews were conducted within a single university. Prior research suggests that support for interdisciplinary research varies across universities (Brint 2005;Lattuca 2001), and that the prevalence of interdisciplinary dissertation research varies across schools (Falkenheim 2010). This means that doctoral students' familiarity with interdisciplinary research, ideas about what interdisciplinary research consists of, and personal experiences with interdisciplinary research could vary widely across different academic contexts. The quantitative analyses in this dissertation are representative of doctoral graduates more broadly, but the data are limited to recent graduates in certain fields, and I am only able to examine the effects of interdisciplinary dissertation research. Future research must determine if these findings apply to those who conduct interdisciplinary research in other settings and at later points in the career. Furthermore, future research should also verify if the use of other indicators of interdisciplinary research would yield similar results. This dissertation lays important groundwork for future examination of interdisciplinary research's effects on individuals' careers, as well as for the development of different and improved interdisciplinarity measures. Yet more work must be done to determine if these findings apply when different types of measures are used. There are many different ways that surveyors and interviewers can identify interdisciplinary research, especially because the concept is so vaguely defined. The complexity of the topic and the variety of ways it can be measured could have important implications for understanding its effects. The SED's indicator of interdisciplinary research appears to tap into interdisciplinarity in a broad, generalized way. It is not a measure that captures the very specific characteristics some interdisciplinary definitions stress. This indicator seems accurate in the sense that it identifies those who utilize multiple disciplines in their research, but it is not able to distinguish between interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches. That is, this measure cannot determine the level of integration individuals use in their research, which is an important component of some interdisciplinary definitions (Klein 1990). Also, many definitions stress the problem-solving nature of interdisciplinary research (Klein 1990;National Academies 2004). The SED indicator is not specific enough to determine if individuals' use of multiple disciplines was driven from a problem-solving standpoint. Although this measure is not equipped to identify these specific elements of interdisciplinary research, it is important to recognize that the literature has yet to operationalize these aspects of interdisciplinarity. In order to construct an indicator that is capable of identifying certain components of interdisciplinarity, we must define what exactly they are and how they appear in practice. The research contained in this dissertation is relevant for institutions of higher education, other employers of doctoral graduates, as well as funding agencies that may encourage interdisciplinary research. The results illustrate that these organizations must recognize the diversity of definitions of interdisciplinarity held by researchers, and suggest that this diversity may be an obstacle in providing effective support for those conducting interdisciplinary research. If there is no commonly-agreed upon definition, it will be difficult for universities to determine how to best accommodate these researchers. Additionally, this will impede funding organizations from being able to identify, and thus promote, good interdisciplinary research. Additionally, the results of Chapter 2, particularly, are important for such organizations as more and more universities are moving toward interdisciplinary models. Numerous commentators suggest that universities are increasingly supporting interdisciplinary research and teaching. For example, some universities seem to be placing emphasis on new, interdisciplinary efforts rather than stressing the importance of traditional disciplines (Brint 2005). Also, there are over 10,000 research centers, primarily in top research universities, that are ostensibly interdisciplinary in nature (Jacobs and Frickel 2009). Other schools are stressing the need for interdisciplinary undergraduate education (Brint et al. 2009). However, because of the lack of clarity surrounding what constitutes interdisciplinary research and education, and no consistent ways of identifying it, there has yet to be any systematic examination of identifying how prevalent interdisciplinary features are in universities, and what impacts they have truly had on how these universities operate. The results of Chapter 2 highlight what steps may need to be taken for us to develop common understandings, and thus methods for determining the prevalence and impact of interdisciplinary endeavors in U.S. higher education. Furthermore, the finding that conducting interdisciplinary research leads to different career paths and sex differences in the sex composition of individuals' job categories should be carefully considered by employers and other organizations looking to promote interdisciplinary research. These analyses suggest there is potential for interdisciplinary research to disadvantage those who conduct it. Employers who are interested in expanding interdisciplinary research must recognize this potential and ensure that they do not create obstacles for interdisciplinary scholars. Funding agencies that are looking to support interdisciplinary projects should recognize that promoting this type of research may affect the individuals who pursue it. These agencies, as well as educational institutions, could play an important role in advancing additional research into the individual-level consequences of interdisciplinary research, and thereby be able to better inform themselves of how to effectively promote this type of research and those who conduct it. This dissertation also suggests that programs focused on increasing women's participation in STEM fields should consider the role that interdisciplinary research may play in shaping women's educational and career opportunities. My research indicates that interdisciplinary research may be slightly more attractive to women, but it does not appear to be something that has influenced women's participation in STEM fields in any dramatic way. Efforts to increase women in STEM fields may benefit from additional work to understand if and how interdisciplinary research may attract women to the STEM fields. However, this dissertation should caution such programs that blindly encouraging women to pursue interdisciplinary science may not be wise. The evidence from Chapter 4 indicates that interdisciplinary research is not effective in increasing women's participation in STEM jobs, and may also lessen their opportunities for working in male-dominated job categories. As  noted, interdisciplinary research should only be used to promote women's participation in STEM if it provides them with the same opportunities for success as men. Although each chapter of this dissertation has focused on a different aspect of interdisciplinary research, all of these analyses confirm that it is a complicated phenomenon and that its impacts are not always consistent and straightforward. Nevertheless, my research illustrates that interdisciplinary research is worthy of future analysis and there is much more that we need to understand about this movement which is already shaping the way research is done."}]
