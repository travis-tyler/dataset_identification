[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study, the authors examined relations between educational, civic, and occupational success in young adulthood and the duration and intensity of participation in organized activities during high school. They also examined these relations as a function of sponsorship (i.e., school-vs. community-sponsored organized activities). They found that youths who participated in organized activities for 2 years demonstrated more favorable educational and civic outcomes in young adulthood than those who participated for 1 year. More intensive participation was also associated with greater educational, civic, and occupational success in young adulthoodparticularly among youths who participated in activities for 2 years. Educational attainment often mediated the relations between temporal measures of participation and young adult civic and occupational outcomes. With the exception of analyses examining occupational success, findings varied little as a function of sponsorship. Of note, analyses revealed that both temporal measures of participation were positively associated with young adult outcomes as many as 8 years after high school."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Growing evidence demonstrates positive associations between participation in organized activities outside of school hours and positive youth development (Feldman & Matjasko, 2005 ; Mahoney, Larson, & Eccles, 2005) .\n1 Studies suggest that participation in organized activities is associated with fewer problem behaviors, better academic performance, and better psychosocial adjustment (Mahoney et al., 2005) . Recent findings also suggest that relations between participation in organized youth activities and positive outcomes may extend into young adulthood (e.g., Zaff, Moore, Papillo, & Williams, 2003) . Accordingly, interest in organized youth activities has surged among families, policymakers, and researchers during the last decade. More than half of American teenagers participate in organized activities (Mahoney, Harris, & Eccles, 2006) , and recent federal, state, and city initiatives aim to increase access to these activities (e.g., federal 21st Century Community Learning Centers, California's Proposition 49, Chicago's After School Matters initiative).\nDespite consensus on the overall value of organized activities, questions remain regarding the extent to which specific dimensions of participation (e.g., duration and intensity) are associated with short-and long-term success. Additionally, there is little consensus on the pathways linking participation in organized activities to later developmental success. In this study, we investigate whether the duration and intensity of participation in organized school-and community-sponsored activities during adolescence are associated with educational, civic, and occupational success in young adulthood. We also explore one of the possible pathways linking participation in organized activities and positive young adult outcomes: We examine the extent to which educational successes associated with participation in organized youth activities may facilitate opportunities for greater civic and occupational success during young adulthood."}, {"section_title": "Organized Activities and Positive Youth Development", "text": "The literature on positive youth development provides a useful framework for conceptualizing how youths' experiences during the after-school hours may contribute to development. Theory and research on positive youth development emphasize the plasticity of human development and suggest that cultivating positive, supportive relationships with people and social institutions encourages healthy development (Lerner et al., 2005; Roth, Brooks-Gunn, Murray, & Foster, 1998) . According to this perspective, organized activities encourage healthy development because they provide more developmental supports and opportunities than other common after-school pursuits, like watching television or hanging out with friends. These supports and opportunities may include (a) physical and psychological safety, (b) appropriate structure, (c) supportive relationships, (d) opportunities to belong, (e) positive social norms, (f) support for efficacy and mattering, (g) opportunities for skill building, and (h) the integration of family, school, and community efforts (Eccles & Gootman, 2002) .\nVarious nomenclatures have been used to describe the healthy outcomes associated with participation in activities that offer these kinds of supports and opportunities. One influential taxonomy, termed \"the five Cs,\" assigns these outcomes to five categories: (a) competence in academic, social, and vocational areas; (b) confidence or a positive self-identity; (c) connections to community, family, and peers; (d) character or positive values, integrity, and moral commitment; and (e) caring and compassion (Lerner, Fisher, & Weinberg, 2000) . Preliminary evidence supports the theoretical contention that these five Cs load onto a single higher order latent construct and that all five Cs therefore make essential contributions to individuals' abilities to thrive in adolescence and adulthood (Lerner et al., 2005) . Although research on this higher order thriving construct is still limited, empirical evidence supports positive relations between participation in organized after-school activities and many of the individual five Cs (see Roth & BrooksGunn, 2003a , 2003b .\nThe issue of self-selection, however, remains an obstacle to definitive conclusions about the causal role of participation in organized activities. Because participation in organized activities is voluntary and constrained by personal factors (e.g., motivation, skills, financial resources) and institutional factors (e.g., availability, transportation, costs), selection undoubtedly plays a role in the link between participation in organized activities and developmental success. Indeed, modest and mixed findings from randomized studies of after-school programs-one of the many types of organized activities that youths participate in-suggest that the robust findings observed in many nonexperimental studies may capitalize on the influence of self-selection (see Harvard Family Research Project, 2006 , for a review of experimental studies of after-school programs). One approach that reduces, but does not eliminate, the influence of self-selection in nonexperimental research is to control for factors known to predict both participation in organized activities and positive outcomes. The studies reviewed below, which informed our research questions, included such statistical controls unless otherwise noted."}, {"section_title": "Dimensions of Participation in Organized Activities", "text": "Different organized activities offer different opportunities and supports for development and may therefore encourage different \"Cs\" (Larson, Hansen, & Moneta, 2006; Roth & Brooks-Gunn, 2003a , 2003b . Youths also differ with respect to the length (i.e., duration) and frequency (i.e., intensity) of their participation in organized activities (Simpkins, Little, & Weiss, 2004) and may thus have varied opportunities for developmental gains. Yet, with relatively few recent exceptions, extant research typically compares the outcomes of nonparticipants with the outcomes of those who participate in any type of organized activity for any length of time (see Feldman & Matjasko, 2005 , for a review). In the present study, we examine associations between three dimensions of participation in organized activities during adolescence-sponsorship (i.e., school vs. community sponsored), duration, and intensityand the development of educational, civic, and occupational successes in young adulthood.\nSome investigations of sponsorship suggest that participation in school-versus community-sponsored activities should be differentially associated with specific outcomes. In particular, some argue that participation in school-sponsored activities may be more strongly associated with educational outcomes (e.g., Kaufman & Gabler, 2004) . A corollary to this view is that participation in community-sponsored activities should be more strongly associated with civic outcomes. The reality, however, is that schoolsponsored activities do not always focus on academics (e.g., service clubs, team sports), and community-sponsored activities do not always focus on promoting civic involvement (e.g., community arts programs, sports leagues).\nAccordingly, findings on the relations between sponsorship and outcomes are mixed. Analyses of data from the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS) indicate that participation in schoolsponsored, but not non-school-sponsored, extracurricular activities during high school predicts higher grades in 12th grade and higher rates of college attendance 2 years later, even after controlling for prior grades (Marsh & Kleitman, 2002) . Similar analyses of NELS data indicate that more intensive participation in school-sponsored, but not non-school-sponsored, activities is positively associated with attending a competitive postsecondary institution (Swanson, 2002) . In contrast, other longitudinal studies have found that youths who participate in school-or community-sponsored activities demonstrate similar educational outcomes (e.g., Casey, Ripke, & Huston, 2005) , and at least one cross-sectional study found that participation in community-sponsored activities is associated with better educational outcomes than participation in school-sponsored activities (Brown & Evans, 2002) . There is also little support for the contention that participation in community-sponsored, versus school-sponsored, activities leads to greater civic involvement. Analyses of data from NELS and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health indicate that political involvement during adulthood is more strongly tied to participation in schoolsponsored activities than to participation in community-sponsored activities during adolescence (McFarland & Thomas, 2006) . The extent to which sponsorship is associated with differences in youth and young adult outcomes therefore remains unclear.\nResearchers have just begun to consider whether differences among youths in temporal dimensions of participation are associated with differences in positive outcomes (see Roth, Malone, & Brooks-Gunn, 2007 , for a complete review). There are at least two reasons to expect such associations. First, research suggests that relationships with adult leaders, peers, and institutions may at least partly explain the association between participation in organized activities and positive developmental outcomes (Eccles & Gootman, 2002; Roth et al., 1998) . These relationships take time to develop, and those who participate over longer periods of time may be more likely to benefit from them. Second, those who participate frequently, over an extended period of time, may reap the rewards of lengthier and more frequent exposure to the opportunities and supports that organized activities provide.\nReviews of a variety of types of after-school activities and programs (e.g., Eccles & Gootman, 2002; Feldman & Matjasko, 2005; Roth et al., 2007) reveal a dearth of studies on participation duration. A few recent studies, however, have identified associations between participation in organized activities over multiple years and positive adolescent and young adult outcomesparticularly educational outcomes. Longitudinal analyses of a large sample of high school students indicate that although there are no differences in grades or attitudes toward school between nonparticipants and 1-year participants in school-sponsored activities, youths who participate for 2 or 3 years earn higher grades, demonstrate more positive attitudes toward school, and have greater academic aspirations than nonparticipants (Darling, 2005; Darling, Caldwell, & Smith, 2005) . Analyses of NELS data also reveal positive relations between participation in organized activities over three waves of data collection during middle and high school (vs. two waves or fewer) and multiple young adult outcomes (i.e., college attendance, voting, and volunteering at age 20; Zaff et al., 2003) . Finally, analyses of data from the Carolina Longitudinal Study demonstrate positive associations between participation in high-school-sponsored activities over 2 years (vs. 1) and college attendance at age 20, particularly for youths with lower interpersonal competence (Mahoney, Cairns, & Farmer, 2003) .\nFindings on the relations between participation intensity and youth development are also limited and somewhat mixed. For instance, some have found significant positive associations between the number of hours that adolescents devote to schoolsponsored extracurricular activities and varied academic outcomes (e.g., high school grades, academic attitudes and aspirations, postsecondary attendance; Darling, 2005; Marsh & Kleitman, 2002) , whereas others have identified only marginally significant relations between time spent in school-sponsored extracurricular activities and adolescents' grades (Cooper, Valentine, Nye, & Lindsay, 1999) . The link between academic outcomes and the intensity of youths' participation in community-sponsored activities is equally unclear. Although some evidence suggests that the intensity of adolescents' participation in community-sponsored activities is positively associated with achievement test scores (Cooper et al., 1999) , studies have also found negative (Marsh & Kleitman, 2002) and nonsignificant relations (Cooper et al., 1999) between more intensive participation in non-school-sponsored activities and grades during adolescence. Finally, recent studies of participation intensity measured without regard to sponsorship suggest that intensity may be positively associated with concurrent (RoseKrasnor, but not longitudinal measures of high school academic functioning.\nFurther complicating the picture, findings from a few studies indicate that at high levels, intensive participation may be associated with adverse adolescent and young adult outcomes, particularly in the academic domain (Cooper et al., 1999; Marsh & Kleitman, 2002) . These findings have been used to make the argument that too much time in organized activities distracts students from other important experiences (e.g., family time, schoolwork) and hinders development. This position, termed the overscheduling hypothesis (Mahoney, Harris, & Eccles, 2006) , draws support from a tempered version of a zero-sum theoretical model, which suggests that at high levels of intensity, commitments to extracurricular activities compete with commitments to academic activities and adversely affect academic performance (see discussion of the zero-sum and threshold model in Marsh & Kleitman, 2002) . Adverse consequences are often observed only among youths who participate at extremely high levels, however (Cooper et al., 1999; Marsh & Kleitman, 2002) . For instance, recent analyses of adolescents' time diaries from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics-Child Development Supplement II found that among some youths (often African American), participating in organized activities for more than 20 hr per week predicted slightly lower scores on a few measures of well-being (e.g., self-esteem, frequency of parent-adolescent discussions) as compared with less frequent participation (Mahoney et al., 2006 ). Participating at this high level generally predicted more positive outcomes than nonparticipation, however. Moreover, among those participating less than 20 hr per week, more frequent participation generally predicted better well-being (e.g., reading achievement, psychological adjustment, lack of substance use, and good parent-adolescent relationships). These findings support the contention that within the normal range, more intensive participation is often associated with more positive outcomes."}, {"section_title": "The Present Study", "text": "Extant research suggests that relations between participation in organized activities and positive youth and young adult development may vary as a function of sponsorship, duration, and intensity. Several unanswered questions remain, however. First, investigations of these three dimensions rarely overlap. It is therefore unclear whether and to what extent the implications of sponsorship, duration, and intensity vary as a function of each other. For instance, we know very little about differences in the associations between temporal participation measures and youth development across sponsorship categories. Additionally, it is unclear whether the positive associations between participation intensity and youth development vary as a function of duration. For instance, participation duration may be so strongly associated with positive outcomes that among, youths who score high on duration, more intensive participation offers few additional benefits. The benefits related to high scores on duration may represent the ceiling of benefits attributable to participation in organized activities.\nSecond, although some researchers have examined associations between participation in organized activities and young adult outcomes immediately following high school (i.e., age 20, or 2 years after high school), the lack of available follow-up data has, until recently, prevented the examination of relations between participation and outcomes later in young adulthood. Thus, it is unclear whether the positive outcomes associated with participation in organized activities are maintained throughout young adulthood. We address this question, examining positive young adult outcomes both 2 and 8 years after high school. We focus on outcomes in three domains that are developmentally relevant for young adults: educational attainment, civic engagement, and occupational success. These three domains tap into four of the five Cs: Educational attainment reflects positive development in the academic area of the first C; civic engagement (e.g., volunteering, voting) reflects positive development in select aspects of the third, fourth, and fifth Cs; and occupational success reflects positive development in the vocational area of the first C. Because our data do not contain a measure of the second C (i.e., confidence and positive identity), it was not possible to examine relations between participation measures and the higher order \"thriving\" construct that arises from the five Cs.\nFinally, it is important to acknowledge that young adults who are successful in one domain are often successful in others. For instance, U.S. Census data indicate that a greater percentage of college-educated young adults (67%) than non-college-educated young adults (38%) voted in a recent election (Holder, 2006) . College-educated young adults also earn more income than noncollege-educated young adults (U.S. Department of Education, 2005) . One plausible explanation for this pattern of findings is that postsecondary education heightens civic awareness and opens the door to career opportunities that are unavailable to those who do not continue their education beyond high school. Consequently, we examine the extent to which educational attainment mediates positive relations between participation duration and intensity in adolescence and civic and occupational success in young adulthood. To our knowledge, prior studies have not explicitly examined these pathways.\nIn summary, using a national longitudinal data set, we attempt to address three sets of unanswered questions:\n1. Is the duration of youths' participation in organized activities during high school positively associated with educational, civic, and occupational success as few as 2, and as many as 8, years after high school? Do these relations vary as a function of sponsorship?\n2. Among those who participate in organized activities during high school, is more intensive participation linearly associated with better educational, civic, and occupational outcomes 2 and 8 years after high school? Or, are there diminishing returns in young adult outcomes at very high levels of intensity? Do associations between intensity and young adult outcomes vary as a function of duration? Do relations between intensity and young adult outcomes vary as a function of sponsorship?\n3. Are associations between temporal participation measures and positive civic and occupational outcomes mediated by educational attainment?\nIn an effort to reduce the influence of selection biases, our analyses control for demographic characteristics (gender, race/ ethnicity, and socioeconomic status) that have been linked to participation in organized activities (Marsh & Kleitman, 2002; Wimer et al., 2006) and to developmental success in young adulthood (Holder, 2006; Lopez & Kirby, 2005; Planty, Regnier, & Owings, 2003; U.S. Department of Education, 2005) . Although it was impossible to control for performance on prior measures of outcome variables (i.e., our models predict young adult outcomes that have no adolescent equivalents), we control for a variety of academic, behavioral, and familial constructs that capture important dimensions of adolescents' overall adjustment. Prior findings from NELS suggest that constructs in these domains have significant implications for participation in organized activities and positive young adult outcomes (e.g., Marsh & Kleitman, 2002; Zaff et al., 2003) . We acknowledge that many other unmeasured characteristics may influence selection into activities, and that the power to draw causal inference is therefore limited."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample", "text": "Data for the present study come from NELS, a national, longitudinal study that began with an assessment of 24,599 8th graders during the spring of 1988.

There were no significant differences between the analytic and excluded samples with respect to gender composition.

The NELS documentation reports the number of individuals added to the 8th-grade sample at the 10th-and 12th-grade follow-ups (the resulting 10th-and 12th-grade samples are referred to as \"freshened\" samples). However, in NELS documentation, the Ns for youths added to the freshened samples at 10th and 12th grades reflect only those added to the number of sampled 8th-grade youths (N \u03ed 26,432). Not all sampled youths completed an 8th-grade questionnaire, however. The Ns for new responders reported in this article-which also include nonresponders sampled at 8th grade who completed 10th-and/or 12th-grade questionnaires-are larger than the Ns reported for youths in the freshened 10th-and 12th-grade samples in NELS documentation.\n3 Sample sizes for each analysis vary from this figure owing to missing data on the dependent and/or independent variables.

At the 10th-and 12th-grade assessments, students reported whether (i.e., yes or no) and at what level (i.e., participant or leader) they participated in each of the following school-sponsored activities during the past year: sports, cheerleading, pom-pom/drill teams, music groups, plays/musicals, student government, academic honor societies, newspaper/yearbook, service clubs, academic clubs, hobby clubs, and FFA/FHA/FTA (Future Farmers, Homemakers, and Teachers of America) organizations. Students also indicated how frequently they participated in each of following five organized community-sponsored activities during the past year: religious activities, community youth groups, music/art/dance lessons, sports lessons, or community service. 5 We used responses to these items to construct four dichotomous measures of participation: participation in at least one schoolsponsored activity during 10th grade, participation in at least one school-sponsored activity during 12th grade, participation in at least one community-sponsored activity during 10th grade, and participation in at least one community-sponsored activity during 12th grade. 6 We constructed separate measures of the duration of youths' participation in school-and community-sponsored activities using these dichotomous participation variables. For each of these two types of activities, youths who did not participate during 10th or 12th grade were assigned a score of 0 (nonparticipants), youths who participated in 10th or 12th grade but not both grades were assigned a score of 1 (1-year participants), and youths who participated in both 10th and 12th grades were assigned a score of 2 (2-year participants). See Table 1 for frequencies.\nParticipation intensity. We used data on participation frequency to construct intensity variables. Students reported the total number of hours that they spent in an average week on all combined school-sponsored extracurricular activities during 10th and 12th grades.

Students also indicated how often they participated in each of the five aforementioned organized communitysponsored activities at each assessment (0 \u03ed never or rarely, 1 \u03ed less than once per week, 2 \u03ed at least once/twice per week, and 3 \u03ed everyday/almost everyday). Frequency scores were averaged across these five items within each assessment period to yield separate 10th-and 12th-grade measures of community-sponsored participation intensity.\nAmong 2-year participants, frequency scores were averaged across 10th and 12th grades within sponsorship categories, yielding separate measures of school-and community-sponsored participation intensity. For 1-year participants, school-and community-sponsored intensity scores reflect only the intensity of participation during the year that youths participated.

In analyses of outcomes 2 years after high school we examined only educational attainment and civic engagement. We did not examine occupational measures 2 years after high school because many individuals at this age are enrolled in school full time. We examined successes in all three domains 8 years after high school. All outcome variables are described below, and descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1 .\nEducational attainment. We used postsecondary attendance (i.e., whether participants attended a postsecondary institution at any time after completing high school) as a measure of educational attainment 2 years after high school. Eight years after high school, attainment was operationalized as completion of a 4-year postsecondary degree. We used self-reports of young adults' highest level of education to construct these dichotomous variables.\nCivic engagement. We examined two dimensions of civic engagement: volunteering and voting. Dichotomous measures of both outcomes were constructed 2 and 8 years after high school. Two years after high school, we defined volunteering as participation in at least one service activity sponsored by a postsecondary institution (i.e., volunteering services to fellow students, volunteering services to community groups) or a community-based agency (e.g., organized volunteer work such as at a hospital, volunteer work for trade or professional organizations). Eight years after high school, volunteering was defined as participation in one or more community-based service activities during the past year (i.e., volunteering for youth organizations, civic/community volunteering).\nWe used single items to measure voting 2 and 8 years after high school. Two years after high school individuals indicated whether they voted in a state, local, or national election during the past year. Eight years after high school participants responded to the same question but reflected on voting behavior over the prior 2 years.\nOccupational success. We examined two measures of occupational success: full-time employment and income. Eight years after high school, a dichotomous measure of full-time employment (i.e., 35 hr or more per week) was constructed using self-reports of hours worked per week. Self-reports of annual income, measured continuously, were also obtained for the year prior to the 8-year post-high-school assessment (i.e., 1999). The income distribution was positively skewed.

We conducted analyses in Stata 8.0 (Stata Corporation, 2003) using robust standard errors to account for the clustering of participants within high schools. Because of the large sample size and the number of models tested, we set the statistical significance criterion at p \u03fd .01 in all analyses."}, {"section_title": "Participation Duration and Outcomes in Young Adulthood", "text": "Analyses examining participation duration proceeded in two stages. First, we used linear regression (in analyses of income) and logistic regression (in all other analyses) to examine the relations between the duration of participation in school-and communitysponsored activities and young adult outcomes, net of all controls. Duration variables were converted to dummy variables within each sponsorship category, and 1-year participants were assigned to the reference category (see Table 2 and Model 1 analyses in Table 3) . 8 Second, we tested the extent to which postsecondary attendance (for 2-year outcomes) and completion (for 8-year outcomes) mediated relations between participation duration and young adult civic and occupational outcomes. We followed Baron and Kenny's (1986) steps for testing mediation, which require (a) a significant relation, c, between the independent and dependent variables; (b) a significant relation, a, between the independent variable and the mediator; (c) a significant relation, b, between the mediator and the dependent variable while controlling for the independent variable; and (d) a significant reduction in the relation between the independent and dependent variables when the mediator is included as a predictor in the model (in this step, the relation between the independent and dependent variables is denoted c\u0408). In keeping with these guidelines, we tested for mediation only where prior analyses identified a significant direct relation between duration and the outcome (i.e., a significant c path) and a significant relation between duration and our mediating variable, postsecondary attendance or completion (i.e., a significant a path). When these criteria were met, we included postsecondary attendance or completion as an additional predictor in models predicting civic and occupational outcomes (see Model 2 results in Tables 3, 5 , and 6).\nWe used Sobel tests to determine the statistical significance of indirect relations through postsecondary education when the above described models revealed significant c, a, and b paths. The Sobel test assesses the significance of the product a \u03eb b, which is approximately equivalent to the quantity c -c\u0408 when using linear regression (MacKinnon, Warsi, & Dwyer, 1995) . A standard error and z score for the term a \u03eb b can be calculated using the following formulas: z score \u03ed ab/SE ab , where (Baron & Kenny, 1986; Sobel, 1982) . Because the Sobel test was developed for use with linear models, a and b coefficients and their standard errors were appropriately transformed using procedures for logistic models outlined in MacKinnon and Dwyer (1993) .

First, we used logistic and linear regression to examine direct relations between participation intensity and young adult outcomes after including controls (see Table 4 and Model 1 analyses in Tables 5-6 ). School-and communitysponsored participation intensity variables were entered as predictors in separate regression models in order to prevent limiting the sample to those who participated in both kinds of activities (i.e., because analyses use listwise deletion, cases with intensity data for only one type of activity would be excluded from models examining both types of activities simultaneously). Second, we added quadratic intensity terms to these models to test for nonlinear relations. Quadratic models were considered an improvement over linear models if the quadratic term was significant at p \u03fd .01 and the model R 2 or pseudo-R 2 value increased significantly upon including the quadratic term.

Our findings extend prior research and suggest that adolescents who participate in organized activities intensively and over a period of 2 years (vs. 1) are particularly likely to achieve these successes in young adulthood. Perhaps most impressive, we found that the associations between participation intensity and duration and positive development extend well into young adulthood, as many as 8 years after high school. The relations between temporal dimensions of participation and young adult outcomes are not always straightforward, however. Our findings build on prior studies that have simply documented relations between participation duration and intensity and young adult outcomes (Marsh & Kleitman, 2002; Swanson, 2002; Zaff et al., 2003) , and suggest that we must consider the complex interplay between duration, intensity, and sponsorship, as well as the paths that link participation to young adult outcomes (see results summary in Table 7 ). We highlight these new findings as we discuss each of our research questions.\nWe first asked whether adolescents who participate in organized activities over 2 years achieve greater young adult success than those who participate for a single year. In keeping with limited extant research (e.g., Mahoney et al., 2003; Zaff et al., 2003) , we found that although 1 year of participation in school-or community-sponsored activities during adolescence was associated with some positive young adult outcomes, 2 years of partic- ipation was associated with even greater odds of postsecondary attendance and completion and greater odds of civic engagement 2 and 8 years after high school (see Table 7 ). This was true regardless of sponsorship. Prior analyses of NELS data have identified positive relations between multiple years of participation in organized activities (measured without regard to sponsorship) and educational and civic outcomes 2 years after high school (Zaff et al., 2003) , but our results are novel in that they suggest that (a) the relations between participation duration and positive educational and civic outcomes are maintained throughout much of young adulthood (i.e., 8 years after high school) and (b) the relations between participation duration and positive young adult outcomes vary little as a function of sponsorship. Although our analyses do not permit definitive conclusions about causality, one explanation for the positive associations between participation duration and educational and civic outcomes is that youths who participate over 2 years (as opposed to 1 year) have more exposure to the developmental supports and opportunities afforded by organized activities and therefore derive greater benefits from participation. Another explanation is that longer periods of participation facilitate the kind of positive interpersonal relationships that are thought to encourage positive youth development (Eccles & Gootman, 2002; Roth et al., 1998) . Because our measure of duration does not address changes in specific activities between 10th and 12th grade (e.g., a switch from school orchestra in 10th grade to school service clubs in 12th grade), the present findings cannot be interpreted as clear support for the second explanation. Both explanations should be investigated in future research.\nWe did not find positive associations between participation duration and occupational success in young adulthood (see Table  7 ). This was true regardless of sponsorship. This is not completely surprising given results from recent analyses of NELS data suggesting that participation in varsity and elite school sports (e.g., as a team captain), but not intramural or junior varsity sports, is positively associated with full-time employment and income in young adulthood (Carlson, Scott, Planty, & Thompson, 2005) . These findings might be interpreted as evidence that intensity plays an important role in predicting occupational outcomes, as elite/varsity athletes likely invest significantly more time in sports than intramural/junior varsity athletes. Consistent with this hypothesis, our analyses revealed that more intensive participation in school-sponsored activities among 2-year participants was, in fact, associated with greater occupational success in young adulthood. Participation in organized activities over longer periods of time at lower levels of intensity, however, may not be sufficient to facilitate greater occupational success in young adulthood. It is unclear why the same does not appear to be true for educational or civic outcomes (i.e., why duration alone is sufficient to predict greater educational and civic success). One plausible explanation stems from the fact that entry into the workforce often occurs long after exiting high school (i.e., after completion of postsecondary education), and occupational success, unlike civic involvement, requires a daily commitment. Associations between activity participation and later occupational success may therefore occur only after youths exceed a uniquely high participation threshold.\nIn our second research question, we asked whether more intensive participation in school-or community-sponsored activities during high school is associated with more favorable outcomes in young adulthood. Consistent with studies that find positive relations between participation intensity and youth and young adult outcomes (e.g., Darling, 2005; Marsh & Kleitman, 2002) , we found many positive associations between participation intensity during high school and educational and civic outcomes in young adulthood. As discussed previously, we also found some positive associations between participation intensity and occupational outcomes in young adulthood (see Table 7 ). Moreover, analyses largely failed to support the overscheduling hypothesis-the notion that very intensive participation limits opportunities for other enriching experiences and hinders development (Cooper et al., \nNote. NS \u03ed nonsignificant relation; \u03e9 \u03ed significant direct relation; P \u03ed partial mediation (direct relation remains significant after adding postsecondary predictor, but indirect path through postsecondary education is significant); C \u03ed complete mediation (direct relation is no longer significant after adding postsecondary predictor, and indirect path through postsecondary education is significant); superscript q \u03ed quadratic relation.\n1999; Mahoney et al., 2006; Marsh & Kleitman, 2002) . We detected only two curvilinear associations between participation intensity and young adult outcomes. First, among 2-year participants, the positive relation between more intensive participation in school-sponsored activities and the odds of postsecondary completion reached a plateau between 10 -19 and 20 hr per week. Counter to the overscheduling hypothesis, however, the odds of postsecondary completion did not decline between 10 -19 and 20 hr per week. Second, up to 4 hr per week, more intensive participation in school-sponsored activities among 1-year participants was positively associated with volunteering 2 years after high school, but as participation increased to 5-9 hr per week, the odds of volunteering declined. It is noteworthy, however, that for the vast majority of 1-year participants (the 87% who participated 4 hr per week or less), more intensive participation in school-sponsored activities predicted greater odds of volunteering 2 years after high school. In the context of all other results obtained in the present study, these findings provide little evidence for the adverse consequences of very intensive participation. The positive associations between participation intensity and young adult successes were not unconditional, however, and were often contingent on the length of time that youths participated (see Table 7 ). Among those who participated for 2 years, more intensive participation in school-and/or community-sponsored activities was associated with more favorable educational, civic, and occupational outcomes both 2 and 8 years after high school. This suggests that more intensive participation in organized activities is associated with gains in young adult outcomes beyond those associated with participation over an extended period of time (i.e., 2 years). On the other hand, among those who participated in organized activities for only 1 year, there were very limited positive associations between participation intensity and young adult outcomes. More intensive participation in school-sponsored activities among 1-year participants was ultimately (i.e., 8 years after high school) associated with only postsecondary completion and voting, and more intensive participation in community-sponsored activities among 1-year participants was not associated with any of the outcomes measured 8 years after high school. Prior studies of NELS data have documented positive relations between participation intensity and postsecondary attendance (e.g., Marsh & Kleitman, 2002; Swanson, 2002) , but to our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly consider the intersection of intensity and duration.\nThe present findings do not explain why more intensive participation should be associated with fewer positive outcomes when participation is limited to 1 year. One contributing factor may be that adolescents who participate in organized activities for 1 year tend to participate less frequently than youths who participate over a period of 2 years (see Table 1 ). If the links between participation intensity and positive development are at least partly explained by greater exposure to the developmental supports and opportunities provided by organized activities, one plausible explanation is that youths must exceed a minimum intensity threshold (i.e., a minimum amount of exposure to supports and opportunities) before positive young adult outcomes are observed. The failure to find consistently positive associations between intensity and young adult outcomes among those who participated in organized activities for only 1 year might stem from the fact that too few of these individuals exceeded the minimum intensity threshold. Our analyses were not designed to address this question, however, and future research is needed to determine how much time youths must spend in activities before positive outcomes are observed (Riggs & Greenberg, 2004) .\nDifferences in the relations between participation intensity and young adult outcomes as a function of sponsorship are also difficult to explain. Ultimately (i.e., 8 years after high school), we found fewer associations between community-sponsored participation intensity and young adult outcomes than between schoolsponsored participation intensity and young adult outcomes. Differences in the average frequency of youths' participation in school-versus community-sponsored activities may, for reasons discussed in the preceding paragraph, partly explain this discrepancy (i.e., on average, youths may spend less time in communitysponsored activities than in school-sponsored activities). We cannot make this determination on the basis of the present findings, however, because our school-and community-sponsored intensity scales are not equivalent. Future studies using more comparable measures of school-and community-sponsored participation intensity are needed in order to determine whether these discrepant findings are a measurement artifacts, and if not, whether they may be attributed to differences in youths' participation intensity across sponsorship categories.\nSponsorship also had noteworthy implications for the relation between participation intensity and occupational outcomes. We found that among 2-year participants, more intensive participation in school-sponsored, but not community-sponsored, activities was positively associated with full-time employment and income. One plausible explanation, worthy of further research, is that schoolsponsored activities, relative to community-sponsored activities, offer developmental supports and opportunities that are more relevant for later occupational success. It is also possible that specific types of school-sponsored activities are driving these findings. As previously noted, recent analyses of NELS data show that participation in elite school-sponsored athletics is positively associated with full-time employment and income (Carlson et al., 2005) . If relations between participation intensity and occupational outcomes are specific to school-sponsored sports, this would explain why we did not find associations between communitysponsored participation intensity and occupational success. To test this hypothesis, future investigations should examine relations between participation intensity and occupational outcomes across different types of activities (varsity sports vs. band/orchestra, academic clubs, etc.).\nIn our final research question, we asked whether participation duration and intensity are indirectly associated with positive young adult civic and occupational outcomes via educational attainment. Except for the fully direct associations between participation and voting 8 years after high school, we found that all significant relations between the duration of participation in organized activities during adolescence and young adult civic and occupational outcomes were at least partly mediated by postsecondary attendance or completion (see Table 7 ). Similar findings emerged in analyses of participation intensity-particularly with respect to outcomes measured 8 years after high school. With the exception of relations between intensity and voting, all significant relations between participation intensity and civic and occupational outcomes 8 years after high school were at least partly mediated by postsecondary completion. In other words, youths who partici-pated in organized activities more frequently and/or over a longer period of time were more likely to attend and graduate from a postsecondary institution and, in turn, were more likely to volunteer and achieve occupational success 8 years after high school. These findings are consistent with the notion that completion of a 4-year postsecondary degree encourages civic awareness and opens the door to career opportunities that may be unavailable to those who do not continue their education beyond high school. To our knowledge, these findings are a novel contribution to the literature on temporal participation measures and civic and occupational success in young adulthood.\nAlthough our findings make a relatively compelling case for the value of intensive involvement in organized activities over a period of more than 1 year, it is important to acknowledge several limitations. First, although we have controlled for a number of selection factors, it is never possible to control for all factors that predict both participation and outcomes. Unmeasured selection factors may at least partly account for the apparent relations between temporal participation measures and positive young adult outcomes. Likewise, we cannot rule out the possibility that selection at least partly explains the observed relations between postsecondary education and civic and occupational outcomes. Recent findings suggest that many of the cognitive and socioemotional skills that predict educational attainment also predict occupational outcomes (Heckman, Stixrud, & Urzua, 2006) . We therefore caution against attributing a causal role to participation in organized activities or to postsecondary attendance and completion. Moreover, we suggest that future studies include analyses that more explicitly consider the role of selection (e.g., analyses examining interactions between temporal measures of participation and youth characteristics related to selection).\nSecond, our measures of participation are general and do not assess several more specific dimensions of participation that have probable implications for young adult outcomes. Although we found that lengthier periods of involvement in organized activities were associated with better young adult outcomes, our measure of duration did not assess the continuity of youths' participation in specific activities (e.g., whether youths participated in band in 10th and 12th grades or switched to an academic club in 12th grade). Additionally, our measure of duration did not distinguish between 1-year participants who dropped out of activities after 10th grade versus those who joined activities during 12th grade. Analyses examining these detailed aspects of duration were beyond the scope of the present study, but they are important steps for future research. Conclusions about the value of more intensive participation must also be tempered by recognition of the imprecise method of measuring participation frequency. Participation in some activities fluctuates markedly across seasons (e.g., marching bands practice more intensively in the fall than in the spring) and may not be adequately captured by measures of the frequency of participation in an \"average\" week. Intensity measures that do not account for these fluctuations (such as those available in NELS) may result in inaccurately estimated intensity coefficients for youth in seasonal activities (McHale, Crouter, & Tucker, 2001) .\nThird, we did not consider the implications of simultaneous participation in more than one kind of activity. Our findings suggest that school-and community-sponsored activities are similarly associated with young adult outcomes, but it is impossible to determine whether this is because school-and communitysponsored activities are truly associated with similar young adult outcomes or because adolescents who participate in one kind of activity also participate in the other. This is a question we plan to address in future research.\nFinally, though the NELS data set lacks measures of activity quality, it is important to point out that the positive relations between participation duration and intensity and young adult outcomes likely depend on the quality of the activities that youths participate in. Several studies highlight the developmental risks associated with participation in poor quality activities (e.g., Mahoney & Stattin, 2000; Smith & Smoll, 1997; Vandell, Shumow, & Posner, 2005) . Thus, we strongly caution against the conclusion that intensive participation in any organized activity over a period of more than 1 year, regardless of quality, should necessarily predict positive young adult outcomes.\nDespite these qualifications, the results of the present study clearly suggest that greater involvement in organized activities during high school, whether measured in terms of duration or intensity, is associated with better odds of educational, civic, and, to some extent, occupational success in young adulthood. Our findings further indicate that adolescents who score high on both temporal dimensions of participation (i.e., duration and intensity) may be particularly likely to demonstrate advantageous outcomes as young adults. Finally, our results show that, with few exceptions, the developmental implications of participation duration and intensity are similar across sponsorship categories. Although longer term, intensive participation in organized activities was associated with occupational success only among those who participated in school-sponsored activities, longer term, intensive participation in school-or community-sponsored activities was often associated with better educational and civic (particularly volunteering) outcomes. These findings provide a nuanced view of the associations between participation in organized activities and young adult development and extend prior studies that have measured participation without regard to duration, intensity, or sponsorship. The mechanisms that link participation duration and intensity to positive young adult outcomes remain poorly understood, however. We find that educational success partly explains the link between participation in organized activities and young adult civic and occupational success, but the pathways that link participation duration and intensity to educational success remain less clear. This is a critically important question for future research, and the answer may be the key to developing youth activities that prepare adolescents to meet the challenges of young adulthood."}]
