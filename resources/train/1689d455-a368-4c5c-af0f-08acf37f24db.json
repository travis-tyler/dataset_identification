[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects. These factors included the reference region selection and intensity normalization of PET images and the within-and across-subject variability of affected brain regions.

The rFTC analysis captures the within-subject similarities between baseline and follow-up regional radiotracer distributions.\nThe rFTC trajectories of 27 cognitively normal subjects were calculated to identify 1) trajectories of rFTC decline in individual cognitively normal subjects; 2) how these trajectories correlate with the subjects' cognitive test scores, baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid beta (A\u03b2), and apolipoprotein E4 (APOE-E4) status; and 3) whether similar trajectories are observed in regional/composite standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) values. Results: While some of the subjects maintained a stable rFTC trajectory, other subjects had declining and fluctuating rFTC values. We found that the rFTC decline was significantly higher in APOE-E4 carriers compared to noncarriers ( p=0.04). We also found a marginally significant association between rFTC decline and cognitive decline measured by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale -cognitive subscale (ADAS_cog) decline (0.05). In comparison to the rFTC trajectories, the composite region of interest (ROI) SUVR trajectories did not change in any of the subjects.

While baseline FDG-PET standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) of cognitively normal subjects predict their future memory decline, 5 longitudinal FDG-PET changes are difficult to detect in preclinical AD, 6 possibly due to several technical challenges associated with longitudinal FDG-PET measurements. 7 One factor is defining a good control population for preclinical AD. 8 The within-and across-subject variability of regions with abnormal metabolism poses another challenge for detecting subtle metabolic changes. While we know from previous research which particular areas become hypometabolic in AD, 3, [9] [10] [11] there are also variabilities among individual subjects regarding identifying affected regions and their progression rates. [12] [13] [14] Many FDG-PET studies use composite regions of interest (ROIs) that include all potentially affected areas. 7, 15 This approach averages subject's brain FDG-PET SUVR values from fast declining regions with less affected areas within a large ROI, thus reducing longitudinal effect sizes. 16 Unlike composite ROIs, statistical voxelwise methods include only voxels with a significant abnormal activity by comparison to a reference population. Here, the power of analysis depends on the selection of the reference population and is limited by its intersubject variability. 17 Most PET studies in clinical environments utilize semi-quantitative data analyses that require a reference region normalization to account for nonspecific radiotracer uptake. The normalization process is subject to additional variabilities due to metabolic changes in reference regions, particularly in elderly adults with a history of brain injuries or vascular diseases, [18] [19] [20] both prevalent in aging populations. There is also an emerging evidence based on FDG-PET that supports the existence of regional increase in neuronal activity as a compensatory mechanism to early AD pathology. 21 Therefore, simultaneous capture of hypermetabolism and hypometabolism may provide a more sensitive way of monitoring the disease progression at early stages.\nWe previously developed an FDG-PET analysis that overcomes the abovementioned critical barriers in longitudinal FDG-PET. Using this method, we were able to provide trajectories of metabolic changes that correlated with the subject's trajectory of cognitive tests scores 22 at mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stages. The objective of this study was to test this method, known as the regional FDG time correlation coefficient (rFTC), on cognitively normal subjects to identify 1) trajectories of rFTC decline in individual cognitively normal subjects; 2) how these trajectories correlate with the subjects' cognitive test scores, baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid beta (A\u03b2), and apolipoprotein E4 (APOE-E4) status; and 3) whether similar trajectories can be observed in regional/composite SUVR values.

Gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) masks of the T1-weighted MRI volumes were segmented in subject's native space as described previously. 22, 28 Briefly, the T1-weighted MRI volume of each subject was aligned to a reference brain with a rigid transform, and then, the deformation field between the reference brain and the globally aligned T1-weighted MRI volume was calculated with a nonrigid demon registration algorithm. 29, 30 Binary masks for 11 regions (left and right frontal lobes, posterior and anterior cingulate cortexes, occipital lobe, left and right parietal lobes, left and right temporal lobes, and mid brain) from the reference brain were warped to the ADNI subject's image volume with the nonrigid deformation field. Each brain volume was also segmented into cerebral spinal fluid, GM, and WM with fuzzy c-means (FCM), 31 and a GM mask was created for each of the 11 anatomic regions. FCM is a data clustering method that divides a dataset into c number of clusters. Every data point belongs to each cluster with a specific degree of membership. For each subject and at each time point, we first constructed a one-dimensional FDG vector from the FDG-PET image. Each element of this vector was the FDG activity from one region. For each subject, the Pearson's correlation coefficients between the subject's baseline FDG vector ( Figure 1 ) and those from the follow-up scans (top middle and right in Figure 1 ) were calculated. The size of the regions was incorporated as their weighting factor into the correlation calculation. 32 The weighted correlation coefficient of the initial vector, rFTC (t=0), was equal to 1.0 for every subject. For each subject, the rFTC(t) value at a follow-up scan was determined by the correlation between the subject's FDG vectors at baseline and the follow-up time point. The rFTC outcome of each individual was a trajectory (x-axis: time) where the value on the y-axis started with 1 at baseline and declined over time as the correlation between the subject's FDG vectors at baseline and follow-up decreased."}, {"section_title": "statistical analysis", "text": "A linear regression model (R software package, www.rproject.org) was used to determine whether the presence of APOE-E4 was associated with a faster rFTC decline. The rFTC decline was characterized by 1) difference between the rFTC values at baseline and last follow-up and 2) maximum decrease in the rFTC value during 38 months (maximum fluctuation). The same model was used to determine the impact of subject's CSF levels of A\u03b2 1-42 on the rFTC decline. A linear mixed-effects model with an autoregressive order 1 (AR(1)) structure of correlation was used to establish associations between rFTC decline and decline in MMSE and ADAS_cog test scores (increasing value in ADAS_cog interprets as decline in cognition) while properly taking into account the underlying longitudinal correlation. Age and gender were included as fixed effects in all models. A generalized linear model was used to determine whether the rFTC decline predicts either subject's conversion to MCI or overall changes in clinical symptoms (clinician's report). A variable for MCI conversion was included in this model. The value for the MCI was set to 0 if the subject did not convert to MCI, 1 when the subject had some changes in clinical symptoms but the diagnosis was not changed to MCI, and 2 when the subject's diagnosis was changed to MCI. The diagnostic summary and baseline changes were downloaded from ADNI (BLCHANGE.csv).\nFor comparison, another linear regression model was applied to regional and the composite region of interest (ROI) SUVR values to find associations between their longitudinal changes (ie, difference between the SUVR values at baseline and last follow-up) and the cognitive decline and whether baseline SUVR values or changes in SUVR (single or composite regions) predicted conversion to MCI (MCI =2) or general change in clinical diagnosis (MCI =1). For the composite SUVR values, we calculated the average SUVR activity of the same 11 regions that were used for rFTC. The regional and composite ROI activities were normalized to the mean GM cerebellar activity to obtain the associated SUVR values. Figure 2 shows the rFTC and composite ROI SUVR trajectories of all subjects. For each subject, the decline in rFTC trajectory was triggered by activity changes in any of the 11 region(s) in any direction (increase or decrease in regional activity). While some of these cognitively normal subjects maintained a stable rFTC trajectory (blue lines), others showed declining rFTC trajectories (red lines). For comparison, the same subjects' trajectories of composite ROI SUVR values did not change. The statistical analyses indicated a faster rFTC decline in APOE-E4 carriers compared to noncarriers while controlling for age effect. This association was more significant when the maximum decline was used as the outcome variable ( p=0.04) but not significant ( p=0.1) when the final decline at the last follow-up was used as the outcome variable (Figure 3 ).

The lack of significant association between rFTC and MMSE could be related to the small range of MMSE test score, making this test less sensitive to cognitive changes at preclinical stages in comparison.\nAnother interesting outcome was to find significant association between rFTC decline and the subject's APOE-E4 status.\nOne of the limitations of this study is the small sample size, which limits the interpretation of the results. Although ADNI is a large database, fewer subjects (mainly from Phase I) have multiple longitudinal follow-ups. We also took a conservative approach and disregarded subjects whose data acquisition, image reconstruction, and scatter/attenuation correction were not performed with same scanner and same methodology at all time points to reduce scanner-related variabilities in correlation decline. The results of this study indicate the potential utility of rFTC as a new biomarker of metabolism at preclinical stages of AD. The decline in the rFTC trajectory is triggered by metabolic changes in any part of the brain. Therefore, this technique can capture temporal changes without using a composite ROI. The value of the correlation coefficient accounts for both hypometabolism and hypermetabolism. In contrast to hypometabolism, very few studies have explored the role of increased neuronal activity (and increased metabolism) in early stages of AD. There is an emerging evidence based on functional MRI 33 that supports the existence of neural compensation in older adults. Recruitment of additional neural resources may allow subjects to maintain normal cognitive activity in the presence of abnormal pathological changes. By capturing correlation changes that are triggered by both increase and decrease in brain metabolism, the rFTC analysis provides a unique way of assessing the disease progression at earliest stages where the neuronal compensations are more likely prominent than in the advanced stages of the AD.\nOne of the most significant limitations of using rFTC in preventive clinical trials is the number of required FDG-PET scans. As current clinical trials are including several MRI acquisitions, A\u03b2-PET and now tau-PET, it may be challenging to incorporate multiple FDG-PET acquisitions into the study design. In addition, FDG-PET is associated with a higher radiation dose 34 than A\u03b2-PET. 35 However, the concept of longitudinal correlation measurements can be translated to other in vivo imaging techniques, such as arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI. Therefore, we believe that this methodology is significant for applications beyond FDG-PET. In addition, by eliminating the reference region normalization, the rFTC methodology could be useful in other applications/diseases where the selection of reference region is particularly challenging (eg, Parkinson's disease 36 ) for FDG-PET."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This study explores the utility of a new image analysis method, the rFTC, as a biomarker of metabolic changes in cognitively normal subjects in association with subtle changes in their cognitive status. loni.usc.edu).
