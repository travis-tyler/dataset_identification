[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In December 2019 an outbreak of severe respiratory disease was identified in Wuhan, China . Shortly later, the etiological agent of the disease was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Zhou, et al. 2020; Zhu, et al. 2020) , and the disease caused by the virus was named coronavirus disease 19 . The virus has since spread rapidly across the globe, causing a WHO-declared pandemic with social and economic devastation in many regions of the world. The infectious disease research community has quickly stepped up to the task of characterizing the virus and its replication dynamics, describing its pathogenesis, and tracking its movement through the human population. Parameterized epidemiological models have been particularly informative of how this virus has spread with and without control measures in place (e.g., Tian, et al. 2020) , and have been used to project viral spread both in the short-term (Flaxman, et al. 2020 ) and in the more distant future (Kissler, et al. 2020) .\nAlong with epidemiological analysis based on case reports and COVID-19 death data, sequencing of viral genomes has become a powerful tool in understanding and tracking the dynamics of infections (Volz, et al. 2013; Gardy and Loman 2018) . So-called \"genomic epidemiology\" allows for effective reconstruction of viral geographical spread as well as estimation of key epidemiological quantities such as the basic reproduction number of a virus, its growth rate and doubling time, and patterns of disease incidence and prevalence. Such insights have been used to inform policy makers during various pathogen outbreaks, as occurred for example in the 2014-2016 outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa (Khoury, et al. 2018; Armstrong, et al. 2019) , and during this current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (Bedford, et al. 2020; Fauver, et al. 2020 ).\nHere, we set out to sequence SARS-CoV-2 from samples across the state of Israel, with the aim of gaining a better understanding of introductions of the virus into Israel, spread of the virus inside the country, and the epidemiology of the disease, including (a) the basic reproduction number of the virus before and after social distancing measures were implemented, and (b) the extent of viral superspreading within Israel. We sought to gain this understanding within the context of existing epidemiological knowledge, including that the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Israel were reported in early-February, followed by many identified SARS-CoV-2 cases in travelers returning to Israel mainly from Europe and the United States. Growth in the number of verified cases rapidly ensued, which led to increased measures of social distancing, including the cessation of passenger flights to Israel, school closure, and eventually a near complete lockdown across the entire state of Israel. Quarantining of returning travelers from Europe was implemented between February 26 and March 4, 2020, and subsequently all incoming travel to Israel was arrested on March 9. In the meantime, the rate of testing was ramped up, eventually reaching a rate of more than 1,500 tests per million people per day. The reported daily incidence and reported numbers of daily severe cases peaked around mid-April and have dropped steadily since then. Despite this knowledge, many questions remain: Which of the multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions resulted in sustained local transmission? How did the virus spread across the state? What was the magnitude of the virus's reproduction potential within Israel, and to what extent did control measures mitigate its spread? Here, through a comprehensive set of phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses, we quantitatively address these questions."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS & DISCUSSION", "text": "In order to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread into and within Israel, we sequenced the virus from a cohort of patients representing a random sample across Israel, resulting in 212 full-genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences (Methods). A total of 224 unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were identified between the Wuhan reference sequence and this set of sequences from Israel. Figure 1 shows the distribution of identified SNVs along the genome and their counts in the sequenced samples. Of these SNVs, 141 were non-synonymous, 72 were synonymous, and the remaining 11 were in noncoding regions. One of the most abundantly detected SNVs was a non-synonymous variant D614G found in the spike protein, which was present in 90% of the sequences. This variant has generated much interest as it has been reported to potentially increase the transmissibility of the virus (Korber, et al. 2020) . Of note however, the alternative hypothesis that the observed increases in this variant's frequency is due to demographic considerations and genetic drift has not been ruled out. We also found five different high confidence genomic deletions, spanning between one and eighteen nucleotides (Fig. 2 ) (Methods), each of which was found in one to two samples. Three of these five deletions occurred in multiples of three and were in-frame deletions or affected non-coding regions. Of the remaining two deletions, deletion #3 spanned ten nucleotides, and likely prevents the translation of ORF7a. Deletion #4 occurred at the end of ORF8 and causes the replacement of the last amino acid with an additional five amino acids. Notably, an 81 nt in-frame deletion in ORF7a has been previously reported (Holland, et al. 2020) , as has been a 382 nt deletion in ORF8 (Su, et al. 2020) , suggesting that the virus is to some extent tolerant to deletions in these ORFs.\n.

Deletion #5 on the other hand was present in two related samples that were sampled five days apart from each other. Deletions #2, #3 and #4 revealed an intriguing pattern: three independent deletions (one of which was present in two samples) were all part of the same clade that included eighteen samples (Fig.  2) . One non-synonymous SNV defined this clade: S2430R in ORF1b which affects the nonstructural protein NSP16. This protein has been reported to be a 2\u02b9O-methyl-transferase that enhances evasion of the innate immune system (Menachery, et al. 2014) .\nWhile further in-depth investigation of SARS-CoV-2 indels is clearly needed, at this point we conjecture that the deletions we detected are neutral or to some extent deleterious, and that deletions in SARS-CoV-2 are likely to occur frequently given the number of deletions detected in our samples."}, {"section_title": "Origins and transmission patterns in Israel", "text": "We next set out to explore patterns of SARS-CoV-2 introduction into Israel. Figure 3 shows the time-resolved phylogeny inferred using the 214 Israeli sequences (212 sequenced here and two additional ones sequenced previously) in addition to 4,693 representative sequences from across the world. This phylogeny allowed us to characterize the major viral clades circulating within Israel and to infer the geographic sources and timing of virus introductions into the state. We found multiple introductions into Israel from both the U.S and Europe, the latter including mainly the U.K., France and Belgium. Over 70% of the clade introductions into Israel (confidence intervals ranging from ~50% to ~80%, see Methods) were inferred to have occurred from the U.S., while the remaining were mainly from Europe. During the entire epidemic in Israel, very close monitoring of all incoming infected travelers was imposed, and reports show that only ~27% of infected returning travelers were from the U.S. The discrepancy between these estimated proportions suggests that the travelers returning from the U.S. contributed substantially more to the spread of the virus in Israel than would be proportionally expected. This may have occurred due to the gap in policy that allowed returning non-European travelers to avoid quarantine until March 9, or due to different contact patterns of those who returned from the U.S. Moreover, this suggests that had flights from the U.S. been arrested at the same time that flights from Europe were arrested (between February 26 and March 4, instead of by March 9), a substantial fraction of the transmission chains in Israel would have been prevented.\n.

In Figure 6 , we show inferred patterns of prevalence (Fig. 6A ) and incidence (Fig. 6B) for three different assumed levels of viral superspreading. Inferred patterns of prevalence corroborate epidemiological findings that the number of cases started to decline in early April. Inferred patterns of cumulative incidence indicate that reporting rates were initially low, but improved considerably over the time course of viral spread. The 'leveling off' of cumulative incidence around late March/early April observed in both the reported case data and in our inferred epidemiological dynamics, ground-truthing the results of our phylodynamic analyses. .

A uniform prior was used for nucleotide frequencies. The down-sampled maximum likelihood tree generated using IQ Tree was used as a starting tree.\nPhyDyn is a coalescent-based inference approach implemented in BEAST2, allowing for the integration over phylogenetic uncertainty (Volz 2012; Volz and Siveroni 2018) . The program requires specification of an underlying epidemiological model, as well as any priors on parameters that will be estimated. In line with recent analyses (sarscov2.phylodynamics.org), we assumed that the epidemiological dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 were governed by Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) dynamics. Transmission heterogeneity has previously been described for viral pathogens including SARS-CoV-1 (Lloyd-Smith, et al. 2005 ) and appears to be important in the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 (Bi, et al. 2020; Endo, et al. 2020) . To account for the possibility of transmission heterogeneity, as in previous work (sarscov2.phylodynamics.org), we modeled two classes of infected individuals: one with low transmissibility Il and one with high transmissibility Ih. Mathematically, the epidemiological model is given by\nWe set as fixed the host population size to the population size of Israel, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (N = 8, 883, 800) , the average duration of time an individual spends in the exposed class (1/ V = 3 days), and the average duration of time an individual spends in the infected (infectious) class (1/ ' = 5.5 days). These rates are based on a study that inferred transmissibility over the course of infection based on data from established SARS-CoV-2 transmission pairs (He, et al. 2020) . R0 in this model is given by ( $ $ + J (1 \u2212 $ ))/ ' , where $ is the fraction of exposed individuals who transition to the $ class. Instead of independently parameterizing $ and J , we defined (as in previous work) the relative transmissibility of infected individuals in the Ih and Il classes by the parameter = $ / J . We defined a parameter P as the fraction of secondary infections that were caused by a fraction $ of the most transmissible infected individuals and set P to 0.8. Based on set values of P and $ , we calculated as(\n. As such, we could easily parameterize the model across various levels of transmission heterogeneity, with a fraction $ of infected individuals being responsible for 80% of secondary infections. Existing epidemiological analysis indicate that $ is on the order of 7-10% (Bi, et al. 2020; Endo, et al. 2020) indicative of even more transmission heterogeneity than given by the 20/80 rule (Woolhouse et al., PNAS, 1997) . We focused on the range of $ between 1-10% in our phylodynamic analyses.\nAgain based on existing analyses (sarscov2.phylodynamics.org), we included an external reservoir, Y, in our analysis to allow for multiple introduced clades into Israel to be jointly considered. We assume symmetric migration of individuals in the , J , and $ classes in and out of Israel based on a per capita migration rate . An exponential prior with a mean of 10 and an upper limit of 10 was used for . Based on the results of the importation analysis described above, we assumed that the migration rate decreased to 25% of its original value after March 20, 2020. As migration is assumed to be symmetrical in and out of Israel it does not affect the focal SEIR model dynamics, however, it influences the probability that a given lineage's geographic state is assigned to Israel. We fix the rate of removal of individuals from .

We set the prior on R0 to a lognormal distribution with mean log (R0) of 1.5 and standard deviation of log (R0) of 0.5. We set the prior on to be uniform between 0 and 2, thereby allowing R0 to either increase, decrease, or remain unchanged after March 19. An exponential prior with mean 1.0 was used for the initial size of the class. The J and $ were assumed to be negligibly small at the beginning of the SEIR dynamics. The PhyDyn \" parameter was set to 2019.7 and a constant population size coalescent model was used prior to this date when proposed trees had earlier root dates. SEIR dynamics were assumed to begin on February 1 st . Sequences sampled from Israel were randomly assigned to $ with probability $ and to J with probability 1 \u2212 $ . XML files to run both BEAST2 and PhyDyn were generated using a custom Python 3 script which was designed to edit a template XML file originally generated with BEAUti and manually edited. MCMC chains for each parameter set were run for at least 1.9 million steps. Convergence was assessed based on visual inspection of parameter traces. Longer MCMC chains and additional replicates are currently being conducted. The first 50% of MCMC steps were discarded as burn-in. BEAST2 log and tree files were combined using LogCombiner. Maximum clade credibility trees were generated using TreeAnnotator. BEAST2 and PhyDyn outputs were visualized using Python 3, Matplotlib (Hunter 2007) , Seaborn, and Baltic (https://github.com/evogytis/baltic).\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 22, 2020 . . https://doi.org/10.1101 Tian H, Liu Y, Li Y, Wu CH, Chen B, Kraemer MUG, Li B, Cai J, Xu B, Yang Q, et al. 2020 .

We note that existing phylodynamic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 have shown that the effective reproduction number RE of the virus has decreased over time, as quarantine and social distancing measures have been implemented within specific regions (Danesh, et al. 2020; Vaughan, et al. 2020; Volz, Baguelin, et al. 2020) . However, many of these analyses have to date modeled reductions in RE as stemming from the depletion of susceptible individuals (Volz, Baguelin, et al. 2020) , rather than from reductions in R0, the latter of which would be consistent with lowering of contact rates. Other analyses, particularly those that use the birth-death model approach for phylodynamic inference, have allowed for changes in R0 over time (Danesh, et al. 2020; Vaughan, et al. 2020 ), but cannot as easily accommodate structure in the infected host population (e.g., that some individuals are exposed but not yet infectious, and that transmission heterogeneity exists between infected individuals). Our phylodynamic analysis here, based heavily on existing coalescent-based model structures that have been applied to SARS-CoV-2 (Volz 2020), instead allows for this structure to be accommodated and for R0 to change in a piecewise fashion over time.\nOur phylodynamic analysis assumes an underlying susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model for SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and explicitly incorporates transmission heterogeneity (Methods). Recent epidemiological analyses have estimated considerable levels of SARS-CoV-2 transmission heterogeneity, with ~7-10% of infected individuals estimated to be responsible for 80% of secondary infections (Bi, et al. 2020; Endo, et al. 2020) . Instead of assuming a given level of transmission heterogeneity for Israel, we instead performed phylodynamic inference of the SEIR model across a range of transmission heterogeneities ranging from ph = 1% to 20% of infected individuals being responsible for 80% of secondary infections. We estimated \" prior to March 19 to be approximately 2.0 across this superspreading range, with estimates increasing towards R0 = 2.4 to 2.6 at extremely high levels of superspreading (ph = 1-2%) ( Figure 5A ). Across this superspreading range, we robustly estimated that quarantine measures had the effect of reducing R0 by approximately two-thirds (a = ~30%; Figure 5B ; see Table S2 for model parameter priors and estimated values). Figure 5C shows the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 cases by April 22, estimated by our phylodynamic analyses across the considered superspreading range. Estimates of the cumulative number of cases is highly sensitive to the level of assumed transmission heterogeneity, particularly at high levels of superspreading (ph = 1-5%). Comparison between these inferred cumulative cases and reported case numbers (dotted line in Figure  5C ) indicates that SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics were driven by an extremely high level of viral superspreading. Specifically, if we assume almost complete case reporting, our phylodynamic analysis indicates that between 5-9% of infections are responsible for 80% of secondary infections; with lower assumed levels of case reporting, between 1-5% of infections would be responsible for this 80% of secondary infections.\n.

The pipeline allows for consensus determination and variant calling. We considered substitutions at the consensus sequence (as compared to the reference) only if a given base was present in 80% of the aligned reads, and five or more reads aligned to the reference; bases where the majority of reads showed a substitution but that did not fulfill these two conditions were deemed uncertain. Similarly positions to which no reads were mapped were also deemed uncertain, and such positions were assigned with an \"N\". All deletions were manually verified: (a) over 98% of the reads covering the deletion site mapped to both ends of the deletion (i.e, bore evidence of the deletions), (b) the deletion was based on over 40 independent reads (on average >1,000 reads), and (c) coverage was high at both ends of the deleted region. Only sequences that spanned 90% of the reference genome were retained, leading to the removal of one sequence (Table S1) , and hence a new set of 212 Israeli sequences was generated here.
