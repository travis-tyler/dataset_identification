However, participation rates and outcomes of students in CTE differ by student sociodemographic characteristics, as documented in prior research. For example, among 1992 high school graduates, 65 percent of males who earned four or more CTE credits enrolled in a postsecondary institution by 2000, compared to 78 percent of females (Levesque et al. 2008, table 2.33). Such differences in earlier high school cohorts raise the question of whether CTE provides equitable opportunities for students from different backgrounds -particularly for students who are disadvantaged or historically underserved. To address these concerns, this study examines gaps in CTE participation rates and outcomes of CTE participants across a number of background characteristics. 1 The report identifies gaps and provides multiple measures of gaps based on student and school characteristics over time at the national level. Specifically, the study focuses on four key characteristics: sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and urbanicity of student's school locale. The data used in this report come from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002(ELS:2002 and the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09), a pair of nationally representative, longitudinal studies of high school students conducted using similar methodologies and measures, allowing for comparison over time. The analytical samples used are students who were in grade 10 in 2002 (from ELS, referred to as the ELS cohort) and students in grade 9 in 2009 (from HSLS, referred to as the HSLS cohort). Most outcomes for these two samples are compared using high school transcript data for each cohort, collected in 2004 for the ELS cohort and in 2013 for the HSLS cohort. The data for the postsecondary enrollment outcome come from slightly different sources, however. For the ELS cohort, study participants were asked in 2006 (for most participants, two years after high school completion) whether they had ever attended a postsecondary institution. For the HSLS cohort, study participants were asked in 2013 (for most, the year they completed high school) if they attended or planned to attend a postsecondary institution immediately after SECONDARY CTE: DIFFERENCES IN ACCESS, PARTICIPATION, AND OUTCOMES xix multivariate statistics take multiple characteristics (such as race/ethnicity, sex, and family SES) into account at once in estimating the relationship between each characteristic and an outcome. Specifically, the report includes regression models: logistic regression 8 for dichotomous (0/1) outcome variables and multinomial logistic regression 9 for categorical outcome variables. For more information on the statistical methods and the definitions of all statistical terms used in this report, see the section on \"Statistical Procedures and Methods\" in Appendix A. Readers are advised that the methods used in this paper cannot support rigorous causal inferences. Students who participate in CTE in high school may differ before taking their first CTE course, and differences in outcomes between CTE participants and CTE nonparticipants (or among CTE concentrators in different CTE fields) may reflect selection into CTE rather than the influence of CTE itself.

Specifically, in the ELS cohort, there was a significant difference (ranging from 8 to 80 percentage points) between the percentage of male students and female students earning a credit in all CTE fields except law and marketing (tables 10A and 10B). In the HSLS cohort, only business, finance, and information technology (IT) participation rates were not significantly different by sex (tables 11A and 11B). \u2022 Participation rates in some CTE fields were much lower for students from the highest SES quartile than from other SES quartiles. In agriculture, human services, and transportation, smaller percentages of students from the highest SES quartile participated than students from all other SES quartiles, in both cohorts (tables 10A and 10B, and tables 11A and 11B). \u2022 Participation across CTE fields of study differed by racial/ethnic composition within each cohort. In the multivariate models, Asian and Hispanic students in the HSLS cohort were about 4 and 3 percentage points less likely, respectively, to earn at least one credit in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) compared to white students (table 13C). \u2022 In both cohorts, students attending rural schools were 9-10 percentage points more likely to take at least one credit in IT compared with suburban students (tables 12B and 13B).  EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES OF STUDENTS IN 2004, 2006 \u2022 Among CTE concentrators and students with CTE access, larger percentages of females than males were academic concentrators in both cohorts (tables 14 and 15). Students were defined as academic concentrators if they completed a college-oriented academic curriculum in high school, as defined by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) for ELS:2002 (Ingels et al. 2014). 11 \u2022 The multivariate models show a difference in academic concentration for CTE explorers and concentrators between the ELS and HSLS cohorts. Specifically, net of all (controlling for) other student and school characteristics, CTE concentrators and explorers in the ELS cohort were about 6 percentage points less likely than CTE samplers to be academic concentrators. However, there was no significant difference in academic concentration by CTE participation level for the HSLS cohort (table 16). \u2022 The gap in graduation rates between high-and low-SES students favored students who were CTE concentrators in both cohorts. For example, in the HSLS cohort, the gap for CTE nonparticipants was 25 percentage points between the lowest and highest SES students, and 4 percentage points between the lowest and highest SES students for CTE concentrators (table 18). \u2022 Among some student groups, lower percentages of CTE concentrators than CTE nonparticipants ever enrolled in postsecondary education. This was the case by sex, for white students, and the highest three SES quartiles. For example, in the ELS cohort, while 95 percent of high-SES CTE nonparticipants had enrolled, 86 percent of high-SES CTE concentrators had enrolled in postsecondary education. However, this pattern did not hold for most racial/ethnic groups (table 20). \u2022 There were wide differences between CTE fields of study in the percentage of graduates who academically concentrated. For the ELS cohort, the percentage of students who were academic concentrators ranged from almost 40 percent for arts to less than 10 percent for human services (table 24). For the HSLS cohort, the percentage of students who were academic concentrators ranged from 61 percent for STEM to 11 percent for human services (table 25).

These differences, mostly related to declining participation in CTE, represent small shifts in the overall patterns of CTE participation. Broadly speaking, participation in CTE generally varied by student and school characteristics, with the most pronounced differences at the CTE field of study level. Differences between the two cohorts were small and, when significant, tended towards a decrease in gaps. However, most differences between student subgroups persisted. The most dramatic results were in the gaps in CTE participation levels, particularly in specific CTE fields of study. These gaps may have a variety of sources: individual student interest, cultural expectations, bias, or even mundane obstacles such as scheduling problems (e.g., for English language learners or academic concentrators). Addressing these gaps will require further research to understand which factors shaped them before any potentially ameliorative policies can be pursued. Also notable were the ways in which participation in certain CTE fields varied by race/ethnicity and SES. These findings highlight that selection into CTE fields of study varies greatly by student and school characteristics. In terms of the relationship between CTE participation and student outcomes, this report provides a first examination of these relationships. More research is needed to tease out the causal relationships between CTE participation and outcomes, taking the differences in selection into different CTE fields of study into account."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Well-formulated career and technical education (CTE) programs provide high-quality, coherent instruction that leads to in-demand technical skills and rewarding careers for students from all backgrounds. However, participation in CTE and concentration in specific CTE fields differ by student sociodemographic characteristics. For example, in 2004, 13 percent of Hispanic/Latino students completed a concentration in a CTE field of study, compared to 18 percent of black/African-American and 19 percent of white students (Dalton et al. 2013, table 8). Similarly, prior research on the outcomes of CTE participants appear to differ by student demographics. For example, among 1992 high school graduates, 65 percent of males who earned four or more CTE credits (across all CTE fields) enrolled in a postsecondary institution by 2000, compared to 78 percent of females (Levesque et al. 2008, table 2.33). These differential rates raise the question of whether CTE provides equitable opportunities for students from different backgrounds and particularly for students who are disadvantaged or historically underserved. Additionally, there is little understanding of differences in CTE participation across time. To address these concerns, this study identifies gaps by examining CTE participation rates and the short-term educational outcomes of CTE participants from different backgrounds. 1 The study provides multiple measures of gaps based on student and school characteristics over time at the national level. This study focuses on how CTE participation rates and outcomes for students at different levels of CTE access and participation differ according to at least four key characteristics: sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and urbanicity of school locale. Where possible, English learner status disability status are also included, which is discussed in detail below. The data used in this report come from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002(ELS:2002 and the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09), a pair of nationally representative, longitudinal studies of high school students using similar methodologies and measures, allowing for comparison over time. The research questions for this study address gaps in CTE participation, access, and outcomes. These questions emphasize the association between student background and access to CTE or benefits from CTE, in order to identify possible systematic differences SECONDARY CTE: DIFFERENCES IN ACCESS, PARTICIPATION, AND OUTCOMES 2 across student groups. It is important to identify whether students' levels of CTE coursetaking vary by their key characteristics and whether CTE coursetaking leads to similar outcomes for students from different backgrounds, as this information indicates how well CTE programs and courses serve different populations. The paper compares high school outcomes for two cohorts of students, students who were in grade 10 in 2002 (the ELS cohort) and those in grade 9 in 2009 (the HSLS cohort). Specifically, 1.

The data and methods section contains an overview of the two datasets used in this report, definitions for all the variables used, and a discussion of the analysis samples. It also discusses the statistical procedures and study limitations. More detailed information about data and methods are available in Appendix A. The results section is organized around the research questions above. That section begins with an overview of the percentage of students participating in CTE overall and concentrating in given CTE fields. After the overview, the focus turns to the student and school characteristics associated with access to CTE and participation in CTE for students by demographic group for each cohort. Then the section focuses on the short-term educational outcomes of students with varying degrees of access to and participation in CTE classes, by the four key characteristics of sex, race/ethnicity, SES, and urbanicity of school locale. Supplemental tables supporting the findings are available in Appendix B. A conclusion and implications section then summarizes the findings as well as policy and practice implications that could be drawn from them. Access to CTE is defined by whether the school or district reported providing access to CTE or CTE classes. In the ELS cohort, a student was defined as having access to CTE if he or she attended a school for which the school administrator indicated that \"vocational education\" (the terminology used on the ELS survey) courses in any CTE field of study were offered either on-site or off-site. In the HSLS cohort, access to CTE is defined by whether the school counselor reported that CTE was offered in his or her district. If CTE was offered (on-site or off-site), the student attending the school was considered to have access to CTE. With regard to participation in CTE, high school students are classified in one of four categories based on their earned credit in CTE courses. CTE courses refer to courses designed for labor market preparation in a specified occupational field, such as business or computer and information sciences. This report focuses only on these CTE courses, using information about credits earned from student transcripts to define the level of CTE participation. 2 Following Dalton et al. (2013), the four categories of CTE participation are 3 1. CTE nonparticipants (less than one CTE credit); 2. CTE samplers (one to two CTE credits in one or more fields of study); 3. CTE explorers (three or more CTE credits but no three credits in any single CTE field of study); and 4. CTE concentrators (three or more CTE credits in at least one CTE field of study). Students who were CTE samplers, CTE explorers, or CTE concentrators are all considered to be CTE participants. CTE participants (particularly CTE concentrators) may be further classified by their high school CTE field(s) of study. Each course on respondents' high school transcripts can be classified into one of the 16 CTE fields of study listed below (Bradby 2007). The shortened names and abbreviations used in this report are in parentheses: 1. Agriculture, food, and natural resources (Agriculture) Analysis sample. Two analytical samples are used in this report, one from ELS:2002 and one from HSLS:09. ELS:2002 enables projections to the nationally representative population of students who were in grade 10 in 2002 or grade 12 in 2004. The grade 10 sample is used to best identify the ways in which CTE is related to student background characteristics, coursetaking, and completion. In addition, to align with public policy interests, the analysis only includes students who attended a public school. Specifically, the ELS:2002 sample includes public school students who were in grade 10 in 2002, who responded to the firstfollow-up in 2004, and who had complete high school transcript data. HSLS:09 enables projections to the nationally representative population of students who were in grade 9 in 2009. The base-year survey, asked of students in grade 9, and first followup, asked of students in grade 11, occurred one year earlier in students' high school careers than did the equivalent ELS surveys, so the HSLS cohort does not align perfectly with the ELS cohort. The HSLS:09 2013 update includes high school outcomes that are similar to those in the ELS first follow-up. The HSLS:09 analysis sample consists of public school students who were in grade 9 in 2009, who responded to both the base-year survey in 2009 and the 2013 update, and who had complete high school transcript data in the HSLS:09 database."}, {"section_title": "HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS", "text": "This report examines CTE participation rates and educational outcomes of CTE participants from different backgrounds. The statistics shown in the figures and tables and discussed in the report are considered estimates because they are drawn from samples of students. Statistics reported include averages or means (e.g., the mean credits earned in specific CTE fields) and percentages or proportions of a group (e.g., the percentage of students who had earned at least one CTE credit in high school). The report compares means or percentages for some groups with means or percentages for other groups. The Student's t-test 4 was used to detect differences between estimates that were larger than would be expected due to sampling variation, and therefore likely represent real differences in the population. In some cases, independent, mutually exclusive groups were compared, such as when CTE concentrators were compared with CTE explorers. Other comparisons, however, were part-to-whole comparisons -for example, CTE concentrators who were employed full time compared to all students who were employed full time -in which case CTE concentrators were a part of the larger group with which they were compared. Throughout the report, wherever differences between students or a subset of students (e.g., agriculture and natural resource CTE concentrators) and a larger, over-arching category are discussed, the reader should note that the estimates for the larger group include the dependent group. 5 Unless noted otherwise, all differences reported in the text are statistically significant 6 at an alpha level 7 of 0.05. This means that the chance that differences between findings cited in the text are due to random variation among the sample is no greater than 5 percent. Readers should note that the text points out some instances when no statistically significant difference was measured. The multivariate 8 techniques take multiple characteristics (such as race/ethnicity, sex, and family SES) into account at once to estimate the relationship between each characteristic and a single outcome. This clarifies whether bivariate 9 relationships observed in descriptive statistics are independent of other characteristics or depend on another characteristic. Specifically, the report includes logistic regression 10 models with appropriate adjustments for the survey design of ELS:2002 and HSLS:09. Logistic (for dichotomous variables) and multinomial logistic regression 11 (for categorical variables) are the two dominant types of models used by researchers for noncontinuous outcomes. For ease of interpretation, the results of the logistic and multinomial logistic regression models are presented as marginal effects. A marginal effect 12 shows the average percentage point change in the predicted probability of having an education outcome associated with a one-unit change in an independent variable, after controlling for (net of) the other variables in the model. 13 The other variables are held at their average to calculate the marginal effects. While both the bivariate and multivariate methods used in this study provide important perspectives on the relationships between characteristics and outcomes, readers should note that estimates of the association between these characteristics and outcomes do not support causal inferences. Observational data, such as those obtained through cross-sectional surveys, cannot be used to determine the underlying cause of the findings presented. For more detailed information on statistical procedures and definitions of statistical terms, see Appendix A."}, {"section_title": "STUDY LIMITATIONS", "text": "This report presents results by CTE participation level and high school CTE field of study for CTE concentrators. CTE concentration, defined as having earned three or more credits in one or more CTE fields of study, does not necessarily correspond to defined curricula or programs as experienced by students or designed by schools. For example, students may have completed programs that involved taking courses across two or more CTE fields of study. The current study mitigates against this possibility by presenting results for CTE explorers, who earn at least three CTE credits but not in one particular CTE field of study. These students may have completed a concentration in a CTE field of study as defined by the school or perceived by employers. The transcripts for the ELS and HSLS cohorts were coded according to two different high school course taxonomies. In order to compare between the two data sources, the ELS:2002 transcript data were recoded to match the HSLS:09 transcript data. Thus, the number of students concentrating in CTE, the CTE fields of study, and the academic concentration indicator reported here will not match previously published reports or figures for ELS:2002. 14 For more information, see Appendix A. In the ELS and HSLS cohorts, the definitions of CTE access vary. As described above, for the ELS cohort, CTE access was based on whether the school offered CTE courses, whereas for the HSLS cohort, CTE access was based on whether the district offered CTE courses. CTE access in the two cohorts is not directly compared for this reason. Additionally, the information on access to CTE courses in ELS:2002 and HSLS:09 was derived from questions asked of school counselors and administrators. The administrators and counselors' responses to questions of CTE access may rely on their understanding of what courses or fields of study count as CTE courses, or the way their schools or districts categorize CTE courses. It may be the case that the courses that administrators and counselors consider \"CTE courses\" do not fully align with the definitions of the CTE fields of study used in this report. Results presented by CTE field of study (for CTE concentrators) are limited by small sample sizes. When outcomes for students who concentrated in a CTE field of study are broken down further (e.g., by demographic background characteristics), results often must be suppressed due to small sample sizes or flagged as unstable, as defined earlier (see Appendix A for a discussion of suppression procedures). Where suppressed data hindered the discussion of findings for CTE concentrators, some CTE participant findings were presented instead, particularly when they were similar to the suppressed results. Readers are advised that the methods used in this paper cannot support rigorous causal inferences. Students who participate in CTE in high school may differ before taking their first CTE course, and differences in outcomes between CTE participants and CTE nonparticipants (or among CTE concentrators in different CTE fields) may reflect selection into CTE rather than the influence of CTE itself. Selection into CTE may include the school characteristics, demographic, and/or academic characteristics of students. Although care is taken in this report to show the observable associations between high school CTE participation and outcomes, no statistical adjustments have been made to estimate the extent to which outcomes derive from selection into CTE. The results presented here provide the associations needed to pursue further causal investigation about high school CTE and student outcomes.

The majority of students in both the ELS and HSLS cohorts attended schools or districts that reported offering access to CTE courses, with over 90 percent of students in both cohorts having access: 92 percent of students in the ELS cohort attended schools with access to CTE, and 96 percent of students in the HSLS cohort attended schools with CTE offerings in the district (figure 1). While ELS focuses on access to CTE within schools and HSLS on access within districts, the responses in both surveys indicate most students in both cohorts had access to CTE. While most students had access to CTE through their school or district, the percentage of students taking more than one credit in CTE decreased: 65 percent of students in the ELS cohort, compared to 61 percent of students in the HSLS cohort who took at least one credit of CTE (figure 2). This decrease is reflected mostly in the decrease in the percentage of students who are CTE explorers (took three or more CTE credits but no three credits in any single CTE field of study). While the proportion of students who were CTE samplers and concentrators were similar across cohorts (42 and 18 percent, respectively), the percentage of CTE explorers fell from 24 to 20 percent between the ELS and HSLS cohorts (figure 1).  -up surveys in 2004, 2006, and 2012.

For the HSLS cohort, respondents are defined as having access to CTE if the school counselor reported that CTE was offered in their district or if students were allowed to take Career Clusters, Pathways, or Programs of Study offered at their school even if not enrolled in them. Students are also counted as having CTE access if their school offered vocational-technical courses that were not part of the formal program.

For both the ELS and HSLS cohorts, the majority of CTE concentrators took more than three CTE credits (94 and 93 percent, respectively) (table 1). While relatively small percentages of CTE concentrators had more than one CTE concentration (7 percent for both cohorts), about half of CTE concentrators in the ELS cohort and about 40 percent in the HSLS cohort had enough CTE credits to meet the definition of being CTE explorers in addition to being CTE concentrators, meaning that in addition to having a CTE concentration (at least three credits in one CTE field of study), they took another three or more CTE credits, although not in any one CTE field of study. The percentage of CTE concentrators who met both definitions decreased from the ELS cohort to the HSLS cohort. Among CTE explorers, about two-thirds from both cohorts took more than three CTE credits, and similar proportions of CTE explorers approached the \"CTE concentrator\" definition by taking two or more credits in at least one CTE field (64 percent 15 in the ELS cohort and 69 percent in the HSLS cohort).

White students made up 61 percent of the ELS cohort but 52 percent of the HSLS cohort, a drop of 9 percentage points (figure 4). Meanwhile, whereas Hispanic students comprised 16 percent of the ELS cohort, their share of the sample increased 6 percentage points to 22 percent of the HSLS cohort; the percentage of students of other races increased between the two cohorts as well. The percentage of Asian and black students remained stable. These changes reflect larger demographic trends in the population of American kindergarten through grade 12 students as well as of the United States as a whole (Aud, Fox, and KewalRamani 2010;Kena et al. 2016). The HSLS cohort also saw slightly larger percentages than the ELS cohort of students who were considered disabled or English language learners. In addition, there were shifts in the urbanicity of students' school locales between the two cohorts. The percentage of students attending schools in suburban locales declined from 52 to 46 percent from the ELS cohort to the HSLS cohort, while the percentage of students attending schools in urban and rural locales increased by 4 and 2 percentage points (respectively) between the two cohorts (table 4). The demographic shifts in the baseline populations of each cohort are important to consider while interpreting the results of this report.

When thinking about students' participation in CTE, it is important to know which students attend schools or districts where administrators report offering CTE courses because this information provides context as to which students were more likely to earn CTE credits. Meanwhile, some students who earned CTE credits did so at a school or in a district that did not report that students had access to CTE. Overall, most students in the ELS and HSLS cohorts had access to CTE courses in their school or district (92 percent in the ELS cohort and 96 percent in the HSLS cohort) (table 5 and table 6). 17 The reported access to CTE varies from CTE coursetaking for several reasons. First, the use of the later School Courses for the Exchange of Data (SCED) codes for ELS results in some courses that were not considered CTE at the time the ELS data collection were classified as CTE in this analysis. Second, schools may offer CTE courses that they do not consider to be CTE, although at a national level those courses cover material that is considered CTE.

Specifically, in the ELS cohort, there was a significant difference between the percentage of male students and female students participating in CTE for all CTE fields except law. In the HSLS cohort, only three of the CTE fields were not significantly different -business, finance, and IT. At the extremes, 82-90 percent of architecture, transportation, and manufacturing CTE participants were male in the ELS and HSLS cohorts, while 74-90 percent of human services and health science CTE participants were female in both cohorts (tables 10A and 10B and tables 11A and 11B). Of the four CTE fields that did not have statistically similar percentages of female students in both the ELS and HSLS cohorts, two switched and no longer had a statistically dominant sex (finance and IT), one became more sex segregated (education went from 66 to 86 percent female), and one CTE field switched which sex was dominant (marketing went from 55 percent female to 44 percent female). The multivariate models support these findings. In the ELS cohort, only law and marketing did not have a statistically significant difference by sex, net of the controls, while in the HSLS cohort, business, finance, and IT were not significantly different. Controlling for race/ethnicity, SES, disability status, English learner status, academic concentrator status, and school urbanicity, sex is associated with a 1 to 21 percentage point difference in the probability of taking at least one class in a CTE field by sex for students in the ELS and HSLS cohorts (tables 12A-12C and tables 13A-13C).

In contrast, overall rates of on-time graduation and postsecondary enrollment remained stable across the two cohorts. However, rates of ontime graduation and postsecondary enrollment varied according to students' levels of CTE access and participation. Compared with CTE nonparticipants, CTE concentrators were more likely to graduate on time but slightly less likely to enroll in postsecondary education (table 17, table 18, table 20, and table 22).

ELS:2002 and HSLS:09 both contain information on the post-high school plans of students in grade 12. The student background predictors and outcomes used from ELS and from HSLS are similar. However, the outcomes studied are more extensive for ELS because ELS contains data for eight years after high school graduation and HSLS only contains data through the end of high school. This appendix describes measures and procedures used for the analysis of these longer-term outcomes in ELS."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment in Postsecondary Education", "text": "With regard to the ELS cohort, in contrast to the patterns seen in the descriptive results for on-time graduation, in which generally larger percentages of CTE concentrators graduated on time than did CTE nonparticipants, the pattern in the descriptive results for ever enrolling 21 in postsecondary education reflects a different pattern among some student groups. For some groups, lower percentages of CTE concentrators ever enrolled, compared with CTE nonparticipants. This was the case across the sexes and the highest three SES quartiles: while 95 percent of high-SES CTE nonparticipants had enrolled, 86 percent of high-SES CTE concentrators had, a difference of about 10 percentage points (table 20). However, this pattern of higher enrollment among CTE nonparticipants did not hold for most racial/ethnic groups, with the exception of white students, among whom 72 percent of CTE concentrators, but 92 percent of CTE nonparticipants, ever enrolled in postsecondary education. The multivariate models reflect the pattern seen among male students, female students, white students, and the three highest SES quartiles in the descriptive statistics: even controlling for all other student and school characteristics, CTE concentrators are less likely than CTE samplers to ever enroll. Among both the CTE participant sample and the sample of all students, having a CTE concentration is associated with a 4 percent lower predicted probability of ever enrolling in postsecondary education (table 21).

The regressions on which these marginal effects are estimated are logistic regression models. e Respondents are coded as \"Don't Know\" if they were nonnative English speakers whose fluency was unknown. Respondents who were partially fluent were counted as not being fluent, while native English speakers were counted as being fluent. f A student is defined as an academic concentrator if he or she earned at least four credits in English; three credits in math with at least one higher than algebra II; three credits in science with at least one higher than biology (i.e., chemistry or physics); three credits in social studies, with at least one of those credits in U.S. or world history; and two credits in a single non-English (foreign) language. g Respondents' level of CTE participation is coded based on students' course credits using course-level transcript data coded based on the School Courses for the Exchange of Data (SCED) taxonomy. CTE nonparticipants earned less than one CTE credit. CTE samplers earned one to two CTE credits in one or more fields. CTE explorers earned three or more CTE credits but no three credits in any single CTE field. CTE concentrators earned three or more CTE credits in at least one CTE field. See Appendix A for more information on the definition of CTE participant status. h Respondents are defined as having access to CTE if they attended a school for which the school administrator indicated that courses in any CTE field of study were offered either on-site or off-site. i Unlike the categories listed for other variables, the categories for CTE field are not mutually exclusive with each other, as a student may concentrate in more than one CTE field. The reference category, \"did not concentrate in the field,\" applies to each CTE field individually. j Small concentrations includes education and training; finance; science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and law, public safety, corrections, and security. A CTE field of study was defined as \"small\" if its number of concentrators made up less than 3.1 percent of all CTE concentrators; this was the threshold at which the models were able to support marginal effects estimation. The ELS sample included no government and public administration concentrators. k Sample sizes differ from those of other regressions because a number of students in the sample are missing information on postsecondary attendance. Among CTE participants, 480 students are missing postsecondary attendance data, and among all students, 567 students are missing this information. NOTES: CTE = career and technical education; ELS = Education Longitudinal Study of 2002. ELS:2002 followed a cohort of grade 10 students starting in 2002, with follow-up surveys in 2004, 2006, and 2012. High school transcript data were collected in the fall and winter after the 2004 first follow-up. The ELS cohort sample used here is composed of grade 10 public school students in 2002 who had transcript data for all four years of high school. The ELS cohort multivariate models show that patterns of postsecondary enrollment among CTE participants reflect the patterns of postsecondary enrollment among all students in the ELS cohort. Including controls for CTE access, participation level, and field of study had little effect on the significance of the other variables in the models. For example, across all models, differences between SES quartiles in postsecondary enrollment were significant and consistent, with students from the lowest quartile 6 to 7 percentage points less likely, students from the third quartile 9 to 10 percentage points more likely, and students from the highest quartile 17 or 18 percentage points more likely than students from the second SES quartile to ever enroll, controlling for all other student and school characteristics as well as CTE access, participation level, and field of study (table 21). Unlike in ELS:2002, information on postsecondary enrollment in HSLS:09 was only available for the fall immediately after an on-time graduation date, rather than two years afterward. As a result, the two cohorts cannot be compared directly with respect to this outcome, although similarities in the results are noted. As with the ELS cohort, the percentages of HSLS students enrolling in postsecondary education do not reflect the cohort's patterns for graduating on time. Instead, the percentages of students enrolling in postsecondary education immediately after high school remained relatively similar for each student and school characteristic across levels of CTE participation and access (table 22).   Overall, accounting for CTE access, participation, and field of study did not affect the association between student and school characteristics and CTE attendance, except in one case. Specifically, while there was not a significant difference between students in the first and second SES quartiles for most of the models, in the model examining all students by access to CTE only students from the lowest SES quartile were less likely to attend postsecondary education than students from the second SES quartile. Generally, the significance and magnitude of difference were fairly stable across models, even when adding controls for CTE access, participation type, and field of study, or when separating out CTE participants. There were some significant differences by CTE field of study: specifically, compared with students who did not concentrate in each respective CTE field, CTE concentrators in architecture (9-10 percentage points), human services (13-14 percentage points), manufacturing (22-23 percentage points), and transportation (8-10 percentage points) were less likely to attend a postsecondary institution immediately after graduating from high school, net of controls. After controlling for school and student characteristics, only business CTE concentrators were more likely than students who did not concentrate in business to attend postsecondary education (by 9 percentage points).   e Respondents are defined as English learners if they were currently enrolled in a program for English language learners (ELLs), as reported by the responding parent in the parent survey. Respondents were counted as \"Don't Know\" if a parent did not know whether the child was enrolled in an ELL program. f Respondents who attended schools in towns were categorized under \"Suburban\" with respondents who attended schools in suburbs. g A student is defined as an academic concentrator if he or she earned at least four credits in English; three credits in math with at least one higher than algebra II; three credits in science with at least one higher than biology (i.e., chemistry or physics); three credits in social studies, with at least one of those credits in U.S. or world history; and two credits in a single non-English (foreign) language. h Respondents are defined as having access to CTE if the school counselor reported that CTE was offered in his or her district or if students were allowed to take Career Clusters, Pathways, or Programs of Study offered at their school even if not enrolled in them. Students are also counted as having CTE access if their school offered vocational-technical courses that were not part of the formal program. i Respondents' level of CTE participation is coded based on students' course credits using course-level transcript data coded based on the School Courses for the Exchange of Data (SCED) taxonomy. CTE nonparticipants earned less than one CTE credit. CTE samplers earned one to two CTE credits in one or more fields. CTE explorers earned three or more CTE credits but no three credits in any single CTE field. CTE concentrators earned three or more CTE credits in at least one CTE field. See Appendix A for more information on the definition of CTE participant status. j Unlike the categories listed for other variables, the categories for CTE field are not mutually exclusive with each other, as a student may concentrate in more than one CTE field. The reference category, \"did not concentrate in the field,\" applies to each CTE field individually. k Small concentrations includes education and training; finance; law, public safety, corrections, and security; and marketing. A CTE field of study was defined as \"small\" if its number of concentrators made up less than 3.1 percent of all CTE concentrators; this was the threshold at which the models were able to support marginal effects estimation. The HSLS sample included no government and public administration concentrators. l Sample sizes differ from those of other regressions because a number of students in the sample are missing information on postsecondary attendance. Among CTE participants, 688 students are missing postsecondary attendance data, and among all students, 890 students are missing this information. NOTES: CTE = career and technical education; HSLS = High School Longitudinal Study of 2009. HSLS:09 followed a cohort of grade 9 students starting in 2009, with a follow-up in 2011 and an update and high school transcript data collection in 2013.

"}, {"section_title": "Educational Outcomes by CTE Field of Study", "text": "This section focuses on the educational outcomes of students in the ELS and HSLS cohorts by CTE field of study. As noted above, there were disparities in CTE coursetaking by race/ethnicity, class, socioeconomic status, and school urbanicity. The findings discussed here are descriptive and associative results of the relationships between CTE participation and field of study on educational outcomes. These findings should be considered in the context of the varied student populations by CTE field of study. Thus the results below cannot fully account for the precise relationships between student participation in CTE, characteristics and outcomes; they provide information on the associations as observed. These outcomes would all benefit from additional research taking selection into CTE fields of study into account."}, {"section_title": "Postsecondary Enrollment", "text": "As with on-time graduation, rates of postsecondary enrollment by CTE field of study differed little between cohorts. However, enrollment varied among the CTE fields of study within each cohort. Significantly lower percentages of ELS students who concentrated in manufacturing or transportation enrolled in postsecondary education than did those in nearly all other CTE fields of study, with 34 percent of manufacturing CTE concentrators and 45 percent of transportation CTE concentrators enrolling (table 24). These patterns held even when student and school characteristics were controlled in the multivariate models. Among both ELS CTE participants and all ELS cohort students, students concentrating in manufacturing were significantly less likely than those not concentrating in manufacturing to enroll in postsecondary education, with a 30-31 percentage point gap in the average predicted probability of enrolling. Students concentrating in the CTE fields of human services and transportation were also less likely to enroll (table 21). Among the CTE fields of study of students in the HSLS cohort, the CTE fields of business, education, and finance had the largest percentages of students enrolling in postsecondary education immediately after high school (90, 94, and 99 percent, respectively), while architecture, human services, law, manufacturing, and transportation had significantly lower percentages of students doing so (44-65 percent) (table 25). These patterns held for both HSLS CTE participants and all HSLS students even when student and school characteristics were controlled in the multivariate models. As in ELS, HSLS students concentrating in manufacturing were significantly less likely than those not concentrating in the field to enroll in postsecondary education, as were students in human services, transportation, and architecture and construction, controlling for all other student and school characteristics. Students in business management and administration were more likely to enroll (table 23). For all of the educational outcome variables, there were significant differences by CTE field. Yet, the first section of the report details persistent and distinct patterns in student participation by CTE field in both cohorts. Thus, additional research is needed to contextualize to what degree the variation in educational outcomes by CTE fields are related to the CTE fields themselves or the processes by which students enroll in the different CTE fields of study.  :2002) and High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) cohorts had access to career and technical education (CTE) in their school or district. There were few differences in CTE participation level, fields of study, and outcomes between the two cohorts. These differences, mostly related to declining participation in CTE, represent small shifts in the overall patterns of CTE participation (see \"CTE Access and Participation Levels\"). The analyses focused on CTE participation and field of study by student and school characteristics -race/ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status (SES which includes parent education and family income), and urbanicity of school locale. 22 Altogether, in these analyses of student and school characteristics, there were differences in CTE participation by student and school characteristics both over time and across CTE participation levels and fields of study. Differences between the cohorts were small, although differences between student subgroups persisted. In general, male students were more likely than female students to participate in CTE courses, while students in the highest SES quartile were less likely than those in the second SES quartile to participate in CTE at almost every level of CTE participation. In addition, white students were more likely in some cases to concentrate in CTE than were other racial/ethnic groups. The most pronounced differences in CTE participation, however, were found at the CTE field of study level: the largest differences in CTE participation were seen when looking across the CTE fields of study (see \"Demographics of CTE Participation\" and \"Demographics of CTE Participants and Concentrators by CTE Field of Study\"). Both the descriptive and multivariate analyses show large sex differences in participation in many CTE fields. Participation in CTE by CTE field varied by race/ethnicity and SES for many CTE fields of study. These findings highlight that selection into CTE fields of study varies greatly by student and school characteristics. In terms of the relationship between CTE access and participation and students' educational outcomes, there were few differences in academic concentration, on-time high school graduation, and in early postsecondary attendance between the two cohorts. While there were some significant differences by CTE field of study, the methods used in this report are not able to identify the distinct causal mechanisms behind these differences. This is an area that requires additional research."}, {"section_title": "IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE", "text": "This report highlights the differences in CTE participation and academic outcomes of high school CTE students for the ELS and HSLS high school cohorts, examining HSLS students at the end of high school and ELS students two years after completing high school. Overall, the differences in CTE participation and CTE field of study are so great that other unobserved factors related to engaging with the different CTE fields likely distort any potential impact of CTE on outcomes. As discussed in the conclusion, there were small differences by student and school characteristics in predicting CTE participation generally, and large differences in predicting CTE participation by CTE field of study. Since CTE participation by CTE field of study varies dramatically across student and school characteristics, this suggests that, at the district (county or state), school, and student level, decision-making around student participation in CTE should be examined. This includes which CTE courses are offered on-and off-site, the barriers to accessing CTE courses, how information about these courses gets shared with students, and student counseling concerning CTE courses. Although this report found evidence of general access to CTE, these data do not include information about which CTE fields of study are offered at the school or district level. Thus an open question for future research, as well as for practice and policy, is about student and school-level access to CTE fields of study. For example, if students systematically have less access to courses in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field of study due to school-level differences in which schools offer these courses, this could be a part of the disparities in CTE coursetaking in this CTE field. In order to better understand the differences in coursetaking by CTE field of study, schools, districts, and states will need to examine this aspect of access to CTE. This includes analyzing school characteristics and the demographic profile of schools which do and do not offer CTE courses focusing on CTE field of study. At the school level, the process by which students enroll in CTE coursework deserves additional examination. How students enroll in CTE courses involves more than just student decision-making and includes how administrators, teachers, and counselors do or do not inform, encourage, and discuss CTE courses and opportunities with students. These processes could include subtle and/or overt differences by sex, race/ethnicity, SES, disability status, or English learner status. Part of this process involves looking at when and where CTE courses are offered to ensure that all students have access to the courses. For example, some populations (like academic concentrators or English learners) may be kept out of CTE courses in some CTE fields of study based on scheduling. Similarly, just as teachers, administrators, and counselors influence students' coursetaking decisions, parents of students may also influence students' coursetaking decisions in the extent to which they discuss and encourage certain academic or career pathways. The knowledge that parents have of certain academic or career paths may vary based on their own demographic characteristics, and these differences in parental knowledge can shape the paths that students consider for themselves. Although some educational outcomes were examined in the analyses, the issues of selection into CTE participation levels generally and CTE fields of study make these associations less useful. Practitioners and policymakers may want to consider that the academic and educational outcomes associated with CTE are not well known because of these selection effects. In investigating differences in CTE access and participation for the four key characteristics of sex, race/ethnicity, SES, and urbanicity of school locale, this report provides a national look at the landscape of CTE coursetaking. Although the findings presented are largely descriptive and associational rather than causal, they lay the groundwork for further monitoring and analysis of data on CTE programs, which will better enable CTE stakeholders to work toward closing gaps in CTE participation, particularly by CTE field. This study focuses primarily on the differences in individuals' career and technical education (CTE) participation, using students' demographic characteristics, high school experiences and coursetaking, and self-reported postsecondary education experiences drawn from survey data on two different cohorts of high school students. Analyses also provide important context about the outcomes of CTE participants by demographic group. This technical appendix provides additional detail about the sizes of the analysis samples used in this report, measures used in figures and tables, and statistical procedures used to identify statistically significant differences."}, {"section_title": "ANALYSIS SAMPLES", "text": "Two analytical samples are used in this report, one from ELS:2002 and one from HSLS:09. ELS:2002 enables projections to the nationally representative population of students who were in grade 10 in 2002 or grade 12 in 2004. Because this report focuses on high school outcomes, the 10th-grade sample is used to best identify the ways in which CTE is related to student background characteristics, coursetaking, and completion. HSLS:09 enables projections to the nationally representative population of students who were in grade 9 in 2009. The base-year survey, asked of students in grade 9, and first follow-up, asked of students in grade 11, occurred one year earlier in students' high school careers than do the equivalent ELS:2002 surveys, so the HSLS cohort does not align perfectly with the ELS cohort. The HSLS:09 2013 Update includes high school outcomes that are similar to those in the ELS:2002 first follow-up. To align with public policy interests, the analysis only includes students who attended a public school. SECONDARY The weighted student response rates for the ELS:2002 base-year and first follow-up surveys were 87.3 and 88.7 percent (Ingels et al. 2004(Ingels et al. , 2005(Ingels et al. , 2014, respectively, while the weighted response rate for the high school transcripts was 90.7 percent. The weighted student response rates for the HSLS:09 base-year survey and 2013 Update were 85.7 and 73.1 percent (Ingels et al. 2011), respectively, while the weighted response rate for the high school transcripts was 87.7 percent (Ingels et al. 2015). The unit weighted response rate for students with responses in the base-year student questionnaire, the 2013 Update, and the high school transcript collection was 64.4 percent (Ingels et al. 2015). The weights used in the analysis (described in the Statistical Procedures and Methods section below) adjust for nonresponse in each study. The ELS:2002 analysis sample consists of public school students who were in grade 10 in 2002, who responded to the first follow-up in 2004, and who had complete high school transcript data available. A total of 9,709 ELS:2002 respondents met all sample criteria.

These transcripts allow researchers to examine the high school coursetaking histories of respondents, while identifying CTE concentrators, levels of CTE participation, and academic coursetaking and performance."}, {"section_title": "Student Background Variables", "text": "In this report, student background measures are crucial for identifying differing access to and impact of CTE participation level and CTE field of study on student outcomes. The report focuses on four key student and school characteristics: sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and urbanicity of student's school locale. In addition to results for the four key characteristics, results are included throughout the report for the student characteristics of disability status and English learner status. While these characteristics were also of interest, in many cases the relatively small numbers of disabled and English language learner students in the study samples did not meet minimum sample size criteria (as described below in the \"Statistical Procedures and Methods\" section). As a result, estimates for the disabled and English language learner groups were subject to greater levels of suppression for confidentiality reasons, hindering discussion of the results for these characteristics. Thus, results for these groups are presented in the report but not discussed in detail. Sex is defined using a dichotomous, self-reported measure (F2SEX/X1SEX). For the race/ethnicity measure, respondents are divided into one of five racial or ethnic categories: Asian (non-Hispanic), Black (non-Hispanic), Hispanic, white (non-Hispanic), or Other (American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and those reporting more than one race) (F1RACE_R/X1RACE). Hispanic ethnicity may be of any race; all race categories are non-Hispanic. ELS:2002 and HSLS:09 allowed for respondents to choose more than one race, reported as \"Other\" in the tables. Because of small percentages that result in unstable estimates, results for American Indians/Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander are also included in \"Other.\" Family socioeconomic status (SES) is a composite variable created by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) using information about parental education and family income (F1SES2QR/X1SES and X2SES). In ELS:2002, a variable dividing the continuous measure of SES into quartiles is available on the data file, with categories for the lowest 25 percent, lower middle 26-50 percent, upper middle 51-75 percent, and highest 25 percent. In HSLS:09, a standardized continuous SES variable was weighted and divided into quartiles for consistency with ELS:2002. Disability status is identified by the conjunction of several measures: reported individualized education plan (IEP) status, accommodations on the assessments, and special education services. A student that meets any of these requirements is classified as having a disability. The first measure is whether the student had an IEP in the base year, as identified by the school (BYIEPTYP/X1IEPFLAG). The second measure is whether the student had a special test or questionnaire accommodations as part of either the base-year (BYACCTYP/X1MACC) or first follow-up assessment/survey (F1ACCTYP/X2MACC). The third measure, which is used in the HSLS cohort only, is whether the student was reported by his or her parent to be receiving special education services at the time of the base-year interview in 2009 (P1SPECIALED). English learner status is measured using different variables for the ELS and HSLS cohorts due to differences in data availability. In both surveys, the variable is coded as dichotomous, with a \"Don't Know\" category. For students in the ELS cohort, the variable categories are SECONDARY based on English fluency in grade 10 (BYSTLNG2). If the student reported that they were not fluent or partially fluent, they are coded in the analysis variable as \"Not Fluent.\" If they reported that they were fluent or a native English speaker, they are coded in the analysis variable as \"Fluent.\" If the student was a non-native English speaker whose fluency was unknown, they were coded as \"Don't Know.\" For the HSLS cohort, English learner status is based on parent survey questions about whether the student was ever or was currently in an English language learner (ELL) program (P1ELLEVER & P1ELLNOW). If the student had never been in an ELL program or had been but were not currently enrolled in one, the student is coded in the analysis variable as \"Not Currently English Language Learner.\" If the student had ever been in an ELL program and was currently enrolled in one, the student is coded in the analysis variable as \"Currently English Language Learner.\" The \"Don't Know\" category included students whose parents did not know if they had ever been or were currently enrolled in an ELL program. The urbanicity of the school's locale (BYURBAN/X1LOCALE & X2LOCALE) includes three categories: urban, suburban, and rural. In the HSLS cohort, students who attended schools in towns are categorized with those who attended schools in suburbs."}, {"section_title": "CTE Access, Participation, and Field of Study", "text": "To determine whether students have access to CTE courses and/or CTE fields of study, the analysis uses questions from the ELS:2002 base-year school administrator interview (BYA16 and BYA17A-R) and the HSLS:09 base-year school counselor interview (C1CTE, C1CLUSTER, C1INDVCRS, and C1VOCTECH). In the ELS cohort, a student was defined as having access to CTE if he or she attended a school for which the school administrator indicated that courses in any CTE field of study were offered either on-site or off-site. For the HSLS cohort, access to CTE is determined in part by whether the school counselor reported that CTE was offered in his or her district. If CTE was offered either on-site or off-site, the student attending the school is considered to have access to CTE. In addition, students are counted as having CTE access if Career Clusters, Pathways, or Programs of Study were offered at their school and if they were allowed to take individual courses in those programs even if not enrolled in them. Finally, students are also counted as having CTE access if their school offered vocational-technical courses that were not part of the formal program. Because the CTE access variable is based on administrator reports and CTE participation is based on transcripts, it is possible that students who do not have official access to CTE may have taken CTE courses. The transcript-based CTE participation and field of study variables (as well as the academic concentrator variable discussed below) were coded using School Courses for the Exchange of Data (SCED) codes (Bradby et al. 2007). Utilizing SCED codes allowed for comparisons between the ELS:2002 and HSLS:09 datasets because the definitions used were the same for each dataset. The SCED definitions are slightly different than the Classification of Secondary School Courses (CSSC) codes definitions natively coded into ELS:2002. Using NCESprovided crosswalks and files, the ELS:2002 data were recoded according to the newer SCED codes to ensure consistency across the ELS and HSLS cohorts. SCED codes were used because there is no such crosswalk or support for recoding HSLS:09 to CSSC. While the SCED codes are advantageous because they provide a consistent set of definitions and allow for comparison between ELS:2002 and HSLS:09, there are some limitations to the SCED-coded ELS:2002 data. The first limitation is that the categories and counts in this report will not align with previously published reports and figures. Second, there was a shift in what was considered a CTE course between CSSC and SCED, thus some courses that were CTE in 2004 are not counted as CTE in SCED, and some courses that were not CTE in 2004 were counted as CTE in this report. This shift will result in less alignment between CTE access and coursetaking. Additionally, some ELS cohort students who took CTE may not be considered CTE participants, samplers, or concentrators in this report due to the new coding. Course-level SCED-coded transcript data are used to determine the degree to which students took CTE courses. High school students are classified according to their overall CTE participation level based on credits in CTE fields (Dalton et al. 2013): 1 1. CTE nonparticipants (less than one CTE credit) 2. CTE samplers (one to two CTE credits in one or more CTE fields of study) 3. CTE explorers (three or more CTE credits but no three credits in any single CTE field of study) 4. CTE concentrators (three or more CTE credits in at least one CTE field of study) CTE concentrators are further classified by their high school CTE field of study. Each course on respondents' high school transcripts was classified into the 16 CTE fields of study listed below. These categories are not mutually exclusive; a course may be counted in two different CTE fields. The SCED taxonomy used in this report follows: "}, {"section_title": "Transportation", "text": "A list of definitions for each of the 16 CTE fields is provided at the end of Appendix A.

Academic concentration describes the extent to which graduates completed a collegeoriented academic curriculum in high school, as defined by NCES for ELS:2002. A graduate is deemed to be an academic concentrator if he or she earned at least four credits in English; three credits in math with at least one higher than algebra II; three credits in science with at least one higher than biology (i.e., chemistry or physics); three credits in social studies, with at least one of those credits in U.S. or world history; and two credits in a single non-English (foreign) language. Because the ELS:2002 academic concentration variable was originally coded using CSSC definitions, a new version of the academic concentration variable was created using transcript data to align the ELS:2002 variable with the SCED definitions used in HSLS:09. In HSLS:09, the variable X3TACADTRCK was used. The postsecondary educational outcome focuses on whether an individual enrolled in a postsecondary institution. In the ELS cohort, the measure is of whether the student ever attended a postsecondary institution since high school (F2EVRATT); in the HSLS cohort, the measure is of whether the student attended a postsecondary institution as of the fall immediately after high school (November 2013) (X3CLASSES)."}, {"section_title": "Imputation", "text": "In both surveys, some key analytical variables were imputed by NCES.

The analyses take into account the complex survey designs of both studies to generate standard errors. To achieve this, all results are weighted to adjust standard errors for the complex survey designs of ELS:2002 and HSLS:09. Descriptive results are weighted using balanced repeated replication (BRR) weights. For the ELS cohort, results are weighted by the high school transcript weight F1TSCWT and utilize BRR weights F1TRS1 through F1TRS200. 2 The sample was subset using the grade 10 cohort flag (G10COHRT=1) to allow projection to the population of spring 2002 sophomores.

The results provide a national comparison of the aforementioned indicators by student and school characteristics in order to highlight differences in CTE concentrators' outcomes, in addition to comparing CTE concentrators' outcomes to those of CTE nonconcentrators. All comparisons cited in the report have been tested for statistical significance. Differences between means (or percentages) were tested using Student's t statistic at the p<.05 level of significance. The Student's t-test allows analysts to determine whether two estimates are different. It is recommended for testing differences between estimates generated from large samples, for example, ELS:2002 or HSLS:09. Adjustments are not made for multiple comparisons. Differences between estimates were tested against the probability of a Type I error 4 or significance level. The statistical significance of each comparison was determined by calculating the t value for the difference between each pair of means or proportions and comparing the t value with published tables of significance levels for two-tailed hypothesis testing. Student's t values were computed to test differences between independent estimates using the following formula: The weighting command specified in Stata to weight the HSLS descriptive outcomes was \"svyset [pweight=W3W1STUTR], brrweight(W3W1STUTR001-W3W1STUTR200) vce(brr) mse.\" 4 See the \"Statistical Definitions\" section of Appendix A for the definition of \"Type I error.\" where \u0305 1 and \u0305 2 are the estimates to be compared, and se1 and se2 are their corresponding standard errors. When making part-to-whole comparisons, for example, comparing the percentage of CTE concentrators who were employed full time to all students who were employed full time, the following formula was used. This formula takes the covariance of the two estimates into account when computing the t value: There are hazards in reporting statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading because the magnitude of the t statistic is related to the observed differences in the estimates and the number of respondents in the categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of respondents would produce a large (and thus possibly statistically significant) t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests is the possibility that one can report a false positive or Type I error. Statistical tests are designed to limit the risk of this type of error using a value denoted by \u03b1 (alpha), which defines the level of confidence that a finding is statistically significant by chance. In a single, two-tailed test of statistical significance, an alpha level of 0.05 is commonly chosen, representing a confidence level of 95 percent. Values in the tables that do not meet minimum sample size criteria are suppressed in the tables and designated with a special symbol ( \u2021). Values whose estimates are unstable are flagged with exclamation marks. For percentages, estimates are defined as unstable if the standard error is 5 or more (meaning that the true value lies in a range of about +/-20 percentage points, based on an alpha level of 0.05); for means, estimates are defined as unstable if the standard error of the mean is one-third or more as large as the estimate."}, {"section_title": "Multivariate Methods", "text": "The multivariate techniques take multiple characteristics (such as race/ethnicity, sex, and family SES) into account at once.

Logistic regression is a technique used in cases in which the outcome variable is dichotomous, such as whether or not a student had graduated on time, whereas MNL regression is used in cases in which the outcome had more than two categories, such as students' level of CTE participation. In both cases, the outcomes are observed as discrete (nonlinear) categories. While the outcomes are observed as discrete categories, the models assume that there is an underlying or latent distribution even though only discrete categories are observed, or y* . 5 These latent distributions are linearly related to the outcome, as expressed in the following formula: * = + Where: =is a vector of values for the ith observation =is a vector of parameters =unexplained error term * =the latent variable y* linked to the observed variable by the following equation Where: =the cut point needed to be observed in a discrete category 5 There are several different ways to describe and discuss logit and multinomial logit models.

Small sample sizes refer to CTE fields of study where there were not enough CTE concentrators to run a stable model. To enable estimation, the small CTE fields of study were grouped together in an aggregate \"small concentrations\" category in the marginal effects models. A CTE field of study was considered \"small\" if the number of CTE concentrators in that CTE field of study made up 3.1 percent or less of all CTE concentrators; this percentage was the threshold at which CTE fields of study were grouped such that logistic regression models were able to be estimated. In the ELS cohort, the small concentrations are education and training, finance, law, and STEM. In the HSLS cohort, they are education, finance, marketing, and law. Perfect prediction occurs when one or more categories of an independent variable includes all observations in a category of the dependent variable; that is, when one explanatory variable does not vary in the dependent variable (Long and Freese 2006). Logistic regression cannot be estimated when outcomes are perfectly predicted due to the use of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in logistic regression. (For more information on MLE, see  Simply described, when there is perfect prediction, it is not possible to model the association between the independent and dependent variables for the perfectly predicted group in a logistic regression equation. As a result, several models were unable to include all cohort members in the logistic models. In order to estimate models in the cases of perfect prediction, the subgroup that was perfectly predicted was removed from the model, or the variable with perfect prediction was removed; this change is noted in the table footnotes in the few cases where it occurred. In tables B-5B and B-7B, Asian students were dropped from the human services model in the ELS cohort and from the manufacturing model in the HSLS cohort because Asian students' CTE concentration status was perfectly predicted (as CTE nonconcentrators) in those CTE fields.

A binary version of this variable describes whether the student ever earned a postsecondary degree.

OLS was used because this outcome is a continuous variable. In general, OLS is a statistical method that attempts to find a linear function that most closely approximates the observed data by minimizing the sum of the squares of the deviations between observed and expected values. In other words, this method tries to find a \"best-fit\" line through a set of observed data points by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed data values and the predicted data values based on the linear approximation. An OLS model may be written as follows: where y represents an outcome variable of interest; xi is the i th independent or predicted variable (i=1, 2, \u2026, n) included in the model; the intercept, , represents the estimated value of y when all values of the independent variables (x1, x2, \u2026, xn) are zero; the regression coefficient, , indicates the average change in the predicted value of y that is associated with a one-unit change in xi while keeping all other independent variables constant in the model; and the error term, , assumed to follow a normal distribution and be statically independent (i.e., uncorrelated to each other), have a homogeneous variance and an expected value of zero (Cohen and Cohen 1983).

The primary association between CTE and educational and labor market outcomes is related to who participated in CTE, and these differences in outcomes by CTE status should be viewed with this moderator in mind. While there were some descriptive associations between CTE participation and educational and labor market outcomes, there were few multivariate associations. CTE participation was \u03b5 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 not associated with race/ethnicity, sex and SES gaps in the level of postsecondary institution attended, remedial coursetaking, earning a postsecondary credential, or educational attainment (Tables C-1A through C-4C). Descriptively, larger proportions of CTE concentrators who were Hispanic (18 percent) earned associate degrees compared with all other CTE concentrators (5-10 percent) and compared with all Hispanic students (10 percent). Additionally, larger proportions of CTE concentrators who were black (19 percent) earned certificates compared with all other CTE concentrators (6-13 percent), and compared with all black students (14 percent). Twentyseven percent of CTE concentrators from the first SES quartile ended their education with their high school diploma. About one-quarter (26 percent) of female CTE concentrators earned bachelor's and advanced degrees (9 percent), while 20 percent and 3 percent, respectively, of male CTE concentrators earned bachelor's or advanced degrees. Without controlling for CTE field of study, CTE concentrators are less likely than CTE participants overall, who have taken at least one CTE credit, to have ever attended a postsecondary institution than CTE nonconcentrators. After controlling for CTE field of study, there is no significant difference between the likelihood of enrollment for CTE concentrators and CTE participants. While for all students rural students were less likely to immediately attend a postsecondary institution compared to suburban students, there was no significant difference in the model with only CTE participants.                                                     a For the ELS cohort, respondents are defined as having access to CTE if they attended a school for which the school administrator indicated that courses in any CTE field of study were offered either on site or off site.

Estimates for figure 11: Among Hispanic students in the ELS and HSLS cohorts, percentage who had graduated from high school on time, by CTE participation level a Respondents' level of CTE participation is coded based on students' course credits using course-level transcript data coded based on the School Courses for the Exchange of Data (SCED) taxonomy. CTE nonparticipants earned less than one CTE credit. CTE samplers earned one to two CTE credits in one or more fields. CTE explorers earned three or more CTE credits but no three credits in any single CTE field. CTE concentrators earned three or more CTE credits in at least one CTE field. See Appendix A for more information on the definition of CTE participant status. NOTE: CTE = career and technical education; ELS = Education Longitudinal Study of 2002; HSLS = High School Longitudinal Study of 2009. Hispanic includes Latino. ELS:2002 followed a cohort of grade 10 students starting in 2002, with follow-up surveys in 2004, 2006, and 2012. High school transcript data were collected in the fall and winter after the 2004 first follow-up. The ELS cohort sample used here is composed of grade 10 public school students in 2002 who had transcript data for all four years of high school. HSLS:09 followed a cohort of grade 9 students starting in 2009, with a follow-up in 2011 and an update and high school transcript data collection in 2013. The HSLS cohort sample used here is composed of grade 9 public school students in 2009 who responded to the base-year and 2013 Update surveys and had transcript data for all four years of high school. ELS cohort respondents are counted as having graduated on time if they received a high school diploma between fall 2003 and summer 2004, and HSLS cohort respondents are counted as having graduated on time if they received a high school diploma between fall 2012 and summer 2013.  Table E-12. Estimates for figure 12: Among ELS and HSLS cohort students who had earned at least one CTE credit or who had concentrated in a CTE field, percentage who were academic concentrators, by selected CTE field a Respondents' level of CTE participation is coded based on students' course credits using course-level transcript data coded based on the School Courses for the Exchange of Data (SCED) taxonomy. CTE concentrators earned three or more CTE credits in at least one CTE field. See Appendix A for more information on the definition of CTE participant status. b CTE fields of study are coded based on categories in the School Courses for the Exchange of Data (SCED) taxonomy (http://nces.ed.gov/forum/SCED.asp). Each course on respondents' high school transcripts was classified into these 16 CTE fields of study. These categories are not mutually exclusive; a course may be counted in two different CTE fields.
