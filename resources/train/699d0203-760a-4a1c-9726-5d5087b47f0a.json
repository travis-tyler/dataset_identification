Despite their increasing numbers, there is still much we do not know about their cognitive development, particularly the social and academic factors influencing that development. This report presents findings from an analysis of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K). These analyses examine the academic skills of language-minority (LM) children across two dimensions: as they enter kindergarten (initial status) and as they progress through the end of first grade (academic growth). Both socioeconomic and sociocultural perspectives have traditionally guided research into the links between language status and student achievement (Rumberger & Larson, 1998). This paper draws from both traditions, recognizing that each dimension may play a role in initial academic achievement and subsequent cognitive growth. The primary goal of this report is to clarify the extent to which language status influences student learning directly or is simply a proxy for other socio-demographic characteristics associated with both language status and academic ability."}, {"section_title": "The Challenge of Classification", "text": "Educational classifications provide schools a way to organize students and provide services. Students are described using a primary characteristic, and then interventions are developed that are assumed to be oriented toward that characteristic. The recent history of American schooling is replete with examples. In special education alone, 13 categories are used to describe various disabilities; talented and gifted programs are based on a classification; economic background identifies Title I children; and language-minority students are organized by degree of English proficiency. The logic of this approach has roots in aptitude-treatment interactions (Snow, 1977) and permeates much of our educational decision-making. Students are classified on the basis of defining characteristics (a priori aptitude, proficiency, or some other characteristic) and then a treatment is prescribed that is viewed as uniquely suited to that group of students. Thus, the term \"interaction\": the treatment is designed only for that group and viewed as inert for students without the defining aptitude, proficiency, or characteristic. Indeed, most educational labels describe student characteristics in an effort to prescribe treatment. For language-minority children, this approach has considerable appeal, but little empirical validation. Recently, increasing resistance to this logic has become noticeable. In fact, one of the most vexing problems in education has been organizing students into groups to reflect specific aptitudes, proficiencies, or characteristics that are useful for developing potentially effective programs. Special education has a 30-year history of attempts to resolve this problem (see Research Report 100 from the Institute for Research on Learning Disabilities: Ysseldyke et al., 1982). Similar problems may be developing in research on language status, as LM children vary socially and academically, and functional treatment classifications are elusive. In general, research on LM children can be characterized as inadequately accounting for the myriad differences beyond language status between LM and non-LM children (Willig, 1985). This paper focuses on language classification more broadly by also considering children's socio-demographic backgrounds. It also moves beyond \"snapshot\" portraits of LM children by employing longitudinal growth modeling to better understand the relationship between student characteristics and cognitive growth."}, {"section_title": "Language Status and Student Demographics", "text": "Policymakers and researchers often mistakenly view language status as the \"cause\" of low achievement, rather than as a correlate with other socio-demographic characteristics that are themselves related to achievement (see Macias, 1993). However, sparse research describes this population with reference to these characteristics and their relationship to academic growth over time. Moreover, LM children are themselves a diverse group, differing widely in terms of socioeconomic background and the educational and familial contexts in which they develop cognitively. For example, the parents of Hispanic immigrant children tend to have less education than those of European or Asian immigrant children (McArthur, 1993). Indeed, \"we do English language learners [ELLs] a disservice if we think of them as one-dimensional on the basis of their limited English proficiency. ELLs have diverse backgrounds, languages, and education profiles\u2026Many come from middleclass families with high levels of literacy; others live in poverty without books in their homes\" (Short & Echevarria, 2005, p. 9-10). Considering the vast amount of variability that exists among native English speakers, these differences among language-minority children should come as no surprise. The potential influences of this socio-demographic variability on children's development are many. For example, lower socioeconomic status (SES) immigrant children are more likely to live in ethnically homogenous neighborhoods, while higher-SES immigrants-who are socially and geographically more mobile-are more likely to live in heterogeneous communities where English is required in daily life (Portes & Rumbaut, 1990). Although all immigrant children face a certain period of adjustment, some children adapt to U.S. social and educational contexts faster than others (see Rumbaut, 1995). Positive social networks play an important role in these socio-cultural transitions, and access to such networks is often associated with familial socioeconomic resources (Stanton-Salazar, 2001). One source of socioeconomic variability among immigrant families are the vastly disparate circumstances under which families immigrate to the United States. Some immigrant families bring considerable social, human, and economic capital to this country, while many others come with few resources. Lee's (1996) work on Asian-American youth and the \"model minority\" stereotype highlights the considerable social chasm that often separates Asian youth whose parents immigrated to the U.S. for high-skill jobs (often with advanced academic training) and Asian families who came from war-torn nations in Southeast Asia during the 1970s and early 1980s. In addition to socioeconomic differences, families who arrive in the U.S. with the aim of improved economic conditions-immigration to obtain a positive-may bring a different outlook than families who arrive out of political necessity-immigration to flee a negative (e.g., war-related violence; see Ogbu, 1978). Clearly, it is difficult to group or classify students homogeneously, whether in reference to their language status or other personal characteristics. Another approach that is more viable is to evaluate learning as a function of personal characteristics and initial performance with outcomes measured longitudinally. Rather than simply comparing LM and non-LM children, a more functional approach is to consider other personal characteristics (e.g. race/ethnicity, SES) while conceptualizing learning as a process composed of both initial performance and change over time (see Greene, 1997;Slavin & Cheung, 2003;Willig, 1985)."}, {"section_title": "Data The ECLS-K Data", "text": "This study uses data drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). These data are ideal for studying the relationship between language status and young children's learning, particularly with the statistical methods employed here. The ECLS-K base-year (1998) data collection had a stratified design structure. The primary sampling units were geographic areas consisting of counties or groups of counties from which about 1,000 public and private schools offering kindergarten programs were selected. A target sample of about 24 children was then drawn from within each school. ECLS-K collected data on the same children in the fall and spring of kindergarten, the fall and spring of first grade (with a random sub-sample in the fall), and in the spring of third and fifth grades. Achievement data were collected at each wave through adaptive, individually-administered, un-timed, cognitive tests. Data were also collected from parents through structured telephone interviews, and from each child's teacher and school through written surveys. This paper focuses on the reading and mathematics assessments and data from the first four waves-the beginning of kindergarten through the end of first grade."}, {"section_title": "Measuring Language Status", "text": "Central to any examination of language-minority children is the conceptualization of \"language-minority\" itself. How should researchers operationalize language status? One could take a circular approach by defining LM children as those having limited English skills. Among the many problems with this solution is that some children whose first language is English also have limited literacy skills. Moreover, other children are perfectly fluent  (NCES, 2002). ECLS-K refers to this assessment as the Oral Language Development Scale (OLDS), which measured children's \"listening comprehension, vocabulary, and ability to understand and produce language\" (NCES, 2001, p. 2-3). Children scoring 37 or above (out of a possible 60) on the OLDS were labeled \"English proficient.\" Roughly half (50.3%) of children who were administered the OLDS passed and subsequently completed the full literacy and mathematics cognitive assessments. This report considers such children \"languageminority/proficient\" (LM/P). Language-minority children who did not pass the OLDS were labeled \"language-minority/non-proficient\" (LM/NP). Non-Spanishspeaking LM/NP did not participate in the cognitive assessments. However, Spanish-speaking LM/NP children were given a Spanish version of the mathematics assessment. As such, analyses of literacy learning in this paper include only non-LM and LM/P children, while the mathematics analyses include non-LM, LM/P and Spanish-speaking LM/NP children. Of the 1,347 children who did not pass the OLDS at the start of kindergarten, virtually all were retested in the spring. Of these, roughly one-third (37.1%) passed it the second time, and were administered the full set of cognitive assessments. This report considers such children to be English proficient (LM/P). In order to capture the unique intersections of race/ethnicity and language status, the analyses further distinguish among Hispanic LM/P, Hispanic LM/NP, Asian LM/P, and Other race/ethnicity LM/P children."}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Findings", "text": "Academic Skills. But more substantive explanations may exist as well. In addition to language status, Hispanic LM/P and LM/NP children may differ socio-demographically from other children. In this sense, language-minority status may simply be a proxy or an indicator of other factors that are themselves related to cognitive ability and cognitive growth. The remainder of this report seeks to untangle these unique associations between language status, academic performance, and other child characteristics that correlate with academic development. Nativity, citizenship, and home language patterns. LM children are less likely than non-LM children to have been born in the U.S. or to be U.S. citizens, although the differences are less than one might expect. Virtually all non-LM children were born in the U.S. or are U.S. citizens. Hispanic LM/NP children are the least likely to have been born in the U.S. or to be U.S. citizens (83.8% and 84.9%, respectively). By definition, language patterns also differ between homes in which English is and is not the primary language. However, home language patterns also vary among LM children. Between one-third and one-half of LM/P children have a parent who regularly speaks English to them, compared to only 12.5% of Hispanic LM/NP children. Between one-half and two-thirds of LM/P children regularly speak English to at least one parent, while only 13.6% of Hispanic LM/NP children do so."}, {"section_title": "Socio-Demographic Background", "text": "Across the three LM/P groups, LM/P children are more likely to speak English to a parent than to have a parent reply in English. This would suggest that on average, LM/P children have greater English facility than their parents (although again, this pattern varies across LM/P groups). Conversely, Hispanic LM/NP children and their parents appear to be equally non-fluent. For Hispanic LM/NP children, these lower levels of parental English fluency-combined with reduced familial human and financial capital-may serve as additional challenges to achieving at levels comparable to their non-LM and even LM/P peers. "}, {"section_title": "Multivariate Findings", "text": "The statistical analyses in this section focus on two primary issues. First, the models estimate entering academic differences between LM and non-LM children and then determine the extent to which these disparities are related to children's socioeconomic rather than linguistic backgrounds. Second, the models go beyond simple cross-sectional approaches to explore the learning rates of LM and non-LM children from the beginning of kindergarten through the end of first grade. Explorations of cognitive growth rather than cognitive status offer a more powerful view of children's intellectual experiences in school. For three reasons, the analytic results presented in this section differ slightly from the descriptive results presented above. First, the relationships discussed above are across all children, regardless of the school attended. These multivariate analyses, however, provide within-school estimates that compare the average academic performances of LM and non-LM children within the same school. Second, the descriptive statistics in Tables 1 and 2 compared LM to non-LM children of all races and ethnicities. Here, in order to identify the unique associations between language status and race/ethnicity, the comparison group is White, non-LM children. As such, the LM/non-LM differences tend to be somewhat smaller. Third, on average, the cognitive assessments were administered between one and two months after school started and before school ended. The scores presented in Table 1 thus represent only a portion of the learning that actually occured during the school year. The estimates here, however, more accurately capture learning from the very beginning of the school year to the very end. Initial status: literacy. As the descriptive statistics suggested, LM and non-LM children differ across many dimensions other than language status. Moreover, LM children are themselves a diverse group. Model 1 in Table 3 presents the unadjusted literacy gaps separating Hispanic LM/P, Asian LM/P and Other LM/P children from non-LM children as they enter kindergarten. The intercept in Model 1 (20.28 points) is the predicted entering score for a White, non-LM child. The presence of the Hispanic*LM/P and Asian*LM/P interaction terms requires careful interpretation of each predictor. The Asian and Hispanic coefficients are the effects for non-LM Asian and Hispanic children respectively, while the Black and Other Race/Ethnicity coefficients represent effects controlling for LM status. Note that the LM/P first order term, which is the LM/P effect only for the smaller number of White, Black, and Other-Race/Ethnicity LM/P children, is non-significant. The focus is therefore on the LM/P effect for Asian and Hispanic children. once SES is taken into account, the gap between Hispanic non-LM and Hispanic LM/P children is eliminated; the Hispanic*LM/P interaction term is no longer statistically significant. Thus, the entering literacy gap between Hispanic non-LM and Hispanic LM/P children is an artifact of socioeconomic difference, not language status, per se. However, the gap between Asian non-LM and Asian LM/P children is reduced only slightly once SES is taken into account (from -4.73 to -4.40). This is unsurprising, as the SES gap separating Asian non-LM and LM/P children is much smaller than that between Hispanic non-LM and LM/P children. Model 3 takes into account additional child characteristics, including gender, whether the child was repeating kindergarten, age, and single-parent status. Incorporating these measures into the model does not substantially alter the effects for Hispanic and Asian LM/P children. Children's place of birth and citizenship status, the extent to which parents and children spoke English to one another, and the number of siblings were non-significant predictors of either initial status or growth in either literacy or mathematics. To increase model parsimony, subsequent models do not include these predictors. Initial status: mathematics. In two respects, the mathematics models presented in Table 4 differ from the literacy models in Table 3. First, the mathematics models now include Hispanic LM/NP children, who completed a Spanish version of the mathematics assessment. Second, the math models do not include Asian*LM/P interaction terms, as no entering mathematics differences were detected between Asian non-LM and LM/P children (see Table 1). The intercept in Model 1 (18.29) is the predicted entering math score for the average White, non-LM child. Mirroring the descriptive information in Table 1,  Literacy learning trajectories. Table 5 presents growth curve estimates of children's literacy learning in kindergarten, summer, and first grade. All coefficients are in a \"points per month\" metric. The intercept for kindergarten literacy learning in Model 1 suggests that on average, White, non-LM children gain 1.67 points per month (p < .05). Asian LM/P children tend to experience some \"catch-up\" in literacy during kindergarten, gaining 0.42 points more per more than Asian non-LM children. However, Hispanic LM/P, Other LM/P and non-LM children learn at the same rates during kindergarten. Importantly, this suggests that the initial gap separating Hispanic LM/P and non-LM children remains constant throughout kindergarten. This estimate closely mirrors the descriptive findings from Table 1. In Model 2, which accounts for the additional child-level covariates, these learning rates remain parallel, while the Asian LM/P advantage is sustained. Unsurprisingly, children gain fewer literacy skills during the summer months when they are not in school. As the first summer learning model suggests, the average White, non-LM child gains 0.15 points per month (p < .05) compared to the much larger 1.67 points-per-month learning rate during kindergarten. However, unlike kindergarten, during the summer months Hispanic LM/P children gain almost two points less per month than Hispanic non-LM children (p < .05), thus widening the achievement gap. During the school year, literacy development among Hispanic LM/P children is likely supported, but during the summer months, when they are less likely to experience English-speaking contexts, their learning rates are lower than those of their Hispanic non-LM peers. As with kindergarten, first-grade children gain literacy skills quickly (an average of 2.60 points per month; p < .05). Importantly, non-LM and LM/P children gain skills at comparable rates during first grade. For Hispanic LM/P children, this can be interpreted as a \"glass is half full\" or \"glass is half empty\" finding. Although it is welcome news that the initial Hispanic LM/P literacy achievement gap does not widen during kindergarten and first grade, it does not narrow either.  Table 3). Kindergarten repeaters gain 0.20 points less each month during both kindergarten and first grade (p < .05). This finding supports extant research suggesting that kindergarten retention is an ineffective remediation strategy. Also supporting existing research, these models suggest that children receiving full-day kindergarten gain roughly one-quarter point more per month than those attending half-day kindergarten, although their full-day peers make up considerable ground during first grade (p < .05). Table 6 presents  Conversely, many children with well-developed literacy skills may speak English fluently, although it is a second language. The approach taken in this paperconceptualizing language-minority children as those for whom English is not the primary home language-also has conceptual difficulties. Foremost among our concerns is that such a typology includes children who are fluent in more than one language. Moreover, our results suggest that even in homes where English is not the primary home language, many parents regularly speak English to their child."}, {"section_title": "Mathematics growth trajectories.", "text": "Perhaps more importantly, the children in such homes tend to be more fluent than their parents, with from one-third to one-half regularly speaking English to a parent. This raises questions regarding research approaches to language-minority status. The focus of such research is certainly not high-achieving children who speak non-English at home. Rather, its concern is with the relationship between English fluency and other social and academic outcomes of schooling. Indeed, the results of this report suggest that language-minority children are not inherently low achieving. Just as race and ethnicity are conceptualized as \"markers\" of academic achievement, language status may (or may not) be related to student learning. Therefore, we contend that concern with language-minority children should be tied to a concern about academic performance. "}, {"section_title": "Examinations of Achievement vs. Growth", "text": "The ultimate goal of school reform is to raise average achievement while simultaneously reducing overall variability in achievement-certainly not an easy task. In a growth curve analytic context, student learning would ideally be characterized by positive learning slopes with an overall decrease in variability-the that they did not create. However, to the extent that initial achievement gaps are related to social and structural inequalities, we-including schools-share a collective responsibility. Regarding the second question, learning is precisely how students, teachers, and schools ought to be evaluated. Assessment based on any other criteria clearly ignores the very real cognitive differences that exist among children as young as five-year-olds. The results presented here highlight this often ignored point. As this paper hopefully demonstrates, education researchers now possess the technology to accurately capture and measure children's learning over time. More importantly, this learning can be modeled based on student and contextual factors (e.g., classrooms and schools). Although not the focus here, with equal effectiveness, these methodological advances can evaluate school performance. If our aim is to assist LM children in reaching their full academic potentials, we must craft accountability systems capable of measuring both achievement and learning. The work presented in this paper hopefully moves us toward such a system."}, {"section_title": "Methodology and Technical Notes", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Analytic Sample", "text": "From the ECLS-K full sample, the analytic sample was collected in six stages. First, children were chosen who (1) had a non-missing weight; (2) remained in the same school in kindergarten and first grade; (3) advanced to the first grade following the 1998-1999 kindergarten year; (4) were not enrolled in a year-round school, and; (5) had complete language status, race/ethnicity and SES data. The final selection stage produced two distinct samples. Language-minority children who did not pass the OLDS did not participate in the literacy assessment. However, children who did not pass the OLDS but whose primary home language was English took a Spanish version of the mathematics assessment. As such, the analytic sample used to evaluate children's mathematics is somewhat larger than that for literacy. For each sample, children were selected who had test scores for three of the four assessment waves. The final analytic sample for literacy learning includes 33,227 test scores nested within 10,059 children nested within 749 schools. The final analytic sample for mathematics learning includes 34,469 test scores nested within 10,425 children nested within 750 schools. A missing data analysis revealed that these final subsamples were somewhat more socioeconomically advantaged than the full ECLS-K sample, with fewer language-minority children and fewer children from the lowest SES quintile. The loss of lower-SES and language-minority children mostly occurred when restricting the sample by available test scores."}, {"section_title": "An Alternate Growth Curve Approach", "text": "Quantitative researchers have traditionally used ANCOVA or gain score models to measure change over time within individuals. Over the past several decades, however, social scientists have concluded that estimating change based on only two data points is inherently inadequate (see Bryk & Raudenbush, 1987;Seltzer, Frank, & Bryk, 1994;Rogosa & Willett, 1985;Willett, 1988). Myriad statistical and substantive issues have driven this methodological shift, although one central concern is shared: traditional approaches assume that variance in the outcome remains steady over time. This assumption itself implies that growth trajectories among individuals are perfectly parallel, \"an entirely unrealistic state of affairs [that] is obvious even at the most casual glance\" (Willett, 1988, p. 377). As an alternative approach, educational researchers are increasingly using three or more data points to model growth rates and learning trajectories. Such analyses entail both within-individual and between-individual components (Willett, 1988). The growth rates of individuals are estimated in the first analytic phase, while the second phase focuses on the detection and explanation of systematic variance in individual growth rates (Rogosa & Willett, 1985). An endless array of potential explanatory covariates exists, including the characteristics of individual children, their classrooms and teachers, schools, peers, neighborhoods or educational interventions (Willett, 1988). The comparative examination of learning rates among LM and non-LM children presented here falls within this relatively new theoretical framework. Specifically, the multivariate analyses consist of three-level HLM growth curve models with test scores (Level-1) nested within children (Level-2) nested within schools ; see Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). The initial unconditional HLM analyses included a traditional third-degree polynomial model. This model revealed a non-linear growth pattern between the start of kindergarten and the end of first grade in both reading and mathematics, with increasing learning in kindergarten, decreasing learning over the summer months, and increasing learning in first grade. For two reasons, however, this paper does not develop the polynomial model further. First, the complexity of such models makes them rather difficult to interpret. Second, traditional growth models assume that the temporal distance between repeated measures is constant across individuals-an assumption broken by the data structure of ECLS-K. Conceptualizing time. The ECLS-K data provide a unique challenge in modeling children's cognitive growth over time. This challenge, however, can be used to the researcher's advantage. The dates on which the ECLS-K assessments were given varied substantially across children. This is understandable given the enormity of the data collection involved with ECLS-K and the amount of time each one-on-one assessment required. In addition to variability in testing dates, the starting and ending dates of academic years varied across schools. The combined result is that children's opportunities to learn between assessments differed both within and among schools. For example, the time children were in school between fall and spring kindergarten assessments ranged from almost four to over eight months. For some children, the fall assessments took place months into the school year and the spring assessments occurred before the end of the school year. The situation was similar in first grade. Methodologically, the implication of this variability is that the four assessments do not represent comparable events in time across children. Further complicating the analyses, approximately half of the \"summer vacation\" between the spring kindergarten and fall first grade assessments includes time when children were actually in school. These considerations are especially crucial considering the rapid learning rates among very young children (see Burkam, Ready, Lee, & LoGerfo, 2004, for further discussion). Due to these methodological issues related to ECLS-K, the HLM growth curve models presented here are conceptually and statistically quite different from typical growth curve models. Many studies of growth consider indicators of time as constant across cases (i.e., \"third grade\" represents an identical value or construct across individuals). The considerable variability in testing dates and school calendars discussed above suggests that the ECLS-K assessments represent disparate events across time. To address this challenge, the Level-1 models presented here include three time-varying covariates that indicate children's exposure to school at the time of each assessment: (1) months of exposure to kindergarten, (2) months of exposure to summer between kindergarten and first grade, and (3) months of exposure to first grade. For example, at the time of the first assessment the average child had been \"exposed\" to over 2 months of kindergarten, but 0 months of summer and 0 months of first grade. With the second assessment, the average child had been exposed to over 8 months of kindergarten, but still no exposure to summer or first grade. At the third assessment, the average child had been exposed to 9.5 months of kindergarten (a full year), 2.7 months of summer (the traditional summer vacation), and over a month of first grade. At the point of the final assessment, the average child had been exposed to 9.5 months of kindergarten, 2.7 months of summer, and over 8 months of first grade. Rather than initial status, the three remaining parameters are linear learning rates or slopes over: (2) the kindergarten year; (3) the summer between kindergarten and first grade; and (4) the first-grade year. The estimates obtained from these three parameters collectively addressed the second research question: How can we characterize the learning rates of LM and non-LM children during kindergarten, summer, and first grade? To isolate the unique effects of language-minority status, the LM growth estimates obtained from these Level-2 models were adjusted for the many socio-demographic characteristics associated with both LM status and student learning. Again, the variability in testing dates permits this \"slopes as outcomes\" approach, where the slopes modeled are exposure to school. An additional benefit of this approach is that at each analytic level, all coefficients are in an easily interpretable metric: points of learning per month in kindergarten, summer, and first grade. As the focus of this paper is the relationship between child characteristics, language status, and cognitive development, the Level-3 (school-level) models are \"unconditional\" and do not include school-level measures. Rather, they simply control for systematic variance between schools, providing \"within-school\" learning estimates. Weights. Because ECLS-K followed a multistage stratified sampling design, the data include a series of design weights. As with other longitudinal NCES datasets, analyses using ECLS-K require the use of weights to compensate for (1) unequal probabilities of selection (e.g., the intentional over-sampling of Asian/Pacific Islander children), and (2) non-response effects. Although our growth curve models consider achievement at four waves of the ECLS-K data, the \"1234\" panel ECLS-K weights are only defined on children in the sample at time 3. Hence, the use of those weights automatically restricts the sample to that small subgroup. Instead, these analyses employ the \"124\" panel weights which retain the larger sample. The descriptive and analytic analyses employ a child-level weight [C124CW0] to compensate for differential sampling both within and between schools. The ECLS-K school-level weight [S2SAQW0] was used with the multi-level growth-curve analyses. Both weights were normalized to reflect the smaller sample size."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "Dependent measures: cognitive assessments. The ECLS-K cognitive assessments were administered individually, with an adult assessor spending between 50-70 minutes with each child (NCES, 2001). The literacy assessment was designed to measure both basic literacy skills (print familiarity, letter recognition, beginning and ending sounds, rhyming sounds, word recognition) as well as advanced reading comprehension skills (initial understanding, interpretation, personal reflection, and ability to demonstrate a critical stance). These advanced literacy skills, which were assessed through verbal dialogue between the child and the assessor, measured children's ability to identify main points and connect text to their own personal backgrounds, as well as their critical thinking skills and the ability to distinguish real versus imaginary content. Mathematics assessment items measured conceptual and procedural knowledge and problem solving, with items equally divided between number sense and measurement. The scores on both the reading and mathematics assessments were separately equated using Item Response Theory (IRT), in order to make them appropriate measures of change over time. As suggested by Seltzer et al. (1994), these analyses use the IRT scale scores. Language status measures. The models employ several interaction terms representing Hispanic LM/P children (yes=1, no=0); Hispanic LM/NP children (yes=1, no=0) and Asian LM/P children (all languages; yes=1, no=0). LM children from the remaining racial/ethnic groups presented a final methodological challenge. Statistically, the subgroup sample sizes of White LM, Black LM, and other race/ethnicity LM children were too small to support unique interaction terms. Substantively, it seemed unwise to create a unique interaction term composed of such a socio-demographically diverse group of children. Although this group is examined with the descriptive analyses, the multivariate HLM models do not employ a non-Asian/non-Hispanic LM interaction term. Rather, the main-effect LM coefficient estimates the \"LM effect\" for these non-Hispanic/non-Asian LM/P children controlling for race/ethnicity (and the remaining covariates in subsequent models). Home language use. The models also incorporate two measures that capture home literacy environments. A series of dummy variables indicates: whether at least one parent regularly speaks English to the child (yes=1, no=0), and; whether the child regularly speaks English to at least one parent (yes=1, no=0). Social and academic background. Children's socioeconomic status is captured with a composite measure of parents' income, education, and occupational prestige (used as quintiles in multivariate analyses, with the middle quintile as the comparison group). The analyses also employ a dummy-coded gender measure (girls=1, boys=0) and account for children's race/ethnicity with a series of dummy variables indicating whether a child is Asian, Hispanic, African-American, or Other race/ethnicity, with White as the un-coded comparison group. The models further account for children's age (in months) and whether the child lived in a single-parent home (1=yes, 0=no). Academic background was captured by whether the child was repeating kindergarten (repeater=1, non-repeaters=0); and had full-day kindergarten (full-day=1, half-day=0). b children identified as non-English proficient for whom Spanish was the primary home language were administered a Spanish-equivalent form of the mathematics assessment, but were not administered the English literacy assessment.
