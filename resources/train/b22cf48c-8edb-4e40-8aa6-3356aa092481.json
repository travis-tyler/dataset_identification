For example, recreating detailed slip distributions for historical earthquakes that occurred before the inception of the International Seismological Centre in 1964 is often hampered by sparse data of insufficient quality. Consequently, the short duration of the catalogue challenges efforts to develop realistic rupture models, used for subduction earthquake and tsunami hazards assessments, that represent the full range of potential rupture variability. Recent slip models integrate multiple datasets in combination with numerical tsunami models (e.g., Wang et al. 2013;Satake, 2015). New models now incorporate greater heterogeneity of moment release in subduction zones, such as slip partitioning downdip, more complex seismogenic zones, tsunami earthquakes, and dynamic ruptures through parts of the megathrust that are creeping or conditionally stable (Lay and Bilek, 2007;Lay et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2012;Noda and Lapusta, 2013). Here, we apply such new modeling to re-examine the details of megathrust slip that generated the great 1957 Andreanof Islands earthquake, in the eastern Aleutian Islands of Alaska. Our modeling implies substantial slip in the eastern part of the 1957 aftershock zone-an enigmatic area first labeled a seismic gap (House et al., 1981) that is presently creeping according to satellite geodesy (Freymueller et al., 2008). The March 9, 1957 earthquake initiated near the Andreanof Islands and ruptured west to Amchitka Pass and east toward Unalaska Island (Figure 1). The ~1200-km-long aftershock area stretched 360 km west and 850 km east of the epicenter (Sykes, 1971;Kanamori, 1977;Sykes et al., 1981). Widely varying estimates of the earthquake's size (Mw 8.3-9.1) and uncertainty in the spatial distribution of moment release reflect the paucity of seismic observations in 1957 before the deployment of the World Wide Standardized Seismograph Network (Okal, 1992;Johnson et al., 1994;Boyd et al., 1995). For example, the distribution of aftershocks following the 1957 earthquake led House et al. (1981) to propose that the easternmost part of the aftershock zone near Unalaska Island did not rupture and that this arealabeled the Unalaska seismic gap-was poised to break in a future earthquake as large as magnitude 8. Alternatively, if the megathrust near Unalaska Island did slip in 1957 then the rupture may have been delayed and/or so slow that the resulting seismic energy was obscured by the coda of the main shock (House et al., 1981). Seismic and tsunami waveform inversions by Johnson et al. (1994) seemed to support the seismic gap hypothesis, and while those authors recognized that some slip occurred along the eastern part of the 1957 aftershock zone, their model did not place significant slip near and to the east of Unalaska Island. However, our simulations, which use the slip distribution of Johnson et al. (1994), do not predict the first arriving tsunami wave at Dutch Harbor, on the north shore of Unalaska Island, and falls far short of meeting field-based geological constraints and eye-witness reports of 13 to 22 m high wave runups on the Pacific coasts of Umnak, Unalaska, Sedanka and Unimak Islands (Lander, 1996;Witter et al., 2014;2016). In this paper, we assess hypothetical rupture models in the eastern part of the 1957 aftershock zone-an area that prevailing slip models presume did not slip in 1957 (e.g., House et al., 1981;Johnson et al., 1994). We evaluate alternative slip distributions for the 1957 rupture near Unalaska and Akutan Islands by constructing a suite of forward models that vary amounts and depths of megathrust slip. We vary slip on the subduction interface to reconstruct water-level dynamics in Dutch Harbor recorded by tide gauge in 1957. We also run models that simulate the maximum runup in Stardust Bay on the southern coast of Sedanka Island, where drift logs transported by the 1957 tsunami were stranded at >18 m above mean sea level (Witter et al., 2016). Our study focuses on a small part of the 1957 aftershock zone for which new data are available, but our findings warrant a complete re-evaluation of the spatial distribution of slip and moment release during the 1957 earthquake using modern techniques."}, {"section_title": "Tsunami modeling methods", "text": "To model Aleutian megathrust ruptures we discretize the 3-D subduction geometry of the Alaska-Aleutian plate interface by Hayes et al. (2012) into a number of 3 to 6 km long rectangles (subfaults) along the plate interface. The subfaults' upper and lower edges coincide with depth contours placed every 1 km along the plate interface. Coseismic deformation is computed for all subfaults using formulas developed by Okada (1985) for an elastic half space. Simulations of tsunami propagation and runup entail a numerical model that has been validated through a set of analytical benchmarks and tested against laboratory and field data (Nicolsky et al., 2011;Nicolsky, 2012). The model solves the nonlinear shallow-water equations using a finite-difference method on a staggered grid. We make reasonable assumptions to simulate seafloor deformation and tsunami generation. First, we assume the initial displacement of the ocean surface is equal to the vertical displacement of the ocean floor during the earthquake rupture process; the contribution of horizontal displacements (Tanioka and Satake, 1996) is not considered. Second, we assume sea floor displacement is instantaneous; we do not model the finite speed of rupture propagation along the fault. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Computations that map tsunami propagation and inundation in detail employ a series of five nested numerical grids with a resolution of 2 arc-minutes; 24, 8, 8/3 arc-seconds; and \u2248 16 \u00d7 16 meters. The bathymetric and topographic relief in each nested grid is based on digital elevation models (DEMs) developed at the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) of the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (Carignan et al., 2012;Taylor et al., 2008 For any coarse-fine pair of computational grids we apply a time-explicit numerical scheme as follows. First, we compute the water flux in the coarse-resolution grid. These calculated flux values are used to define the water flux on the boundary of the fine-resolution grid. Next, the water level and then the water flux are calculated over the fine-resolution grid. Finally, the water level computed in the fineresolution grid is used to define the water level in the area of the coarse-resolution grid that coincides with the fine grid. Subsequently we compute the water elevation for all other points in the coarse grid and proceed to the next time step. More about the numerical scheme, grid nesting, and time stepping can be found in Goto et al., (1997) and in Nicolsky et al., (2011). Systematic tsunami travel-time delays (due to elasticity of the solid Earth, seawater compressibility, and variations of gravitational potential) occur in many numerical experiments (Watada et al., 2014); a modeled tsunami may arrive up to 15 minutes sooner than the observed tsunami being modeled. For example, in modeling the 2011 Tohoku tsunami, Tang et al., (2012) observed a 3-minute delay between the computed and observed waves at DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis) buoys 46408 and 46402 along the eastern Aleutian Islands south of Unalaska Island, but a much larger delay of 15 minutes at the Dutch Harbor tide gauge, only 410 km north-northwest of DART buoy 46402 ( Figure 1). Similar delays, 8 minutes at the DART buoys and 15 minutes at Dutch Harbor, were also noted by Nicolsky et al., (2015), who used a different numerical model and a tsunami source mechanism to model the 2011 Tohoku tsunami propagation to Dutch Harbor. We hypothesize that a significant increase in the delay between the DART buoys and the tide gauge is due to possible discrepancies in the ocean bathymetry at the continental shelf edge. A further cause of potential arrival time errors in the 1957 tsunami model may be the 850 km length of the rupture, which propagated from the Andreanof Islands eastward to Unalaska Island. The rupture velocity of the 1957 earthquake is poorly constrained, but for a rupture propagation speed of 3-5 km/s (Johnson et al., 1994), the trench south of Unalaska Island would have ruptured about 3-5 minutes after the earthquake started. Adding this to the DART-tide gauge differential arrival time error of Nicolsky et al., (2015) results in an estimated arrival time error of 10-15 minutes in our model, if the rupture is located close to the trench.  Salsman (1959) and Lander (Fig. 61, 1996) reveals that the tsunami arrives 5 minutes earlier in Salsman-Lander's copy of the marigram ( Fig. S15 in Supplementary Data). This discrepancy could be due to digitization errors, a decrease in the rate of tide gauge barrel rotation, or other unknown reasons."}, {"section_title": "Tsunami runup in 1957 registered by tide gauge, historical accounts and coastal geology", "text": "Historical accounts of tsunami runup in 1957 include 9-23 m high tsunami waves along Pacificfacing Aleutian island shorelines and a far-field tsunami in Hawaii with maximum runups up to 16 m (Lander, 1996; National Geophysical Data Center/World Data Service, NGDC/WDS, 2015). The accounts reported by Lander (1996) include sheep drowned by the tsunami at a ranch at Chernofski on the northwest coast of Unalaska Island. On the Pacific Ocean side of Umnak Island, Lander (1996) reports that four sheep camps were impacted by the 1957 tsunami and waves reached heights up to 13.7 and 23 m. Accounts also mention 12.5-15 m high waves at Scotch Cap on Unimak Island (Lander, 1996), which lend further support to the possibility of substantial megathrust slip in the hypothesized Unalaska seismic gap. At Stardust Bay on Sedanka Island (Figure 1), Witter et al., (2016) identified drift logs transported by the 1957 tsunami at an elevation of >18 m above mean sea level. These observations conflict with models of low moment release in the eastern part of the 1957 rupture (House et al., 1981;Johnson et al., 1994). Tsunami models run by Witter et al. (2016) that use the 1957 source model of Johnson et al. (1994) failed to produce tsunami runup that matched observations at Stardust Bay. Alternatively, they used a simple megathrust source model to simulate tsunami inundation and runup that agreed with drift log elevations at Stardust Bay. However, Witter et al., (2016) did not compare the simulated tsunami dynamics of their source to the 1957 tide gauge record at Dutch Harbor."}, {"section_title": "Slip models for the Unalaska seismic gap and comparison with observations", "text": "To reassess the slip distribution in the eastern part of the 1957 aftershock zone, we consider several hypothetical rupture models in the Unalaska seismic gap and compare them with the 1957 observations. Previous analyses placed nearly the entire seismic moment release in 1957 west of 173\u00b0W, about 300 km west of Unalaska Island (House et al., 1981;Johnson et al., 1994). It was recognized that slip occurred east of 173\u00b0W, possibly near the western part of Umnak Island and trenchward from Driftwood Bay (Witter et al., 2016), but the slip distribution of Johnson et al. (1994) does not predict tsunami waves that fit the Dutch Harbor tide gauge record well. Particularly important is the prominent rapidly increasing first arriving wave on the Dutch Harbor marigram, whereas the Johnson et al. (1994) model predicts a slowly increasing first arrival; the amplitude of the first wave is also underpredicted. We infer that the rapid first arrival is the result of large slip off the Pacific coast of Unalaska Island. We test this hypothesis using a suite of rupture models. We consider four hypothetical slip distribution models (A-D), each equivalent to an M w 8.2 earthquake near Unalaska and Akutan Islands. The resulting tsunami predictions can be scaled linearly for larger or smaller amounts of slip. Each model is developed by first prescribing a general pattern of slip distribution along the interface, then computing the slip at the center of each subfault using seismic moment as a constraint. Similar to Geist and Dmowska (1999) and Sobolev et al., (2007), we used theoretical slip distribution formulas by Freund and Barnett (1976) to parameterize and compute coseismic slip on the fault. This allows us to impose a smooth slip distribution using only a few parameters. Figure 2 shows the slip distribution for each model. The relative slip distribution for all four models is identical: uniform in the along-strike direction with tapering at the ends of the rupture. The scenarios are offset by about 10 km in the downdip direction to test the impact of different rupture depths such that model A is centered at 40 km depth; model B is centered at 30 km; model C is centered at 20 km; and model D is centered at 10 km.

The vertical deformation computed for each model provides the initial input for the tsunami simulation (right column of Figure 2)."}, {"section_title": "Comparison of modeled and observed tsunami records in Dutch Harbor", "text": "We compared modeled and observed (de-tided) water level dynamics over several hours after initiation of the 1957 earthquake (Figure 3). Note that 8-50 cm of subsidence in Dutch Harbor occurs in models A-C; the amount of modeled subsidence is indicated in the sub-title of each subplot. The modeled water level is shown from the perspective of an observer watching a tide gauge that subsides together with the land in Dutch Harbor. In all models, the time between successive waves is ~30 min. The predicted water levels differ considerably in both amplitude and arrival time for the four models. The first wave arrival time is much earlier for models A-C than for model D, and the amplitudes of the waves are larger for the deeper ruptures. This seemingly counter-intuitive result occurs because of the position of the region of coseismic subsidence relative to the islands; for deeper ruptures significantly more water is pulled through passages between the Aleutian Islands and is directed toward the Dutch Harbor. The deeper models A and B produce subsidence on the Bering Sea side of Unalaska Island, and in those models the first arriving waves come from this region, followed soon by waves from the uplifted region. In model C, there is still significant subsidence on the continental shelf and the upper part of the inner trench wall, while in model D the primary tsunami source is located offshore the Pacific side of Unalaska Island. The first wave arrival time changes drastically among the models. As discussed earlier, we expect a 10-15 minute arrival time delay in the modeled tsunami. A 15 minute travel-time delay (\u03b4T=15 min) applied to the model results produces a satisfactory match between observed and modeled water level This article is protected by copyright.

The delay that would be required to match the first positive arrival in model C would be ~20 min, somewhat larger than expected. Moreover, the modeling results for model C include the arrival of the small positive wave 30 minutes after the earthquake, which is not observed in the marigram. The modeling results for models A and B indicate an arrival of the first wave ~20 minutes after the earthquake, which is more than an hour earlier than observed. We note that if Salsman-Lander's copy of the marigram is used in the above comparison, then 10 and 15 minute delays would be required to produce a reasonable match between the simulated and observed records for models D and C, respectively, and the delay, \u03b4T, required to fit models A and B would still be too large. Based on its amplitude and arrival time, the slip distribution of model D, characterized by shallow near-trench slip, best explains the tide gauge record at Dutch Harbor. However, model D predicts no coseismic subsidence at Dutch Harbor. This appears to conflict with the 10-15 cm of coseismic subsidence estimated by Wahr and Wyss (1980) based on analyses of annual mean relative sea levels at the Dutch Harbor tide gauge. However, the Dutch Harbor tide gauge marigram shows no measurable subsidence in Dutch Harbor during the 1957 earthquake ( Fig. S6 in Supplementary Data). Evidence for rise in relative sea level at the time of the earthquake that would have occurred if coseismic subsidence lowered the tide gauge by 10-15 cm is lacking. Substantial afterslip downdip of the model D rupture in the months following the earthquake could have produced subsidence at the tide gauge that would be consistent with annual mean data used by Wahr and Wyss (1980). Furthermore, in the decades since 1957, the Dutch Harbor tide gauge has recorded gradual relative sea-level fall at a rate of -5.08\u00b10.53 mm/yr (mean sea level trend for NOAA tide gauge station #9462620 available at: http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_station.shtml?stnid=9462620).

We ran tsunami simulations in Stardust Bay for models A-D and compared the simulated runup produced by each scenario to the elevation of drift logs inferred to have been deposited by the 1957 tsunami (Witter et al., 2016). A line of debris, including drift logs, often delineates the minimum runup after most tsunamis. Witter et al., (2016) found three logs deposited 13-14 m above sea level; they also discovered a higher log containing nails attesting to its historical age. The nailed log was stranded in a narrow gully at an elevation of 18.5 m. Modeling tsunamis in narrow gullies, similar to the setting where the nailed log was found, is a challenging task. Numerical experiments simulating tsunami runup in a narrow gully in the Monai Valley, Okushiri Island during the 1993 Hokkaido-Nansei-Oki tsunami showed that runup was significantly underestimated by most models (NTHMP, 2012, p 32). The computed values of the runup in the gully were found to be sensitive to the resolution of the digital elevation model, uncertainties in topography and bathymetry, and general limitations of the shallow water models (NTHMP, 2012). The maximum computed water level varies along the coast of Sedanka Island. The maximum water level along the southern coast of the island is much higher than that along the northern coast ( Figure   4a). The computed runup at the head of Stardust Bay is about 12-14 m and reaches as high as 18 m at some locations (Figure 4b). Model C results in the largest extent of inundation, while models B and D produce lower runup, but similar inundation extents (Figure 4b). Model A produces the least inundation and lowest runup. The simulated extent of inundation for models B-D agree well with locations of the drift logs at Stardust Bay. The log with nails at 18.5 m lies at the boundary of the simulated inundation limit for model D, and is well within the uncertainty for narrow gullies. The simulations indicate that on the outer coast facing the trench, the maximum runup and inundation is predicted well by any slip model with slip extending along Unalaska Island at depths shallower than 30 km (i.e. models B-D)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusions", "text": "A suite of forward models shows that tsunami waves generated by a shallow rupture at 5-15 km This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Our results, along with those of Witter et al., (2016), motivated us to reassess the spatial extent of slip in the eastern part of the 1957 aftershock area along Unalaska and Akutan Islands. In the eastern area, aftershocks extend ~500 km beyond the end of significant slip inferred by previous studies (House et al., 1981;Johnson et al., 1994), In contrast, drift log elevations at Stardust Bay and the Dutch Harbor tide gauge data are consistent with large slip at shallow depths along the eastern part of the aftershock zone, suggesting that the rupture length is reasonably approximated by the 1200-km long zone of aftershocks. Moreover, Boyd and Jacob (1986) recognized that the narrow band of aftershocks observed near Unalaska Island did not differ significantly from the spatial distribution of aftershocks to the west because few aftershocks occurred along the up-dip part of the plate interface between depths of 6-17 km. In their assessment, Boyd and Jacob (1986) propose that slip did occur in the eastern part of the aftershock zone, but the speed of rupture and magnitude of moment release near Unalaska Island may have been very different from the western part of the rupture. Further support for shallow rupture near Unalaska Island comes from modern analogs: Lay and Bilek (2007) point out that shallow rupture in the 1992 Nicaragua earthquake produced few aftershocks near the trench, the area of greatest slip. Our reassessment of the extent of 1957 slip supports conceptual models that suggest that the shallow (<10 km) part of subduction megathrusts have complex seismogenic properties with variable zones of frictional stability, can undergo large slip that may involve longer rupture durations, and generate large seafloor displacements that propel tsunamis (Lay and Bilek, 2007). If the 1957 rupture did extend along the entire 1200-km-long aftershock zone, then estimates of earthquake magnitude of M w \u22648.6 are anomalously low and would make the 1957 earthquake a notable global outlier based on empirical relations between earthquake magnitude and rupture length (Henry and Das, 2001). Size constraints on this event from seismology are weak, as there are few records that do not come from nodal directions (E. Okal, personal communication) and the few long-period records available give a wide range of magnitudes (Okal, 1992;Boyd et al., 1995). Other methods also fail to pin down earthquake size. For instance, seismic moment estimated from the distribution of aftershocks varies from as little as 30 x 10 20 Nm (Sykes, 1971) to as much as 585 x 10 20 Nm (Kanamori, 1977). The equivalent magnitudes for these estimates range from M w 8.3-9.1. Abe (1979) estimated the seismic moment from far-field tsunami runup at 400 x 10 20 Nm, which is equivalent to M w 9. Alternatively, seismic moment estimated by inversions of seismic and tsunami data ranges from 67 to 88 x 10 20 Nm (Johnson et al., 1994), which implies M w 8.5-8.6. Models that limit moment release to the western part of the 1957 aftershock zone, like the model of Johnson et al. (1994), rely on the assumption that P-wave amplitudes recorded at station PER in Perth Australia were decaying before PP arrivals, which requires little slip after the first 4 minutes of the rupture. However, it is possible that large P-waves that arrived later during the bilateral rupture could be hidden within the PP wavetrain; indeed, this possibility was noted by  who proposed that the coda might have obscured the signal of delayed or slow rupture in 1957. Drift log elevations at Stardust Bay, eye-witness accounts of tsunami heights, and our modeling results imply that the eastern part of 1957 earthquake rupture likely had substantial slip along a section of the megathrust that is poorly coupled today (Freymueller et al., 2008). These observations can be reconciled if slip and slip deficit are mainly confined to the shallow, near-trench region where geodetic observations on the islands have little resolution. Highly variable frictional properties, and thus potentially variable slip behaviors, exist along-strike and down-dip on the subduction interface (Scholz, 1998;Lay et al, 2012). A more comprehensive model of the 1957 rupture that considers several possible slip modes offshore Unalaska and Akutan Islands in 1957 might unite the geologic and tide gauge observations with previous studies. One possibility is that normal seismic slip passed along-strike through a poorly coupled zone (Harris and Day, 1997;Noda and Lapusta, 2013) and the resulting seismic energy was masked by the coda in the 1957 seismic data. Alternatively, the shallowest part of the megathrust offshore Unalaska Island may have slipped slowly in a tsunami earthquake, in which case the long-period energy would be difficult to retrieve from existing records (Polet and Kanamori 2000;Newman et al., 2011). Early studies noted the possibility that rupture speeds and slip amounts may have been highly variable in this region (House et al., 1981;Boyd and Jacob, 1986). Further modeling efforts to resolve the details of moment release during the 1957 earthquake, should incorporate local geological and tide gauge observations of tsunami wave dynamics as well as far-field tsunami waveforms recorded around the Pacific Ocean. With improved constraints from tsunami observations, new models of the 1957 rupture should evaluate multiple possible rupture modes along strike, including dynamic rupture in poorly coupled areas, and delayed, shallow slip that may be evident in the long-duration seismic waveforms produced by great earthquakes.
