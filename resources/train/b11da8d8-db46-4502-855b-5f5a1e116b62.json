The APOE gene product is the apolipoprotein e (Apo-e) protein which is expressed by three different APOE alleles (i.e, APOE \u03b52, \u03b53, and \u03b54). The presence of the APOE \u03b54 allele has also been reported to be associated with lower plasma Apo-e protein levels as well as with a distinct cognitive profile, and brain atrophy pattern compared to subjects with the \u03b52, and \u03b53 [29, 47, 62] . In the periphery, Apo-e is mainly, but not exclusively, synthesized in the liver, and by macrophages, whereas in the central nervous system (CNS) astrocytes are the main source of Apo-e protein synthesis, and release under normal conditions [4, 36] .\nThe different Apo-e isoforms have been associated with different rates of brain A\u03b2 clearance [7] , and there are several mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the association between APOE and AD [34] . A previous biomarker study from our group using a multi-analyte panel to interrogate plasma from three different cohorts of cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD subjects found that lower plasma Apo-e protein levels were associated with a diagnosis of MCI and AD in analyses that were not adjusted for APOE genotype [24] . Studies of another separate cohort found an association of lower plasma Apo-e with clinical diagnosis of MCI, and AD [13] , but not with amyloid positron emission tomography (PeT) imaging positivity [6] . A small cross-sectional study including lewy body disease subjects has described increased cerebrospinal (CSF) Apo-e levels associated with APOE \u03b54 presence and association between higher CSF Apo-e levels and worse cognitive and neuroimaging measures [56] . Finally, one further study described the association between CSF Apo-e levels and CSF A\u03b2 , clinical diagnosis and its genetic associations [11] . However, no studies have described longitudinal neuropsychological or structural imaging associations with CSF levels of Apo-e protein in AD, MCI and CN subjects. In our study, we wanted to test if plasma CSF Apo-e protein levels were associated with clinical and longitudinal biomarker and cognitive changes and evaluate if the associations of Apo-e protein levels went beyond the ones expected based on the APOE genotype."}, {"section_title": "Subjects and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Data used in the current study were downloaded on November 7th, 2013 from the AD neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu). The ADNI has been extensively described elsewhere [59] ; see supplementary material (SM). 311 subjects had CSF Apo-e levels measured at baseline, although one subject had no clinical information and was, therefore, excluded from the study (Table 1) . 565 subjects had plasma Apo-e measurements at baseline (Supplementary Table 2 ). We reviewed the medications of all subjects and grouped the cholesterol drugs into statins, fibrates, resins, niacin and ezetimibe to test if these drugs were associated with Apoe-e levels (Supplementary Table 3 ).\nSample collection and biomarker measurements CSF samples were obtained in the morning after an overnight fast [43] (see ADNI procedures manual (http://www.adni-info.org/ and SM). All but 3 subjects had CSF A\u03b2 and tau baseline measurements. In addition, 127 subjects had longitudinal CSF A\u03b2 and tau measurements on a yearly basis for a total of 589 measurements. longitudinal CSF data have been analyzed and described previously in more detail [53] .\nA\u03b2 , t-tau, and p-tau 181 were measured using the multiplex xMAP luminex platform (luminex Corp, Austin, TX) with innogenetics (INNO-BIA AlzBio3; ghent, Belgium; for research use-only reagents) immunoassay kit-based reagents. Capture monoclonal antibodies used were 4D7A3 for A\u03b2 , AT120 for total tau (t-tau), and AT270 for phosphorylated tau (p-tau 181 ). The analytespecific detector antibodies were HT7 for tau, and 3D6 for the N-terminus of A\u03b2 [44] (see Supplementary methods). Hemoglobin was measured in CSF samples as an indication of blood contamination [23, 30, 50 ] using a human hemoglobin elISA quantitation kit from Bethyl lab Inc (Montgomery, TX, USA). 571 plasma samples from 571 individual subjects and 327 CSF samples from 311 subjects, including 16 replicates, of never before thawed aliquots were interrogated by rules based medicine (rBM, Austin, TX) using the multiplex Human DiscoveryMAP\u2122 panel on a luminex 100 platform (see papers on methods, and procedures available in http://www.adni-info.org/). Apo-e was measured as a part of a multiplexed panel using a flow-based laser apparatus to detect polystyrene beads loaded with different ratios of two spectrally distinct fluorochromes. The beads are coated with antibodies and serve as a solid phase coating matrix to detect the analytes of interest in this case of CSF Apo-e. The beads are read one at a time as they pass through a flow cell on the luminex laser instrument using a dual laser system. Two sets of quality control (QC) measures are available. The first one was obtained by spiking human plasma with cell culture extracts expressing the human analytes, which were run in duplicate. Based on this analysis, the least detectable dose for Apo-e was 0.00128 \u03bcg/ml. Coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated by running three standards in duplicate for five runs. The three standards had a mean concentration of 7.26 \u03bcg/ml, 13.6 and 35.3 with a CV of 9.4, 7.97 and 8.48 %, respectively (average CV = 8.6 %). For the second QC measure, two different CSF aliquots were sent to Myriad rBM for 16 cases, blinded to the Myriad rBM analytical staff. All of these analytes were successfully measured; the mean percent difference was 18.2 and neither the Bland-Altman intercept (\u22120.11, p = 0.93) nor slope (0.20, p = 0.24) was significantly different from 0."}, {"section_title": "Structural MrI acquisition and processing", "text": "Subjects with a 1.5-T MrI and a sagittal volumetric 3D MPrAge with variable resolution around the target of 1.2 mm isotropically were included in the analysis.

For further analyses, power transformations were applied if necessary and biomarker levels were standardized (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1) to be able to compare effect sizes [regression coefficient (\u03b2) and hazard ratio (Hr)]. Tukey honestly significance difference was applied for post hoc comparison of significant ANOVA analyses. Associations between Apo-e levels and other variables were tested in covariateadjusted multivariable linear regression models (note that \u03b2 refers to the transformed values). gender and APOE genotype differed between the clinically defined groups and age has been shown to be associated with changes in biomarkers [2] . Therefore, these variables were included as covariates. We tested the conditions necessary to apply the regression model (normal distribution of the residuals and absence of multicollinearity [variance inflation factor <5]), which were fulfilled by all the models. A Cox model was used to study the conversion of MCI to AD for Apo-e levels. The CSF Apo-e mismatch (Apo-e-Mis) was calculated as the residuals from the regression model that included age, gender, APOE \u03b54 presence and t-tau as predictors. We analyzed longitudinally different quantitative outcome measures (MrI volumetric measures and neuropsychological measures) using mixed-effects models to assess the association with CSF Apo-e levels. All the AD subjects were excluded from longitudinal analyses due to short follow-up. For the ADAS-Cog analysis, age, gender, education, APOE \u03b54 allele presence, CSF t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio, and clinical diagnosis at baseline were included in the model as fixed effects. Three random effects were included: an intercept, follow-up time measured in years and the squared time. An interaction between time and clinical diagnosis, time and CSF t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio, and time and Apo-e levels was also included. A significant value for any of these interactions would indicate that the longitudinal change differs between groups, i.e. an interaction between clinical diagnosis and time would indicate that MCI subjects show a higher increase of ADAS-Cog score than CN subjects during follow-up. A similar model was applied for the association with volumetric MrI changes that also included intracranial volume (ICV) as a covariate. Statistical tests were two-sided and significance was set at the p < 0.05. Benjamini-Hochberg correction was applied for the MrI comparisons and Bonferroni correction when multiple comparisons were performed (except the descriptive values presented in Table 1 ).

Female compared to male gender (\u03b2 = \u22120.34, t 308 = \u22122.94, p = 0.025) and APOE \u03b54 presence (\u03b2 = \u22120.35, t 308 = 3.13, p = 0.014) were associated with decreased CSF Apo-e levels, whereas increasing age (\u03b2 = 0.022, t 308 = 2.72, p = 0.048) was associated with higher CSF Apo-e levels. Hemoglobin showed no association with CSF Apo-e levels (\u03b2 = \u22120.001, t 308 = \u22120.47, p = 0.64). Higher CSF Apo-e levels were associated with higher t-tau (\u03b2 = 0.33, t 302 = 6.09, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1a) and p-tau 181 (\u03b2 = 0.20, t 305 = 3.51, p = 0.0037), but not with A\u03b2 1-42 (\u03b2 = 0.13, t 305 = 2.33, p = 0.14). Whereas there were no significant CSF Apo-e differences between the clinical groups in the univariate analysis (Table 1) , MCI (\u03b2 = \u22120.40, t 297 = \u22123.38, p = 0.0008) and AD (\u03b2 = \u22120.74, t 297 = \u22125.0, p < 0.0001) patients showed decreased CSF Apo-e levels ( Fig. 1a ) in the analysis adjusted for t-tau levels, age, gender, clinical diagnosis and APOE \u03b54. This would indicate that Apo-e increases with higher t-tau levels but that MCI and AD subjects show for similar levels of t-tau lower levels of CSF Apo-e. For visual display, we calculated the Apo-e-Mis that showed differences between clinical groups in the ANOVA analysis (F 301 = 9.8, p = 0.0001) (Fig. 1b) . The post hoc comparison found that MCI (\u03b2 = \u22120.29, p = 0.021) and AD (\u03b2 = \u22120.58, p < 0.0001) subjects had lower CSF Apo-eMis than the CN subjects and that AD subjects (\u03b2 = \u22120.29, p = 0.048) had also lower CSF Apo-e-Mis than MCI subjects.\nTo test the association with longitudinal CSF changes, we studied CSF A\u03b2 1-42 , t-tau and p-tau 181 changes in a subset of 127 subjects who had a total of 429 CSF measurements. The model that studied longitudinal CSF changes was adjusted for gender, clinical diagnosis age, and APOE \u03b54 presence. We found no association between baseline CSF Apo-e levels and longitudinal changes in A\u03b2 (t 336 = \u22121.62, p = 0.11), t-tau (t 335 = \u22120.86, p = 0.39) or p-tau 181 (t 339 = 0.68, p = 0.49).\nWe tested if any of the cholesterol lowering drugs was associated with CSF Apo-e values, but none of the drugs affected CSF Apo-e levels (Supplementary Table 3 ).\nAssociation of CSF Apo-e protein levels and APOE genotype with diagnosis and cognitive decline\nThe following analyses had clinical diagnosis, neuropsychological score or MrI gM volumes as dependent variables (outcome) and included age, gender, education, APOE \u03b54 presence, t-tau and CSF Apo-e protein levels as independent/predictor variables. Clinical diagnosis was included as a predictor in the mixed-effects model that studied ADAS-Cog changes and MrI atrophy, but not the Cox hazard model that studied MCI conversion to AD.\n149 MCI subjects had CSF Apo-e level measurements with a median follow-up of 158.8 weeks (1st quartile: 105.6 weeks; 3rd quartile: 312.8 weeks) and we found that 88 converted to dementia. lower CSF Apo-e and higher CSF t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio were associated with MCI conversion to dementia in the fully adjusted models (Table 2 ; Fig. 1c ). For comparison, we present the association with the CSF t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio including CSF Apo-e as a covariate (Fig. 1d) . The proportional hazard model that included CSF Apo-e levels showed a better predictive value than the one that excluded CSF Apo-e levels (\u03c7 2 = 6.85, p = 0.0089, 1 df). After the exclusion of CSF Apo-e from the model, APOE \u03b54 presence was not associated with MCI progression (data not shown) and there was a decrease of the CSF t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio Hr (Hr = 1.33, z = 2.23, p = 0.026).\nFor the longitudinal ADAS-Cog analysis, 91 CN subjects with 626 visits and 144 MCI subjects with 949 visits were included. low CSF Apo-e levels and high CSF t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio, but not APOE \u03b54 presence, were associated with a greater cognitive decline as measured by ADAS-Cog scale (Table 2 ; Fig. 1e, f) . When CSF Apo-e levels were excluded from the model, APOE \u03b54 presence was not significantly associated with ADAS-Cog changes (data not shown)."}, {"section_title": "Association with structural MrI", "text": "Finally, we tested the association of CSF Apo-e levels with longitudinal brain atrophy in an analysis that included age, gender, clinical diagnosis, APOE \u03b54 presence, CSF t-tau/ A\u03b2 1-42 ratio and intracranial volume as covariates. low baseline CSF Apo-e levels and high CSF t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio were associated with faster rate of atrophy in several cortical areas (Table 3 ; Supplementary Fig. 1 ). When we excluded CSF Apo-e levels from the model, APOE \u03b54 presence was not significantly associated with MrI longitudinal changes (data not shown).\nStratification of CSF Apo-e analyses based on APOE \u03b54 presence We stratified our analysis based on the presence or absence of one or more APOE \u03b54 alleles (Supplementary  Tables 4-6 ). In these analyses, results remained significant only in the subgroup of subjects with no APOE \u03b54 alleles, although the coefficients of the variables with significant associations changed overall less than 12 % in the subgroup with APOE \u03b54 alleles. In these analyses, CSF t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio was not associated with conversion from MCI to AD and similarly associations with longitudinal MrI changes were decreased. lack of association of plasma Apo-e levels with clinical and neuroimaging outcomes Plasma and CSF Apo-e levels showed a mild correlation (r = 0.23, p = 0.004, Supplementary Fig. 2 ) in an analysis that included 202 subjects who had the plasma and CSF samples drawn the same day. There was no association between plasma Apo-e levels and AD CSF biomarkers (A\u03b2 : t 341 = \u22120.75, p = 0.45; t-tau: t 336 = 1.35, p = 0.18; p-tau 181 : t 342 = 1.14, p = 0.26). Statin treatment was associated with decreased plasma Apo-e levels (Supplementary Table 3 ). Plasma Apo-e levels were associated with CSF A\u03b2 1-42 and p-tau 181 levels only if "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In our study, we showed the association of CSF Apo-e levels with CSF AD biomarkers, MCI conversion, structural MrI changes and longitudinal cognitive decline in models that were adjusted for baseline clinical diagnosis, age, gender, presence of APOE \u03b54, and the tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio. Our results suggest that increased CSF Apo-e levels could represent a protective response to neuronal injury and that decreased CSF Apo-e levels are associated with a worse longitudinal outcome. Whereas the presence of APOE \u03b54 has been shown to be associated with the risk of AD and A\u03b2 amyloid deposition decades ago [15, 38] , reported data on plasma and CSF Apo-e levels are scarce and mainly reported as compared group-based differences [11, 13, 19, 24, 33, 47, 56] , despite the fact that the initial report on measures of CSF Apo-e levels was published over 30 years ago [42] . Interestingly, CSF Apo-e levels were positively correlated with CSF t-tau levels independent of APOE \u03b54 presence, indicating that Apo-e synthesis might be also increased in response to injury (which is thought to cause the t-tau increase in CSF). Increased CSF Apo-e would facilitate neuronal repair as a response to neuron damage [1, 3, 63] . As seen in Fig. 1b , although the correlation between CSF t-tau and CSF Apo-e levels was present across the three clinical groups, CSF Apo-e levels were significantly decreased in MCI and AD subjects. Plausibly, this could indicate that as AD progresses, there is an insufficient response to neuronal injury and that there is an impaired repair response. Accordingly, those subjects with lower CSF Apo-e levels progressed faster. Alternatively, truncated CSF Apo-e4 fragments (\u0394272-299) have been associated with tau phosphorylation and, therefore, increased CSF Apo-e4, which is more susceptible to truncation that the Apo-e3 isoform could contribute to increased CSF p-tau levels [26] . Finally, it can also be expected that neuronal loss might be responsible for the decreased CSF Apo-e levels as atrophy might be associated with a lower demand for CSF Apo-e levels. In addition, since neurons produce Apo-e in response to neuronal insults, even in situations where there is increased astrocytosis and gliosis, neuronal loss might be associated with a reduced production of Apo-e. We tested baseline association of CSF Apo-e and cortical gM atrophy, but the association was not significant (\u03b2 = 0.091, t = 1.65, p = 0.10). Therefore, it is not clear that baseline atrophy or neuronal loss can explain the association with longitudinal changes.\nIn our analysis, lower CSF Apo-e levels were associated with increased conversion of MCI subjects to dementia, longitudinal cognitive decline in CN and MCI subjects and longitudinal gM atrophy in all clinical groups. In addition, models that included CSF Apo-e protein levels showed a better prediction of the outcome variable than those that did not include CSF Apo-e, indicating that CSF Apo-e is an independent predictor of cognitive decline and that the clinical and MrI changes associated with CSF Apo-e levels go beyond the effect of APOE \u03b54 presence. A previously published small cross-sectional study included patients with lewy body disease and the authors analyzed clinical and biomarker correlations of CSF Apo-e levels [56] . In this study, the authors described a positive correlation between CSF Apo-e levels and CSF t-tau and PiB PeT binding and an inverse correlation with cognitive scores. That study reported increased CSF Apo-e levels in APOE \u03b54 carriers. On the other hand, our study and a previous study with CSF Apo-e measurements in over 700 subjects [11] showed decreased levels CSF Apo-e levels in APOE \u03b54 carriers. One important difference, besides the lack of inclusion of AD subjects and the younger age of the subjects, is that the study by Vijayaraghavan et al. [56] only included six subjects (mainly with APOe \u03b54) with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PeT who had standardized uptake value ratios above 1.5 (compatible with amyloid deposition) and that analyses were not adjusted for covariates.\nIt is unclear why increased CSF levels might have the associations we report here and appear to protect against cognitive decline, AD and the conversion from MCI to AD. The association with the clinical and biomarker outcomes in models adjusted for CSF t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio may imply that mechanisms beyond A\u03b2 amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles might be linked to the cognitive changes associated with CSF Apo-e levels or that Apo-e is involved in injury repair mechanisms that are independent of amyloid clearance [25] . In line with this hypothesis, neither plasma nor CSF Apo-e baseline visit levels predicted longitudinal changes in CSF A\u03b2 1-42 , t-tau or p-tau 181 levels. Nevertheless, larger longitudinal early stage samples are needed to confirm these results. Apo-e is known to act as a scaffold for the formation of high density lipoprotein-like particles that are thought to bind to soluble A\u03b2 and promote the proteolytic degradation of soluble A\u03b2 [14, 28] . Although the capacity of Apo-e to promote A\u03b2 degradation depends not only on the levels of Apo-e but also on the Apo-e isoform and the lipidation status of these proteins, we did not measure specific Apo-e2, Apo-e3 and Apo-e4 isoforms nor do we know the lipidation state of the Apo-e isoforms we measured here as our assay measures total Apo-e. In addition, several A\u03b2 independent protective mechanisms have been suggested for CSF Apo-e [25] . Based on our results, an increase in CSF Apo-e levels could be a response to initial neuronal injury which decreases when patients show cognitive changes and do not respond to the potential protective effects of Apo-e and stabilize or even decrease during disease progression (Figs. 1a; 2a) . Alternatively, other factors may regulate CSF Apo-e levels and differences in CSF Apo-e levels (not related to disease stage) may modify the cognitive decline. Therefore, high CSF Apo-e levels would delay the onset of cognitive decline (right-shifted dark green curve) (Fig. 2b) . These are preliminary hypotheses and further studies with longitudinal biomarker data are needed to develop the model. In line with this modifier effect, we found that the inclusion of CSF Apo-e levels in our model was associated with a stronger association of the CSF t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio and a better fit of the model. Therapies such as bexarotene that increase Apo-e levels using liver X receptor (lXr) agonists have been reported to enhance behavioral test performance in AD mouse models engineered to overexpress A\u03b2 and form A\u03b2 plaques [10, 14, 17, 54] in addition to reducing the number of plaques after acute but not chronic treatment in one study [10] . However, the reduction of plaques has not been replicated in other studies [17, 31, 37, 48, 54, 55] , although one study showed some trends [14] . Of these studies, only five tested behavior in mice: two found an improvement [14, 17, 54] , one had conflicting results [48] whereas the last one did not find an improvement [31] . All studies showed target engagement with an increase of ABCA 1 and/or Apo-e [14, 17, 31, 37, 48, 54, 55] . Differences between studies have been attributed to the formulation of bexarotene [32] and gender differences between groups [31, 55] . CSF Apo-e levels before treatment together with CSF Apo-e levels after treatments could be used to monitor baseline Apo-e levels, target engagement and correlations between the extent of target engagement and observed response in studies involving lXr.\nIn the different models, APOE \u03b54 presence was not associated with longitudinal clinical outcomes or gM atrophy. This observation would indicate that either APOE \u03b54 presence is not associated with the rate of decline. There are consistent results of APOE \u03b54 presence being associated with an earlier age of onset of AD [8] ; however, the association with cognitive decline is inconsistent across different studies [5, 9, 61, 64] . recently, a study that included neuropathological data regarding A\u03b2 and tau deposition showed that the effect of APOE genotype on cognition is mediated by A\u03b2 and tau deposits and that adjusting for these variables leads to a lack of association between APOE genotype and cognitive decline [65] . This last study is in line with our results; when the CSF t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio was included, there was no association between cognitive decline and APOE genotype, but after excluding the CSF t-tau/A\u03b2 ratio APOE genotype was associated with cognitive decline (data not shown).\nWe found a weak correlation between the levels of Apo-e in each of these compartments when we analyzed subjects from whom both CSF and plasma samples were obtained on the same day as previously reported [11] . This is in agreement with animal studies which found that the blood-brain barrier was not permeable to peripherally labeled Apo-e [35] . The association between lower plasma and CSF Apo-e levels in subjects with APOE \u03b54 presence has been previously reported in the ADNI cohort [29, 47] and other studies [20, 21] , although other studies did not find this association or found higher CSF Apo-e levels in the presence of an APOE \u03b54 [12, 58] . The Australian imaging, biomarkers and lifestyle (AIBl) study described a mild correlation with amyloid deposition measured by PiB PeT, although this association decreased when the analysis was adjusted for APOE genotype [21] . Similarly, Cruchaga et al. [11] reported that the significant decrease of plasma Apo-e values observed in AD subjects disappeared once APOE genotype was included in the analysis. The association of lower CSF Apo-e levels in APOE \u03b54 carriers might be related to a faster degradation of Apo-e4 isoforms which has been observed in animal and cell models [41] and also a faster metabolism in the periphery [20] . Alternatively, changes in plasma Apo-e may cause early events in AD onset pathologically that reaches a plateau before the onset of cognitive symptoms and this timing difference could explain the lack of association with cognitive changes. However, the lack of largely decreased association with AD when the analysis is adjusted for APOE genotype makes this hypothesis less probable. The more complex origin and metabolism of plasma biomarkers and the presence of the blood brain barrier may account for a weak association of Fig. 2 Proposed models for CSF Apo-e effects in AD. CSF Apo-e as a neuroprotective mechanism that fails in advanced disease stages (a) and CSF Apo-e levels as a neuroprotective mechanism that modulates disease progression (b) plasma biomarkers, like plasma A\u03b2, with cognitive decline [16, 51, 52] .\nIn our study, we were not able to measure the different Apo-e isoforms and the limited age-span of the subjects and lack of longitudinal CSF Apo-e measurements prevents us from predicting how CSF Apo-e levels change during disease history. Since Apo-e4 shows different lipophilicity than Apo-e3 and, therefore, future studies should consider if the difference in lipophilicity may alter the measurements based on the diluents used in the assay since it has been reported that Apo-e3 forms dimers and heterodimers whereas Apo-e4 does not [60] . Hence the presence of these dimers might also affect the measurements of different Apo-e isoforms. When we stratified our results based on the presence APOE genotype results, they were only significant in subjects without APOe \u03b54 alleles. There are at least three potential explanations to account for this: (1) our assay might not be adequately measuring Apo-e levels in the APOE \u03b54 group, (2) Apo-e levels might not be protective in APOE \u03b54 subjects (or only the Apo-e3 isoform might be protective) or (3) the stratification reduced the sample size in each of the APOE groups with the APOE \u03b54 group having a smaller sample size for the cognitive and MrI analysis. In line with the third hypothesis, some of the t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 associations were not significant or their association decreased in the APOE \u03b54 group. Therefore, further independent validation of the longitudinal results in an independent cohort including a different assay is needed. Whereas the mean value of the highest standard (35.5 \u03bcg/ ml) was higher than the values in the CSF, it was below the median Apo-e plasma value of each of the three clinical groups. Therefore, our plasma results should be considered cautiously.\nFinally, cholesterol levels are modified by statin treatment and there are conflicting results regarding the protective effect of statin treatment [45, 46] , thereby prompting suggestions that statins are neuroprotective [22] . Based on our analyses, statins (and other cholesterol lowering drugs) affected plasma but not CSF Apo-e levels independently of the lipophilicity of these drugs, so CSF Apo-e levels might not be affected by usual statin doses. Statins may exert their protective effects by reducing abnormal vascular changes and cerebrovascular pathology that are commonly found in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, and which lower the dementia threshold [49] .\nIn summary, we found that CSF Apo-e protein levels are decreased in association with neuronal damage, as measured by t-tau, in cognitively impaired subjects compared to CN subjects and that baseline CSF Apo-e levels are associated with cognitive decline and brain atrophy which is independent of CSF t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio. These results provide clinical evidence that CSF Apo-e levels might represent a response to neuronal insults with beneficial effects and would prompts us to infer that a therapy targeted to increase Apo-e3 levels in the brain as reflected by CSF measures of Apo-e might improve cognitive performance and gM MrI volumetric measures in MCI patients or even in later stages of AD. Finally, it is possible that inclusion of repeated CSF Apo-e measures in clinical trials could be used to measure target engagement for drugs targeting Apo-e and as a covariate in the analysis of the clinical outcomes.\nConflict of interest Dr. Arnold reports grants from NIH, the American Health Assistance Foundation and the Marian S Ware Alzheimer's Programseveral pharmaceutical companies, other from Universities, pharmaceutical companies and advisory/speaking honoraria from Universities, pharmaceutical companies and law firms.
