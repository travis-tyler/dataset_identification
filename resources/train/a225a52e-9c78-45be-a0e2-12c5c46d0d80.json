Of the international travel-related cases, seven (50%) were linked to travel to European countries (Portugal, Spain, Italy, 176\nSwitzerland, Austria, England, Belgium, Germany, Czech Republic, and Hungary), while six reported travel to countries in the Americas (USA, Colombia, Jamaica, Cayman Islands, Panama, 178\nChile, and Peru). One case reported travel to Israel.\nTo explore the history of the virus in MG, we performed a maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic 180 analysis on the dataset containing the 40 new sequences plus other 3,062 sequences deposited in GISAID up to 15 April 2020. Our estimated ML phylogeny identified two major clades branching 182 at the root of the tree (Fig 3) . These two clades were named lineages A and B, following a SARS-CoV-2 lineage nomenclature recently proposed [26] . 184\nAccording to this nomenclature scheme, two main SARS-CoV-2 lineages could be identified as other countries such as Australia, China, Canada, Malaysia, and USA [28] . Moreover, two sequences were assigned to lineage B.2 (isolates CV22 and CV36), and one sequence to lineage A 194 (isolate CV7) (see S2 Table for full results) .\nSlightly different from the lineage assignment approach mentioned before, in our ML phylogeny 196 most of MG's new sequences (n=37, 92,5%) were placed in a descendant lineage we named B.1, which also included other sequences from GISAID sampled worldwide. Of these 37 sequences from 198 MG within lineage B.1 (Fig 3) , 11 are isolates from cases that reported travel to European countries .

Two MG's sequences (CV22 and CV9) fell into lineage B, one of which (CV22) reported travel to Germany. 202\nThe only sequence from MG that fell into lineage A refers to a case (CV7) that reported travel to European countries (Fig 3 and Table 1) . 204\nTo assess these lineages in more detail and in time, we performed Bayesian time-measured phylogenetic analysis using a molecular clock model. We analyzed three sub-datasets (named subset 206 A, subset B and subset B.1) extracted from each lineage from the ML tree that included Brazilian sequences. Our maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees showed that most of MG's sequences were 208 interspersed with other isolates sampled from other countries (Fig 4b, c, d) . This pattern, similar to that observed in other countries [28] [29] [30] , is also in accordance with our ML tree and with the 210 epidemiological data, indicating that these isolates were linked to travel exposure rather than community transmission, and reinforcing the idea that multiple independent introductions with 212 source abroad have occurred in MG.\nDespite the observed dispersed distribution, some sequences from MG grouped together, forming 214 clusters that also included sequences from Brazil and other countries. Subset B.1 tree shows these clusters containing more than one sequence from MG (Fig 4d) . However, these clusters have very 216 low posterior probability support, because of the low genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes currently available worldwide [31-33]. Nonetheless, four clusters, each consisting of only two MG 218 sequences showed posterior probabilities of >80%. One of these clusters (Fig 4d) , with a posterior probability of 100%, was formed by isolates CV34 and CV36, referring to cases of seemingly local 220 transmission from contacts with a COVID-19 confirmed and suspected case, respectively. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 11, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.20091611 doi: medRxiv preprint the epidemiological data from the first case confirmed in SP, regarding a traveler returning from Lombardy, Italy, on 21 February 2020 [11, 13] . 226\nDespite the grouping of some MG sequences, we cannot infer a close relationship between these sequences with certainty at this stage, because of the small sample size data which covers only 228 about 30 days of the epidemic in MG. That is, this dataset cannot fully represent the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating. Moreover, the low genetic diversity of sequences 230 available so far limits conclusions about SARS-CoV-2 directionality and spread based solely on genetic data. As observed in another study [32] , due to the described limitations of the available 232 genomic data, the phylogenetic results presented should be approached with caution and considered as hypothesis-generating on the transmission events of SARS-CoV-2 in a local setting. 234\nIn conclusion, at the end of April 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic in the state of MG was still expanding (R>1) and it is highly dispersed with cases and deaths reported mostly away from the 236 capital city and with approximately only 64% and 35% of the total population being represented in case and death reported data, respectively. Genomic data and other epidemiological information 238 from travel-related cases, allowed us to identify several introduction events that occurred independently in MG, further helping to explain the geographical patchiness of reported cases and 240 deaths. These initial insights based on the restricted data that is available show that transmission is likely to continue in the near future and suggest room to improve reporting. Increasing COVID-19 242 testing and SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing would help to better understand on how the virus is spreading and would thus inform better control of the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil. 244\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 11, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.20091611 doi: medRxiv preprint\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 11, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.20091611 doi: medRxiv preprint Samples were selected based on the Ct value \u2264 32.

When using reported cases, 142\nwe found that the effective population sizes were ~100%, ~100% and 64% of the total population sizes of RJ, SP and MG, respectively. When using reported deaths, the effective population sizes 144 were ~95%, ~92%, and 35% of the total population sizes of RJ, SP and MG, respectively. Overall these numbers suggest that in MG cases and deaths have been reported only in a subset of the 146 overall population, while in the other states SARS-CoV-2 appears widely dispersed.
