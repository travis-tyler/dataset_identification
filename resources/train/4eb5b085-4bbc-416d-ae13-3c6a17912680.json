[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "There have been many attempts to assess the elements of age-and dementia-related neurodegenerative changes in the brain using MRI; however, traditionally assessments focus only on single deficit. Over the past few years, our group has worked to create and validate the Brain Atrophy and Lesion Index (BALI) as an MRI-based whole-brain structural degeneration rating scale. The BALI can be used for applications in aging and dementia across the entire brain and can be applied to common clinical MR images. As a whole-brain structural health assessment, the BALI gives a more representative picture of how the brain ages. During the aging process, multiple elements of degeneration accumulate and interact to overwhelm repair processes and cause high-level failure in the function of the brain. To reflect this process, the BALI combines the assessment of several neurodegeneration changes into one scale. The BALI evaluation can be performed quickly and has been validated for use by nonneuroradiology expert raters trained with the method. This review gives a brief overview of the content of the BALI; covers the development, refinement, and application of the method; and provides insights about future development and clinical implementation of MRI-based whole-brain health assessment in aging and dementia.\nAlzheimer's disease, brain aging, brain atrophy and lesion index, dementia, magnetic resonance imaging 1 | INTRODUCTION As we age, structural degeneration occurs throughout the brain.\nThese degenerative changes are nearly inescapable; they are seen in normal aging, and with increased severity in individuals with dementia and cognitive decline.\n1-4 Some of these, such as atrophy and white matter lesions, are well recognized as markers of cognitive decline and dementia, 5, 6 and others, such as dilated perivascular spaces and microvascular changes, have received less attention. 1 While most literature has focused on evaluating the impact of each of these changes, a number of studies have noted that certain changes are more likely to occur in tandem and can combine to increase the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. 7-10 This makes intuitive sense. As a complex and interconnected system, the activities of the brain can be disrupted not only by a large insult, but also by diffuse damage from multiple smaller deficits across subsystems. While the individual effect of each of these small changes may be minor, their combined impact can cumulate to produce negative outcomes in the higherlevel functions of the brain. While research has pointed to this cumulative impact of small changes on general health, 11 a standardized methodology for assessing neurodegenerative changes across the entire brain is yet to be established.\nEven though it has not been extensively utilized to address this specific problem, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a superb\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "modality for the assessment of structural changes in the brain. While these structural changes result from a number of underlying pathologies, they result in several characteristic changes that are visible on MR images taken using common clinical sequences. Clinicians and scientists have created a number of scales to be applied to MRI that quantify individual neurodegenerative changes, such as Scheltens'\nMedial Temporal Atrophy Scale (MTAS) 12 and the Fazekas Scale for White Matter Lesions. 13 However, these scales are incapable of assessing multiple changes across the entire brain simultaneously. The MRI-based \"Brain Atrophy and Lesion Index\" (BALI) has been created and validated to address this deficiency. The BALI is a semi-quantitative visual scale that adapts and combines several established evaluation methods that typically target specific types of brain changes in specific brain regions, to give a measure of whole-brain structural degeneration, with applications in aging and dementia research and for future clinical translation. In this paper, we introduce the BALI method and give an overview of how it was validated and applied to different research questions."}, {"section_title": "| CONTENT OF THE BALI", "text": "To produce a BALI score, several subcategories are assessed, primarily using either T1-or T2-weighted images which are common in research and routine clinical MRI tests (while other clinical sequences can also be added to the assessment when available). A score of 0-3 is assigned based on the severity of the changes occurring in each category. Scores of 4 and 5 possible in the deep white matter and the global atrophy categories, which allows us to account for very severe changes. Subcategory scores are summed to a total score with a maximum of 25. The BALI can be rated on both 1.5T and 3T images, 9 and images from other common clinical MRI sequences can be included to increase our ability to see specific changes. 10 Table 1 describes the BALI evaluation method of how images are rated. Figure 1 gives examples of the BALI rating of two older adult individuals with the same age and sex. For a more comprehensive account of how the BALI can be implemented, see Guo et al. This category assesses any lesions within the cortical gray matter, such as small areas of encephalomalacia, and juxtacortical dilated perivascular spaces."}, {"section_title": "| Category 2: Deep white matter lesions (DWM)", "text": "This category assesses white matter hyperintensities located in the white matter, excluding the periventricular and juxtacortical WM.\nScores of 4 and 5 are given when there are extensive white matter lesions throughout the entire brain."}, {"section_title": "| Category 3: Periventricular white matter lesions (PV)", "text": "This category assesses lesions in the white matter adjacent to the lateral ventricles.

The results showed a high correlation between ratings performed on images using each sequence and were highly correlated with age and cognitive performance. The BALI scores were also sensitive in their ability to detect group differences, helping delineate Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls (HC). Furthermore, this initial work also supported the hypothesis that the summed effect of the lesions is more important than each considered in isolation, as the total BALI score was better correlated with age and cognition than the individual lesion scores, 15 even those considered to be traditional hallmarks of age-related neurodegeneration.\nAfter its introduction, a follow-up study by Zhang et al 17 Literature has reported that variety of interventions can lead to structural brain improvements [20] [21] [22] even in older adults with dementia. 23 The improvements seen in BALI may have been the result of While the BALI gives a highly generalizable measure of brain aging, the MTAS gives us a very specific measure of focal atrophy symbolizing Alzheimer's disease process. This opens up the possibility that re-weighting the BALI scores to emphasize MTA may be beneficial for the prediction of AD; however, doing so would reduce the generalizability of the BALI. 24 Further work may create differently weighted versions of the BALI for use in different situations. In contrast though, recent work emphasizes the multiple structural deficits that present in AD, particularly vascular risk factors, which may be some of the first changes to present in the neurodegenerative process 25 ; even though the BALI may not be specific to underlying pathology of a deficit, it is open to many more aspects of the disease process.\nTo extend the capabilities of the BALI, further work was carried out to validate its use on both 3.0T and conventional 1.5T images.\nGuo et al 9 made use of one of the unique aspects of the ADNI dataset, in which a subset of the participants received both 3T and 1.5T images on the same day (n = 127). Results showed that BALI scores for each participant, using each field strength, were correlated, and scores differed by diagnosis, with AD receiving the highest scores, MCI intermediary, and HC the lowest, across both field strengths. As expected, the 3T images were able to more robustly capture brain changes, especially in the visualization of GM-SV and DWM. Because of this, BALI scores were slightly higher in 3T\nimages. There was a greater difference between 3T and 1.5T BALI scores in healthier participants, as subtle, low-grade lesions are less conspicuous and therefore harder to recognize on lower field strength images. However, because these differences in ability to visualize changes were common across all 1.5T images, the scores were lower, but inter-rater agreement between the 3T and the 1.5T\nBALI scores was similar. 9 With a systematic underestimation such as this, we are capable of taking it into consideration and can therefore compensate more effectively than if there were increased random error in one set of images.\nIn another study, Guo et al 14 also outlined a standardized procedure for evaluating the BALI and a plan for training new BALI raters. This work also showed that the BALI can be applied by nonexpert raters who were trained with the method. Whereas previous ratings had been completed exclusively by neuroradiologists, Guo et al 14 showed that researchers with a working knowledge of neuroanatomy and MRI can be taught how to use the scale, and they can produce data with inter-and intrarater reliability similar to those achieved by neuroradiologists. This increases the feasibility of BALI being mastered for use in different clinical and research settings.\nFurther work validated the application of the BALI to two more types of common clinical MRI sequences and assessed which types of images could best detect specific age-related changes. Guo et al 10 used 3T MR images from ADNI 2 (n = 950), the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set (n = 722), as well as a local dataset generated from multiple research protocols at a MRI center (n = 170). Scores showed a characteristic pattern across all datasets, supporting the assertion that the BALI scale can be easily applied to data collected under different protocols, and to a diverse range of participants. In this study, alongside the previously validated sequences (T1 and T2), clinical T2*GRE and T2\nFLAIR images were included, while the images were examined to determine which type would most effectively reveal specific changes. 10 The investigation revealed that T2WI are best for GM and subcortical lesions; T2FLAIR images were best for DWM and PV, and suitable for investigating the BG and GA; T1WI and T2WI are also suitable for BG and GA, and well suited for investigating malacia and others category. While T2*GRE is not suitable for rating the traditional BALI categories due to patchy low signal intensity, it is optimal for detecting microbleeds and lacunes with hemosiderin deposition. This work also initiated the BALI evaluation of microhemorrhages, which are of an increasingly high interest in aging research, as they are highly prevalent in aging populations.\nThey have been implicated as an early presenting and high-impact across multiple datasets, and in a diverse set of participants. 9, 10, 14, 15, 17, 18, 24 Construct validity is also strong for the BALI. This concept refers to how well a scale can quantify aspects of the theoretical construct that are purported to measure. This then reflects both GRAJAUSKAS ET AL.\n| 61 the target measures, that is, the theoretical construct we are trying to quantify, and how well the two of them align. The theoretical construct the BALI aims to measure is \"age-related whole-brain changes.\" While one weakness of MRI is that it measures the outcome of age-related neurodegeneration rather than the pathophysiological processes that underlie it, MRI visible changes do occur in close synchrony with cellular-and vascular-level changes, especially with the added specificity offered by high-field images. Compared to other MRI measures that already exist, the BALI is much better suited to measure \"brain aging,\" as it takes a holistic approach, assessing changes across the entire brain. This is a more complete way to operationalize \"brain aging,\" as it is a heterogeneous process that occurs over the entire brain, and in many unique patterns across different individuals. Therefore, while the measure of a single brain change may be more specific, a holistic measure like the BALI will be more generalizable across the entire population. Alongside this, MRI allows for the measure to be applied in vivo, something not possible with histopathological measures capable of directly assessing pathophysiology.\nThe BALI was also shown to possess predictive validity, with\nwork showing that a high BALI score is associated with a risk of MCI-AD conversion and that the combination of the BALI with other measures, such as the MTAS, may offer even greater predictive power. 17, 18, 24 Overall, the BALI is shown to have strong internal validity, with strong inter-rater reliability and robust inter-rater reliability, shown repeatedly even with non-neuroradiologist raters. The BALI has also been shown to perform similarly on multiple datasets, collected in multiple countries under a number of different protocols."}, {"section_title": "| FUTURE OF WHOLE-BRAIN HEALTH ASSESSMENTS", "text": "A few other recent studies have also accounted for more than one type of brain changes using MRI, but they have not taken a wholebrain approach, while emerging whole-brain approaches lack the breadth of accounting for multiple changes. 29, 30 As the first validated MRI assessment of whole-brain health in aging, a number of future refinements and applications exist for the BALI.\nIn the process of its development, BALI has been applied to rating MR images from over three thousand participants, many of which were collected in large multicenter collaborations, giving access to a number of other tests, including cognitive assessments and various biomarkers. Further included datasets have extensive longitudinal data on the participants we assessed. Alongside further investigations utilizing cognitive and biomarker data, this set of rated images is a valuable resource for technical development. These data will allow further studies using machine-learning tools to train an automated classifier capable of producing a BALI score without relying on the expertise of a trained rater. Such an automated BALI assessment tool will have implications in both the research and clinical domains, allowing us to investigate trends by applying the BALI to even larger datasets, and giving clinicians a tool they can use to easily to track and assess the structural degeneration in the brains of their patients. Automated assessments will also allow us to do an indepth investigation on the weighting of BALI subcategories, possibly increasing diagnostic specificity for various types of dementia. The potential applications of the BALI are numerous, and are well poised to make significant impacts on a number of problems currently faced by our society."}, {"section_title": "| CONCLUSION", "text": "Aging populations across the world are poised to cause significant social and economic problems. Dementia is estimated to effect 46.8 million people globally, at an annual cost of $818 billion USD, 31 and even subclinical cognitive decline has an economic impact, and negatively affects the lives of those suffering and their families. Valid new tools that give us the capability to investigate how the brain ages will allow us to understand and tackle these problems much more effectively. The BALI is one such tool. In the case of Alzheimer's, for over a decade, basic scientists and clinicians have looked for single protein abnormalities and failed to find a cohesive model of the disorder. It seems clear that rather than a single root cause, the disorder must more or less stem from a complex set of interacting deficits. 32 The human brain is a complex system, with multiple redundancies and the capacity for active self-repair. Degeneration resulting from many deficits that combine to overwhelm these failsafe systems makes more sense than failure resulting from a single insult. The BALI is designed to reflect this paradigm. Rather than investigating elements of neurodegeneration independently, it takes a holistic understanding, incorporating multiple elements, to reflect how failure must occur in a system as complex as the human brain.\nWhile there is still no clear way to reverse the course of cognitive decline and dementia, a great deal of evidence has shown that early intervention and modification of risk factors can delay the onset of the disorder. The BALI will help us do exactly that, both in its ability to help us learn about the aging brain and in its potential clinical applications."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDG MENTS", "text": "We would like to gratefully acknowledge Canada's National Science "}, {"section_title": "CONFLI CT OF INTEREST", "text": "The authors declare that no conflicts of interest exist with this work."}]
