These studies often focus on neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) [5, 7] , Alzheimer's disease (AD) [10, 11] or Parkinson's disease (PD) [1, 3, 6, 9, 8] .\nOne objective of such studies is to find a biomarker, i.e. a specific imaging signal characteristic whose presence is strongly correlated to a neurodegenerative disease. As such, several papers have shown that diffusion MRI (dMRI) and tractography can provide metrics sufficiently discriminative to be used as PD biomarkers [3, 12, 6, 8] . Studies have looked at the effect of PD on motor pathways and the substantia nigra. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values were found to increase in the motor tracts [6] and decrease in the nigrostriatal and nigropallidal pathways (NSP) [13] . Furthermore, increases in tract-density [12] , free-water compartment [14] , mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD) [13] were found around the substantia nigra. Some studies have tried to correct for free-water partial volume effect without identifying significant differences in free-water corrected FA in PD patients [13] . Others have examined more closely sensorimotor connections within the cortico-basal ganglia thalamocortical system and found decreases of anatomical and functional connectivity in some of these regions [3] .\nUnfortunately, many of these studies are based on small sample sizes, similar to AD studies before the creation of the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) dataset 1 . Another problem is that most existing studies are based on voxel-wise protocols and classical diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics. Furthermore, studies all rely on the assumption that dMRI metrics as well as white matter (WM) fascicles are discriminant by nature. In other words, these studies assume that subjects of a homogeneous healthy group share a similar brain structure whose configuration is locally different from the brains of a group suffering from a neurodegenerative disease [3, 6, 7] . As a result, one usually concludes that a shift in the observed dMRI metrics is an indication of the disease.\nHowever, WM fascicles extracted from dMRI suffer from a certain level of noise and distortion as two tractography pipelines do not always produce the same results [15, 16, 17] . This may be due to different preprocessing algorithms, different fiber tracking algorithms or hyperparameters, or simply the way the fascicles have been extracted [18] . Also, dMRI is by nature a noisy and artefactprone imaging modality [19] . WM tracts and fascicles are thus vulnerable to accumulated noise and distortions in the many processing steps involved in population group analyses. Although this situation has been studied in the past, the fact that tractography results provide a distorted picture of\nthe real anatomy of the brain has never been thoroughly investigated in applied WM studies. While some studies do integrate some sort of reliability assessment in their analysis [4, 6, 7] , without stateof-the-art reliability measurements, one cannot disregard the hypothesis that statistically significant variations in diffusion measures may be due to the processing pipeline rather than an actual biological phenomenon.\nIn this paper, we propose a robust protocol for mining dMRI datasets and apply it to the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) [20] dataset. PPMI comes with a unique testretest characteristic as subjects were scanned four times: twice initially, and twice one year later. This is a rare and a very powerful feature that can lead to more robust, reliable and reproducible tractometry and tract-based statistics.\nOur approach involves a processing pipeline extracting dMRI metrics along WM fascicles. DTIand HARDI-based metrics are extracted and projected on each fascicle to extract a vector of averaged metric values, sometimes called tract profile [4] . We also propose a test-retest validation protocol to assess the reproducibility of these metrics and fascicles. While a simple procedure, we show that it is important to measure the inherent variability of the acquisition and processing pipelines, which directly affects the results of subsequent statistical analyses.\nIn this paper, we intend to answer the following questions:\n1. How would one evaluate the test-retest reproducibility of dMRI metrics when projected to fascicles?\n2. Can this serve to perform a tractometry population study on the PPMI dataset and are there any significant differences between the PD and healthy populations?\nWe found that not all of our extracted WM fascicles are reliable enough to be used in a population study. When comparing reliable fascicles of PD patients and healthy controls, we found statistically significant differences in regions located along the brainstem-substantia nigra-basal ganglia-motor cortex connections. Tract profiling reveals significant increases in FA, apparent fiber density, tractdensity, and generalized FA detected for the nigro-subthalamo-putaminal-thalamo-cortical pathway.\nThis connection is one of the major motor circuits balancing the coordination of motor output. In PD, overactivity of the striatum and subthalamic nucleus (STN) and pallidum due to striatal degeneration results in reduced activity of the motor cortex. Clinically, this phenomenon is reflected by hypokinesia, tremor and rigidity. Detailed anatomic knowledge and quantification of WM properties are of particular therapeutic importance for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), an invasive neuromodulatory therapy which aims to balance disorganized motor circuits by applying high-frequency current\nto a target nucleus within a motor circuit. In PD, the STN and GPi (globus pallidus internus) are most frequently targeted, and recent research from Vanegas-Arroyave et al. [21] provides evidence for the involvement of WM fascicles in promoting the beneficial clinical effect. Thus, detailed and quantifiable knowledge of these WM fascicles is essential to improving DBS outcome.\ntherefore remove fascicle #2 from the analysis. a) b)\nComparison of the FA tract profile of the corticospinal tract (CST) and fascicle #2, described in table 1, from three different acquisitions: the first two from the same subject and the last one from a different subject. In (a), we have the desired case where the two intrasubject acquisitions are closer to each other than to the other subject's acquisitions, while in (b) we have the unfortunate case of the subject's first acquisition being closer to the other subject's acquisition than its second acquisition.\nThe goal of the test-retest tract profile score is to verify that intrasubject acquisitions are closer to each other than to other subjects' acquisitions. After z-score standardization using the mean and standard deviation of each point of each profile, an Euclidean distance is computed between all acquisition pairs of each subject. Since the PPMI dataset contains 179 healthy subjects and 412 PD all with 4 acquisitions (2 at the baseline and 2 one year later), we get to compute (412+179)*4-1=2363 tract profile distances for each tract profile of each patient (more details on PPMI in Sec. 2.4).\nThese distances were then averaged into two different values: (1) an intrasubject average distance, which includes distances of scan 1 of subject 1 vs scan 2-4 of subject 1, scan 2 of subject 1 vs scan 3-4 of subject 1, etc. and (2) an intersubject average distance, which included scan 1-4 of subject 1 vs scan 1-4 of subject 2-600, scan 1-4 of subject 2 vs scan 1-4 of subject 3-600, etc. Finally, these two values were subtracted from each other into what was called the average intersubject minus intrasubject tract profile distance. Thus, a single value for each fascicle studied was obtained. An ideal situation is where the difference would be high; then, the distance between same-subject tract profiles of this fascicle is much lower than the distance between different subjects. Should this difference be too small or even negative, the fascicle would be discarded from the study.\n\nQuality control by manual inspection was used to verify the quality of the registration.\nMajor WM fascicles were segmented using Freesurfer [43] and TractQuerier [24] . Since these were extracted to validate our method, we report fascicles in common with the PPMI dataset namely, the arcuate fasciculus (AF), corpus callosum (CC), cingulum (CG), corticospinal tract (CST), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), optic radiation (OR), and the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF).\n\nType Metric Fascicles (GA), and maximal apparent fiber density (AFD max) for PD patients as compared with controls in pathways connecting the subsantia nigra. In these same pathways, we also found that these significant increases are driven by significant decreases in mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and tensor norm for PD patients. Finally, parts of the corpus callosum and corticospinal tracts had comparable trends in motor regions. While both hemispheres showed similar trends, statistically significant differences appeared more frequently in the left hemisphere. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, the progression of the disease was also studied by comparing profiles of patients at the baseline timepoint and one year later. While nothing was statistically significant, similar trends than when comparing patients to healthy controls were found, which indicates that the disease indeed affects the regions highlighted in this paper. It is not significant perhaps because PD evolves slowly and one year is not enough to see major changes in specific regions. The PPMI dataset is planning to follow patients every year in order to acquire more timepoints. This will allow future studies to better research the progression of this disease.\nand, as such, of the 6 fascicles they found significant differences, 5 of them did not pass our testretest analysis (namely fascicles 4, 5, 6, 11 and 12) . This is not surprising since these fascicles are hard to define, have variable spatial extent and are hard to recover robustly. As more papers use dMRI tractometry to perform population statistics, it is important to remember that results are of value if the exact same regions of the brain are statistically compared. Given the strong anatomical priors injected in the segmentation of WM fascicles, test-retest is critical to assess the specificity and reproducibility of the extracted tracts.\nHowever, similar to us, Son et al. did find significant differences for the putamen, globus pallidus and thalamus levels, which corresponds to 3 regions associated to our 3 most significant fascicles (fascicles 14, 15 and 16).\n\nhibiting the thalamus, courses from the STN to the GPi (globus pallidus internus), the thalamus and to the cortex. The indirect pathway, on the other hand, inhibits movement by interposing the GPe (globus pallidus externus) as an additional relay station [54, 55] . The third, more recently discovered hyperdirect pathway, also inhibits movement along a direct connection from the STN to the cortex [56] .\nThe Parkinsonian state is characterized by neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra (SN), which leads to reduced dopaminergic input. As a result, overactivity of the STN and GPi enforces inhibition of thalamocortical motor pathways, which clinically presents as hypokinesia, tremor and rigidity [57] .\nDetailed knowledge of the WM changes in PD is essential in order to successfully modulate unbalanced motor circuits by deep brain stimulation (DBS) [58] . DBS is a gold standard therapy in drug refractory PD, which involves electrical stimulation of a target structure, most frequently the STN and GPi. There is evidence that the stimulation current not only affects the target structure, but spreads within adjacent axonal connections. Analysis of DBS electrodes in PD patients identified anatomic vicinity of clinically efficient electrodes and the substantia nigra, the thalamus and the brainstem [21] . These regions correspond to the ones where we detect most significant FA changes in our study, implying the modulation of motor circuits. This finding is in accordance with previous studies, which detected alterations of diffusion parameters along the nigrostriatal circuit [59] .\nHowever, there remains some controversy concerning the role of striatal diffusion changes, in particular, FA changes in PD. Some studies detected a reduction in FA values [60, 61, 59] , whereas others did not report on any significant FA alterations [62, 63] or FA increases [64] . A systematic review on all studies of FA changes revealed methodological differences as the main reason accounting for the divergent results, such as selection of ROI size, disease duration among patients and number of diffusion directions [63] . In our study, these methodological differences are overcome by careful test-retest qualification of the fascicles of interest and tractometry of an extensive list of DTI, HARDI and tract-based metrics.\nPathophysiologically, PD is characterized by a progressive neurodegenerative process leading to nigral iron accumulation [65, 66] , which was seen to increase FA values [67] . Another possible mechanism of FA increase may be the progressive degeneration of the nucleus and subsequent invasion by adjacent fiber tracts [68] . These effects could explain our significant increases and decreases observed in the diffusion metrics.\nA C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T\ndesign of dataset for tractometry studies should consider test-retest acquisitions to assess variability of measurements."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Tractometry Processing Pipeline", "text": "Our processing pipeline is illustrated in figure 1 . At first, fiber ODFs are extracted with spherical harmonics of maximal order 8 using MRtrix 2 (a) [22] . DTI/HARDI metrics are then computed using the Dipy python package [23] . These metrics are detailed in table 2. Then, whole brain fODF deterministic tractography (b) is performed using MRtrix's streamtrack command with a step size of 0.5 mm and a total number of 500,000 streamlines. Seeding was performed with a WM mask coming from a T1 registered to the diffusion upsampled to 1 mm 3 . Next, WM pathways (c) are automatically dissected from the whole brain tractogram with TractQuerier [24] (queries available at https://github.com/martcous/ppmi-study). From this point on, each pathway is processed independently using our automated tractometry pipeline (d). Spurious streamlines (outliers) are removed using hierarchical QuickBundles (e). As shown in C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. [25] , outliers have a low density and are far in terms of shape distance from other streamlines in the fascicle. They can therefore be detected automatically, as detailed in 7.1 [26] . Then, centroids are computed as a mean streamline of the pathway using the minimum-distance-flipped metric (f) [26] . This centroid is subsampled to N=20 equidistant points and every point of every streamline of the pathway is assigned to its closest centroid point (g). Metric values are then projected to these assignments masks and averaged in order to extract N averaged values along the pathway. Each voxel is weighted by its relative geodesic distance to the closest centroid point such that spurious streamlines far from the centroid do not affect the result as much. In the end, a tract profile is extracted for every combination of metrics and pathways (h)."}, {"section_title": "Reproducibility of White Matter Fascicles", "text": "As mentioned previously, dMRI is a noisy and artefact-prone modality. As such, tractography algorithms may return a distorted picture of the real WM anatomy. To produce meaningful statistics, one should take into consideration the level of distortion each fascicle is suffering from and use only pathways that are above a certain level of precision. Unfortunately, it is very difficult (if not impossible) to quantify to which extent a given WM fascicle (as well as its associated diffusion metrics) is distorted for a single subject. However, due to the multi-acquisition and multi-timepoint nature of PPMI, we can compute a test-retest score and measure the reproducibility of each fascicle.\nAlthough a reproducibility score does not explicitly account for tractography distortions per se, it nonetheless ensures the consistency of our dMRI pipeline. When a given subject undergoes two dMRI acquisitions within a short period of time with the same acquisition protocol, one can assume that tractography results should not vary much. The goal of our test-retest score is to measure the reproducibility of WM fascicles in terms of their shape and volume, as well as their tract profile.\nFollowing this test, we keep fascicles whose configuration is reproducible and thus reliable for a population study.\nAt first, our test-retest score measures the reproducibility of the fascicles' shape and volume. In that perspective, we compute the overlap of every fascicle extracted from each pair of acquisitions (two acquisitions at the baseline and two more one year later) both for healthy and PD subjects. To do so, we register the T1 of every subject to the MNI 2009 template [27] using the ANTs non-linear registration software [28] .

Given that WM fascicles have more tracts in the middle than in their periphery, we propose a weighted Dice coefficient which accounts for the number of streamlines per voxel. In that perspective, each voxel in W i and W j contains a value between 0 and 1 expressing the fraction of tracts passing through that position. Our weighted Dice metric sums the voxels that overlap in W i\nand W j and divides by the total sum of voxels:\nwhere v \u2032 stands for the voxels that are within the intersection of the W i and W j fascicles. Our weighted Dice gives more importance to areas with dense fibers.\nWe also quantify the test-retest reproducibility of the tract profiles.

Here, FA tract profiles of the corticospinal tract are shown in (a), and in (b), tract profiles of fascicle #2 described later as the connection between associative cortex and putamen. The first two profiles (green and blue) were extracted from two acquisitions of the same subject while the last one (in red) was extracted from another subject.

This is in line with intuition as the brain structure of an individual is more similar to itself than to that of another person. Conversely, in (b), we see that the tract profile of the first acquisition of the first subject is more similar to the tract profile of the other subject than to its second acquisition.

We then replicated this analysis on the PPMI dataset, and got similar good results for the major WM fascicles included in this analysis. For example, the corticospinal tract (CST) scored a weighted Dice coefficient of over 90% in the healthy dataset and over 80% on the PPMI dataset. The difference can be explained by the fact that the PPMI dataset contains considerably older subjects and not all scanned within a few days like the healthy dataset. Despite being slightly lower, it remains a rather satisfactory reproducibility for the PPMI dataset. Generally, we considered Dice of over 70% satisfactory based on the lowest value obtained from the test-retest dataset."}, {"section_title": "Poor Reproducibility of Some WM Fascicles", "text": "Several of the extracted fascicles based on Sharman et al. [3] obtained quite poor reproducibility.\nFor example, fascicle 7 connecting the sensorimotor cortex to the caudate got an overlap of under 20%. This can be explained by the fact that these fascicles connect small and deep nuclei (caudate, putamen, thalamus) to large functional cortical areas (associative, limbic, sensorimotor), which makes a good overlap very difficult to achieve. The poor reproducibility highlights a certain level of \"hardness to track\" for these connections, even with advanced crossing fiber HARDI techniques.\nFurthermore, the regions they connect are quite complex such as the limbic cortical areas, the subcortical areas and the basal ganglia, and their area of termination depends on the quality of automatically segmented atlases. All of these factors are exacerbated by potential partial volume effects, motion, and poor resolution of acquisitions."}, {"section_title": "Clinical Implications", "text": "Precise motor function relies on the balanced interplay of motor circuits, in which the basal ganglia plays a major coordinating role.

While the trends of the changes can be understood and well explained in terms of the fundamentals of diffusion tensor modeling and other local reconstruction methods, such as the increased FA and apparent fiber density driven by reduction of radial and mean diffusivity, it is very hard to specifically apply a biological interpretation to these diffusion measure changes. Potential explanations for the increased FA in PD include: i) increased fiber density caused by axonal hypertrophy, ii) decreased fiber density on crossing pathways to the main motor connections from SN to motor cortex, and iii)\nalterations of the extra-cellular space (e.g. due to neuroinflammation).\nIn order to further probe these possibilities, it is necessary to go beyond single b-value high angular resolution diffusion imaging. Advanced diffusion imaging and sophisticated modeling with multiple shells and multiple diffusion times [70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75] may bring new answers in the near future and show the way to better interpretations. Further, imaging-pathologic correlations in appropriate animal models of PD would serve to further elucidate the biological underpinnings of the diffusion alterations."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We have established a reliable dMRI protocol for extracting robust disease-specific biomarkers.\nBy taking advantage of the multi-timepoint aspect of the PPMI dataset and using state-of-the-art processing methods, we have computed reliable DTI and HARDI diffusion metrics along WM fascicles connecting motor and pre-motor regions from the basal ganglia, substantia nigra and brainstem.\nUsing robust permutation statistics to compare healthy controls and PD populations, we have found statistically significant discriminant regions confirming existing literature. Tract profiling reveals that these changes do not appear everywhere along the WM fascicles, but are rather localized in precise and reproducible locations. There were significant increases in FA, apparent fiber density, tract-density, and generalized FA in the central part of connections between basal ganglia and substantia nigra as well as the extremities of the motor and premotor part of the corpus callosum and corticospinal tract. These WM integrity changes are driven by a reduction in radial diffusivity and mean diffusivity.\nOur confidence in these findings was confirmed by our proposed test-retest reproducibility measures that assess the reliability of extracted WM fascicles, and we stress the importance of future tract-based population studies to perform a similar analysis before reporting any statistics.
