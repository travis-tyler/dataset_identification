Psychotherapy is the primary treatment for BPD, with pharmacotherapy as an adjunctive treatment to target state symptoms [1] . In the last two decades, numerous psychotherapeutic approaches have been proposed for this diagnosis and their effectiveness in reducing symptoms and dysfunctions in behaviors seemed to be well supported, even though data on the improvement in social functioning is less optimistic [2] [3] [4] . Furthermore, these specialist treatments seem to have similar effects despite distinct theories and interventions. Moreover, despite progress, how psychological therapies produce this improvement is not fully understood [5] . Neurobiological studies could clarify the mechanism of change of psychotherapy for BPD and this could improve our knowledge of the pathophysiology underlying the disease. In particular, several MRI studies explored the neurobiological correlates of the disorder, showed volume reduction in amygdala and hippocampus [6] [7] [8] [9] , thickness decrease of the prefrontal cortex [10] [11] [12] , and volume reduction in various regions of the temporal and parietal lobes [13, 14] , as compared with healthy subjects. In the field of fMRI studies, the hyperactivity of the amygdala and hypo-activation of frontal areas in response to emotional stimuli in BPD samples [15] seems to be one of the most robust finding. These results were interpreted as the biological substrate of the core symptoms of the disease and, in particular, emotional dysregulation. The key question is whether psychotherapy is able to impact cerebral structures and functional activities and connectivity.\nWhile the majority of the neuroimaging studies of psychotherapeutic treatments have been conducted on Axis I disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder [15] [16] [17] [18] , mood disorders [19] [20] [21] , panic disorder [22] , social anxiety disorder [23] , specific phobia [24, 25] , and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [26] , only a few studies explored the impact of psychotherapy in personality disorder and the most are in the context of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy for BPD. Goodman and colleagues showed BPD patients showed an overall decrease in amygdala after 12 months of DBT while the overall amygdala activation of the HC (healthy control) was comparable at baseline and 1 year follow-up [27] .\nA previous pilot study on 6 BPD patients showed comparable results, in particular a decreasing hemodynamic response to negative stimuli in the right-sided anterior cingulate, temporal and posterior cingulate cortices as well as in the left insula after a 12-week in-patient treatment program [28] . In another interesting study on a 12-weeks DBT program, patients exhibited reduced activity and increased connectivity in neural networks related to salience processing and emotion regulation after treatment [29, 30] . Preliminarily, some effects on brain structure, in terms of increased gray matter volumes in regions that are critically implicated in emotion regulation and higher-order functions, such as mentalizing, have been described [31] .\nFurthermore, Perez and colleagues [32] showed that after 1 year of Transference-Focused Psychotherapy [4] BPD patients showed relatively increased activation in dorsal prefrontal (dorsal anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal, and frontopolar cortices) in relation with treatment effect, and relatively decreased activation in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampal after the intervention. Noteworthy, an increased left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activation resulted positevely correlate to clinical improvement in constraint, while left posterior-medial orbitofrontal cortex/ventral striatum activation and negatively with right amygdala/parahippocampal activation seemed to be positively associated to clinical improvement in affective lability correlated. These results are very intriguing and they gave a great contribution to clarify possible mechanisms associated to clinical changes induced by the psychotherapy. No neuroimaging study has yet assessed the effect of other psychotherapy interventions on neurobiological features, e.g. approaches specifically oriented to increase mentalizing [3] or metacognition [33] that are often compromised in BPD and represent one of the core features in BPD patients. Metacognition, as conceptualized by Semerari [33] , is the general capacity to think about thinking. Scarce metacognitive abilities have been associated to the difficulty to deal with interpersonal problems and deficit in using problem-solving strategies and choosing adaptive behaviors [34] . Metacognitive Interpersonal Therapy (MIT) is a cognitive behavior-based psychotherapeutic approach aimed to increase metacognitive abilities in order to improve general personality functioning and to promote better interpersonal relationships [35] . More in detail, MIT is designed to support patients in learning to recognize and integrate different mental states and in improving their ability to solve interpersonal problems using mentalistic knowledge of themselves and others.\nThe aim of the present study is twofold. The primary outcome will be the change in emotion dysregulation, measured by the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale -DERS, [36, 37] after 12 months of MIT treatment in subjects with BPD. The secondary outcomes will be the effect of MIT on neurobiological (changes in cerebral patterns of activation in response to emotional visual stimuli during fMRI scans) and other clinical features. Lastly, we will study the correlation between patients' metacognitive profiles and structural and functional brain imaging features."}, {"section_title": "Method/design", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Trial design", "text": "The study design is a randomized parallel controlled clinical trial.

"}, {"section_title": "Interventions", "text": "Patients will be randomly allocated to one of two interventions: Metacognitive Interpersonal Treatment (MIT) [35] or Structured Clinical Management (SCM) [1] delivered in each recruitment centre.\nMIT is a cognitive behavioral-oriented psychotherapy designed to ameliorate metacognitive abilities and to enhance interpersonal relationships [35, 41, 42] . Metacognition pertain to a comprehensive set of cognitive and affective skills aimed to identify mental states, reasoning about them, and attributing them to themselves and others [33, 43] . These skills allow people to understand the reason why other persons react in such way, on the basis of own regularities and constructing personal meaning over their lifespan [44] . MIT is conceptualized to target the general psychopathology of personality. Treatment consists in 50-min one weekly individual session and a metacognitive skill training group (90 min) that cover a period of about 6 months during the year of the treatment. The MIT is manualized and follows a goal hierarchy, as proposed by the authors of the theoretical model [35] . In particular, the main goals of the treatment are: 1) the assessment of symptoms, mental state, metacognitive functions, interpersonal problems, emotion regulation skills; 2) intervention on the aspects that interfere with the therapeutic alliance and/or threaten the patient's life (in particular, self-harming/ suicidal behaviors); 3) intervention on symptoms that cause suffering to the patient; 4) intervention to promote the integration of different mental states MIT sessions will be supervised by the authors of the theoretical model through audio-record and the analyses of the narratives.\nSCM is an evidence-based intervention that reflects \"best general psychiatric treatment for BPD\" and it's feasible for use by \"generalist mental health clinicians\" with minimal additional training [45] . It was developed based on \"expert consensus\" about what general practices work best for treating this condition. SCM is the active comparator used in several study on BPD psychotherapy showing to be effective across an array of clinical outcomes [46] . SCM is tailored on BPD symptomatology and employs a supportive approach with case management and advocacy support. There is an emphasis on psychoeducation, problem-solving, explicit safety planning, medication review and assertive follow-up if appointments are missed. As the comparator, SCM treatment consists in 50-min one weekly individual session and a problem solving group (90 min) that cover a period of about 6 months during the year of the treatment.\nTreatment retention was measured by the total number of weeks with at least one session and the number of weeks from the first to the last session attended. Patients were classified as having completed treatment if the time between the first and last sessions was at least 12 months between the 1st and the last session. Dropouts will be defined as those missing four consecutive sessions with no ascertained reason.\nTreatment adherence. MIT therapists will be supervised throughout the duration of treatments, and treatment fidelity will be assessed using audiotaped sessions. For each therapist, 2 entire sessions will be recorded and evaluated by 2 senior therapists who developed the MIT, to ensure that the treatment is being done in a rigorous, reproducible, and similar way. As part of the assessment of fidelity, a treatment manual will be developed (as describe above). After each session, each MIT therapist will be required to fulfill a checklist on MIT strategies and techniques in order to monitor the fidelity. For SCM, bimonthly supervision will be mandatory to monitor the case management."}, {"section_title": "Therapists' requirements", "text": "Psychotherapies will be delivered by 12 \"expert therapists\", with 4-year training in psychotherapy (psychodynamic-or CBT-oriented), a minimum of 2 years of clinical experience and a minimum of 1 year of experience treating BPD patients. More specifically, MIT therapists involved in the project will have received an intensive training in MIT (48 h), 4 years with Cognitive Behavioral are required. For SCM therapists, a 16 h-training on SCM will be delivered, no specific theoretical model will be required but expertise in treating BPD.\nIn each arm, patients will be randomly assigned to therapists within 2 weeks from the randomization."}, {"section_title": "Pharmacological treatment", "text": "In order to reduce the possible confounding effect of pharmacotherapy, both on clinical and neuroimaging measures, an adaptation of the APA Guidelines [1] will be adopted to harmonize the prescriptions. Briefly, it includes the following principles: 1) Treatment is symptom specific, directed at particular behavioral dimensions; 2) Affective dysregulation and impulsivity/ aggression are risk factors for suicidal behavior, self-injury, and are given high priority in selecting pharmacological agents; 3) Medication targets both acute symptoms (e.g., anger treated with dopamine-blocking agents) and chronic vulnerabilities (e.g., temperamental impulsivity treated with serotonergic agents).\nSymptoms to be targeted are divided in three groups: Affective dysregulation symptoms, Impulsive behavioral symptoms and Cognitive-perceptual symptoms and each of this has specific recommendation."}, {"section_title": "Primary outcome", "text": "The primary outcome measure will be changes in emotion regulation, measured by the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) [36, 37] .

Metacognitive functions will be measured with the MAI, a semi-structured clinical interview aimed to evaluate the metacognitive abilities of patients. The interviewers ask for a report of an emotionally meaningful experience or life event occurred in the previous 6 months, in which the subject and another person was involved. After the spontaneous report of the situation, interviewers asked a series of specific questions designed to evaluate the four metacognitive subfunctions (monitoring, integration, differentiation, and decentration).\nSymptoms Check-list 90 Revised (SCL-90-R) [49] . General psychopathology will be assessed with the SCL-90-R, a 90 item self-report inventory aimed to measure the presence of psychological symptoms. The SCL-90-R assessed nine symptom dimensions: (1) Somatization; (2) Obsessive-Compulsive; (3) Interpersonal Sensitivity; (4) Depression; (5) Anxiety; (6) Hostility; (7) Phobic Anxiety; (8) Paranoid Ideation; and 9) Psychoticism. For the purpose of our study, we will used the Global Severity Index (GSI), which is the mean value of all of the items, and is considered a measure of global symptomatic distress.\nBeck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) [50] . Depressive symptoms will be evaluated by the BDI-II, a 21-item self-report questionnaire measuring the severity of depressive symptoms in the past 2 weeks with higher scores correlating higher levels of depression.\nState-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) [51] . State and Trait anger will be assessed with STAXI-2, that is a 57-item inventory which measures the intensity of anger as an emotional state (State Anger) and the disposition to experience angry feelings as a personality trait (Trait Anger). The instrument consists of six scales measuring the intensity of anger and the disposition to experience angry feelings. Items consist of 4-point scales that assess intensity of anger at a particular moment and the frequency of anger experience, expression, and control.\nBarratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) [52] is a questionnaire aimed to evaluated impulsiveness. The BIS-11 identifies three factors that express three different dimensions of impulsivity: Motor impulsiveness, Impulsivity without planning and Cognitive impulsivity and provides a general index of the construct, as a total score. These scales have shown a good reliability and validity with other measures of the same dimension and the total score of the BIS-11 is an internally consistent measure of impulsiveness.\nInterpersonal functioning will be assessed by Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP) [53] . IIP is a 57 items self-report, evaluating different dimensions of interpersonal features (interpersonal sensitivity, interpersonal ambivalence, aggression, need for social approval, and lack of sociability).\nAlexithymia will be measured by Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) [54] , a self-report consisting of 20 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale. TAS-20 provide a total score and three subscales: Difficulties Identifying Feelings; Difficulties Describing Feelings; and Externally Oriented Thinking, which refers to a specific tendency to focus on superficial matters and to avoid emotional thinking (Bagby, et al., 1994) .\nChildhood traumatic experiences will be evaluated by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) [55] . The CTQ includes a 28-items that measures 5 types of maltreatment -emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, and emotional and physical neglect.\nThe attachment experience will be assessed by the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ) [56] that is a 40-item survey that uses a 6-point Likert-type scale. The ASQ yields five factor scores: one is a factor representing secure attachment, the other four represent a particular aspect of insecure attachment.\nData on demographics, suicide attempts, self-injury and aggression episodes, hospitalizations, and pharmacotherapy will be collected.\nAt the baseline, the neuropsychological test battery included measures used to assess nonverbal reasoning (Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices), verbal fluency (phonemic and semantic), visuospatial capacity (Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Copy) , and attention and executive function (Trail Making Test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Stroop Test), memory (Story Recall, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Recall , Digit Span). All of the neuropsychological tests were administered and scored according to standard procedures [57] .\nFurthermore, all participants completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) [58] , the Reading the Mind in the Eyes (RME) [59] , the Facially expressed emotion labeling (FEEL) [60] and an experimental task to assess emotional priming (Emotional Priming Paradigm, EPP) [61] .\nAdditionally, we will collect blood samples at baseline and at the different time of observation in order to explore possible peripheral biomarkers of emotional dysregulation and related to the limbic system, neuroplasticity, presence of inflammation and stress response and to observe modifications during treatment."}, {"section_title": "Neuroimaging protocol", "text": "Structural, functional and diffusion MRI following the ADNI protocol [62] will be acquired in BPD patients twice, at the baseline and after treatment, in order to assess functional and structural brain changes after psychotherapy.

Image acquisition will be performed on a 3 Tesla scanner with a 64 Channels RF HEAD COIL (Skyra Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) at the Unit of Neuroradiology -Spedali Civili Hospital (Brescia, Italy). In order to assess the cerebral patterns of activation in response to emotional visual stimuli, during fMRI scans (EPI sequence TR/TE 2000/30 ms, voxel size of 2.2 \u00d7 2.2 \u00d7 3.5 mm), participants will view unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant photographic pictures from the IAPS [63] . In particular, the fMRI study paradigm will be adapted from other studies [27, 64] . Briefly, a total of 96 intermixed unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant photographic images will be presented twice in a random order for a total of 192 trials [27, 64] . Participants will be instructed to watch the picture and then make a three-choice response (unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant) with their dominant hand, basing on the meaning for them personally.

Previous studies reported that the standard deviation (SD) of DERS was 20.7 in females and 18.8 in males [36] . Thus, we assumed a SD of about 20 points. In addition, the correlation between two evaluations (12 months apart) was expected around 0.7 (indicating that about 50% of the variance of the second measurement should be explained by the first measurement). We computed that the SD of DERS changes will be about 15. Our hypothesis is that MIT will decrease DERS more than SCM and, more precisely, a difference between MIT and SCM mean effect larger than 10 points will be considered clinically relevant. To recognize such difference as statistically significant (at bilateral alpha level of 0.05) with an adequate power (0.80), the total number of patients to be recruited should be 60, raised up to 80 (40 MIT + 40 SCM), considering an attrition rate around 20%."}, {"section_title": "Randomization", "text": "After baseline assessments, eligible participants will be assigned to treatment arms using randomly generated block randomization scheme within each center.

First, the population included in the project represents a clinical priority of mental health system for several reasons (high suicidal risk, high direct and indirect costs, long-term impairment and social dysfunctioning), moreover in Italy there is a paucity of intervention specifically oriented to this clinical group.\nSecondly, our project's contribution will be to test the effectiveness of a psychotherapeutic approach and to identify the clinical and neurobiological factors associated with response to the treatment. The inclusion of a multidisciplinary study protocol will allow to study BPD considering different features that can affect the treatment response and their reciprocal relationships.\nThe RCT CLIMAMITHE will contribute to deepen this topic, studying in particular the change in emotion dysregulation comparing the two treatments and the relation between these and changes in neurobiological aspects. The rationale to include emotional dysregulation as primary outcome is manifold. From a clinical point of view, emotional dysregulation is one of the core dimensions of BPD and the relationship between emotion regulation capacities and metacognitive abilities has not been yet clearly addressed. In the definition proposed by Gratz and Roemer [36] , emotion regulation includes also metacognitive aspects (awareness and understanding of emotions, the ability to control impulsive behaviors and to behave flexibly in accordance with desired goals when experiencing negative emotions). We will investigated the relationship between emotion regulation, metacognitive abilities and other BPD features. From a methodological point of view, DERS has demonstrated good psychometric properties, in terms of internal consistency, test-retest reliability and validity [36, 37] . Lastly, DERS has been previously used to measure clinical and neurobiological change after DBT [27] .\nThe use of the same behavioral task during fMRI used in other study will let the results to be comparable and this could diminish the variabilities of their interpretation. Moreover, the expected number of patients to be included could overcome the limitations of other studies with a small sample.\nIn addition to ED, another core feature of BPD is the deficit in mentalizing, but no RCT with neuroimaging focused on this variables. By investigating specifically metacognition, this study will permit to contribute to the study on the mechanism of change in BPD treatments and help to provide date to the analisys on \"what is expected to change in BPD?\" and \"which are the specific aspects that mainly contribute to the improvement of the patients' symptomatology\". In fact also changes in other clinical variables will be investigate and correlate to neuroimaging data.\nMoreover, BPD is a heterogeneous diagnosis with numerous comorbidities and different clinical endophenotypes based on subgroups of symptoms (impulsive symptoms, cognitive symptoms, interpersonal symptoms and affective symptoms) [66, 67] . We plan to search for specific pattern in the sample and investigate the relationship with the neurobiological variables. This is the first RCT on BPD conducted in Italy."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and limitations", "text": "The main strength of the project is the synergy between clinical and biological expertise. Although psychotherapies are delivered in routine clinical settings, a dedicated research team coordinates and supports the activities of the project. The periodic supervision and the systematic assessment of fidelity delivered by the authors of the MIT is an effort to reduce variability and to maximize the treatment adherence. The multidimensional clinical assessment gives the opportunity to characterize BPD patients. One possible limitation is represented by the presence (possible but not mandatory) of pharmacotherapy, which could have an impact both on clinical and neurobiological aspects. Although the pharmacotherapy does not represent the first choice in the treatment of BPD patients, it is well documented that pharmacotherapy is very common both in the United States and in Europe, with a percentage of patients prescribed medication ranging between 70% to more than 80% [68] [69] [70] . Furthermore, polypharmacy is also a common practice, with more than one-third of participants with BPD in these studies taking at least three drugs. One possible strategy to avoid that the presence of medication represents a potential confounding factor on clinical and neurobiological outcomes could be the enrollment of drug-na\u00efve/ free patients. On the one hand, this strategy could be potentially useful, on the other hand it would lead to include a group of patients that might not be representative of the clinical real world where BPD patients are commonly treated with pharmacotherapy. We will minimize this source of variability by using a standard methodology to prescribe pharmacotherapy [1] . Furthermore, the large number of subjects will allow us to conduct additional analyses on sub-groups of patients who were given similar treatments. Another critical aspect could be adherence to the psychotherapy, but in the definition of the sample size we considered an attrition rate of 20% to mitigate this problem, coherently with other similar study."}, {"section_title": "Trial status", "text": "The protocol was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with the number identifier of NCT02370316.
