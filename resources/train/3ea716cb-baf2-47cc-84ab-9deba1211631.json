Understanding the dynamics of coastal systems is important to maintaining the sustainability of these regions. Diverse geologic settings make up coastlines, and specific processes have helped to create these distinguishable coasts. Inman and Nordstrom (1971) explained how the coast is governed by first-and higher-order geomorphic processes. First-order processes refer to tectonics that influence the geologic structure and morphology of a coastline. Higher-order processes include second-order processes such as localized erosional and depositional patterns, followed by hydrodynamic processes (e.g., wave action, longshore transport) that create smaller coastal features (e.g., spits). Inman and Nordstrom (1971) also offer insight into how marine and terrestrial influences can alter a coastline, as well as the importance of millennial-scale sea-level change. These higher-order geomorphic processes have created much of the surficial coastal landscapes we observe today. The foci of this thesis are the higher-order processes, such as erosion and deposition in the Roanoke Island region of North Carolina, and how they influence the overall coastal morphology on a modern time-scale (~100 years). This region of North Carolina is located on an Amero-trailing-edge coast, typical of the Atlantic Coast of the United States (Inman and Nordstrom, 1971). Many estuarine systems are found along this setting, including the Albemarle-Pamlico estuarine system (APES), which is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by the Outer Banks barrier island system (Figure 1). This long barrier chain is located on a Quaternary sedimentary geologic framework within the Albemarle Embayment in the Northern Coastal Province of North Carolina (Riggs and Ames, 2003;Mallinson et al., 2008). This sedimentation study focuses on the Croatan and Roanoke sounds, with particular emphasis on the subtidal regions surrounding Roanoke Island (Figure 2). The back-barrier estuarine and Roanoke Island shorelines have received less attention than the ocean side of the Outer Banks, but face similar hazards (e.g., erosion) as well. There are approximately 20,000 km (~12,000 miles) of estuarine shoreline in North Carolina, consisting of 65% marsh, 20% swamp forest, 10% sediment bank, and 5% modified shorelines (McVerry, 2012). This region is constantly undergoing physical changes associated with sea-level rise, storm events, and anthropogenic modification. Shoreline erosion also has the potential to affect coastal sedimentation (e.g., sediment accumulation) (Tully, 2004;Marciniak, 2008;Eulie, 2014). This study builds on preliminary efforts by applying four primary objectives as follows: 1) to characterize the modern and surficial sedimentary patterns of the seabed; 2) to evaluate modern sediment accumulation; 3) to examine shoreline change over a range of temporal scales; and 4) to evaluate the sediment budget of the region."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Many North Carolina barrier island segments have experienced shoreline loss on the back-barrier and ocean sides through storm events and disruptions in sediment supply (Timmons et al., 2010). The inability of overwash processes to supply new sediment to the back-barrier shoreline in many cases is further leading to island narrowing in many segments of the barrier system, in addition to anthropogenic modification of the shoreline (e.g., conversion of fringing marsh to developed shoreline). Currently much of the developed Outer Banks area, and undeveloped areas (e.g., Pea Island), are sediment starved, due to lack of overwash processes, further slowing or preventing landward migration (Riggs and Ames, 2003;Smith et al., 2008;Riggs et al., 2011). Anthropogenic shoreline modification (e.g., shoreline hardening) is taking place throughout North Carolina, including those regions of interest in this study (e.g., Roanoke Island and the Nags Head back-barrier; McVerry, 2012). These shoreline modifications are used to reduce the potential erosion via long-term sea-level rise, and short-term storm impacts by waves (Riggs and Ames, 2003). Wave energy not only leads to shoreline change, but also to changes within the seabed. Alterations in shoreline morphology and rates of change may influence how sediment is dispersed within the system, and where modern sediment is accumulating. With coastal property having great economic and ecological value, it is important to understand the mechanisms behind shoreline change and sedimentation in this region (Riggs et al., 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Shoreline Change", "text": "Riggs and Ames (2003) investigated shoreline erosion within the estuarine and coastal system of North Carolina via historical maps and aerial imagery analysis, and from their work and previous literature, they suggested that the recession rate is a function of shoreline type and fetch. Their research provided insight into variations in shoreline types (e.g., marsh) and drivers of erosion (e.g., storms). Riggs and Ames (2003) also believe climatic conditions associated with storms impact erosion, such as storm frequency, storm type and direction, storm duration and intensity, resulting storm tides, and currents and waves. Based on qualitative observations throughout the APES, they suggest that storm tides allow for water to pile up along the shoreline, increasing coastal flooding and vulnerability to shoreline erosion, as wave energy is higher along the shoreline. Riggs et al. (2011) suggested that most shoreline erosion occurs as the result of acute high energy storm events, rather than a chronic day-to-day process. Both these studies note the importance of short-term storm impacts on dramatic erosional and accretional changes observed along the shoreline. Subsequent work has shown how estuarine shoreline change rates (SCR) can be controlled by differences in shoreline type (e.g., wetland, forest, sediment bank) and other known processes (e.g., Relative Exposure Index, fetch) (Cowart et al., 2010(Cowart et al., , 2011. To provide a more quantitative analysis, Cowart et al. (2010) conducted a case study of Cedar Island, North Carolina (NC), in which the estuarine shorelines in 1958 and 1998 imagery were digitized and compared. SCRs were calculated using transect-and point-based approaches, and data showed that erosion varied with land type. Cowart et al. (2011) presented a case study of the whole Neuse River Estuary. From analysis of shoreline change trends over the same 40-year period (1958-1998), they determined that >93% of the shoreline in this area was actively eroding (Cowart et al., 2011). An empirical relationship was developed to predict shoreline change rates based on mean fetch values. However, this equation overestimated erosion along high fetch shorelines, and underestimated erosion on sediment bank shorelines (Cowart et al., 2011). They acknowledged how these conservative predictions of erosion, based on fetch, may be more accurately estimated by incorporating shoreline type, wave energy, and shoreline modification. A study on Cedar Island, Virginia (note, different from above) investigated shoreline erosion and accretion along a barrier system over varying time-scales (i.e., 1852, 1994Nebel et al., 2013). This study reported a positive relationship between shoreline retreat and storm frequency, stating that Cedar Island, VA has been undergoing shoreline retreat throughout the time-interval, and overall, the island has been narrowing (Nebel et al., 2013). The long-term  average SCR in the region (-4.1 m/yr) was comparable to past studies, but the short-term (1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007) average SCR was much higher (-12.6 m/yr), and may be related to increased tropical storm activity after the 1970s (Nebel et al., 2013). This trend was also documented for adjacent Parramore Island to the south (Richardson and McBride, 2007). Estuarine shoreline change may influence seabed sedimentation by increasing sediment loading. In Pamlico Sound, there is a central basin that acts as a depocenter where sediments are actively accumulating, and the potential for marsh-derived sediment contribution has been hypothesized (Tully, 2004). Using shoreline erosion and sediment accumulation rates from Pamlico Sound, exported marsh sediment was estimated to be ~1.25 x 10 6 m 3 (Tully, 2004). The total volume of accumulated sediment was estimated at ~13.6 x 10 6 m 3 for the entire Sound (northern, central, southern), making the eroded marsh sediment contribution ~12% (Tully, 2004). Unlike Pamlico Sound, Croatan and Roanoke sounds have restricted flow, and there is no centralized depocenter. While higher rates of shoreline erosion will lead to greater delivery of sediment to a system, factors such as bathymetry, currents, and wave action will influence the fate of supplied sediment."}, {"section_title": "Estuarine Sediment Dynamics", "text": "Estuaries act as sediment traps that continuously evolve with dynamic hydrologic conditions and geomorphic changes (Kjerfve and Magill, 1989;Nichols, 1989). Sediment accumulation in estuaries varies with location due to differences in sediment input, hydrodynamic conditions, freshwater inflow, and geomorphology (Nichols, 1989). Rates of sediment accumulation in lagoonal estuarine systems (i.e., APES) can be categorized into three scenarios with respect to sediment input and relative sea-level (RSL) changes: (1) an accretionary \"surplus\", if the accretion rate exceeds the RSL rise rate; (2) an accretionary \"deficit\", if RSL rise exceeds the accretion rate; and (3) a balance between the two processes (Nichols, 1989). Sediment to an estuarine or lagoonal system can be derived from river input, the continental shelf, shoreline erosion, and by autochthonous biogenic production (Wells and Kim, 1989). Within the APES, most of the sediment in the deeper central basins consist of fine silt and organic-rich clays (Wells and Kim, 1989). This is also characteristic of the embayed river mouths and channels feeding the sounds, which act as traps for some of the fine sediment. Fine sand occurring along basin edges is thought to be the result of shoreline erosion from wave energy. The majority of the sand within eastern Pamlico Sound is believed to be derived from the barrier islands, adjacent shoals, and offshore sources (Wells and Kim, 1989). Organic-rich sediment (average composition: 10.7% organic matter, 76.2% mud, 13.1% sand) is the dominant sediment type in the Albemarle estuarine system (Riggs, 1996). Fine to medium quartz sand makes up the shallow perimeter platforms within the Albemarle estuarine system (Wells and Kim, 1989). Shoreline recession supplies sand and mud to the deeper basin, mixing with fluvial inputs from the rivers (Riggs, 1996). Lead-210 (t1/2: 22.3 years) dating is potentially useful for examining recent sedimentation. This technique has been used in North Carolina estuaries in numerous studies (Cooper et al., 2004;Tully, 2004;Abbene et al., 2006;Vance et al., 2006;Corbett et al., 2007;Corbett et al., 2009;Mattheus et al., 2010;Eulie, 2014), and in other coastal marsh and continental margin settings (Sommerfield and Nittrouer, 1999;Alexander and Venherm, 2003;Leorri et al., 2014). The short half-life of 210 Pb allows sediments to be dated up to approximately five half-lives (~120 years; Corbett and Walsh, 2014). Lead-210 is a naturally occurring radioisotope, which is produced in the atmosphere, water, and soil through decay of 222 Rn (t1/2: 3.82 days). Wet and dry deposition delivers atmospheric unsupported (excess) 210 Pb to the estuarine environment, where additional 210 Pb may also be produced within the water column via decay of 226 Ra. Radium-226 is the long-lived parent (t1/2: 1602 years) of 210 Pb, which decays to 222 Rn, ultimately producing 210 Pb (Corbett and Walsh, 2014) (Figure 3). Additional excess 210 Pb is scavenged onto particles in the water column before settling on the seabed. This excess 210 Pb, can be used for establishing a geochronology of sediments in many coastal systems (Corbett and Walsh, 2014). Cesium-137 (t1/2: 30.2 years) is an anthropogenic radioisotope derived from nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s-1960s and is often used to corroborate 210 Pb age dates (Corbett and Walsh, 2014). Maximum fallout occurred around 1963, creating a distinct peak in some sediment archives (Pennington et al., 1973). In areas of rapid sediment input and potential mixing, another short-lived isotope, 7 Be (t1/2: 53.3 days), can be used to evaluate sediment deposition over an annual time-scale (Walling, 2013;Walsh et al., 2014). This isotope is a naturally-occurring, particle-reactive tracer, which is produced by cosmic ray spallation of nitrogen and oxygen in the stratosphere and troposphere (Tully, 2004;Walling, 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Study Area", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Regional Setting", "text": "The development of the modern day APES is a result of sea-level rise after the Last Glacial Maximum, ~18,000 years before present (BP) (Riggs et al., 2011). The paleo-Roanoke River valley in the vicinity of the modern Albemarle Sound flooded first, approximately 12,000 years BP. By 9,000 years BP, the Tar-Pamlico and Neuse paleo-river systems beneath modern Pamlico Sound began to flood (Riggs et al., 2011). Inundation of these river valleys led to the formation of small estuaries, separated from the Atlantic by a peninsula region known today as Hatteras Flats. By 8,000 years BP, the modern coastal system began to develop (Riggs et al., 2011). This peninsula region was drowned around 7,000 years BP, initiating the modern day barrier island system, which formed more fully over the past 3,500 years (Riggs et al., 2011). Within the past few millennia, the barrier system has migrated landward and undergone numerous changes, including inlet formations and closures (Riggs et al., 2011). Relative sealevel rise rates are thought to have fluctuated over the past 2,100 years, with a general increase in relative sea-level rise (Kemp et al., 2011). The rate of relative sea-level rise for the 20 th century was between 3.0-3.3 mm/y for northeastern North Carolina (Kemp et al., 2009). Rates presently vary along the United States Atlantic coastline, with the highest relative sea-level rise rates in the Mid-Atlantic for the 20 th Century (Kemp et al., 2014;Figure 4). Presently, NOAA tide gauge measured sea-level rise rates range between 3.9-4.6 mm/y in the study area (Oregon Inlet-Duck, NC), based on records from 1977-2014 (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends.html). Often classified as a lagoonal estuary, the APES is a shallow system with limited seawater-estuarine exchange, due to very few inlets, and receives fresh water input from four major river systems (i.e., Chowan, Roanoke, Tar-Pamlico, and Neuse) and other smaller waterways (Wells and Kim, 1989). The APES is shallow, reaching approximately 7 m in the central basins of Albemarle and Pamlico sounds (Wells and Kim, 1989;Riggs, 1996). It is a micro-tidal estuary with an astronomical tidal range of 10-100 cm, with increasing range near the inlets. Strong winds associated with storms have a dramatic effect on water levels by increasing the water buildup in the direction of prevailing wind (Wells and Kim, 1989;Riggs and Ames, 2003). Croatan and Roanoke sounds, connecting Albemarle Sound and Pamlico Sound, are separated by Roanoke Island ( Figure 5). Compared to Albemarle Sound, salinity is much higher in Pamlico Sound (15-20 ppt) and in the southern reaches of Croatan and Roanoke sounds due to the proximity of Oregon Inlet (Wells and Kim, 1989;Riggs, 1996). The overall biodiversity in the APES is limited, typical of some brackish-water estuaries, with decreasing fauna/flora (e.g., seagrasses) to the north away from Oregon Inlet (O'Connor et al., 1973)."}, {"section_title": "Geologic Evolution", "text": "The Roanoke Island area is located in the Albemarle Embayment, within the Northern Coastal Province, and the upper 55-60 m of sediments in the Roanoke Island region is Quaternary in age (Parham et al., 2007), with areas in the northern Pamlico Sound containing up to 90 m of Quaternary sediments (Mallinson et al., 2005(Mallinson et al., , 2010Thieler et al., 2014). The lithofacies have been categorized in several studies of the Roanoke Island region, to understand the paleoenvironment and sea-level controls throughout the Quaternary (O'Connor et al., 1973;Eames, 1983;Rudolph, 1999;Parham, 2003;Parham et al., 2007). Eight lithofacies comprise the Holocene sediments within Croatan Sound, which comprise the surficial sediments in some locations ( Figure 6) (Rudolph, 1999). Quartz sand is the most common surficial unit, covering <0.75 m across majority of the sound. This layer likely represents reworked (eroded and winnowed) sediments that move with the currents, and in some areas, it appears as much as 3,500 years of estuarine depositional history has been erased due to active scouring (Rudolph, 1999;Riggs and Ames, 2003). The characterization of the Holocene sedimentary record in Croatan Sound has allowed for further interpretation into the modern sedimentary system (O'Connor et al., 1973;Rudolph, 1999). In ~1817, Roanoke Inlet closed, likely causing a change in hydrodynamics, diverting water flow to the south (O'Connor et al., 1973 'Connor et al., 1973 andRudolph, 1999). Caffey's Inlet also closed between 1811-1829, which would have further restricted water flow in Currituck Sound, moving it towards the south (Pilkey et al., 1998). With the inlet closures, tidal and fluvial flow was likely focused through Croatan Sound into Pamlico Sound. This change in hydrodynamics led to the switch from a depositional to erosional regime in Croatan Sound, and to a more depositional regime in Roanoke Sound (Figure 7) (O'Connor et al., 1973;Rudolph, 1999;Riggs and Ames, 2003). This augmented water flow deepened Croatan Sound and widened it through shoreline erosion, yielding an enlarged cross-sectional area (O'Connor et al., 1973;Riggs and Ames, 2003). Marshes that previously covered the southern boundary of the former Croatan Bay have undergone extensive erosion over the past 200 years ( Figure 8). These marshes, known as the Roanoke Marshes, and referred to throughout this study, stabilized and accreted laterally from the period of about 2,100 years BP until the early 1800s (Rudolph, 1999). The surface sediments of Roanoke and Croatan sounds have been classified by O'Connor et al. (1973) into nine different types, with differences related to bathymetry, sediment source, and underlying geology ( Figure 9) (O'Connor et al., 1973). The finest sediments were mapped in the deeper channels of eastern Croatan Sound. Shell-rich deposits are evident in deeper channels in northern Croatan Sound that are sourced from nearby oyster bioherms (O'Connor et al., 1973). These shell-rich gravel deposits also provide evidence of the erosive nature of the sound floor, likely by storm-enhanced currents. Peat and organic-rich mud occur off of the shorelines of Croatan Sound, with variable amounts of mud and sand throughout the sound. Roanoke Sound is mostly covered by clean sands associated with tidal channel and overwash deposits near/from Bodie Island (O'Connor et al., 1973)."}, {"section_title": "Climate and Hydrodynamics", "text": "Prevailing winds are southwest in the summer, and northeast in the winter (CRONOS Database, NC State Climate Office). During winter months, high pressure systems may interact with low pressure trough systems moving across the U.S., to produce counterclockwise circulation patterns and potentially strong nor'easters (Benton, 1980). In summer months, the Bermuda High pressure system is dominant offshore due to the presence of the Subtropical Convergence Zone (Benton, 1980 (Singer and Knowles, 1975)."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample Collection", "text": "Eighty-four estuarine surface samples ( Figure 10), five short push-cores (13-40 cm; Figure 10), and 18 marsh shoreline/mud flat grab samples ( Figure 11) were collected between December, 2013 and January, 2015.

Porosity (n) was determined based on the mass loss by drying and assumptions of the water and particle density for all surface and marsh grab samples and each core interval through the following equation: = (water volume (cm 3 )) (water volume (cm 3 ) + dry volume (cm 3 )) where the water volume is: where 1.015 g/cm 3 represents the average water density (based on average salinity) of the region.

A linear sediment accumulation rate (SAR) is calculated using: where Az is the activity at depth (dpm/g), Ao is the initial activity (dpm/g), \u03bb is the decay constant (0.03114 y -1 ) of 210 Pb, z is the sample depth interval (cm), and SAR is the linear accumulation rate (cm/yr) (Corbett and Walsh, 2014). The SAR can be obtained based on the best fit slope for the natural log of excess 210 Pb versus sample depth (Corbett and Walsh, 2014). This utilizes the \u03bb divided by the slope to calculate the SAR. Age of the sediment at specific depths can also be calculated by the relationship between depth and the SAR. Errors in the SAR are calculated by taking the standard error from linear regression of the excess 210 Pb activities down-core, and dividing that value by the product of the slope of best fit line and SAR."}, {"section_title": "Shoreline Change Data Collection and Analysis", "text": "All aerial imagery was georeferenced and the shoreline digitized to evaluate shoreline change over different time-scales (Geis and Bendell, 2008).

Seismic data for this project was collected using an EdgeTech Chirp 2-16 kHz subbottom profiling system. Side-scan data were obtained with an EdgeTech 4125-P. Both were deployed off of the R/V Stanley R. Riggs in May-June, 2014. The chirp and side-scan sonar tow fishes were both towed just below (~0.5 m) the water surface. A total of 28 chirp seismic lines (~25 km) were collected. The EdgeTech SEG-Y data was imported into the Seismic Micro-Technology (SMT) Kingdom Suite software, where navigation files were combined with the SEG-Y data after necessary corrections applied in Microsoft Excel. Horizons were digitized based on observable features (e.g., reflections, structures). Particular attention was given to identifying recent horizons, due to the focus of this study on modern sedimentation (past ~100 years).\nThe deepest depths in the study area were found in a narrow channel in northern Croatan Sound, where Croatan and Albemarle sounds converge, and in the vicinity of Roanoke Marshes. Roanoke Sound displayed shallower bathymetry overall. In Croatan Sound, a small terrace-like region was seen in the vicinity of the UNC CSI region, fronted by deeper bathymetry. This morphology was also apparent along the historical location of Roanoke Marshes (Figure 33). Before creating the KRIGED bathymetry surface, four regions were chosen where two bathymetry data-sets overlapped (1850/1851, 2002). These four regions all displayed deepening between the intervals, ranging from 0.7-1.8 m ( Figure 34; Table 7). A mosaic of side-scan sonar data near UNC CSI displayed areas of backscatter variability. Areas of high backscatter were seen and thought to represent sandy sediments, whereas variable low backscatter areas reflect organic-rich, fine sediments of eroded marshes ( Figure 35). Four of 28 chirp seismic lines (~25 km total) are presented and show variable bathymetry with sediment infilled regions ( Figure 12). A noticeable bathymetric high created by a sedimentary deposit can be seen in the seismic data ( Figure 36, Line A-A') and in the bathymetry (Figure 33). Line B-B' has an infilled channel feature with much of the line obscured by gas ( Figure 37). Line C-C' is a shore-normal transect along which cores and grab samples were collected (Figure 38). For example, core CSI-N-5 was obtained from an area of sediment infill, and a lack of potential infill regions is more consistent towards the east, where more peat material was noted. A shore-parallel line (Line D-D') displays an infilled paleo-channel ( Figure   39). A channel in this location was noted in Eames (1983), and may be the same channel as depicted in this seismic survey. whereas Roanoke Sound is dominated by fine to medium sands. Of interest is a dominant gravelly region along the southwestern shore of Roanoke Island, which is mentioned in the 1973 work and also occurs in this study at site RI-SW-2 ( Figure 40), associated with channel fill or bioherms. Based on field observations (e.g., grab samples) and literature review (O'Connor et al., 1973;Knebel, 1989Knebel, , 1991Rudolph, 1999;Riggs and Ames, 2003) regions containing abundant gravel material and exposed peat outcrops (not eroded peat blocks) are representative of an erosional surface, whereas organic-rich mud-dominated areas reflect locations of modernrecent deposition (Figure 41). The side-scan sonar survey conducted offshore of the UNC CSI displayed what appears to be either peat blocks or peat outcrops surrounded by a varying bottom surface, ground-truthed to consist of dominantly organic-rich mud, with some sandy locations. Using similar data, Knebel et al. (1989Knebel et al. ( , 1991 categorized sedimentary environments of into three categories: 1) environments of bedload transport/erosion, 2) environments of deposition, and 3) environments of sediment reworking. Erosional areas typically displayed exposed outcrops and highly reflective areas. Similarly, it was noted that depositional areas typically were featureless, finegrained sediment deposits (Knebel, 1989;Knebel et al., 1991). Rudolph (1999) (Figures 8, 34; Table 7). Based on depth, two regions in Croatan Sound were potentially modern accumulation areas and were investigated further: (1) a NW-SE trending northern central channel, and (2) a small deep N-S trending channel along the southwestern shore of Roanoke Island (Figure 33). Oyster shells and gravel were recovered within the northern channel, overlaying a firm light gray mud, interpreted to be lithofacies-1 (LF-1) \"Gray Mud\" (Rudolph, 1999). This lithofacies, common to the Holocene channel complexes, is interpreted as older Holocene sediment (Rudolph, 1999). The small channel southwest of Roanoke Island had a mud-dominated seabed with the highest LOI value for surface sediments (~10.5%). Analysis of a core further revealed fine-sediment deposition (Figure 22, Appendix 6), and radionuclide activities were suggestive of episodic sedimentation. Unlike Croatan Sound, Roanoke Sound is considered to be a depositional regime ( Figure   7, O'Connor et al., 1973). While the surficial sand layer is active and likely influenced by accretionary processes via remobilization, mud (>5%) in Roanoke Sound appears to accumulate primarily in Shallowbag Bay and in limited regions of northern and southern Roanoke Sound (Figures 15, 16). Thus, modern sedimentation in Roanoke Sound is likely controlled by remobilization of sand-sized sediments during high-energy events (e.g., storms), and mud accumulation is limited to lower energy environments.

The GRADISTAT statistical software program was used to calculate grainsize parameters for the sand and gravel fraction, and mud content was sufficiently small to have little influence (Blott and Pye, 2001). For the remaining 38 samples, nine contained a large portion of unconsolidated organic fragments (e.g., twigs, peat material) and were wet sieved through a 63\u00b5m sieve. The remaining organic fragments were assumed to not be a true representative bulk sediment sample and were not dry sieved. The remaining 29 samples, containing more than 5% mud, are presented only in regards to total percent mud present, due to the fact that phi sizes finer than 4\u0278 were not quantified ( Figure 16).

The >4\u0278 value incorporates all potential mud sizes into one representative value, since clay and silt were not quantified. Generally, the sediment fined with increasing distance from Roanoke Island, although some areas showed higher mud content directly adjacent to the shore (e.g., near UNC CSI, Figure 16). From the GRADISTAT analysis of the sand-dominated samples (<5% mud), four textural groups were identified: slightly gravelly sand (35), sand (3), gravelly sand (2), and sandy gravel (1). The majority of the 41 samples were unimodal (35), with the remaining bimodal (6). These samples ranged from very well sorted to poorly sorted, and were fine to very coarsely skewed (Appendix D). Eighty-two surface samples were analyzed for porosity ( Figure 17).

The UNC CSI marsh shoreline sediments generally had higher organic content and were muddier, while the Nags Head Woods samples were dominated by sandy material (~48% sand). Samples from the Whalebone and Pt. Peter sites were dominated by organic-rich mud at the scarp edge (>44% mud). Sandier sediment was typical at the Shallowbag Bay site (SB-Manteo, ~46% sand).

Core CSI-N-3 was dominated by peat material (3-13 cm) and was not sieved for grain-size analysis due to the amount of organic marsh material present. The LOI levels were lowest in the top 3 cm of the core, and increased down-core where more peat material was visually present. Porosity was high (>80%), except at a depth of 2.5 cm (46%). CSI-N-5 contained >50% mud from 1-20 cm, and <50% mud from 20-40 cm, with the exception of the sample at 25 cm (59% mud). The LOI percent was variable down-core, but an increase was noted deeper than 20 cm where a large amount of visual organic matter was present (e.g., peat fragments). The variation in porosity was similar to that of LOI percentages, lower from 0-20 cm, and higher at 20-30 cm depth. Grain-size for CSI-S-5 varied throughout, with minor changes between sand and mud content in the top 14 cm, and LOI was highest in the top 6 cm. Overall, porosity decreased down-core, but was still variable (porosity >63%), with the top 1 cm containing the highest value (~92%). See Appendix F for additional details for the UNC CSI cores, and Figure 19 for LOI trends down-core. Core CSI-N-5 had a linear accumulation rate of 0.37 \u00b1 0.04 cm/y. Only the data between 5 and 20 cm of depth was utilized, due to potential mixing in the first 5 cm, and older peat material below this interval ( Figure 20). Based on this sediment accumulation rate, this interval is representative of the early 1970s to ~2011. Core CSI-S-5 was calculated to have a linear accumulation rate of 0.26 \u00b1 0.02 cm/y for the same interval ( Figure 21). An accumulation rate could not be calculated for core CSI-N-3 due to the dominance of old peat material. Grain-size for DH-S17 was highly variable down-core, and two sandy layers (>40% sand) were present at about 6 cm and 20 cm depth. These were associated with reduced excess 210 Pb activity ( Figure   22). LOI amounts varied down-core ( Figure 19), with the lowest value corresponding to the highest sand content. Porosity generally varied with grain-size and LOI, with a decrease in porosity seen with decreasing mud content and lower LOI. See Appendix F for additional core details. Excess 210 Pb activities in this core were nearly vertical, indicating either significant biophysical mixing or rapid deposition. Given the down-core decrease in 7 Be and laminations of sand, rapid sedimentation events were hypothesized. Modeling the 7 Be isotopes in the same way as 210 Pb (assuming CF:CS), a rapid deposition rate of 2.3 \u00b1 0.5 cm/month was obtained. RI-SB-4 was mud-dominated (>50% mud) at the surface and gradually decreased to 20% mud at 20 cm. LOI ( Figure 19) and porosity percentages were >10% and >90%, respectively, near the surface and decreased with depth (Appendix F). Activity data from RI-SB-4 suggest a shift in sediment accumulation with time or a potential event-related deposition in the top 8 cm ( Figure 23; Figure 24: 0-8 cm vs. 8-20 cm). A whole core sediment accumulation rate was calculated to be 0.12 \u00b1 0.01 cm/y. However, taking into account the apparent shift in the slope of the down-core 210 Pb, accumulation rates of 0.37 \u00b1 1.0 cm/y from 0-8 cm and 0.08 \u00b1 0.01 cm/y from 8-20 cm were estimated.

Error was not calculated for the volumetric erosion rates, and the following assumptions were applied: 1) the average lateral SCR in the region was representative of the overall SCR for that area, and 2) the field measured scarp heights provided a representative vertical shoreline height of that specific shoreline region. Regions 1 and 2 are the mainland shoreline of Dare County. These regions are particularly exposed to northerly and southerly winds and waves, respectively. The cut-off for Region 1 and 2 was based on the visual change in SCRs, with noticeably less erosion in Region 1. Region 3 is almost entirely marsh shoreline, with some isolated sandy beaches. This region is exposed to the southwest, including the fetch of Croatan Sound. High rates of erosion were observed within the segment. Region 4 consists of Shallowbag Bay, a semi-enclosed bay system with marsh, sediment bank, and modified shorelines. This shoreline is sheltered from westerly winds and has a minimal (<6 km) fetch to the east across Roanoke Sound. Region 5 has a mixture of marsh, sediment bank, and modified shoreline, and displayed lower SCRs than Region 3. Regions 5-7 had some of the highest accretion rates, but also showed widespread erosion along with high wind/wave exposure to the northwest (Region 5) and southwest (Region 7). Regions 6 and 7 include central and southern Roanoke Sound, which are areas of restricted flow and widespread sandy sediments. Marsh scarps, at seven areas within the volumetric analysis regions noted above, were measured and assumed to represent the typical shoreline scarp height for that region (Table 5; Figure 11). Then, using average SCRs for the region, the average scarp height (RTK-GPS measurement), the total shoreline segment length, and an estimated dry bulk density (e.g., range between 0.5-1.0 g/cm 3 ), the sediment volume (m 3 /y) and mass (kg/y) eroded per year were calculated. The dry bulk density was averaged from marsh shoreline samples from the seven regions, and the top 5 cm of four shoreline cores (Nags Head Woods, UNC CSI). To estimate the total long-term eroded sediment volume and mass, the rates (per year) of shoreline volume (m 3 /y) and mass (kg/y) loss were multiplied by 97 years . Data were then summed to assess the total volume and mass eroded from the shoreline for the entire study region (Table   6). Based on the above assumptions, 8.3 x 10 6 m 3 of sediment was eroded from the shoreline over the 97-year period, with the highest volumetric and lateral change rates found in Regions 2 and 3 (dominated by marsh shoreline), and the lowest rates in Regions 4-7. Region 4 was composed of a much smaller shoreline extent, and Regions 5-7 had similar rates. The dry bulk density range (e.g., 0.5-1.0 g/cm 3 ) is a generalized representation, and is likely an underestimate since this range is common for marsh sediments, while sediment bank shorelines tend to have higher dry bulk densities. However, applying this range gave a total of 4.16 x 10 9 -8.32 x 10 9 kg (4.16 x 10 6 -8.32 x 10 6 tons) of eroded shoreline sediment from 1915 to 2012."}, {"section_title": "Shoreline", "text": "Fringing marsh shorelines are particularly susceptible to wave attack and have high erosion potential (Finkelstein and Hardaway, 1988). In general, the observations support a wealth of work indicating the influence of wave power on shoreline change (Schwimmer, 2001;Cowart et al., 2010Cowart et al., , 2011. Shoreline type is a large control on erosion potential, but the morphology of the shoreline in regards to potential wave energy is an important control as well. The geomorphic character of the estuary (e.g., bathymetry) likely continues to be an important driver in shoreline erosion (Eulie, 2014). As determined from bathymetric data comparisons collected through NOAA (http://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/bathymetry/), it is evident that certain regions have deepened since 1850, including scour of the northern-central portion of Croatan Sound and along the western shoreline of Roanoke Island (Figure 34; Table   7). Qualitatively, it appears that regions of high long-term shoreline erosion are typically associated with deeper areas of the estuary adjacent to the shore. For example, west of the UNC CSI, at the southern end of Roanoke Island, and along the mainland shoreline (southwestern Croatan Sound), there is a preponderance of high erosion (Figure 33). SCR differences between the eastern and southwestern shores of Roanoke Island may likely be due to enhanced waves coupled with stronger currents (Singer and Knowles, 1975). However, the importance of bathymetric influence is unclear. Based on a regression analysis (Figure 42), no significant correlation was found between the seabed gradient and SCRs in the 1915-2012 interval ( Figure   43). However, an analysis of the influence of fetch on SCRs showed correlation, albeit a weak relationship ( Figure 44; Table 8a-8b), suggestive of wave energy importance. In summary, the patterns of SCRs are complex, and it is likely a combination of anthropogenic influence, storm events, and morphological change that impact the observed trends. -scale (1915-1949, 1949-2012) The rates observed within the study area as a whole display a more negative (greater erosion) mean change rate (-0.78 \u00b1 0.21 m/y) for the 1915-1949 interval, when compared to any other interval (Table 3). Additionally, when looking at the percentage of significantly eroded sediment (\u22650.32 m/y), the 1915-1949 interval has more shoreline loss (57% vs. 46% for the 1949-2012 interval). When utilizing higher erosion rates (e.g., \u22651 m/y), an even larger difference is noted (33% for 1915-1949 vs. 14% for 1949-2012), indicating higher erosion rates in the earlier interval. Previous works have also calculated higher average erosion rates in earlier intervals for northern Croatan Sound (e.g., 1817-1851: ~15-18 m/y; 1851-1954: ~1-1.5 m/y) ( Figure 45, Riggs and Ames, 2003). This is clearly related to a more  al., 1973).

This period displayed high accretion in the back-barrier system, but  (Reed, 1989). This has been observed in other studies examining short-term events, where accretion may follow an erosive event (e.g., Hurricane Earl, 2010) (Eulie, 2014). Conversely, the short-term data here suggest rapid erosion is possible, likely in response to storm wave energy, for example in southwestern Croatan Sound (Figure 28). Long-term SCRs can provide insight into chronic changes, while short-term rates, due to events (e.g., hurricanes), can reveal more episodic variations in accretion and erosion that might not represent the long-term patterns in the system. Short-term change can also appear more dramatic if detachment of marsh mat/blocks occurs (Schwimmer, 2001). Ultimately, the longterm rates take into account (i.e., is the net result) many individual events, and these reflect the overall climatic and oceanographic conditions associated with this time-frame and area (e.g., currents, wave energy), whereas the short-term is more complex due to events. For this reason, scientists and managers must consider the variability in time and space when examining trends and making projections into future scenarios."}, {"section_title": "Anthropogenic, Climatic, and Geomorphic Impacts on the System", "text": "The latter half of the 20 th century brought increased development to this region of the coast, including modifications of the shoreline ( Figure 46) (e.g., shoreline hardening, dredging in Roanoke Sound). The large volume of water flow through Croatan Sound in conjunction with large fetch continue to drive high erosion rates in this region, and human-induced impacts (e.g., shoreline modification) have likely overprinted geomorphic responses in the intermediate-and short-term. Shoreline hardening and land-use changes not only affect the erosional or accretionary character of the shoreline, but also may alter sediment delivery and storage within the system. For example, visible in the data, the northern end of Roanoke Island, although exposed to a large northerly fetch, has displayed lower rates of erosion and even accretion in recent times (i.e., 2007-2012). Many segments of the shoreline here have been hardened, and sandy sediment may be undergoing remobilization in front of these structures, causing variability within SCRs (Cowart et al., 2011). This may cause temporarily accretionary regions along a modified shoreline in the short-term. Strandplain beaches have been shown to form along any shoreline type if a new source of sand is available (Riggs and Ames, 2003). However, the minor accretion observed in Figure 47 is <1 m/y along this region, where sediment bank fronts a hardened structure, and shoreline hardening has been shown to slow or even stop further recession (Riggs and Ames, 2003;Currin et al., 2015). Shallowbag Bay is another region that has undergone shoreline hardening, and changes in erosional and accretionary segments of the shoreline (note differences in SCRs, Figures 26, 27). When examining sediment accumulation in Shallowbag Bay, two noticeable trends in excess 210 Pb are noted, suggesting changes in the rates of accumulation. Based on data from 0-20 cm, an accumulation rate of 0.12 \u00b1 0.01 cm/yr was estimated; however, the excess 210 Pb profile of the core indicated two potentially differing rates (0.37 \u00b1 1.0 cm/y from 0-8 cm, and 0.08 \u00b1 0.01 cm/y from 8-20 cm) ( Figure 24). Change in sediment delivery to the bay may be related to several factors, including shoreline modification, as mentioned above. Noted in nautical charts, is a spoil area for dredged sediment in the southeastern section of the bay near Roanoke Sound (Figure 48). This material could now act as barrier, leading to more accumulated sediment in the deeper central portion of the bay. Additionally, the impact of land-use change on sedimentation has been reported in many coastal systems (Ryan et al., 2008). Data here also highlight how landscape modification may impact sediment supply to the system. Based on these data, it is difficult to fully assess whether these rates reflect a human-induced change of sediment to the system, or potential bioturbation within the upper 8 cm. Climate or event-driven changes are also challenging to identify in coastal sedimentary "}, {"section_title": "Shoreline Sediment Erosion vs. Subaqueous Accumulation", "text": "One question guiding this research was how the erosion of shoreline sediment relates to sediment accumulating on the seabed in the study area. RTK GPS-measured scarp heights were between 0.47-0.76 m, which are comparable to a study of Hog Island Bay ( Roanoke Sound sites typically had sandier marsh sediment, which may be influenced from greater sand resuspension in that region, while Croatan Sound had muddier marsh sediments (Table 2). Based on shoreline data (Table 6), an average of 8.6 x 10 4 m 3 /y is eroded from the shoreline, and it is estimated that a total of 8.32 x 10 6 m 3 (4.16-8.32 \u00d7 10 6 tons) of sediment has been removed from the shoreline over the 97-year study period."}, {"section_title": "Currin et al. (2015) examined sediment eroded from shoreline erosion for the New River", "text": "Estuary. For approximately 90 km of shoreline, volumetric erosion rates varied between 1.86 x 10 4 and 3.72 x 10 4 m 3 /y, depending on bank height (0.5-3 m) and shoreline type, utilizing SCRs from a 48-year time-interval   (Currin et al., 2015). In the New River Estuary, the scarp relief was more varied than in this study. However, the shoreline length used for Roanoke Island volumetric change rates is ~200 km, about 2.2 times that of the shoreline length of the New River Estuary study. If examining the range provided in the New River Estuary study, the Roanoke Island area annual contribution is between 1.6 to 2.3 times more than the New River Estuary exported amount. If the upper extremes of the New River Estuary are more likely, then the shoreline sediment exported from each study region is comparable when normalizing for shoreline length. Since shoreline types were not quantified for the SCR intervals in this thesis, it is only assumed both studies had similar overall lateral SCRs to have similar volumetric rates. Sediment accumulation rates determined in this study varied spatially and temporally. The UNC CSI core rates ranged between 0.26-0.37 cm/y, and are comparable to previously recorded rates in the APES (0.29-0.36 cm/y, Neuse River Estuary; 0.08-0.57 cm/y, Albemarle Sound; 0.11-0.42 cm/y, Pamlico Sound) (Tully, 2004;Corbett et al., 2007Corbett et al., , 2009. Although the range of rates in other regions can be large, the measurements observed in this study fall within previous ranges. Higher rates for the other estuarine systems occur where fine-sediments are depositing that have a fluvial origin (Corbett et al., 2007(Corbett et al., , 2009. The long-term rates in this study (1.2-3.7 mm/y) are below to within range of the relative sea-level rise rate estimates in the region (3.0-4.6 mm/y), suggesting accumulation is not outpacing sea-level rise, which is typically seen in lagoonal systems (Nichols, 1989) through the formation of accommodation space. Along the southwestern shore of Roanoke Island, confined within a narrow deep channel (4.9 m water depth), excess 210 Pb activities were nearly vertical down-core to 32 cm, indicating rapid deposition or biological mixing. DH-S17 is located in this channel and displayed sedimentation not on a decadal-centennial scale, but within a more rapid time-frame. The CF:CS model was applied to the first 12 cm of the core over the time-scale relevant to 7 Be. Sediment deposition in this channel occurred at 2.3 \u00b1 0.5 cm/month, probably associated with several small events or one large-scale event. This 7 Be profile of this core is unlikely from mixing given the lack of observed infauna, and two prominent sand lenses indicative of a depositional or erosive event prior to rapid sediment deposition in the top 12 cm. It is likely that this channel accumulates sediment due to the depth and grain-size content of the channel; however, episodic erosion/scour of the channel bottom likely prevents long-term accumulation and rather discontinuous events lead to depositional event layers as observed in the 7 Be profile . Although the cores used in this study are in the immediate alongshore region, it can be assumed that accumulation on the centennial-scale in the open sounds is likely prevented in areas undergoing active scouring, high wave energy, and high bed shear stress. Maximum bed shear stress was modeled and examined in the APES during a one hour period in September, 2008 (Clunies and Mulligan, personal communication, 2015, Figure 50). Regions with high bed shear stress undergo sediment remobilization more readily than other areas with lower shear stress. The higher shear stress observed in northern Croatan Sound explains the erosional regime within that region. This has been observed with deepening of the northern-central channel (Figures 34, 45; Table 7). Shear stress was relatively high as well along the Dare County mainland shoreline in Croatan Sound, which may have indicated higher wave energy along that stretch of shoreline, where the highest erosion rates and currents (0.5 m/s, Singer and Knowles, 1975)  Overall, as a function of water depth, area, and accumulation rates, approximately 9.32 x 10 3 m 3 /y (7.24 x 10 6 kg/y) of sediment is estimated to be accumulating in the system (Table 9). When comparing this rate to the volume of eroded sediment per year over the 1915-2012 interval (8.57 x 10 4 m 3 /y), the accumulating area only accounts for ~11% of the amount of annually eroded material. Eulie (2014) also conducted a sediment budget of fine-grained sediments in the Tar-Pamlico estuary, and determined that 93% of the sediment derived from shoreline erosion and the Tar River Basin is stored in that estuary. When comparing the Roanoke Island region to the Tar-Pamlico estuary, it is evident that the Roanoke Island region is an export system ( Figure   53). Identifying the source of sediment is difficult; however, based on the high organic content (% LOI) of the accumulating sediment (Figure 20), much of the modern sediment is likely marsh-derived. It appears the majority of the eroded material is exported out of the study area into Albemarle and Pamlico sounds. Since this thesis addresses modern organic-rich mud accumulation only, further refinement of this budget could include incorporating alongshore sand deposits that may also be erosion derived from sediment banks."}, {"section_title": "6.0", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This thesis provides insight on modern (past ~100 years) morphological changes associated with an estuarine system that has undergone significant hydrodynamic changes in the past two hundred years. These data may be used to help interpret other geological processes 4) A CF:CS modeled increase in the accumulation rate is noted in Shallowbag Bay (RI-SB-4), which likely indicates greater sediment delivery and/or storage in recent time. However, when examining accumulation on long-term scales (~100-y), the UNC CSI sites display higher accumulation (0.26-0.37 cm/y) when compared to Shallowbag Bay (0.12 cm/y). Data from Hatteras, NC indicates that wind speeds have decreased on a decadal-scale through averaged daily wind speeds. This may have an impact on wave energy and overall erosion potential to the system, and may be a driver for lower erosion rates (e.g., erosion \u22650.32 m/y: 1915-1949; 46% during 1949-2012). Previously modeled bed shear stress (Clunies and Mulligan, personal communication, 2015) has offered insight into areas prone to seabed sediment remobilization, with higher regions of bed shear stress indicating more remobilization and episodic sediment deposition (e.g., DH-S17)."}, {"section_title": "5)", "text": "These data indicate most of the eroded sediment is exported out of Croatan and Roanoke sounds. The sediment accumulation rates are too low to account for the total material exported from shoreline erosion over the 97-year interval (8.32 x 10 6 m 3 , 4.16 x 10 9 -8.32 x 10 9 kg), but it is likely that modern sediment is constrained to small, localized areas in bathymetric lows not influenced by current and/or wave action as indicated in the sediment budget (9.32 x 10 3 m 3 /y, 7.24 x 10 6 kg/y). When comparing the volume of accumulated sediment to the volume of eroded sediment in the 1915-2012 interval (8.57 x 10 4 m 3 /y), the accumulated sediment accounts for only ~11% of the amount of annually eroded sediment.

The timing of this LOI process is highly dependable on the type of furnace used. 9) Remove crucible and sediment and weigh to obtain the total amount of sediment after LOI. This provides the percent total organic content lost for the bulk sample. 10) Save sediment and use to calculate the inorganic sand and mud fraction. 11) Since sediment has been in extreme heat for 12+ hours, transfer the sediment to a small beaker and add a small amount of 0.05% Calgon (< 20 g) solution to help with the disaggregation of mud particles. Use a stirring rod to help with the process, and once the sediment has disaggregated, it is ready for wet sieving. 12) Wet sieve through a 63 micron sieve to remove all mud content.

Use the weight of the dried sediment after LOI as the representative total inorganic sediment dry fraction, and subtract the dry inorganic sand fraction from that to obtain the estimated inorganic dry mud fraction. These should add up to 100%. 15) In order to look at all three components (organic content, inorganic sand, inorganic mud), take the original LOI % value, and subtract from 100. The remaining percentage value is what the two inorganic fractions compose.
