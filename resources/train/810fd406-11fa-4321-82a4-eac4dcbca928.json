We describe and compare cow-calf operations by size, farm resource regions, and states, and measure their relative competitiveness. We estimate a Cobb-Douglas production function using stochastic production frontier (SPF) techniques. Our results suggest there is opportunity for most cow-calf operations to increase the efficiency of their operations. Statistically significant results of the Cobb-Douglas stochastic production frontier model with half-normal distribution are given in Table 1. The halfnormal density function was chosen based on the (AIC) test. \u2022 Results of the maximum likelihood estimates of the input elasticities (x1, x2, x3, and x4) are significantly different from zero with expected signs. \u2022 Land provides a greater contribution compared to other inputs. \u2022 Operator education is significant and positively correlated with production. \u2022 Operations with stockers produce greater output than those without stockers. \u2022 Returns to scale are decreasing. We use USDA's 2008 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data, cow-calf survey. This data is cross-sectional and includes detailed information about farm size, production costs, business arrangements, production facilities and practices, and farm operator and financial characteristics of beef cow-calf farms. Data are from 22 states and include only beef cow-calf operations with \u226520 cows. Expansion factors allow for inference to 90% of the U.S. cow-calf farm population. Our sample consists of 653 beef cow-calf farms in the Southeast (AL, AR, FL, GA, KY, MS, TN, and VA), of which 47 observations have missing values.

The Cobb-Douglas functional form has performed favorably compared with more flexible functional forms in measuring production firms' relative efficiency levels using production functions. For the beef cow-calf production model, we employ the following model to estimate factors affecting the technical efficiency of southeastern farms: where are inputs, is output, are farm specific characteristics, are dummy variables for regions and states, is a dummy variable for farmer age and education; and 0 , , , , and are the parameters to be estimated. is an error term composed of \u2212 for the random error component and the technical inefficiency error, respectively. For the analysis, one output and four inputs developed from the ARMS data for cow-calf farms are: y1 = gross value of beef cow-calf production x1 = quality-adjusted land value x2 = cost of allocated overhead (capital recovery of machinery and equipment, taxes and insurance, and general farm overhead) x3 = cost of labor (hired plus opportunity cost of unpaid labor) x4 = operating costs (cattle for backgrounding, veterinary and medical, bedding and litter, marketing, custom services, repairs, interest on operating capital, fuel, lube, and electricity) Farm characteristics include: Portion of cattle that are purebred Portion of farm returns from cattle Portion of cattle returns from stockers Operator age Operator holds a college bachelors degree 17 state / production region dummy variables (combinations of 8 southeastern states and 5 ERS production regions)."}]
