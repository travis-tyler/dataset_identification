[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Purpose Precise evaluation of serum testosterone levels is important in making an accurate diagnosis of androgen deficiency. Recent practice guidelines on male androgen deficiency recommend that testosterone be measured in the morning while fasting. Although there is ample evidence regarding morning measurement of testosterone, studies that evaluated the effect of glucose load or meals were limited by inclusion of hypogonadal or diabetic men, and measurement of testosterone was not performed using mass spectrometry. Methods Sixty men (23-97 years) without pre-diabetes or diabetes who had normal total testosterone (TT) levels underwent either an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) after an overnight fast. Serum samples were collected before and at regular intervals for 2 h (OGTT cohort) or 3 h (MMTT cohort). TT was measured by LC-MS/ MS. LH and prolactin were also measured. Results TT decreased after a glucose load (mean drop at nadir = 100 ng/dL) and after a mixed meal (drop at nadir = 123 ng/ dL). Approximately 11% of men undergoing OGTT and 56% undergoing MMTT experienced a transient decrease in TT below 300 ng/dL, the lower normal limit. Testosterone started declining 20 min into the tests, with average maximum decline at 60 min. Most men still had TT lower than baseline at 120 min. This effect was independent of changes in LH or prolactin. Conclusion A glucose load or a mixed meal transiently, but significantly, lowers TT levels in healthy, non-diabetic eugonadal men. These findings support the recommendations that measurement of serum testosterone to diagnose androgen deficiency should be performed while fasting."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Male hypogonadism is a clinical syndrome resulting from low testosterone levels due to dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis. The diagnosis of hypogonadism is based on the laboratory finding of consistently low serum testosterone levels in the presence of specific symptoms of androgen deficiency [1] . Hence, precise measurement of testosterone is critical in making an accurate diagnosis. As various clinical practice guidelines suggest specific, cutoffs for testosterone levels, care must be taken to avoid factors that transiently lower serum testosterone levels as otherwise these patients might be misclassified as hypogonadal. Use of accurate assays in the measurement of sex steroids is important and has received much emphasis recently [1, 2] . In addition to the assays, several other considerations are also important during the evaluation of androgen deficiency. One important consideration is measurement of serum testosterone in the morning. Indeed, a large body of data confirms that serum testosterone secretion has a diurnal rhythm and its concentration varies widely during the day, with peak levels occurring during the morning hours [3, 4] . Based on these observations, clinical practice guidelines for male androgen deficiency have recommended that serum testosterone levels, in a patient presenting for evaluation of hypogonadism, should be assessed in the morning [1] .\nAnother important consideration is whether measurement of testosterone in the evaluation of androgen deficiency be performed in a fasting state. Although the most recent Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend that testosterone should be drawn in a fasting state [1] , these recommendations are based on studies that either had a small sample size, enrolled a heterogenous population of men or did not use reliable methods for testosterone measurement [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . For instance, some studies enrolled men with impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [10, 12] , conditions known to be associated with low testosterone [14, 15] , while other studies enrolled men who were either hypogonadal or had other comorbidities [10] [11] [12] . Therefore, inclusion of men with heterogenous characteristics in previous studies makes it difficult to ascribe the decline in serum testosterone concentrations solely to glucose load or meals. Furthermore, studies that did enroll healthy men either had a very small sample size or did not measure serum testosterone with liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), the gold-standard method [16] . Not surprisingly, the findings from these studies were not unanimous with some reports showing a transient decrease in total testosterone levels [independent of changes in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , while others did not observe any significant change [5] . Furthermore, the response in luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion was also variable and was not helpful in elucidating the mechanisms by which feeding might influence testosterone secretion. Lastly, these studies did not measure serum prolactin levels, a hormone that is known to increase in post-prandial state and suppresses testosterone production by inhibiting gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) synthesis.\nConsidering that the influence of a glucose load or meals on morning serum testosterone levels in metabolically healthy eugonadal men has not been evaluated using stateof-the-art assays, we evaluated two cohorts of eugonadal men to understand whether acute feeding affects circulating testosterone concentrations: (1) The first cohort included healthy, non-obese, eugonadal men from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA) without diabetes and a normal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) that was performed using frequent blood sampling (OGTT Cohort); (2) The second cohort comprised of healthy, eugonadal, nonobese, non-diabetic men who were part of a protocol to evaluate metabolic response to a mixed meal; these men underwent a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) and underwent frequent sampling during the test (MMTT Cohort). Our objective was to determine whether 75 g of glucose load (concentration of glucose in some beverages) or a mixed meal results in any changes in serum testosterone level; to determine whether these changes occur at any specific time points during these tests, and whether oral glucose load or mixed meal has any differential effects on serum testosterone concentrations."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The OGTT cohort"}, {"section_title": "Design and participants", "text": "The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) has been investigating human aging since its establishment by the National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program in 1958 [17] .

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Accurate diagnosis of male androgen deficiency is important so that only those men who are likely to benefit are started on testosterone therapy. Over the years, various clinical practice guidelines on male androgen deficiency syndromes recommend that a diagnosis of hypogonadism be made only in patients with specific signs and symptoms and consistently (and unequivocally) low morning testosterone concentrations [21] [22] [23] [24] . The most recent Endocrine Society guidelines also recommended that serum testosterone measurement should be performed while the patient is fasting [1] . These latest recommendations are based on a limited number of previous studies [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] that were limited by inclusion of either hypogonadal, prediabetic, or diabetic men. Furthermore, these studies did not utilize goldstandard methods for measurement of testosterone nor measured serum prolactin levels. The present study was designed to overcome these limitations. Herein, we report that ingestion of either a glucose load or a mixed meal results in a significant decrease in serum total testosterone levels (as assessed by LC-MS/MS) in healthy, non-diabetic, eugonadal men. Participants achieved reductions in serum testosterone levels by as much as 39% with the glucose load and 56% after a mixed meal; this drop resulted in serum testosterone levels dropping below the normal range in a significant number of participants. Thus, our observations support the recent recommendations by the Endocrine Society guidelines that measurement of testosterone in the evaluation of androgen deficiency should be performed after an overnight fast [1] . As this reduction in serum testosterone concentrations was non-trivial even in healthy non-diabetic men, it is conceivable that this decrement might be of a greater magnitude in men who are obese or have metabolic syndrome.\nPrevious studies had reported mean reduction in serum total testosterone concentrations between 10-35% with either OGTT or MMTT (Fig. 3 ) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Although the exact mechanism by which this reduction occurs remains unclear, none of the previous studies observed any significant change in SHBG concentrations either following a glucose load [10, 11] or administration of meals [5, 8, 9] , suggesting that the fall in serum testosterone is real and not simply a reflection of reduction in serum SHBG levels. What remains unclear is whether this decline in testosterone is due to a central process or secondary to reduced testicular secretion as some previous studies reported an increase in LH levels while others showed no change [6, 8, 10 ]. In the current study, we did not observe any significant change in serum LH levels following either a glucose load or mixed meal despite measuring serum LH levels at multiple time points in both cohorts. The reason for these contrasting findings might be due to the fact that LH is secreted in a pulsatile manner and its measurement at limited time points may not be sufficient to draw meaningful inferences. A previous study that performed serial LH sampling at 10-min intervals for 6 h reported that glucose ingestion dampened LH pulsatility but did not affect basal or total LH secretion [12] . Since the decrease in serum testosterone concentrations observed in these studies (including the current study) was not associated with a parallel decline in serum LH levels, it does suggest that this decline is not solely mediated by a central mechanism; however, the absence of a concurrent rise in LH levels in response to the fall in testosterone does suggest some degree of central involvement. Indeed, exposure of immortalized GnRH cell line to high concentrations of glucose results in impairment in GnRH synthesis and secretion in vitro and leads to their apoptosis. Though speculative, it is conceivable that the Fig. 2 Mean serum levels of glucose, insulin, prolactin, LH, and total testosterone in metabolically healthy eugonadal men before and in the 3 h following a mixed meal. Data are means and error bars are SEM. p-values calculated by paired t-test with BonferroniHolm correction comparing baseline to follow-up measurements. *p < 0.05. LH luteinizing hormone, total T total testosterone sudden increase in serum glucose concentrations might transiently impair GnRH synthesis and/or release [25] . Hyperprolactinemia, of any etiology, suppresses hypothalamic GnRH synthesis and/or secretion and is an established cause of central hypogonadism [26, 27] . It has also been known that serum prolactin concentrations increase post-prandially, particularly after high-protein meals [28] [29] [30] . We had hypothesized that a surge in prolactin levels might be contributory to this transient decrease in serum testosterone levels, however, serum prolactin concentrations did not increase significantly in either cohort, in fact its levels decreased after glucose load. This suggests that postprandial decline in serum testosterone levels is not a consequence of hyperprolactinemia. Another mechanism that might be responsible for post-prandial reduction in testosterone level is increased secretion of inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). This cytokine is known to increase in healthy men in response to glucose administration [31] ; it blunts LH response to GnRH administration [32] and directly suppresses testosterone secretion by Leydig cells [33, 34] . The role of cytokines in this context should be explored in future studies.\nThe observations of the current study have important practical ramifications. Coming for a blood draw after an overnight fast is not convenient for many patients, in particular for older men and those who take medications in the morning. Consequently, many patients ask that instead of a full breakfast they could have orange juice, coffee, or other breakfast beverages before coming to the laboratory. Considering that a cup of some special coffee beverages contains up to 60 g of sugar and that a glass of orange juice contains 30 g of sugar (Supplementary Table) , it is conceivable that consumption of these beverages might have an influence on serum testosterone concentrations. Therefore, it is prudent that the practitioners advise their patients to present for testosterone measurement after a complete overnight fast. In select patients suspected of having metabolic syndrome, this fasting visit can also serve as an avenue for measuring certain metabolic parameters such as fasting glucose and lipid profile.

The present study has several strengths: (i) careful exclusion of hypogonadal, prediabetic, and diabetic men to avoid any confounding effect of their condition on changes in testosterone levels; (ii) evaluation of healthy men without chronic illness; (iii) measurement of serum testosterone using LC-MS/MS, the gold-standard method; (iv) measurement of serum prolactin levels in parallel with testosterone measurement; and, (v) measurement of hormonal parameters at multiple time points. Additionally, since intake of pure glucose load or mixed meal may result in variable changes in testosterone levels, we evaluated responses to both interventions. Lastly, the composition of the mixed meal was carefully standardized. The study also has a few limitations. The sample size in the MMTT study was small, though comparable to some previous studies. We did not measure SHBG levels; however, this was intentional as none of the previous studies observed any effect of a glucose load or meals on serum SHBG levels [5, [8] [9] [10] [11] . Lastly, we did not measure inflammatory cytokines, which might have shed some additional light on the mechanism behind post-prandial reduction in testosterone."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We demonstrate a significant reduction in concentrations of serum total testosterone in healthy men in response to an oral glucose load (mean reduction of 18% from baseline) and administration of a mixed meal (mean reduction of 26% from baseline.
