In addition, the percentage of students who reported having been in a physical fight on school property was higher for 9th-graders than for 10th-graders. Students in grades 9-12 were also asked how many times they had been in a physical fight, both anywhere and on school property, during the previous 12 months. In 2017, about 18 percent of students in these grades reported having been in a physical fight anywhere 1 to 3 times, 4 percent reported having been in a physical fight anywhere 4 to 11 times, and 2 percent reported having been in a physical fight anywhere 12 or more times (figure 12.3 and table 12.2).

In addition, the percentage was higher for American Indian/Alaska Native students (32 percent) and Black students than for Asian students. Since 2015, the YRBS has included a question to identify students' sexual orientation by asking students in grades 9-12 which of the following best described them-\"heterosexual (straight),\" \"gay or lesbian,\" \"bisexual,\" or \"not sure.\" 68 In 2017, a higher percentage of gay, lesbian, or bisexual students than 68 In this indicator, students who identified as \"gay or lesbian\" or \"bisexual\" are discussed together as the \"gay, lesbian, or bisexual\" group. Although there are likely to be differences among students who identify with each of these orientations, small sample sizes preclude analysis for each of these groups separately. Students were not asked whether they identified as transgender on the YRBS. of heterosexual students reported using alcohol on at least 1 day during the previous 30 days (37 vs. 30 percent), as well as on 3 to 29 days during the previous 30 days (18 vs. 13 percent; figure 14.3 and table 14.2).

In 2017, state-level data on the percentages of students in grades 9-12 who reported using alcohol during the previous 30 days were available for 39 states and the District of Columbia (table 14.3). 69 Among these jurisdictions, the percentages of students who reported using alcohol on at least 1 day during the previous 30 days ranged from 11 percent in Utah to 34 percent in Louisiana. Not sure ! Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30 and 50 percent. NOTE: Students were asked which sexual orientation-\"heterosexual (straight),\" \"gay or lesbian,\" \"bisexual,\" or \"not sure\"-best described them. This indicator uses data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) to examine the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported they had used marijuana during the previous 30 days. It then examines the percentage of students who reported they had been offered, sold, or given an illegal drug on school property in the 12 months preceding the survey. Readers should take note of the differing time spans and locations. While marijuana use on school property was not asked in more recent versions of the YRBS, students' overall use can be important to know within a school context. For example, marijuana use has been associated with decreased academic performance in adolescence (Meier et al. 2015;Pardini et al. 2015) and a higher risk of dropping out of high school (Bray et al. 2000). In 2017, about 20 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported using marijuana at least 1 time during the previous 30 days. This was lower than the percentage reported in 2001 (24 percent) but not measurably different from the percentage reported in 2015 (figure 15.1 and table 15.1). Specifically, in 2017 about 7 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported using marijuana 1 or 2 times during the previous 30 days, 9 percent reported using marijuana 3 to 39 times during the previous 30 days, and 4 percent reported using marijuana 40 or more times during the previous 30 days (table 15.2). In every survey year between 2001 and 2011, the percentages of students in grades 9-12 reported using marijuana at least 1 time during the previous 30 days were higher for male students than for female students (figure 15.1 and table 15.1). Since 2013, there has been no measurable difference in the percentages of males and females that reported using marijuana at least 1 time during the previous 30 days. In 2017, a higher percentage of males (5 percent) than of females (3 percent) reported using marijuana 40 or more times during the previous 30 days (table 15.2). In 2017, some differences in the percentages of students who reported marijuana use were observed by race/ethnicity and grade level. The percentage of Asian students (7 percent) who reported using marijuana at least 1 time during the previous 30 days was lower than the percentages reported by Pacific Islander students (16 percent), White students (18 percent), students of Two or more races (20 percent), Hispanic students (23 percent), Black students (25 percent), and American Indian/ Alaska Native students (30 percent; table 15.1). The percentage for White students was also lower than the percentages for Hispanic and Black students. In addition, the percentage of 9th-graders (13 percent) who reported using marijuana at least 1 time during the previous 30 days was lower than the percentages of 10th-graders (19 percent), 11th-graders (23 percent), and 12th-graders (26 percent) who reported doing so. The percentage for 10th-graders was also lower than the percentages for 11th-and 12th-graders. Since 2015, the YRBS has included a question to identify students' sexual orientation by asking students in grades 9-12 which of the following best described them-\"heterosexual (straight),\" \"gay or lesbian,\" \"bisexual,\" or \"not sure.\" 70 In 2017, a higher percentage of gay, lesbian, or bisexual students (31 percent) than of heterosexual students and students who were not sure about their sexual orientation (19 percent each) reported using marijuana at least 1 time during the previous 30 days (figure 15.2 and table 15.1). Additionally, a higher percentage of gay, lesbian, or bisexual students reported using marijuana 1 to 2 times and 3 to 39 times, compared to heterosexual students and students who were not sure about their sexual orientation (table 15.2). A higher percentage of gay, lesbian, or bisexual students than heterosexual students reported using marijuana 40 or more times.  6.6 9.6 5.5 9.0 13.8 7.6 3.5 7.3 5.8!\nIn 2017, state-level data for students who reported using marijuana at least 1 time during the previous 30 days were available for 39 states and the District of Columbia (table 15.3). 71 Among these jurisdictions, the percentages of students who reported using marijuana ranged from 8 percent in Utah to 33 percent in the District of Columbia. In the YRBS, students in grades 9-12 were asked whether someone had offered, sold, or given them an illegal drug on school property in the 12 months preceding the survey. 72 The percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported that illegal drugs were made available to them on school property decreased from 29 percent in 2001 to 20 percent in 2017 (figure 15.3 and table 15.4). However, no measurable differences were found between the percentages in 2015 and 2017. In 2017, there was no measurable difference in the percentage of males and females who reported that illegal drugs were offered, sold, or given to them on school property. In contrast, in every survey year from 2001 to 2015, a higher percentage of male than of female students reported that illegal drugs were offered, sold, or given to them on school property. 71 U.S. total data are representative of all public and private school students in grades 9-12 in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. U.S. total data were collected through a separate national survey rather than being aggregated from state-level data. 72 \"On school property\" was not defined for survey respondents. In 2017, a higher percentage of Hispanic students (25 percent) than of students of Two or more races (19 percent), Black students (19 percent), White students (18 percent), Asian students (18 percent), and American Indian/Alaska Native students (17 percent) reported that illegal drugs were made available to them on school property (figure 15.4). The percentage of students who reported that illegal drugs were made available to them on school property was lower in 2017 than in 2001 for students from all racial/ ethnic groups, with the exception of Black students for whom there was no measurable change over time. Although these longer-term changes were observed, no measurable differences were found between the 2015 and 2017 percentages for students of any racial/ ethnic groups (table 15.4). In 2017, public school students' reports of the availability of illegal drugs on school property varied across the 34 states for which data were available (table 15.5). Among these states, the percentages of students reporting that illegal drugs were offered, sold, or given to them on school property ranged from 12 percent in North Dakota to 31 percent in Arkansas.

Any instance of crime or violence at school not only affects the individuals involved but also may disrupt the educational process and affect bystanders, the school itself, and the surrounding community (Brookmeyer, Fanti, and Henrich 2006;Goldstein, Young, and Boyd 2008). For both students and teachers, victimization at school can have lasting effects. In addition to experiencing loneliness, depression, and adjustment difficulties (Crick and Bigbee 1998;Crick and Grotpeter 1996;Nansel et al. 2001;Prinstein, Boergers, and Vernberg 2001;Storch et al. 2003), victimized children are more prone to truancy (Ringwalt, Ennett, and Johnson 2003), poor academic performance (MacMillan and Hagan 2004;Wei and Williams 2004), dropping out of school (Beauvais et al. 1996;MacMillan and Hagan 2004), and violent behaviors (Nansel et al. 2003). For teachers, incidents of victimization may lead to professional disenchantment and even departure from the profession altogether (Karcher 2002;Smith and Smith 2006). For parents, school staff, and policymakers to effectively address school crime, they need an accurate understanding of the extent, nature, and context of the problem. However, it is difficult to gauge the scope of crime and violence in schools given the large amount of attention devoted to isolated incidents of extreme school violence. Measuring progress toward safer schools requires establishing good indicators of the current state of school crime and safety across the nation and regularly updating and monitoring these indicators; this is the aim of Indicators of School Crime and Safety."}, {"section_title": "Purpose and Organization of This Report", "text": "Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2018 is the 21st in a series of reports produced since 1998 by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) that present the most recent data available on school crime and student safety. Although the data presented in this report are the most recent available at the time of publication, the most recent two or more school years are not covered due to data processing timelines. The report is not intended to be an exhaustive compilation of school crime and safety information, nor does it attempt to explore reasons for crime and violence in schools. Rather, it is designed to provide a brief summary of information from an array of data sources and to make data on national school crime and safety accessible to policymakers, educators, parents, and the general public. Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2018 is organized into sections that delineate specific concerns to readers. The sections cover violent deaths; nonfatal student and teacher victimization; school environment; fights, weapons, and illegal substances; fear and avoidance; discipline, safety, and security measures; and campus safety and security. This year's report also includes a spotlight section on topics related to youth opioid use, perceptions of bullying, and active shooter incidents in educational settings. Each section contains a set of indicators that, taken together, describe a distinct aspect of school crime and safety. Where available, data on crimes that occur outside of school grounds are offered as a point of comparison. 1 Supplemental tables for each indicator provide more detailed breakouts and standard errors for estimates. A reference section and a glossary of terms appear at the end of the report. This edition of the report contains updated data for 16 indicators: violent deaths at school and away from school (Indicator 1); incidence of victimization at school and away from school (Indicator 2); prevalence of victimization at school (Indicator 3); threats and injuries with weapons on school property (Indicator 4); students' reports of gangs at school (Indicator 8); students' reports of being called hate-related words and seeing hate-related graffiti (Indicator 9); bullying at school and electronic bullying (Indicator 10); physical fights on school property and anywhere (Indicator 12); students carrying weapons on school property and anywhere and students' access to firearms (Indicator 13); students' use of alcohol (Indicator 14 ); marijuana use and illegal drug availability (Indicator 15); students' perceptions of personal safety at school and away from school (Indicator 16 ); students' reports of avoiding school activities or classes or specific places in school (Indicator 17); students' reports of safety and security measures observed at school (Indicator 20); criminal incidents at postsecondary institutions (Indicator 21); and hate crime incidents at postsecondary institutions (Indicator 22). In addition, this report includes three spotlight indicators: use, availability, and 1 Data in this report are not adjusted to reflect the number of hours that youth spend on school property versus the number of hours they spend elsewhere."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The indicators in this report are based on information drawn from a variety of independent data sources, including national surveys of students, teachers, principals, and postsecondary institutions and universe data collections from federal departments and agencies. The sources include BJS, NCES, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Office of Postsecondary Education, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Each data source has an independent sample design, data collection method, and questionnaire design, or is the result of a universe data collection. The combination of multiple, independent sources of data provides a broad perspective on school crime and safety that could not be achieved through any single source of information. However, readers should be cautious when comparing data from different sources. While every effort has been made to keep key definitions consistent across indicators, differences in sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and question phrasing can all affect the comparability of results. For example, both Indicators 19 and 20 report data on selected security and safety measures used in schools. Indicator 19 uses data collected from a survey of public school principals about safety and security practices used in their schools during the 2015-16 school year. The schools range from primary through high schools. Indicator 20, however, uses data collected from 12-through 18-year-old students residing in a sample of households. These students were asked whether they observed selected safety and security measures in their school in 2017; however, they may not have known whether, in fact, the security measure was present. In addition, different indicators contain various approaches to the analysis of school crime data and, therefore, will show different perspectives on school crime. For example, both Indicators 2 and 3 report data on theft and violent victimization at school based on the National Crime Victimization Survey and the School Crime Supplement to that survey, respectively. While Indicator 2 examines the number of incidents of victimization, Indicator 3 examines the percentage or prevalence of students who reported victimization. Finally, some indicators in this report are based on data from different sources than have been used in previous Indicators reports. This is due to data availability or efforts to improve analytic methodology or comparability. Table A provides a summary of some of the variations in the design and coverage of sample surveys used in this report. Several indicators in this report are based on selfreported survey data. Readers should note that limitations inherent to self-reported data may affect estimates (Addington 2005;Cantor and Lynch 2000). First, unless an interview is \"bounded\" or a reference period is established, estimates may include events that exceed the scope of the specified reference period. This factor may artificially increase reported incidents because respondents may recall events outside of the given reference period. Second, many of the surveys rely on the respondent to \"self-determine\" a condition. This factor allows the respondent to define a situation based upon his or her own interpretation of whether the incident was a crime or not. On the other hand, the same situation may not necessarily be interpreted in the same way by a bystander or the perceived offender. Third, victim surveys tend to emphasize crime events as incidents that take place at one point in time. However, victims can often experience a state of victimization in which they are threatened or victimized regularly or repeatedly. Finally, respondents may recall an event inaccurately. For instance, people may forget the event entirely or recall the specifics of the episode incorrectly. These and other factors can affect the precision of the estimates based on these surveys."}, {"section_title": "Introduction 4", "text": "to provide 10 to 20 years of trend data when available. In the case of surveys with long time frames, such as the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey and the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a decade's beginning year (i.e., 2001) often starts the trend line. The narrative for the indicators compares the most recent year's data with those from the established base year, often including analyses for intervening data points and the immediately preceding survey administration. In the tables for the indicators, data from selected earlier and intervening years are presented with the base year and most recent data to show a more complete trend. Where data from samples are reported, as is the case with most indicators in this report, the standard error is calculated for each estimate provided in order to determine the \"margin of error\" for these estimates. The standard errors of the estimates for different subpopulations in an indicator can vary considerably and should be taken into account when making comparisons. With the exception of Indicator 2, in this report, in cases where the standard error was between 30 and 50 percent of the associated estimate, the estimates were noted with an \"!\" symbol (Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation [CV] for this estimate is between 30 and 50 percent). In Indicator 2, the \"!\" symbol cautions the reader that marked estimates indicate that the reported statistic was based on 10 or fewer cases or the coefficient of variation was greater than 50 percent. With the exception of Indicator 2, in cases where the standard error was 50 percent or greater of the associated estimate, the estimate was suppressed, with a note stating, \"Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.\" See appendix A for more information. The appearance of an \"!\" symbol (Interpret data with caution) in a table or figure indicates a data cell with a high ratio of standard error to estimate, alerting the reader to use caution when interpreting such data. These estimates are still discussed, however, when statistically significant differences are found despite large standard errors. Comparisons in the text based on sample survey data have been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. Findings described in this report with comparative language (e.g., higher, lower, increase, and decrease) are statistically significant at the .05 level. Comparisons based on universe data do not require statistical testing, with the exception of linear trends. Several test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the comparison being tested. The primary test procedure used in this report was Student's t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Linear trend tests were used to examine changes in percentages over a range of values such as time or age. Linear trend tests allow one to examine whether, for example, the percentage of students who reported using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school increased (or decreased) with age. When differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordinal categories (such as grade), analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. Results of significance testing might differ slightly from those published elsewhere based on differences in how the testing was performed. Percentages reported in the tables and figures are generally rounded to one decimal place (e.g., 76.5 percent), while percentages reported in the text are generally rounded from the original number to whole numbers (with any value of 0.50 or above rounded to the next highest whole number). While the data labels on the figures have been rounded to one decimal place, the graphical presentation of these data is based on the unrounded estimates. Appendix A of this report contains descriptions of all the datasets used in this report and a discussion of how standard errors were calculated for each estimate. Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2018 in opioid use among 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-graders from 1995 to 2017, as well as by student and family characteristics in 2017. In addition, it looks at trends in students' reported ease of access to opioids and their perceived harmfulness of opioid use over time. Two main categories of opioids (heroin and narcotics other than heroin) and three time intervals during which drug use occurred (ever used, used during the past 12 months, and used during the past 30 days) are discussed in this spotlight. 3 Only drug use not under a doctor's orders is included in the use of narcotics other than heroin and the use of OxyContin and Vicodin, two commonly prescribed narcotics. In 2017, about 0.7 percent of 8th-graders reported ever using heroin, 0.3 percent reported using heroin during the past 12 months, and 0.2 percent reported using heroin during the past 30 days (table S1.1). Among 10th-graders, 0.4 percent reported ever using heroin, 0.2 percent reported using heroin during the past 12 months, and 0.1 percent reported using heroin during the past 30 days. While these overall rates were low, they nevertheless represented, for the year 2017, approximately 28,900 8th-graders and 16,600 10th-graders who had ever used heroin, 12,400 8th-graders and 8,300 10th-graders who had used heroin during the past 12 months, and 8,300 8th-graders and 4,200 10th-graders who had used heroin during the past 30 days. 4 3 Questions administered to 8th-and 10th-graders sometimes differed slightly from those administered to 12th-graders, and the points in time at which some questions were introduced also sometimes differed. Readers should take note of the grade(s) and year span(s) specified at each stage of the discussion. 4 These counts, as well as counts for 12th-graders in the following paragraph, are all based on projected fall 2017 public school enrollment (see  Also in 2017, about 0.7 percent of 12th-graders reported ever using heroin, 0.4 percent reported using heroin during the past 12 months, and 0.3 percent reported using heroin during the past 30 days. These rates translated to approximately 27,800 12th-graders in 2017 who had ever used heroin, 15,900 who had used heroin during the past 12 months, and 11,900 who had used heroin during the past 30 days. Data on the use of narcotics other than heroin not under a doctor's orders were also available for 12th-graders. Compared to 12-graders' use of heroin, 12th-graders' use of narcotics other than heroin was more common: 6.8 percent of 12th-graders reported ever using narcotics other than heroin, 4.2 percent reported using narcotics other than heroin during the past 12 months, and 1.6 percent reported using narcotics other than heroin during the past 30 days. These rates translated to approximately 269,600 12th-graders in 2017 who had ever used narcotics other than heroin, 166,500 who had used narcotics other than heroin during the past 12 months, and 63,400 who had used narcotics other than heroin during the past 30 days. Between 1995 and 2017, heroin use among 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-graders decreased across all use intervals. For instance, the percentage of 8th-graders who reported using heroin during the past 12 months decreased from 1.4 percent in 1995 to 0.3 percent in 2017 (figure S1.1 and table S1.1). This percentage also decreased from 1.1 to 0.2 percent for 10thgraders and from 1.1 to 0.4 percent for 12th-graders during the same period (figure S1.2 and table S1.1). Although the percentages of 12th-graders in 2017 who reported ever using narcotics other than heroin, using narcotics other than heroin during the past 12 months, and using narcotics other than heroin during the past 30 days were not measurably different from the corresponding percentages in 1995, they all represented decreases from their corresponding percentages in 2005. The use of OxyContin and Vicodin during the past 12 months also generally decreased for 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-graders between 2005 (the first year of data collection for these survey items) and 2017.

About 12 percent of public schools reported that cyberbullying had occurred among students at least once a week at school or away from school in 2015-16. Seven percent of public schools also reported that the school environment was affected by cyberbullying at least once a week, and 6 percent of schools reported that staff resources were used to deal with cyberbullying at least once a week (figure 7.3 and table 7.2). Public schools' reports on the occurrence of cyberbullying at school and away from school at least once a week varied by school characteristics in 2015-16. Higher percentages of middle schools and high schools reported cyberbullying among students (26 percent each) than combined schools (11 percent) and primary schools (4 percent). The percentage of public schools that reported cyberbullying among students was generally higher for schools with larger enrollment sizes. For instance, 27 percent of schools with an enrollment size of 1,000 or more students reported cyberbullying among students, compared to 13 percent of schools with 500 to 999 students enrolled and 9 percent of schools with 300 to 499 students enrolled.\n\n1 Includes students who reported being bullied 1 day in the school year but did not report how many times in the day the bullying occurred.

Students ages 12-18 who reported being bullied at school during the school year were asked to indicate how much bullying had a negative effect on various aspects of their life. In 2017, about 27 percent of students who reported being bullied at school indicated that bullying had somewhat or a lot of negative effect on how they felt about themselves, 19 percent each indicated that bullying had somewhat or a lot of negative effect on their school work and on their relationships with friends or family, and 14 percent indicated that bullying had somewhat or a lot of negative effect on their physical health (figure 10.5 and table 10.5). Students ages 12-18 were also asked whether they had been subjected to bullying related to a specific characteristic. In 2017, about 42 percent of students who reported being bullied at school indicated that the bullying was related to at least one of the following characteristics: physical appearance (30 percent), race (10 percent), gender (8 percent), disability (7 percent), ethnicity (7 percent), religion (5 percent), and sexual orientation (4 percent; table 10.6). As mentioned in the introduction, the YRBS collected data on electronic bullying for students in grades 9-12. In 2017, about 15 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported being electronically bullied during the previous 12 months (figure 10.6 and table 10.7). This percentage was not measurably different from the percentages reported in 2011 (the first year of data collection for this item) or in 2015. The percentage of students who reported being electronically bullied in 2017 was higher for female students than for male students (20 vs. 10 percent); higher for White students (17 percent) and students of Two or more races (16 percent) than for Black students (11 percent) and Asian students (10 percent) and higher for White students than for Hispanic students (12 percent); higher for gay, lesbian, or bisexual students (27 percent) and students who were not sure of their sexual orientation (22 percent) than for heterosexual students (13 percent); and higher for 9th-graders than for 12th-graders (17 vs. 13 percent). The YRBS also collected data on electronic bullying anywhere and bullying on school property at the state level. In 2017, data on the percentages of students in grades 9-12 who reported being electronically bullied during the previous 12 months were available for 39 states and the District of Columbia (table 10.8). 57 Among these jurisdictions, the percentages of students who reported being electronically bullied ranged from 9 percent in the District of Columbia to 21 percent in Louisiana. Data on the percentages of students in grades 9-12 who reported being bullied on school property during the previous 12 months were also available for 38 states and the District of Columbia. Among these jurisdictions, the percentages of students who reported being bullied on school property ranged from 12 percent in the District of Columbia to 27 percent in Arkansas. On this survey, 19 percent of students in the United States reported being bullied on school property in 2017.    Managing inappropriate behaviors and classroom disruptions is time-consuming and takes away from instructional time and student engagement in academic behaviors (Riley et al. 2011). In the National Teacher and Principal Survey (NTPS) administered in 2015-16, public school teachers were asked whether student misbehavior and student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching as well as whether school rules were enforced by other teachers and by the principal at their school. These questions were also asked in previous administrations of the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) from 1993-94 to 2011-12. The NTPS was designed to allow comparisons with SASS data. However, because the 2015-16 NTPS was administered only to public school teachers whereas the SASS was administered to both public and private school teachers, this indicator focuses on public school teachers only. During the 2015-16 school year, 43 percent of public school teachers agreed or strongly agreed that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching, and 38 percent agreed or strongly agreed that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching (figure 11.1 and table 11.1). These percentages varied by teacher and school characteristics. For instance, the percentage of teachers who reported that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching was higher for teachers with 3 years or fewer of teaching experience (47 percent) than for those with more years of teaching experience (ranging from 41 to 43 percent). The percentage was also higher for teachers in towns (44 percent) than for those in suburban and rural areas (40 and 37 percent, respectively). The same patterns by years of teaching experience and locale were observed for the percentage of teachers who reported that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching. A higher percentage of public secondary school teachers than of public elementary school teachers reported that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching (48 vs. 32 percent). Additionally, a higher percentage of teachers in schools with 1,000 or more students enrolled (46 percent) reported these behaviors than of teachers in schools with smaller enrollment sizes (ranging from 34 to 38 percent). The percentage of public school teachers who reported that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching fluctuated between 1993-94 and 2015-16. The percentage in 2015-16 (43 percent) was lower than in 1993-94 (44 percent) but higher than in the intervening survey years (ranging from 36 to 41 percent; figure 11.2 and table 11.1). The percentage of public school teachers reporting that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching increased between 1993-94 and 2015-16 (from 28 to 38 percent); however, there was no measurable difference between the two most recent survey years (2011-12 and 2015-16). During the 2015-16 school year, 67 percent of public school teachers agreed or strongly agreed that other teachers at their school enforced the school rules, and 84 percent agreed or strongly agreed that the principal enforced the school rules (figure 11.3 and table 11.2). These percentages also varied by school characteristics. For instance, a lower percentage of secondary school teachers than of elementary school teachers reported that school rules were enforced by other teachers (53 vs. 75 percent) and by the principal (82 vs. 85 percent), and a lower percentage of teachers in suburban areas than in rural areas reported so.

In 2017, differences in opioid use were found by student characteristics such as whether the student had a 4-year college plan and the education of the student's parents. Among 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-graders, those who had no plans to complete 4 years of college consistently reported higher rates of heroin use, use of OxyContin and Vicodin, and use of all narcotics other than heroin 5 during the past 12 months than students who had plans to complete 4 years of college. For instance, 1.7 percent of 8th-graders with no 4-year college plans reported using heroin during the past 12 months, compared with 0.2 percent of 8th-graders with college plans (figure S1.3 and table S1.2). The rates of heroin use for students without college plans versus students with college plans were 0.7 percent versus 0.1 percent among 10th-graders and 0.7 percent versus 0.2 percent among 12th-graders. Across all grades and types of opioids used, opioid use was generally more prevalent among students 5 Data for use of all narcotics other than heroin are only available for 12th-graders. whose parents had the lowest educational attainment than among students whose parents had the highest educational attainment. 6 However, the percentage of 12th-graders who reported using narcotics other than heroin during the past 12 months was higher among students whose parents had the highest educational attainment than among students whose parents had the lowest educational attainment (4.6 vs."}, {"section_title": "percent).", "text": "With respect to differences in the prevalence of opioid use by students' sex and race/ethnicity, different patterns emerged depending upon the type of opioid used.

In contrast, higher percentages of male than of female 8th-graders reported using OxyContin (1.0 vs. 0.6 percent) and Vicodin not under a doctor's orders (0.9 vs. 0.4 percent) during the past 12 months. Among 10th-graders, a higher percentage of Black students than of White students reported using heroin during the past 12 months (0.4 vs. 0.2 percent), while higher percentages of White students than of Black students reported using OxyContin (2.3 vs. 1.6 percent) and Vicodin (1.8 vs. 1.2 percent) during the past 12 months. Similarly, the percentage of 12th-graders reporting heroin use during the past 12 months was higher for Black (0.5 percent) and Hispanic (0.4 percent) students than for White students (0.2 percent), while the percentage reporting using narcotics other than heroin during the past 12 months was higher for White students (5.0 percent) than for Black (3.2 percent) and Hispanic (3.8 percent) students. Ease of access to opioids is one of the risk factors associated with youth opioid use. To assess the availability of opioids, the MTF survey asked students how difficult it would be for them to get heroin or narcotics other than heroin if they had wanted some. The percentage of students who reported that heroin would be fairly easy or very easy to get decreased between 1995 and 2017 among 8th-graders (from 21.1 to 8.1 percent), 10th-graders (from 24.6 to 10.6 percent), and 12th-graders (from 35.1 to 19.1 percent; figure S1.4 and table S1.1). The percentage of students who reported that narcotics other than heroin would be fairly easy or very easy to get also decreased during this period among 8th-graders (from 20.3 to 8.9 percent) and 10th-graders (from 27.8 to 17.7 percent). While the percentage of 12th-graders who reported that narcotics other than heroin would be fairly easy or very easy to get did not measurably differ between 1995 and 2017, it did decrease from a peak of 54.2 percent in 2010 to 35.8 percent in 2017. In 2017, as well as in 1995, the percentages of 10thand 12th-graders who reported that they could get narcotics other than heroin fairly easily or very easily were higher than the percentages who reported that they could get heroin fairly easily or very easily. However, the differences between these percentages were greater in 2017, indicating that it might be relatively easier to get narcotics other than heroin as compared to getting heroin in 2017 than in 1995. Specifically, in 1995, the difference between the percentages of students who reported they could fairly easily or very easily get narcotics other than heroin and students who reported they could fairly easily or very SOURCE: University of Michigan, Institute for Social Research, Monitoring the Future, selected years, 1995 through 2017. easily get heroin was 3.2 percentage points for 10thgraders and 4.7 percentage points for 12th-graders. In 2017, in comparison, the difference between the percentages of students who reported they could fairly easily or very easily get narcotics other than heroin and students who reported they could fairly easily or very easily get heroin was 7.1 percentage points for 10thgraders and 16.7 percentage points for 12th-graders. These larger differences in 2017 were mostly driven by the decrease between 1995 and 2017 in the percentage of students who reported they could get heroin fairly easily or very easily. Attitudes toward opioid use are also correlated with actual use (Sung et al. 2005). The MTF survey asked students how much they thought people risked harming themselves (physically or in other ways) if they were to engage in a given activity related to opioid use. Between 1995 and 2017, the percentage of students who thought people risked harming themselves greatly by taking heroin occasionally without using a needle decreased for both 8th-graders (from 76.8 to 74.7 percent) and 10th-graders (from 85.1 to 81.4 percent; figure S1.5 and table S1.3). Additionally, the percentages of 10th-graders who thought that people risked harming themselves greatly by trying OxyContin once or twice, by taking OxyContin occasionally, and by taking Vicodin occasionally all decreased between 2012 (the first year of data collection for these survey items) and 2017. Among 12th-graders, the percentages who thought people risked harming themselves greatly by trying heroin once or twice and by trying heroin once or twice without using a needle both increased between 1995 and 2017 (from 51 to 63 percent and from 56 to 65 percent, respectively), while the percentage who thought people risked harming themselves greatly by regularly taking any narcotic other than heroin decreased between 2010 (the first year of data collection for this survey item) and 2017 (from 75 to 71 percent). In 2017, higher percentages of 10th-graders than of 8th-or 12th-graders reported thinking that people risked harming themselves greatly by trying heroin once or twice without using a needle (72 vs. 63 and 65 percent, respectively) and by taking heroin occasionally without using a needle (81 vs. 75 and 73 percent, respectively). Higher percentages of 10th-graders than of 8th-graders also reported thinking that people risked harming themselves greatly by trying OxyContin once or twice (28 vs. 21 percent), trying Vicodin once or twice (22 vs. 17 percent), taking OxyContin occasionally (41 vs. 33 percent), and taking Vicodin occasionally (32 vs. 27 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Spotlight 2", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Perceptions of Bullying Among Students Who Reported Being Bullied: Repetition and Power Imbalance", "text": "In 2017, of students ages 12-18 who reported being bullied, 56 percent reported that they thought those who bullied them had the ability to influence what other students thought of them; 50 percent reported that those who bullied them were socially more popular; 40 percent reported that those who bullied them were physically bigger or stronger; 31 percent reported that those who bullied them had more money; and 24 percent reported that those who bullied them had more power in another way. Bullying is prevalent and often has significant negative effects on individuals, families, and schools. For example, students who are bullied are more likely to experience depression and anxiety, have more health complaints, and are more likely to skip or drop out of school (Swearer and Hymel 2015; Hornor 2018). The involvement of young bullying victims in recent suicides and school shootings has heightened concerns regarding the public health problem of bullying (Hornor 2018). It is important to understand youths' perceptions of bullying in order to design anti-bullying programs as well as assistance programs that can mitigate the negative effects of bullying. Bullying is often defined as containing three elements: repetition, power imbalance, and intent to hurt. 7 Repetition is defined as the recurrence of bullying behaviors. Power imbalance means that \"the power is in favor of the aggressor, with the victim of bullying finding him-or herself in an inferior status that makes it very difficult to put up any defense\" (Cuadrado-Gordillo 2012). Intent to hurt refers to the injurious effects of bullying: it inflicts physical, social, or psychological harm on the individuals who are bullied. Using the 2017 School Crime Supplement (SCS) to the National Crime Victimization Survey, this spotlight examines youths' perceptions of bullying regarding the elements of repetition and power imbalance in bullying and whether these perceptions vary according to student and school characteristics. The 2017 SCS asked students who reported being bullied whether they thought the bullying would happen again and what type of power imbalance they perceived between themselves and the person who bullied them. Five types of power imbalance are investigated in this spotlight: (1) the person who bullied the student was physically bigger or stronger; (2) the person who bullied the student was socially more popular; (3) the person who bullied the student had more money; (4) the person who bullied the student had the ability to influence what other students thought of the bullied student; and (5) the person who bullied the student had more power in another way. In 2017, about 20 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being bullied at school during the school year. Of the students who reported being bullied, 41 percent reported that they thought the bullying would happen again (figure S2.1 and table S2.1).   (Urban),\" \"in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),\" and \"not MSA (Rural).\" NOTE: Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. SOURCE: U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, School Crime Supplement (SCS) to the National Crime Victimization Survey, 2017. Whether students felt the bullying would happen again varied by student characteristics. In 2017, of students ages 12-18 who reported being bullied at school, a higher percentage of White students (47 percent) than of Hispanic (33 percent) and Black students (32 percent) thought the bullying would happen again. In addition, a higher percentage of 11th-graders (54 percent) than of 6th-graders (38 percent), 8th-graders (37 percent), and 12th-graders (33 percent) thought the bullying would happen again. Moreover, a higher percentage of students in rural areas (49 percent) than of students in urban areas (37 percent) thought the bullying would happen again. No measurable differences by sex or between students in public and private schools were observed in the percentages of students' perceptions of whether the bullying would be repeated. The perception of a power imbalance is a core element in the definition of bullying. Students who are bullied usually perceive aggressors (students who bully them) as being more powerful than them in some way (Cuadrado-Gordillo 2012). In 2017, of students ages 12-18 who reported being bullied at school, 56 percent reported that they thought those who bullied them had the ability to influence what other students thought of them; 50 percent reported those who bullied them were socially more popular; 40 percent reported those who bullied them were physically bigger or stronger; 31 percent reported those who bullied them had more money; and 24 percent reported those who bullied them had more power in another way (figure S2.2 and table S2.1). In 2017, of students ages 12-18 who reported being bullied at school, the type of power imbalance that they reported most often was the ability of students who bullied them to influence what other students thought of them. A higher percentage of female students (62 percent) than of male students (48 percent) reported that those who bullied them had the ability to influence what other students thought of them. Higher percentages of White (60 percent) and Hispanic students (57 percent) than of Black students (43 percent) reported that those who bullied them had the ability to influence what other students thought of them (figure S2.3 and table S2.1). Also, a higher percentage of 12th-graders (70 percent) than of 7th-graders (54 percent), 6th-graders (52 percent), and 8th-graders (50 percent) reported that those who bullied them had the ability to influence what other students thought of them. 8 In addition, a higher percentage of students in private schools (72 percent) than of students in public schools (55 percent) thought those who bullied them had the ability to influence what other students thought of them. The percentages of students who perceived that the person who bullied them had the ability to influence what others thought of them did not differ measurably by urbanicity.

SOURCE: U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, School Crime Supplement (SCS) to the National Crime Victimization Survey, 2017. In 2017, of students ages 12-18 who reported being bullied at school, one-half perceived those who bullied them as being socially more popular. No measurable differences by any student or school characteristics were observed in the percentages of students who reported that those who bullied them were socially more popular. Two out of five of students ages 12-18 who reported being bullied at school perceived those who bullied them as being physically bigger or stronger in 2017. There were no measurable differences by most student and school characteristics in the percentages of students who perceived that those who bullied them were physically bigger or stronger. The only characteristic that was an exception was urbanicity: a higher percentage of students in urban areas (46 percent) than of students in suburban areas (38 percent) reported those who did the bullying had more physical power. 9 In 2017, of students ages 12-18 who reported being bullied at school, about one-third perceived that those who bullied them had more money. Bullied students' perception of this financial power imbalance differed by race/ethnicity and grade level. Specifically, a higher percentage of White students (34 percent) than of Black students (24 percent) reported that those who bullied them had more money. Additionally, higher percentages of 9th-graders (40 percent) and 10th-graders (38 percent) than of 7th-graders (27 percent), 8th-graders (26 percent), and 6th-graders (25 percent) reported that those who bullied them had more money (figure S2.4 and table S2.1). However, no measurable differences were observed by sex, urbanicity, or control of school in the percentage of bullied students who perceived an imbalance of financial power between themselves and those who bullied them. In 2017, of students ages 12-18 who reported being bullied at school, about one-quarter thought that those who bullied them had more power in another way. For the most part, there were no measurable differences by student and school characteristics in the percentages of students who reported that those who bullied them had more power in another way; however, higher percentages of White (26 percent) and Hispanic students (26 percent) than of Black students (16 percent) reported that those who bullied them had more power in another way.

The Indicators of School Crime and Safety report aims to capture a wide range of student experiences, from more common occurrences to rarer events. Active shooter incidents are a rare occurrence and represent a small subset of the possible violent incidents that occur at schools. While rare, these events are of high concern to all those interested in the safety of our nation's students. In 2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released its first in a series of reports that covered active shooter incidents in the United States, following the signing of the Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2012 (Blair and Schweit 2014). These reports cover active shooter incidents in all types of settings, but this spotlight focuses on those incidents that occurred in educational settings. Educational settings were the second-most common location for active shooter incidents to occur, behind incidents in commerce settings. 10 This spotlight focuses on active shooter incidents at elementary and secondary schools and at postsecondary institutions from 2000 to 2017. It presents data on the frequency of incidents, the number of casualties, characteristics of the incidents, and characteristics of the shooters. \"Active shooter\" is a law enforcement term describing a shooting in progress. The FBI defines an active shooter as \"one or more individuals actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area.\" Because the situation is active, law enforcement and citizens involved in the incident have the potential to affect the outcome. Due to the specific definition used to determine an active shooter incident, this spotlight is not a comprehensive overview of gun violence or serious violent incidents in U.S. education settings. Data in this spotlight should be considered in conjunction with other indicators in the report to gain a broader picture of violent incidents in our nation's schools. 11 11 At the elementary and secondary school level, the indicator Violent Deaths at School and Away From School reports on the homicides and suicides of students ages 5-18 while at school in comparison to those away from school. Students Carrying Weapons on School Property and Anywhere and Students' Access to Firearms provides a look at the numbers of public school students involved in firearms incidents at school by state, as well as students' access to firearms at school and away from school. At the postsecondary level, Criminal Incidents at Postsecondary Institutions provides data on the number of disciplinary actions for and arrests related to illegal weapons possession on campus as well as the number of murders that occurred on postsecondary campuses. Taken together with the data found in this spotlight, these indicators give a more comprehensive picture of the frequency of weapons-related incidents, active shooter incidents, and homicides and suicides that occur in education settings. From 2000 to 2017, there were 37 active shooter incidents at elementary and secondary schools 12 and 15 active shooter incidents at postsecondary institutions. The annual number of active shooter incidents at elementary and secondary schools per year ranged from 0 to 6 during this time span (figure S3.1 and table S3.1). There were 4 years from 2000 to 2017 in which 0 active shooter incidents occurred, 6 years in which 1-2 active shooter incidents occurred, 7 years in which 3-4 active shooter incidents occurred, and 1 year in which 6 active shooter incidents occurred. At postsecondary institutions, the annual number of active shooter incidents per year ranged from 0 to 2 from 2000 to 2017. There were 8 years during this time span in which 0 active shooter incidents occurred and 10 years in which 1-2 active shooter incidents occurred. From 2000 to 2017, there were 153 casualties (67 killed and 86 wounded) in active shooter incidents at elementary and secondary schools, and 143 casualties (70 killed and 73 wounded) in active shooter incidents at postsecondary institutions. 13 At the elementary and secondary level, the number of casualties as a result of active shooter incidents 13 Number of casualties excludes active shooters. per year ranged from 0 to 36 from 2000 to 2017 (figure S3.2 and table S3.1). The number of casualties per year at the postsecondary level ranged from 0 to 49. At both the elementary and secondary level and the postsecondary level, there were more years in which the number wounded was higher than the number killed. 1 One shooter was reported to have used \"several handguns,\" which was counted as 3 for the total.

A single gun was used in the majority of active shooter incidents at education settings from 2000 to 2017, and two-thirds of guns used were handguns. Of the 37 active shooter incidents at elementary and secondary schools from 2000 to 2017, the shooter used a single gun in 23 of the incidents and more than one gun in the other 14 incidents (figure S3.3 and table S3.2). A total of 35 handguns, 10 shotguns, and 13 rifles were used. Of the 15 active shooter incidents at postsecondary institutions from 2000 to 2017, the shooter used a single gun in 8 incidents and more than one gun in 7 incidents. A total of 22 handguns, 14 3 shotguns, and 2 rifles were used. Each of the active shooter incidents at education settings from 2000 to 2017 involved a single shooter. All 37 active shooters at elementary and secondary schools were male. At postsecondary institutions, 13 of the active shooters were male, and the other 2 were female. Of the 37 active shooters at elementary and secondary schools, the majority (26) were 12 to 18 years old, 3 of the shooters were 19 to 24 years old  and 8 were 25 years old and above (figure S3.4 and table S3.2). At the postsecondary level, 1 shooter was 12 to 18 years old, 4 were 19 to 24 years old, and 10 were 25 years old and above. Most of the shooters were current or former students of the school at both the elementary and secondary level and the postsecondary level (Blair and Schweit 2014). Roughly half of active shooters at education settings from 2000 to 2017 were apprehended by law enforcement. At the elementary and secondary school level, 22 shooters were apprehended by law enforcement, 14 committed suicide, and 1 was killed or wounded by law enforcement (figure S3.5 and table S3.2). At the postsecondary level, 6 shooters were apprehended by law enforcement, 5 committed suicide, and 4 were killed or wounded by law enforcement."}, {"section_title": "27", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Violent Deaths at School and Away From School", "text": "Between 1992-93 and 2015-16, the percentage of youth homicides occurring at school each year remained at less than 3 percent of the total number of youth homicides, and the percentage of youth suicides occurring at school each year remained at less than 1 percent of the total number of youth suicides. Violent deaths at schools are rare but tragic events with far-reaching effects on the school population and surrounding community. This indicator presents data on school-associated violent deaths that were collected through the School-Associated Violent Death Surveillance System (SAVD-SS), as well as data on total homicides and suicides by school year identified through the National Vital Statistics System. The SAVD-SS defines a school-associated violent death as \"a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention death (involving a law enforcement officer), 15 in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States.\" School-associated violent deaths also include those that occurred while the victim was on the way to or returning from regular sessions at school or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims of school-associated violent deaths may include not only students and staff members, but also others at school, 16 such as students' parents and community members. The most recent data released by the SAVD-SS cover the period from July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016. During this period, there were a total of 38 student, staff, and other nonstudent schoolassociated violent deaths in the United States, which included 30 homicides, 7 suicides, and 1 legal intervention death (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). 17 Of these 15 A legal intervention death is defined as a death caused by a law enforcement agent in the course of arresting or attempting to arrest a lawbreaker, suppressing a disturbance, maintaining order, or engaging in another legal action. 16 \"At school\" includes on the property of a functioning elementary or secondary school, on the way to or from regular sessions at school, and while attending or traveling to or from a school-sponsored event. In this indicator, the term \"at school\" is comparable in meaning to the term \"school-associated.\" 17 Data from 1999-2000 onward are subject to change until law enforcement reports have been obtained and interviews with school and law enforcement officials have been completed. The details learned during the interviews can occasionally change the classification of a case. For more information on this survey, see appendix A. 38 school-associated violent deaths, 18 homicides and 3 suicides involved school-age youth (ages 5-18; also referred to as \"youth\" in this indicator). When these incidents of homicide and suicide of school-age youth at school were combined, there was approximately 1 youth violent death at school for every 2.7 million students enrolled. 18 Data for all violent deaths, including those occurring both at school and away from school, are included as a point of comparison for violent deaths occurring at school. As with the SAVD-SS data on schoolassociated violent deaths, the most recent data available for total homicides and suicides of schoolage youth are for the 2015-16 school year. During this period, there were 1,478 youth homicides and 1,941 youth suicides 19 in the United States (figure 1.2 and table 1.1). The percentage of youth homicides occurring at school each year remained at less than 3 percent of the total number of youth homicides between 1992-93 (when data collection began) and 2015-16, even though the absolute number of homicides of schoolage youth at school varied across the years. 20 Between 1992-93 and 2015-16, the number of school-age youth who died by suicide at school fluctuated each year and ranged from 1 to 10. The percentage of youth suicides occurring at school each year remained at less than 1 percent of the total number of youth suicides over these years. 18 The total number of students enrolled in prekindergarten through 12th grade during the 2015-16 school year was 56,188,564 (see  table 105.30 in Snyder, de Brey, and Dillow 2019). 19 Total youth suicides exclude self-inflicted deaths among 5-to 9-year-olds because determining suicidal intent in younger children can be difficult. The number of self-inflicted deaths among 5-to 9-year olds was generally less than 7 in each year between 1992-93 and 2015-16. 20 Single incidents occurring at school with a large number of school-age victims could result in large variations in the number of homicides of school-age youth at school between two years. Please use caution when making comparisons over time.

From 1992 to 2017, the total victimization rate and rates of specific crimes-thefts, violent victimizations, and serious violent victimizations 25 -declined for 21 Although Indicators 2 and 3 present information on similar topics, Indicator 2 is based solely on data collected in the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), whereas Indicator 3 is based on data collected in the School Crime Supplement (SCS) to the NCVS as well as demographic data collected in the NCVS. Indicator 2 uses data from all students ages 12-18 who responded to the NCVS, while Indicator 3 uses data from all students ages 12-18 who responded to both the NCVS and the SCS. Inclusion criteria for the NCVS and SCS differ slightly. For example, students who are exclusively homeschooled are able to complete the NCVS but not the SCS. 22 \"Theft\" includes attempted and completed purse-snatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery, which involves the threat or use of force and is classified as a violent crime. 23 \"Violent victimization\" includes serious violent crimes (rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault) and simple assault. 24 \"Students\" refers to youth ages 12-18 whose educational attainment did not exceed grade 12 at the time of the survey. An uncertain percentage of these persons may not have attended school during the survey reference period. These data do not take into account the number of hours that students spend at school or away from school. \"At school\" includes in the school building, on school property, and on the way to or from school. 25 \"Serious violent victimization\" includes the crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. students ages 12-18, both at school and away from school (figure 2.1). 26 In most years between 1992 and 2008 and in 2012, the rate of theft was higher at school than away from school for students ages 12-18. In every year between 2009 and 2015 (except 2012), there were no statistically significant differences between the rates of theft at school and away from school. Similar to earlier years, the rate of theft reported in 2017 was higher at school (12 thefts per 1,000 students) than away from school (7 thefts per 1,000 students). Between 1992 and 2000, the rate of violent victimization at school was either lower than or not measurably different from the rate away from school among students ages 12-18. From 2001 to 2017, the rate of violent victimization at school was generally higher than or not measurably different from the rate away from school. Based on the 2017 survey, the rate of violent victimization at school (21 victimizations per 1,000 students) was higher than the rate of violent victimization away from school (12 victimizations per 1,000 students). This difference was driven primarily by a higher rate of simple assault 27 at school (16 victimizations per 1,000 students) than away from school (7 victimizations per 1,000). The rate of serious violent victimization among students ages 12-18 was lower at school than away from school in most years between 1992 and 2008. Between 2009 and 2015 and in 2017, there was no statistically significant difference between the rate of serious violent victimizations at school and away from school. The serious violent victimization rates reported in 2017 were 4 victimizations per 1,000 students at school and 6 victimizations per 1,000 students away from school. 1 Serious violent victimization is also included in all violent victimization. NOTE: Every 10 years, the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) sample is redesigned to reflect changes in the population. Due to the sample redesign and other methodological changes implemented in 2006, use caution when comparing 2006 estimates to other years. Due to a sample increase and redesign in 2016, victimization estimates among youth in 2016 were not comparable to estimates for other years. \"Serious violent victimization\" includes the crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. \"All violent victimization\" includes serious violent crimes as well as simple assault. \"Theft\" includes attempted and completed purse-snatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts.

The rate of violent victimization at school was higher for male students ages 12-18 (25 victimizations per 1,000 students) than for female students ages 12-18 (16 victimizations per 1,000 students). Away from school, the rates of total victimization and theft for male students did not differ measurably from the rates for female students. The rate of violent victimization away from school was higher for male students (16 victimizations per 1,000 students) than for female students (9 victimizations per 1,000 students), and the rate of serious violent victimization away from school was higher for male students (8 victimizations per 1,000 students) than for female students (3 victimizations per 1,000 students).

The theft rate at school was lower for students residing in suburban areas (10 victimizations per 1,000 students) than in urban areas (17 victimizations per 1,000 students). In addition, the violent victimization rate at school was lower for students residing in suburban areas (15 victimizations per 1,000 students) than in urban areas (32 victimizations per 1,000 students). Away from school, the rate of total victimization was lower for students residing in suburban areas (15 victimizations per 1,000 students) than in rural areas (32 victimizations per 1,000 students), and the rate of theft was lower for students residing in suburban areas (5 thefts per 1,000 students) than in rural areas (15 thefts per 1,000 students). Among students living in urban areas, rates of total victimization away from school (23 victimizations per 1,000 students) and theft away from school (9 thefts per 1,000 students) did not differ significantly from students living in other areas.

Students are not the only victims of intimidation and violence in schools. Teachers are also subject to threats and physical attacks, and students from their schools sometimes commit these offenses. In 2015-16, the National Teacher and Principal Survey (NTPS) asked public school teachers 36 whether they were threatened with injury or physically attacked by a student from their school in the previous 12 months.

Between 2005 and 2017, the percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported being bullied at school during the school year decreased from 29 to 20 percent (figure 10.1 and table 10.1). 55 However, there was no 51 \"Bullying\" includes students who reported that another student had made fun of them, called them names, or insulted them; spread rumors about them; threatened them with harm; tried to make them do something they did not want to do; excluded them from activities on purpose; destroyed their property on purpose; or pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on them. In the total for students bullied at school, students who reported more than one type of bullying were counted only once. 52 \"At school\" includes in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and going to and from school. 53 In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), bullying was defined for respondents as \"when one or more students tease, threaten, spread rumors about, hit, shove, or hurt another student over and over again.\" \"On school property\" was not defined for survey respondents. 54 Being electronically bullied includes \"being bullied through e-mail, chat rooms, instant messaging, websites, or texting\" for 2011 through 2015, and \"being bullied through texting, Instagram, Facebook, or other social media\" for 2017. 55 Prior data are excluded from the time series due to a significant redesign of the bullying items in 2005. measurable difference between the percentages in 2015 and 2017. A declining trend between 2005 and 2017 in the percentage of students who reported being bullied at school was observed for most of the student and school characteristics examined: the percentage decreased for male students (from 27 to 17 percent) and female students (from 30 to 24 percent); White students (from 30 to 23 percent), Black students (from 29 to 23 percent), Hispanic students (from 22 to 16 percent), Asian students (from 21 to 7 percent), and students of Two or more races (from 35 to 23 percent); students in each grade from 6 through 12 (with decreases ranging from 6 to 11 percentage points); students in urban areas (from 26 to 18 percent) and suburban areas (from 29 to 20 percent); and public school students (from 29 to 21 percent). In addition, the percentage of private school students who reported being bullied at school was lower in 2017 than in 2005 (16 vs. 23 percent). Although the percentage of students in rural areas who reported being bullied at school in 2017 was not measurably different from the percentage in 2005, it was higher than the percentage in 2015 (27 vs. 18 percent). This indicator has been updated to include 2017 data. For more information: Tables 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2018), (https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/pdf/2017/ss6708.pdf), and https://nces.ed.gov/programs/crime/.  Urban,\" \"in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),\" and \"not MSA (Rural).\" These data by metropolitan status were based on the location of households and differ from those published in In 2017, about 20 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being bullied at school during the school year (figure 10.2 and table 10.2). Of students ages 12-18, about 13 percent reported being the subject of rumors; 13 percent reported being made fun of, called names, or insulted; 5 percent reported being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; and 5 percent reported being excluded from activities on purpose. Additionally, 4 percent of students reported being threatened with harm, 2 percent reported that others tried to make them do things they did not want to do, and 1 percent reported that their property was destroyed by others on purpose. In 2017, a higher percentage of female students than of male students ages 12-18 reported being bullied at school during the school year (24 vs. 17 percent). There were also differences in selected types of bullying by sex. A higher percentage of female students than of male students reported being the subject of rumors (18 vs. 9 percent); being made fun of, called names, or insulted (16 vs. 10 percent); and being excluded from activities on purpose (7 vs. 3 percent). In contrast, a higher percentage of male students than of female students reported being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on (6 vs. 4 percent). Overall, of students ages 12-18, higher percentages of students of Two or more races, Black students, and White students (23 percent each) than of Hispanic students (16 percent) and Asian students (7 percent) reported being bullied at school during the school year in 2017. In addition, higher percentages of American Indian/Alaska Native students (27 percent) and Hispanic students than of Asian students reported being bullied at school. Even though percentages were suppressed for some racial/ethnic groups due to small sample sizes and high standard errors, the measurable differences by race/ethnicity for the specific types of bullying followed similar patterns as for the differences for total bullying. For example, the percentages of students who reported being the subject of rumors and being made fun of, called names, or insulted were both higher for Black students and White students than for Hispanic students and Asian students. The percentages were also higher for students of Two or more races and Hispanic students than for Asian students. Higher percentages of students in each grade from 6 through 8 than of students in each grade from 9 through 12 reported being bullied at school during the school year. In 2017, about 29 percent of 6thgraders, 25 percent of 8th-graders, and 24 percent of 7th-graders reported being bullied at school, compared with 19 percent each of 9th-and 10thgraders, 15 percent of 11th-graders, and 12 percent of 12th-graders. In addition, a higher percentage of 9th-graders than of 11th-and 12th-graders and a higher percentage of 10th-graders than of 12thgraders reported being bullied at school. In 2017, a higher percentage of students ages 12-18 in rural areas (27 percent) than of students in suburban areas (20 percent) and urban areas (18 percent) reported being bullied at school during the school year. A higher percentage of students in rural areas than of students in suburban areas reported being the subject of rumors (19 vs. 13 percent); being made fun of, called names, or insulted (16 vs. 13 percent); and being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on (8 vs. 5 percent). In addition, a higher percentage of students in rural areas than of students in urban areas reported being the subject of rumors (19 vs. 11 percent) and being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on (8 vs. 5 percent). There was no measurable difference between the percentages of public and private school students who reported being bullied at school, either overall or by specific types of bullying. The SCS also asked students ages 12-18 who reported being bullied at school during the school year to indicate the location where they had been bullied. In 2017, of students who reported being bullied at school, 43 percent reported being bullied in the hallway or stairwell at school, 42 percent reported being bullied inside the classroom, and 27 percent reported being bullied in the cafeteria (figure 10.3 and table 10.3). About 22 percent of students who were bullied reported being bullied outside on school grounds, 15 percent reported being bullied online or by text, 12 percent reported being bullied in the bathroom or locker room, 8 percent reported being bullied on the school bus, and 2 percent reported being bullied somewhere else in the school building. There were some differences by student and school characteristics in the locations where students ages 12-18 reported they were bullied during the school year. For example, a higher percentage of female students than of male students reported being bullied online or by text (21 vs. 7 percent). The percentage of students who reported being bullied online or by text was also higher for 11th-graders (22 percent), 10thgraders (22 percent), and 9th-graders (20 percent) than for 6th-graders (7 percent), and it was higher for 10th-graders than for 7th-graders (13 percent), 8thgraders (12 percent), and 12th-graders (12 percent). Higher percentages of Black students (46 percent) and White students (43 percent) than of Hispanic students (36 percent) reported being bullied inside the classroom. A higher percentage of students in suburban areas than of those in rural areas reported being bullied in the cafeteria (30 vs. 21 percent); in contrast, a higher percentage of students in rural areas than of those in suburban areas reported being bullied outside on school grounds (29 vs. 18 percent). In 2017, about 31 percent of students ages 12-18 who reported being bullied at school during the school year indicated that they were bullied on 1 day in the school year, 19 percent indicated that they were bullied on 2 days in the school year, 30 percent indicated that they were bullied on 3 to 10 days in the school year, and 20 percent indicated that they were bullied on more than 10 days in the school year (figure 10.4 and table 10.4). Although a higher percentage of male students than of female students reported being bullied on 1 day in the school year (36 vs. 27 percent), a higher percentage of female than of male students reported being bullied on more than 10 days in the school year (23 vs. 17 percent). A higher percentage of White students (24 percent) than of Hispanic students (14 percent) and Black students (13 percent) also reported being bullied on more than 10 days in the school year. Among students ages 12-18 who reported being bullied at school during the school year in 2017, about 46 percent reported notifying an adult at school 56 about the incident. Higher percentages of 6th-and 7th-graders (57 percent each) than of 9thgraders (39 percent), 10th-graders (38 percent), and 12th-graders (33 percent) and a higher percentage of 8th-graders (47 percent) than of 12th-graders reported notifying an adult at school after being bullied. The percentage of students who reported notifying an adult at school after being bullied was highest for those who reported being bullied on more than ten days in the school year (64 percent) and lowest for those who reported being bullied on one day in the school year (31 percent). "}, {"section_title": "Indicator 6", "text": "Violent and Other Criminal Incidents at Public Schools, and Those Reported to the Police In 2015-16, about 69 percent of public schools recorded one or more violent incidents, 15 percent recorded one or more serious violent incidents, and 39 percent recorded one or more thefts. Between 1999Between -2000Between and 2009, as well as in 2015-16, the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) asked public school principals to provide the number of violent incidents, 38 serious violent incidents, 39 thefts of items valued at $10 or greater without personal confrontation, and other incidents 40 that occurred at their school. 41 Public school principals were also asked to provide the number of incidents they reported to police or other law enforcement. This indicator presents the percentage of public schools that recorded one or more of these specified crimes, the total number of incidents recorded, and the rate of incidents per 1,000 students. These data are also presented for crimes that were reported to the police. During the 2015-16 school year, 79 percent of public schools recorded that one or more incidents of violence, theft, or other crimes had taken place, amounting to 1.4 million crimes (figure 6.1 and table 6.1). This translates to a rate of 28 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled in 2015-16. During the same school year, 47 percent of schools reported one or more of the specified crimes to the police, amounting to 449,000 crimes, or 9 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled. 38 \"Violent incidents\" include serious violent incidents (see footnote 39) as well as physical attack or fight without a weapon and threat of physical attack without a weapon. 39 \"Serious violent incidents\" include rape, sexual assault other than rape, physical attack or fight with a weapon, threat of physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon. 40 \"Other incidents\" include possession of a firearm or explosive device; possession of a knife or sharp object; distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol; inappropriate distribution, possession, or use of prescription drugs; and vandalism. 41 \"At school\" was defined for respondents to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school hours, or when school activities or events were in session. Not all recorded incidents were reported to the police. In 2015-16, across all types of crime, the percentage of public schools that reported one or more incidents to the police was lower than the percentage of recorded incidents: violent incidents of crime (33 vs. 69 percent), serious violent incidents (10 vs. 15 percent), thefts (18 vs. 39 percent), and other incidents (34 vs. 59 percent). In terms of rates, this translates to 4 violent crimes reported to the police per 1,000 students compared with 18 violent crimes per 1,000 students recorded by schools, less than 1 serious violent incident reported compared with 1 serious violent incident recorded per 1,000 students, 1 theft reported compared with 3 thefts recorded per 1,000 students, and 4 other incidents reported compared with 7 other incidents recorded per 1,000 students. The percentage of public schools recording one or more incidents of violence, theft, or other crimes was lower in 2015-16 (79 percent) than in every prior survey year (ranging from 85 to 89 percent between 1999-2000 and 2009-10). Similarly, the percentage of public schools that reported one or more incidents of violence, theft, or other crimes to the police was lower in 2015-16 (47 percent) than in every prior survey year (ranging from 60 to 65 percent between 1999-2000 and 2009-10). For many types of crime, the percentages of public schools recording incidents of crime or reporting incidents of crime to the police were lower in 2015-16 than in 2009-10. For instance, 65 percent of public schools recorded incidents of physical attack or fight without a weapon in 2015-16 compared to 71 percent in 2009-10, and 25 percent reported such incidents to the police in 2015-16 compared with 34 percent in 2009-10. incidents to the police, and the rate of crimes per 1,000 students, by type of crime: School year 2015-16 Rate per 1,000 students 7.1 3.7"}, {"section_title": "Type of crime", "text": "1 \"Violent incidents\" include \"serious violent\" incidents (see footnote 2) as well as physical attack or fight without a weapon and threat of physical attack without a weapon. 2 \"Serious violent\" incidents include rape, sexual assault other than rape, physical attack or fight with a weapon, threat of physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon. 3 Theft or larceny (taking things worth over $10 without personal confrontation) was defined for respondents as \"the unlawful taking of another person's property without personal confrontation, threat, violence, or bodily harm.\" This includes pocket picking, stealing a purse or backpack (if left unattended or no force was used to take it from owner), theft from a building, theft from a motor vehicle or motor vehicle parts or accessories, theft of a bicycle, theft from a vending machine, and all other types of thefts. 4 \"Other incidents\" include possession of a firearm or explosive device; possession of a knife or sharp object; distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol; inappropriate distribution, possession, or use of prescription drugs; and vandalism.

For example, 57 percent of primary schools recorded violent incidents compared with 88 percent of middle schools and 90 percent of high schools (figure 6.2 and table 6.2). Similarly, a lower percentage of primary schools recorded serious violent incidents (9 percent) than middle and high schools (23 and 30 percent, respectively), a lower percentage of primary schools recorded incidents of theft (23 percent) than middle and high schools (55 and 76 percent, respectively), and a lower percentage of primary schools recorded other incidents (43 percent) than middle and high schools (77 and 88 percent, respectively). A similar pattern was observed for public schools that reported such incidents of violent crime, serious violent crime, theft, and other incidents to the police. The percentages of primary schools that reported incidents of these types of crime to the police were lower than the percentages of middle schools and high schools (figure 6.2 and table 6.3). Data on the number of crimes recorded and reported by public schools in 2015-16 were categorized by frequency range as well. For example, 31 percent of schools did not record a violent crime, whereas 14 percent of schools recorded 20 or more violent crimes (figure 6.3 and table 6.4). Sixty-seven percent of schools did not report a violent crime to the police, while 3 percent of schools reported 20 or more violent crimes to the police . With regard to serious  violent crimes, 85 percent of schools did not record  a serious violent crime, while 1 percent of schools  recorded 10 or more such crimes (figure 6.3 and  table 6.5). Ninety percent of schools did not report a serious violent crime to the police; in contrast, less than 1 percent of schools reported 10 or more serious violent crimes to the police. The number of crimes recorded and reported by schools by frequency range also varied by school characteristics. For instance, a larger percentage of city schools recorded 20 or more violent incidents in 2015-16 (21 percent) than suburban schools and rural schools (14 and 7 percent, respectively; table 6.4). With regard to violent incidents reported to the police, larger percentages of town (4 percent), city (4 percent), and suburban schools (2 percent) reported 20 or more such crimes to the police than rural schools (1 percent). The percentage of schools recording 20 or more violent incidents in 2015-16 was also higher for schools where 76 percent or more of the students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (23 percent) than for schools where a smaller percentage of the students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (ranging from 6 to 14 percent).

About 10 percent of public schools reported that gang activities had happened at all during the 2015-16 school year. The percentage of public schools that reported student bullying occurred at least once a week decreased from 29 percent in 1999-2000 to 12 percent in 2015-16 (figure 7.1 and table 7.1).

Between 1999-2000 and 2009-10, as well as in 2015-16, the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) asked public school principals how often certain disciplinary problems happened in their schools 43 during the school year. In 2013-14, school principals were asked to provide responses to a similar set of questions on the Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) survey of school safety and discipline. 44 Using data from both surveys, this indicator examines whether the following discipline problems were reported by public schools to have occurred at least once a week: student racial/ethnic tensions, student bullying, student sexual harassment of other students, student harassment of other students based on sexual orientation or gender identity, student verbal abuse of teachers, student acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse, and widespread disorder in the classroom. SSOCS also looked at the occurrence of gang activities during the school year; however, this item was not collected in the FRSS survey. In 2015-16, about 12 percent of public schools reported that bullying occurred among students at least once a week (figure 7.1 and table 7.1).

In 2005 and prior years, the period covered by the survey question was \"during the last 6 months,\" whereas the period was \"during this school year\" beginning in 2007. Cognitive testing showed that estimates for earlier years are comparable to those for 2007 and later years. NOTE: \"Urbanicity\" refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent's household as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include \"central city of an MSA (Urban),\" \"in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),\" and \"not MSA (Rural).\" All gangs, whether or not they are involved in violent or illegal activity, are included. \"At school\" includes in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and going to and from school.   addition, the percentage of students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school in 2017 was lower than the percentage in 2015 (27 percent). The percentages of male students who reported being called a hate-related word and seeing haterelated graffiti at school during the school year did not measurably differ from the percentages for female students in any survey year from 2001 to 2017. During this period, the percentage of male students who reported being called a hate-related word decreased from 13 to 6 percent, and the percentage of female students decreased from 12 to 7 percent. Similarly, the percentage of male students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school decreased from 35 to 23 percent between 2001 and 2017, and the percentage of female students decreased from 37 to 24 percent during the same period. The percentage of male students who reported being called a hate-related word was lower in 2017 than in 2015, and the percentages of male students and female students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti were lower in 2017 than in 2015. In 2005 and prior years, the period covered by the survey question was \"during the last 6 months,\" whereas the period was \"during this school year\" beginning in 2007.

In 2017, lower percentages of Asian students (5 percent) and White students (6 percent) than of students of Two or more races (11 percent) reported being called a hate-related word at school during the school year (figure 9.2 and table 9.1). Also in 2017, a lower percentage of Asian students (15 percent) than of students who were Hispanic (21 percent), White (24 percent), Black (25 percent), and of Two or more races (35 percent) reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school during the school year. In addition, lower percentages of Hispanic, White, and Black students than of students of Two or more races reported seeing hate-related graffiti. The percentages of White, Black, and Hispanic students who reported being called a hate-related word and seeing hate-related graffiti all decreased between 2001 and 2017. Some measurable differences were observed across grade levels in students' reports of being called a haterelated word and seeing hate-related graffiti at school during the school year. In 2017, lower percentages of 11th-and 12th-graders (5 percent each) than of 7th-and 9th-graders (7 and 8 percent, respectively) reported being called a hate-related word at school, and lower percentages of 6th and 7th-graders (21 percent each) than of 10th-graders (27 percent) reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school. In 2017, a lower percentage of private school students reported being called a hate-related word at school during the school year than did public school students (4 vs. 7 percent). Similarly, in 2017, a lower percentage of private school students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school than did public school students (6 vs. 25 percent). The pattern of a lower percentage of private school students than of public school students reporting seeing hate-related graffiti at school was also observed in each data collection year between 2001 and 2015.  Students who reported being called hate-related words at school during the school year were asked to indicate whether the derogatory word they were called referred to their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, or sexual orientation. In 2017, a lower percentage of male students than of female students reported being called a hate-related word referring to their gender (less than 1 percent vs. 2 percent; figure 9.3 and table 9.2). However, a lower percentage of female students than of male students reported being called a hate-related word referring to their religion (less than 1 percent vs. 1 percent). Race was the most frequently reported characteristic referred to by hate-related words. In 2017, a lower percentage of White students than of students of any other race/ethnicity for which data were available reported being called a hate-related word referring to their race. Specifically, 2 percent of White students reported being called a hate-related word referring to their race, compared with 3 percent of Hispanic students, 4 percent of Asian students, 5 percent of Black students, and 8 percent of students of Two or more races. 2.8 2.9 2.7 1.7 1.7 1.6 0.7 1.0 0.5 0.7 0.8 0.7 1.0 0.4 1.6 0.8 0.6 1.0"}, {"section_title": "Type of hate-related word", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Male Total Female", "text": "1 Students who reported being called hate-related words were asked which specific characteristics these words were related to.

In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), students in grades 9-12 were asked about their involvement in physical fights, both in general (referred to as \"anywhere\" in this indicator) and on school property, during the 12 months preceding the survey. 58 In this indicator, percentages of students reporting involvement in a physical fight occurring anywhere are used as a point of comparison with percentages of students reporting involvement in a physical fight occurring on school property. Overall, the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported having been in a physical fight anywhere during the previous 12 months decreased between 2001 and 2017 (from 33 to 24 percent), and the percentage of students who reported having been in a physical fight on school property also decreased during this period (from 13 to 9 percent; figure 12.1 and table 12.1). However, there were no measurable differences between the two most recent survey years (2015 and 2017) in the percentage of students who reported having been in a physical fight, both anywhere and on school property. In every survey year from 2001 to 2017, a higher percentage of male students than of female students in grades 9-12 reported having been in a physical fight during the previous 12 months, both anywhere and on school property. In 2017, for example, 30 percent of male students, compared with 17 percent of female students, reported having been in a physical fight anywhere; 12 percent of male students, compared with 6 percent of female students, reported having been in a physical fight on school property. 58 \"Anywhere\" includes fights that occurred on school property. The term \"anywhere\" is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many times in the past 12 months they had been in a physical fight. In the question asking students about physical fights at school, \"on school property\" was not defined for survey respondents. Similar to the pattern for students overall, the percentages of both male and female students in grades 9-12 who reported having been in a physical fight, both anywhere and on school property, during the previous 12 months also decreased between 2001 and 2017. During this time, the percentage of students who reported having been in a physical fight anywhere decreased from 43 to 30 percent for male students and from 24 to 17 percent for female students. Similarly, the percentage of students who reported having been in a physical fight on school property decreased from 18 to 12 percent for male students and from 7 to 6 percent for female students. The percentages of students in grades 9-12 who reported having been in a physical fight, both anywhere and on school property, during the previous 12 months differed by race/ethnicity. For example, in 2017, the percentage of students who reported having been in a physical fight anywhere was higher for Black students (33 percent) than for Hispanic students (26 percent), students of Two or more races (26 percent), Pacific Islander students (23 percent), and White students (21 percent); and the percentage for Asian students (11 percent) was lower compared with all these groups (figure 12.2 and table 12.1).

Data for the percentage of public school students in grades 9-12 who reported having been in a physical fight anywhere in 2017 were available for 36 states and the District of Columbia. 60 Among these jurisdictions, the percentages of students who reported having been in a physical fight anywhere ranged from 15 percent in Maine to 31 percent in Louisiana and the District of Columbia (table 12.3). 60 U.S. total data are representative of all public and private school students in grades 9-12 in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. U.S. total data were collected through a separate national survey rather than being aggregated from state-level data. In 2017, data for physical fights on school property involving these students were available for 32 states and the District of Columbia. Among these jurisdictions, the percentages of students who reported having been in a physical fight on school property ranged from 5 percent in Kansas and Maine to 15 percent in the District of Columbia. This indicator uses data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) to examine the percentages of students in grades 9-12 who reported carrying a weapon on school property and anywhere during the previous 30 days, then uses data from the EDFacts data collection to examine by state the numbers of students reported by schools to have possessed firearms at school during the school year. It concludes with a discussion of data from the School Crime Supplement (SCS) to the National Crime Victimization Survey on students ages 12-18 who reported having access to loaded firearms at school or away from school during the school year without adult permission. Readers should take note of the differing data sources and terminology. In the YRBS, students in grades 9-12 were asked if they had carried a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club 61 anywhere during the previous 30 days and if they had carried such a weapon on school property during the same time period. 62 In this indicator, the percentage of students carrying a weapon \"anywhere\" 63 is included as a point of comparison with the percentage of students carrying a weapon on school property. In 2017, about 16 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported that they had carried a weapon anywhere 61 The question asked about these weapon types combined. Separate data on each type of weapon were not collected. The question did not specify whether guns carried only for hunting or for a sport should be included. 62 The term \"anywhere\" is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many days they carried a weapon during the past 30 days. In the question asking students about carrying a weapon at school, \"on school property\" was not defined for survey respondents. 63 \"Anywhere\" includes on school property. at least 1 day during the previous 30 days: 7 percent reported carrying a weapon anywhere on 6 or more days, 5 percent reported carrying a weapon on 2 to 5 days, and 3 percent reported carrying a weapon on 1 day (tables 13.1 and 13.2). In the same year, 4 percent of students reported carrying a weapon on school property at least 1 day during the previous 30 days. This percentage included 2 percent of students who reported carrying a weapon on 6 or more days, 1 percent of students who reported carrying a weapon on 2 to 5 days, and 1 percent of students who reported carrying a weapon on 1 day during the previous 30 days. The percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported carrying a weapon on school property during the previous 30 days decreased from 6 percent in 2001 to 4 percent in 2017 (figure 13.1 and table 13.1). However, there was no measurable difference between 2001 and 2017 in the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the previous 30 days. There were also no measurable differences between 2015 and 2017 in the percentages of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere and on school property during the previous 30 days. In every survey year from 2001 to 2017, a higher percentage of male students than of female students in grades 9-12 reported that they had carried a weapon, both anywhere and on school property, during the previous 30 days. In 2017, for example, 24 percent of male students reported carrying a weapon anywhere, compared with 7 percent of female students. Similarly, 6 percent of male students in 2017 reported carrying a weapon on school property, compared with 2 percent of female students. This indicator has been updated to include 2017 data on student-reported information and 2016-17 data on the number of students involved in activities related to weapons possession (instead of data on the number of discipline incidents related to weapons possession as reported in prior editions).

NOTE: Respondents were asked about carrying \"a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club.\" The term \"anywhere\" is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many days they carried a weapon during the past 30 days. In the question asking students about carrying a weapon at school, \"on school property\" was not defined for survey respondents.   In 2017, the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the previous 30 days was higher for students of all other racial/ethnic groups than for Asian students. Specifically, 21 percent of American Indian/ Alaska Native students, 18 percent each of Pacific Islander and White students, 16 percent of students of Two or more races, 13 percent of Hispanic students, and 11 percent of Black students reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the previous 30 days, compared with 6 percent of Asian students (figure 13.2 and table 13.1). Additionally, a higher percentage of White students than of Hispanic students and Black students, and a higher percentage of American Indian/Alaska Native students than of Black students, reported carrying a weapon anywhere. In 2017, there were no measurable differences by race/ ethnicity in the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon on school property during the previous 30 days. Since 2015, the YRBS has included a question to identify students' sexual orientation by asking students in grades 9-12 which of the following best described them-\"heterosexual (straight),\" \"gay or lesbian,\" \"bisexual,\" or \"not sure.\" 64 In 2017, there were no measurable differences by sexual orientation in the percentages of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere and on school property during the previous 30 days. There were no measurable differences by grade in the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the previous 30 days in 2017 (ranging from 15 to 17 percent in each grade). However, the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon on school property during the previous 30 days was higher for 11th-graders (5 percent) than for 10th-graders (3 percent) and 9thgraders (2 percent), and this percentage was higher for 12th-graders (4 percent) than for 9th-graders. While the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon on school property on 1 day was higher for 9th-, 10th-, and 11th-graders than for 12th-graders (1 percent each vs. less than 1 percent), the percentage who reported carrying a weapon on school property on 6 or more days was higher for 11th-and 12thgraders than for 9th-and 10th-graders (3 percent each vs. 1 percent each). In 2017, data on percentages of public school students in grades 9-12 who reported carrying a weapon anywhere were available for 26 states and the District of Columbia (table 13.3). 65 Among these jurisdictions, the percentages of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere ranged from 11 percent in Massachusetts to 30 percent in Idaho. There were also 35 states that had 2017 data available on the percentages of students reporting that they carried a weapon on school property during the previous 30 days; the percentages ranged from 2 percent in Pennsylvania to 10 percent in Idaho and Alaska. As part of the EDFacts data collection, state education agencies report the number of public school students from kindergarten to 12th grade who brought firearms to or possessed firearms at school. State education agencies compile these data based on student counts that were reported by their schools and school districts. During the 2016-17 school year, 3,300 students were reported to have brought firearms to or possessed firearms at schools in the United States (table 13.4). 66 The number of students varies widely across jurisdictions, due in large part to their differing populations. Therefore, the rate per 100,000 students can provide a more comparable indication of the frequency of students involved in these activities across jurisdictions. During the 2016-17 school year, the overall rate of students who brought firearms to or possessed firearms at school was 6 per 100,000 students in the United States. In 2016-17, data on the rates of students who brought firearms to or possessed firearms at school during the school year were available for 49 states and the District of Columbia. The majority of jurisdictions (42 states and the District of Columbia) had rates between 1 and 20 per 100,000 students. Two states, New Jersey and Missouri, had rates per 100,000 students below 1, while five states had rates above 20: New Mexico, Louisiana, Wyoming, Arkansas, and West Virginia. 6.7 5.5 4.7 3.7 4.2 3.4 8.4 7.6 5.6 3.9 5.3 4.0 5.0 3.4 3.6 3.4 3.1 2.7 Information about students' access to firearms can provide context for student reports of carrying a weapon anywhere and on school property. In the SCS survey, students ages 12-18 were asked if they could have obtained a loaded gun without adult permission, either at school or away from school, during the current school year. In 2017, about 3 percent of students ages 12-18 reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission, either at school or away from school, during the school year (figure 13.3 and table 13.5). This percentage represents a decrease from 7 percent in 2007 (the first year of data collection for this item). Between 2015 and 2017, there was no measurable difference in the percentage of students who reported having such access to a loaded gun. In every survey year from 2007 to 2017 (except in 2013 when there was no measurable difference between male and female students), a higher percentage of male students than of female students ages 12-18 reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission, either at school or away from school during the school year. In 2017, about 4 percent of male students reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission, compared with 3 percent of female students. The percentages of male and female students who reported having such access to a loaded gun both decreased between 2007 and 2017 (from 8 to 4 percent for males and from 5 to 3 percent for females), but there were no measurable differences between the percentages in 2015 and 2017. In 2017, higher percentages of students in 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade than of those in 7th grade reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission, either at school or away from school during the school year. About 6 percent of 12th-graders, 5 percent of 11th-graders, 4 percent of 10th-graders, and 3 percent of 9th-graders reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission, compared with 1 percent of 7thgraders. In addition, the percentage of students who reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission was higher for 11th-and 12th-graders than for 8th-graders (2 percent), and this percentage was higher for 12th-graders than for 9th-graders.\nGay, lesbian, or bisexual Heterosexual Not sure !

This indicator uses data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) to examine the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported using alcohol during the previous 30 days. 67 Adolescent alcohol use is associated with various negative outcomes, such as physical injury, suicide ideation, delinquency, and risky behaviors (Barnes, Welte, and Hoffman 2002;Bonomo et al. 2001;Mason et al. 2010;Schilling et al. 2009). In most states, the purchase or public possession of alcohol anywhere by students in grades 9-12 is illegal, since most students are under the minimum legal drinking age. Between 2001 and 2017, the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported using alcohol on at least 1 day during the previous 30 days decreased from 47 to 30 percent (figure 14.1 and table 14.1). However, the percentages of students who reported using alcohol in 2015 and in 2017 were not measurably different. In 2017, about 16 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported using alcohol on 1 or 2 days during the previous 30 days, 13 percent reported using alcohol on 3 to 29 of the previous 30 days, and 1 percent reported using alcohol on all of the previous 30 days (table 14.2). In 2001, the percentage of male students in grades 9-12 who reported using alcohol on at least 1 day during the previous 30 days was higher than the percentage of female students who reported doing so (49 vs. 45 percent). In every survey year between 2003 and 2015, the percentages of male and female students who reported using alcohol on at least 1 day during the previous 30 days were not measurably different (figure 14.1 and table 14.1). However, in 2017, a higher percentage of female than of male students reported using alcohol on at least 1 of the previous 30 days (32 vs. 28 percent). While the percentage of students who reported using alcohol decreased for both male (from 49 to 28 percent) and female (from 45 to 32 percent) students between 2001 and 2017, the decrease was larger for male students (22 percentage points) than for female students (13 percentage points). Consistent with the difference between male and female students in overall alcohol use in 2017, a higher percentage of female than of male students in 2017 reported using alcohol on 1 or 2 days during the previous 30 days (18 vs. 15 percent; table 14.2). In contrast, a higher percentage of male than of female students reported using alcohol on all of the previous 30 days (0.9 vs. 0.3 percent). In 2017, the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported using alcohol during the previous 30 days increased with grade level. About 19 percent of 9th-graders reported using alcohol on at least 1 day during the previous 30 days, compared with 27 percent of 10th-graders, 34 percent of 11thgraders, and 41 percent of 12th-graders (figure 14.2 and table 14.1). Additionally, a higher percentage of 12th-graders reported using alcohol on 3 to 29 days during the previous 30 days (18 percent) than 9th-and 10th-graders (7 percent and 11 percent, respectively), and a higher percentage of 12th-graders reported consuming alcohol on all of the previous 30 days (1 percent) than 9th-graders (less than 1 percent; table 14.2).

In the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS), public school principals were asked to report the number of disciplinary actions their schools had taken against students for specific offenses. The student offenses reported by principals during the 2015-16 school year and discussed in this indicator were physical attacks or fights; distribution, possession, or use of alcohol; distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs; use or possession of a firearm or explosive device; and use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device. During the 2015-16 school year, 37 percent of public schools (31,100 schools) took at least one serious disciplinary action-including out-of-school suspensions lasting 5 days or more, removals with no services for the remainder of the school year, and transfers to specialized schools-for specific offenses (figure 18.1 and table 18.1). Out of all offenses reported, physical attacks or fights prompted the largest percentage of schools (27 percent) to respond with at least one serious disciplinary action. In response to other offenses by students, 19 percent of schools reported that they took disciplinary actions for the distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs; 10 percent took actions for the use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device; 8 percent did so for the distribution, possession, or use of alcohol; and 2 percent did so for the use or possession of a firearm or explosive device.

This pattern by school level was generally observed for disciplinary actions taken in response to specific offenses as well. For example, 62 percent of high schools took serious disciplinary actions in response to distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs, compared with 31 percent of middle schools, and 2 percent of primary schools. A higher percentage of schools with 76 percent or more of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch took at least one serious disciplinary action (44 percent) than did schools with 0 to 25 (25 percent) and 26 to 50 percent (34 percent) of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. 80 The percentage was also higher for schools where 51 to 75 percent of students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (41 percent) than for schools where a lower percentage of students were eligible.  A total of 305,700 serious disciplinary actions were taken by public schools during the 2015-16 school year for specific offenses (table 18.1). The largest number of these reported disciplinary actions were taken in response to physical attacks or fights (178,000 actions).

Schools use a variety of practices and procedures to promote the safety of students, faculty, and staff. Certain practices, such as locking or monitoring doors and gates, are intended to limit or control access to school campuses, while others, such as the use of metal detectors and security cameras, are intended to monitor or restrict students' and visitors' behavior on campus. Between 1999-2000 and 2009-10, as well as in 2015-16, the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) asked principals of public schools about their schools' use of safety and security measures and procedures. Principals were also asked to report whether their school had a written plan for procedures to be performed in selected scenarios. In 2013-14, data on safety and security measures and procedures and written plans for selected scenarios were collected from the Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) survey of school safety and discipline. 81 In the 2015-16 school year, 94 percent of public schools reported that they controlled access to school buildings by locking or monitoring doors during school hours (table 19.1).

Use of various safety and security procedures differed by school level during the 2015-16 school year (figure 19.1 and table 19.2). For example, greater percentages of public primary schools and public middle schools than of public high schools controlled access to school buildings and required faculty and staff to wear badges or picture IDs. Additionally, a greater percentage of primary schools than of middle schools required students to wear uniforms (25 vs. 20 percent), and both percentages were greater than the percentage of high schools requiring uniforms (12 percent). The percentage of schools reporting the enforcement of a strict dress code was greater for middle schools (70 percent) than for high schools (55 percent) and primary schools (46 percent). The percentage of schools reporting the use of security cameras to monitor the school was greater for high schools (94 percent) than middle schools (89 percent), and both of these percentages were greater than the percentage for primary schools (73 percent).

A greater percentage of public schools with 1,000 or more students enrolled than of those with fewer students enrolled reported the use of security cameras, a requirement that students wear badges or picture IDs, the use of random dog sniffs, and the use of random metal detector checks (table 19.2). A smaller percentage of schools with less than 300 students enrolled than of schools with higher numbers of students enrolled reported that they required faculty and staff to wear badges or picture IDs. A greater percentage of schools with 300-499 students (23 percent) and 500-999 students (25 percent) than of schools with less than 300 students or 1,000 or more students (both 16 percent) required students to wear uniforms. A similar pattern was evident for controlled access to school buildings. A greater percentage of schools with 500-999 students and 1,000 or more students (both 58 percent) than of schools with 300-499 students (49 percent) or less than 300 students (47 percent) reported the enforcement of a strict dress code. A greater percentage of public schools located in cities than of those located in suburban areas, towns, and rural areas reported in 2015-16 that they used random metal detector checks, required students wear badges or picture IDs, and required students to wear uniforms (table 19.2). A greater percentage of schools located in cities (61 percent) and rural areas (54 percent) than of those located in suburbs (46 percent) reported that they enforced a strict dress code. A greater percentage of schools in suburban areas (81 percent) than of those in towns (66 percent), cities (64 percent), and rural areas (56 percent) required faculty or staff to wear badges or picture IDs. Random dog sniffs were reported by a greater percentage of public schools in rural areas (37 percent) and towns (31 percent) than in suburban areas (19 percent) and cities (15 percent). A greater percentage of schools in rural areas (84 percent) than of those in suburbs (78 percent) reported the use of security cameras, and a greater percentage of schools in cities (96 percent) than of those in rural areas (91 percent) reported controlled access to school buildings. Many safety and security measures tended to be more prevalent in schools where 76 percent or more of students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch than in schools where a lower percentage were eligible (table 19.2). A greater percentage of schools where 76 percent or more of students were eligible than of schools where lower percentages were eligible reported that they enforced a strict dress code, required school uniforms, and used random metal detector checks. A smaller percentage of schools where 76 percent or more of students or 25 percent or less were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (17 and 18 percent, respectively) reported the use of random dog sniffs than of schools where 26 to 50 percent of students and 51 to 75 percent of students (both 30 percent) were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch.

NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. Data for 2013-14 were collected using the Fast Response Survey System, while data for other years were collected using the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS). The 2013-14 survey was designed to allow comparisons with SSOCS data. However, respondents to the 2013-14 survey could choose either to complete the survey on paper (and mail it back) or to complete the survey online, whereas respondents to SSOCS did not have the option of completing the survey online. The 2013-14 survey also relied on a smaller sample. The percentages of public schools reporting the use of various safety and security measures in 2015-16 tended to be higher than in prior years (figure 19.2  and table 19.1). For example, the percentage of public schools reporting the use of security cameras increased from 19 percent in 1999-2000 to 81 percent in 2015-16. Similarly, the percentage of public schools reporting that they controlled access to school buildings increased from 75 percent to 94 percent during this period. From 1999-2000 to 2015-16, the following safety and security measures also increased: requiring faculty and staff to wear badges or picture IDs, use of random dog sniffs, requiring school uniforms, and requiring students to wear badges or picture IDs. Conversely, the percentage of schools that reported using random metal detector checks decreased from 7 percent in 1999-2000 to 4 percent in 2015-16. The percentage of schools reporting that they enforced a strict dress code increased from 47 percent in 1999-2000 to 58 percent in 2013-14, but the percentage in 2015-16 (53 percent) was lower than the percentage in 2013-14. Another aspect of school safety and security is ensuring that plans are in place to be enacted in the event of specific scenarios. In 2015-16, about 96 percent of public schools reported they had a written plan for procedures to be performed in the event of a natural disaster (figure 19.3 and table  19.3). 82 Ninety-four percent of public schools reported they had a plan for procedures to be performed in the event of bomb threats or incidents. The percentage of schools that had a plan in place for procedures to be performed in the event of a shooting increased over time, from 79 percent in 2003-04 to 92 percent in 2015-16. 83 In 2015-16, schools were also asked whether they had drilled students during the current school year on the use of selected emergency procedures. About 95 percent of schools had drilled students on a lockdown procedure, 84 92 percent had drilled students on evacuation procedures, 85 and 76 percent had drilled students on shelter-in-place procedures. 86 82 For example, earthquakes or tornadoes. 83 On the 2015-16 questionnaire, the wording was changed from \"Shootings\" to \"Active shooter.\" 84 Defined for respondents as \"a procedure that involves occupants of a school building being directed to remain confined to a room or area within a building with specific procedures to follow. A lockdown may be used when a crisis occurs outside of the school and an evacuation would be dangerous. A lockdown may also be called for when there is a crisis inside and movement within the school will put students in jeopardy. All exterior doors are locked and students and staff stay in their classrooms.\" 85 Defined for respondents as \"a procedure that requires all students and staff to leave the building. While evacuating to the school's field makes sense for a fire drill that only lasts a few minutes, it may not be an appropriate location for a longer period of time. The evacuation plan should encompass relocation procedures and include backup buildings to serve as emergency shelters, such as nearby community centers, religious institutions, businesses, or other schools. Evacuation also includes 'reverse evacuation,' a procedure for schools to return students to the building quickly if an incident occurs while students are outside.\" 86 Defined for respondents as \"a procedure similar to a lockdown in that the occupants are to remain on the premises; however, shelter-in-place is designed to use a facility and its indoor atmosphere to temporarily separate people from a hazardous outdoor environment. Everyone would be brought indoors and building personnel would close all windows and doors and shut down the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC). This would create a neutral pressure in the building, meaning the contaminated air would not be drawn into the building.\"  Indicator 20"}, {"section_title": "Students' Reports of Safety and Security Measures Observed at School", "text": "In 2017, about 84 percent of students ages 12-18 reported observing one or more security cameras to monitor the school, and 79 percent of students reported observing locked entrance or exit doors during the day at their schools.

In 2017, about 99 percent of students ages 12-18 reported that they observed the use of at least one of the selected safety and security measures at their schools (figure 20.1 and table 20.1). In 2017, about 95 percent of students ages 12-18 reported that their schools had a written code of student conduct, higher than the percentages for all other safety and security measures examined. Most students also reported a requirement that visitors sign in and wear visitor badges or stickers (90 percent), and most reported the presence of school staff (other than security guards or assigned police officers) or other adults supervising the hallway (88 percent). About 84 percent of students reported the use of one or more security cameras to monitor the school, 79 percent reported locked entrance or exit doors during the day, 71 percent reported the presence of security guards or assigned police officers, 48 percent reported locker checks, and 24 percent reported that students were required to wear badges or picture identification at their schools. Ten percent of students reported the use of metal detectors at their schools, making this the least observed of all selected safety and security measures in 2017. The percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported observing the use of one or more security cameras to monitor the school increased between 2001 and 2017 (from 39 to 84 percent), as did the percentages of students who reported observing the use of locked entrance or exit door during the day (from 49 to 79 percent) and who reported observing the presence of security guards or assigned police officers (from 64 to 71 percent). However, the percentages of students reporting these three safety and security measures did not measurably differ between the two most recent survey years (2015 and 2017). The percentage of students who reported a requirement that students wear badges or picture identification was higher in 2017 than in 2001 (24 vs. 21 percent), but this percentage was also not measurably different between the two most recent survey years. The percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported observing locker checks decreased between 2001 and 2017 (from 54 to 48 percent). The percentages of students who reported locker checks and the presence of metal detectors were both lower in 2017 than in 2015 (48 vs. 53 percent and 10 vs. 12 percent, respectively). The percentages of students who reported a written code of student conduct and the presence of school staff (other than security guards or assigned police officers) or other adults supervising the hallway were not measurably different between 2001 and 2017, or between 2015 and 2017. The percentage of students who reported a requirement that visitors sign in and wear visitor badges or stickers was not measurably different between 2015 and 2017. 88  1 Prior to 2015, the question asked simply whether the school had \"A requirement that visitors sign in.\" As of 2015, the question has also included the requirement that visitors wear badges or stickers. Data for 2001 have been omitted because the change in questionnaire wording may affect comparability of the data over time.

The number of on-campus crimes reported per 10,000 full-time-equivalent students also increased, from 18.7 in 2015 to 19.2 in 2016. Since 1990, postsecondary institutions participating in Title IV federal student financial aid programs have been required to comply with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, known as the Clery Act. The Clery Act requires institutions to distribute timely warnings about crime occurrences to students and staff; to publicly report campus crime and safety policies; and to collect, report, and disseminate campus crime data. Since 1999, data on campus safety and security have been reported by institutions through the Campus Safety and Security Survey, sponsored by the Office of Postsecondary Education of the U.S. Department of Education. These reports include on-campus criminal offenses and arrests involving students, faculty, staff, and the general public, as well as referrals for disciplinary action primarily dealing with persons associated formally with the institution (i.e., students, faculty, and other staff). In 2016, a total of 28,400 criminal incidents against persons and property on campuses at postsecondary institutions were reported to police and security agencies, representing a 3 percent increase from 2015, when 27,600 criminal incidents were reported (table 21.1). The number of on-campus crimes reported per 10,000 full-time-equivalent (FTE) students 89 also increased, from 18.7 in 2015 to 19.2 in 2016 (table 21.2). Among the various types of on-campus crimes reported in 2016, there were 12,000 burglaries, 90 which constituted 42 percent of all criminal incidents (table 21.1). Other commonly reported crimes included forcible sex offenses (8,900 incidents, or 31 percent of crimes) and motor vehicle thefts (3,500 incidents, or 12 percent of crimes). In addition, 2,200 aggravated assaults and 1,100 robberies 91 were reported. These estimates translate to 8.1 burglaries, 6.0 forcible sex offenses, 2.4 motor vehicle thefts, 1.5 aggravated assaults, and 0.7 robberies per 10,000 FTE students (table 21.2). Between 2001 and 2016, the overall number of reported on-campus crimes decreased by 32 percent (figure 21.1 and table 21.1). During this period, the number of reported on-campus crimes increased by 7 percent between 2001 and 2006 (from 41,600 to 44,500), decreased by 40 percent between 2006 and 2014 (from 44,500 to 26,800), but then increased by 6 percent between 2014 and 2016 (from 26,800 to 28,400). This recent increase was driven primarily by the recent increase in the number of reported forcible sex offenses. The number of on-campus crimes reported in 2016 was lower than the number reported in 2001 for every category except forcible sex offenses and negligent manslaughter offenses. 92 The number of reported forcible sex offenses on campus increased from 2,200 in 2001 to 8,900 in 2016 (a 305 percent increase). More recently, the number of reported forcible sex offenses increased by 11 percent between 2015 and 2016 (from 8,000 to 8,900). Data on reported forcible sex offenses were collected differently since 2014. Since 2014, schools were asked to report the numbers of two different types of forcible sex offenses, rape and fondling, and these were added together to reach the total number of reported forcible sex offenses. In years prior to 2014, schools reported only a total number of reported forcible sex offenses, with no breakouts for specific types of offenses. About 5,800 rapes and 3,100 fondling incidents were reported in 2016. 91 Taking or attempting to take anything of value using actual or threatened force or violence. 92 The number of negligent manslaughter offenses was the same in 2001 and 2016 (2 incidents).

Some institutions that report Clery Act data-specifically, non-degree-granting institutions and institutions outside of the 50 states and the District of Columbia-are excluded from this figure. Crimes include incidents involving students, staff, and on-campus guests. Excludes off-campus crimes even if they involve college students or staff. The number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 FTE students changed between 2001 and 2016 due to changes both in the FTE college enrollment and in the number of reported on-campus crimes during that period (see Digest of Education Statistics 2017 for details about college enrollment). Overall, the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 students decreased from 35.6 in 2001 to 19.2 in 2016 (figure 21.1 and table 21.2). Between 2001 and 2006, both postsecondary enrollment and the number of reported on-campus crimes increased. However, because enrollment increased by a larger percentage than the number of reported crimes, the number of reported on-campus crimes per 10,000 students was actually lower in 2006 (33.4) than in 2001 (35.6). Between 2006 and 2014, the number of reported on-campus crimes decreased, enrollment increased, and the number of on-campus crimes reported per 10,000 students decreased from 33.4 to 18.1. Between 2014 and 2016, the number of reported on-campus crimes increased, enrollment decreased, and the number of reported on-campus crimes per 10,000 students increased from 18.1 to 19.2. The rate per 10,000 students was lower in 2016 than in 2001 for all types of reported on-campus crimes except forcible sex offenses. The rate for forcible sex offenses increased from 1.9 per 10,000 students in 2001 to 6.0 per 10,000 students in 2016. In 2016, the number of crimes reported on college campuses differed by type of institution, although to some extent this reflects the enrollment size of the types of institutions and the presence of student residence halls. Crimes involving students on campus after normal class hours, such as those occurring in residence halls, are included in campus crime reports, while crimes involving students off campus are not. In 2016, institutions with residence halls reported higher rates of on-campus crime than institutions without residence halls (24.8 vs. 5.9 per 10,000 FTE students; table 21.2). The rate for each individual type of crime was also higher for institutions with residence halls. For example, more burglaries were reported at institutions with residence halls than at institutions without residence halls (10.7 vs. 2.1 per 10,000 students), and more forcible sex offenses were reported at institutions with residence halls than at institutions without them (8.2 vs. 0.8 per 10,000 students). Illegal weapons possession NOTE: Data are for degree-granting institutions, which are institutions that grant associate's or higher degrees and participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs. Some institutions that report Clery Act data-specifically, non-degree-granting institutions and institutions outside of the 50 states and the District of Columbia-are excluded from this figure. Arrests include incidents involving students, staff, and on-campus guests. Excludes off-campus arrests even if they involve college students or staff. Although data for different types of institutions are difficult to compare directly because of the differing structures of student services and campus arrangements, there were decreases in the overall numbers of on-campus crimes reported at all institution types between 2006 (when the overall number of reported on-campus crimes reached its peak since data collection began) and 2016. For example, the number of reported on-campus crimes decreased over this period from 20,600 to 14,200 for public 4-year institutions, from 16,900 to 11,100 for nonprofit 4-year institutions, and from 5,700 to 2,600 for public 2-year institutions (table 21.1). The decreases in the number of on-campus crimes reported per 10,000 FTE students over the period were from 35.5 to 19.7 for public 4-year institutions, from 57.7 to 32.7 for nonprofit 4-year institutions, and from 15.4 to 7.9 for public 2-year institutions (table 21.2). As part of the Clery Act, postsecondary institutions are also required to report the number of arrests made on campus for illegal weapons possession, drug law violations, and liquor law violations. The total number of these reported on-campus arrests increased between 2001 and 2011 (from 40,300 to 54,300), then decreased between 2011 and 2016 (from 54,300 to 39,000; figure 21.2 and table 21.1). The number of arrests for drug law violations increased from 11,900 to 19,300 between 2001 and 2016. There was an increase in the number of arrests for liquor law violations between 2001 and 2007 (from 27,400 to 35,100); however, the number decreased between 2007 and 2016, and the 2016 figure (18,600) was lower than in any year between 2001 and 2015. There was no clear pattern of change in the number of arrests for illegal weapons possession between 2001 and 2016; the number of arrests ranged from 1,000 to 1,300 each year during this time span. The number of arrests per 10,000 FTE students for drug law violations increased from 10.2 in 2001 to 13.0 in 2016 (figure 21.2 and table 21.2). In contrast, the number of arrests per 10,000 students for liquor law violations decreased from 23.5 to 12.6, and the number of arrests per 10,000 students for illegal weapons possession was lower in 2016 (0.8) than in 2001 (0.9). In addition to reporting on-campus arrests, institutions report referrals for disciplinary action for cases involving illegal weapons possession, drug law violations, and liquor law violations. Disciplinary action counts include only incidents for which there was a referral for institutional disciplinary action but no arrest. In 2016, there were 231,600 referrals for disciplinary action for cases involving illegal   .3 and  table 21.1). The number of referrals for liquor law violations also increased during this period (from 130,000 to 173,700). The number of referrals for illegal weapons possession varied somewhat from year to year with no clear pattern of change, but the number of such referrals in 2016 (1,400) was higher than the number in 2001 (1,300). Part of the increase in the total number of disciplinary referrals over time may be associated with increases in the number of students on college campuses. The number of referrals per 10,000 students for drug law violations increased between 2001 and 2016 (from 20.5 to 38.2; figure 21.3 and table 21.2). However, the number of referrals per 10,000 FTE students for illegal weapons possession was lower in 2016 (1.0) than in 2001 (1.1); the number of referrals per 10,000 students for liquor law violations decreased between 2006 and 2016 (from 141.6 to 117.4), following an increase between 2001 and 2006 (from 111.3 to 141.6). In 2016, the number of referrals per 10,000 FTE students for liquor law violations differed by type of institution and by presence of student residence halls. For instance, the number of referrals per 10,000 students for liquor law violations was higher for nonprofit 4-year institutions than for public 4-year institutions (232.9 vs. 125.0 per 10,000 students). Similarly, this rate was higher for nonprofit 2-year institutions than for public 2-year institutions (60.5 vs. 12.2 per 10,000 students). Overall and for each type of institution, the number of referrals per 10,000 students for liquor law violations was higher at institutions with residence halls than at institutions without residence halls. For instance, among nonprofit 4-year institutions, the rate was 254.7 per 10,000 students at institutions with residence halls, compared with 15.8 per 10,000 students at institutions without residence halls; among public 4-year institutions, the rate was 139.5 per 10,000 students at institutions with residence halls, compared with 0.5 per 10,000 students at institutions without residence halls. 1 Willfully or maliciously destroying, damaging, defacing, or otherwise injuring real or personal property without the consent of the owner or the person having custody or control of it. 2 Placing another person in reasonable fear of bodily harm through the use of threatening words and/or other conduct, but without displaying a weapon or subjecting the victim to actual physical attack. 3 Physical attack by one person upon another where neither the offender displays a weapon nor the victim suffers obvious severe or aggravated bodily injury involving apparent broken bones, loss of teeth, possible internal injury, severe laceration, or loss of consciousness. 4 Unlawful taking, carrying, leading, or riding away of property from the possession of another. 5 Attack upon a person for the purpose of inflicting severe or aggravated bodily injury. 6 Any sexual act directed against another person forcibly and/or against that person's will. 7 Unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or theft. 8 Taking or attempting to take anything of value using actual or threatened force or violence. 9 Willful or malicious burning or attempt to burn a dwelling house, public building, motor vehicle, or personal property of another.

Similar to the overall pattern, race was also the most frequent category of motivating bias associated with the three most common types of hate crimes reported in 2016-vandalism, intimidation, and simple assault. Race accounted for 38 percent of reported vandalisms classified as hate crimes (174 incidents), 40 percent of reported intimidations (167 incidents), and 42 percent of reported simple assaults (42 incidents; figure 22.2 and table 22.1). Sexual orientation was the second-most frequent motivating bias reported for intimidations (20 percent; 84 incidents) and simple assaults (17 percent; 17 incidents). Religion was the second-most frequent motivating bias reported for vandalisms (29 percent; 136 incidents). The third-most frequent motivating bias reported for vandalisms was sexual orientation (14 percent; 66 incidents) and for intimidations was religion (16 percent; 66 incidents), while the third-most frequent motivating bias reported for simple assaults was ethnicity (14 percent; 14 incidents). Across different types of institutions, the total number of hate crimes reported in 2016 was highest at 4-year public and 4-year private nonprofit postsecondary institutions (483 and 395 incidents, respectively); to some extent, this reflects their larger enrollment size and number of students living on campus. Public 2-year institutions, which also enroll a large number of students, had the third-highest total number of reported hate crimes (178 incidents). The frequency of crimes and the most commonly reported categories of motivating bias were similar across these types of postsecondary institutions.

While evacuating to the school's field makes sense for a fire drill that only lasts a few minutes, it may not be an appropriate location for a longer period of time. The evacuation plan should encompass relocation procedures and include backup buildings to serve as emergency shelters, such as nearby community centers, religious institutions, businesses, or other schools. Evacuation also includes 'reverse evacuation,' a procedure for schools to return students to the building quickly if an incident occurs while students are outside.\" 7 Defined for respondents as \"a procedure that involves occupants of a school building being directed to remain confined to a room or area within a building with specific procedures to follow. A lockdown may be used when a crisis occurs outside of the school and an evacuation would be dangerous. A lockdown may also be called for when there is a crisis inside and movement within the school will put students in jeopardy. All exterior doors are locked and students and staff stay in their classrooms.\" 8 Defined for respondents as \"a procedure similar to a lockdown in that the occupants are to remain on the premises; however, shelter-in-place is designed to use a facility and its indoor atmosphere to temporarily separate people from a hazardous outdoor environment. Everyone would be brought indoors and building personnel would close all windows and doors and shut down the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC). This would create a neutral pressure in the building, meaning the contaminated air would not be drawn into the building.\" 9 Data on suicide threat or incident, severe risk of terrorist attack, and pandemic flu were not collected in 2003-04 and 2005-06. 10 Data on postcrisis reunification of students with their families were not collected in years prior to 2015-16. 11 Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 8.

For specific SAVD studies, school-level data for schools where incidents occur are obtained through the National Center for Education Statistics Common Core of Data and include school demographics, locale (e.g., urban, suburban, rural), grade levels comprising the school, Title I eligibility, and percentage of students eligible for free/reduced-price lunch among other variables. All data years are flagged as \"preliminary.\" For some recent cases, the law enforcement reports have not yet been received. The details learned during data abstraction from law enforcement reports can occasionally change the classification of a case. New cases may be identified, because of the expansion of the scope of media files used for case identification. However, cases not identified during earlier data years may be discovered at a later date as a result of newly published media articles describing the incident.

Initiated in 1972 and redesigned in 1992, the NCVS collects detailed information on the frequency and nature of the crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, theft, household burglary, and motor vehicle theft experienced by Americans and American households each year. The survey measures both crimes reported to police and crimes not reported to the police. NCVS estimates reported in Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2013 and beyond may differ from those in previous published reports. This is because a small number of victimizations, referred to as series victimizations, are included in this report using a new counting strategy. High-frequency repeat victimizations, or series victimizations, refer to situations in which six or more similar but separate victimizations that occur with such frequency that the victim is unable to recall each individual event or describe each event in detail. As part of ongoing research efforts on the NCVS, BJS investigated ways to include high-frequency repeat victimizations, or series victimizations, in estimates of criminal victimization, which results in more accurate estimates of victimization. BJS now includes series victimizations using the victim's estimates of the number of times the victimization occurred over the past 6 months, capping the number of victimizations within each series at 10. This strategy balances the desire to estimate national rates and account for the experiences of persons who have been subjected to repeat victimizations against the desire to minimize the estimation errors that can occur when repeat victimizations are reported. Including series victimizations in national rates results in rather large The SCS was designed to assist policymakers, as well as academic researchers and practitioners at federal, state, and local levels, to make informed decisions concerning crime in schools. The survey asks students a number of key questions about their experiences with and perceptions of crime and violence that occurred inside their school, on school grounds, on the school bus, or on the way to or from school. Students are asked additional questions about security measures used by their school, students' participation in afterschool activities, students' perceptions of school rules, the presence of weapons and gangs in school, the presence of hate-related words and graffiti in school, student reports of bullying and reports of rejection at school, and the availability of drugs and alcohol in school. Students are also asked attitudinal questions relating to fear of victimization and avoidance behavior at school. The SCS survey was conducted for a 6-month period from January through June in all households selected for the NCVS (see discussion above for information about the NCVS sampling design and changes to the race/ethnicity variable beginning in 2003). Within these households, the eligible respondents for the SCS were those household members who had attended school at any time during the 6 months preceding the interview, were enrolled in grades 6-12, and were not homeschooled. In 2007, the questionnaire was changed and household members who attended school sometime during the school year of the interview were included. The age range of students covered in this report is 12-18 years of age. Eligible respondents were asked the supplemental questions in the SCS only after completing their entire NCVS interview. It should be noted that the first or unbounded NCVS interview has always been included in analysis of the SCS data and may result in the reporting of events outside of the requested reference period. The prevalence of victimization for 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017 was calculated by using NCVS incident variables appended to the SCS data files of the same year. The NCVS type of crime variable was used to classify victimizations of students in the SCS as serious violent, violent, or theft. The NCVS variables asking where the incident happened (at school) and what the victim was doing when it happened (attending school or on the way to or from school) were used to ascertain whether the incident happened at school. Only incidents that occurred inside the United States are included. In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modified from previous collections. First, in 1995 and 1999, \"at school\" was defined for respondents as in the school building, on the school grounds, or on a school bus. In 2001, the definition for \"at school\" was changed to mean in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. This change was made to the 2001 questionnaire in order to be consistent with the definition of \"at school\" as it is constructed in the NCVS and was also used as the definition in subsequent SCS collections. Cognitive interviews conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on the 1999 SCS suggested that modifications to the definition of \"at school\" would not have a substantial impact on the estimates. A total of about 9,700 students participated in the 1995 SCS, 8,400 in 1999SCS, 8,400 in , 8,400 in 2001SCS, 8,400 in , 7,200 in 2003SCS, 8,400 in , 6,300 in 2005SCS, 8,400 in , 5,600 in 2007SCS, 8,400 in , 5,000 in 2009,500 in 2011, 5,500 in 2015, and 7,100 in 2017. In the 2017 SCS, the household completion rate was 76 percent. In the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017 SCS, the household completion rates were 95 percent, 94 percent, 93 percent, 92 percent, 91 percent, 90 percent, 92 percent, 91 percent, 86 percent, 82 percent, and 76 percent, respectively, and the student completion rates were 78 percent, 78 percent, 77 percent, 70 percent, 62 percent, 58 percent, 56 percent, 63 percent, 60 percent, 58 percent, and 52 percent, respectively. The overall unweighted SCS unit response rate (calculated by multiplying the household completion rate by the student completion rate) was about 74 percent in 1995, 73 percent in 1999, 72 percent in 2001, 64 percent in 2003, 56 percent in 2005, 53 percent in 2007, 51 percent in 2009, 57 percent in 2011, 51 percent in 2013, 48 percent in 2015, and 40 percent in 2017. There are two types of nonresponse: unit and item nonresponse. NCES requires that any stage of data collection within a survey that has a unit base-weighted response rate of less than 85 percent be evaluated for the potential magnitude of unit nonresponse bias before the data or any analysis using the data may be released (U.S. Department of Education 2003). Due to the low unit response rate in 2005,2007,2009,2011,2013,2015, and 2017, a unit nonresponse bias analysis was done. Unit response rates indicate how many sampled units have completed interviews. Because interviews with students could only be completed after households had responded to the NCVS, the unit completion rate for the SCS reflects both the household interview completion rate and the student interview completion rate. Nonresponse can greatly affect the strength and application of survey data by leading to an increase in variance as a result of a reduction in the actual size of the sample and can produce bias if the nonrespondents have characteristics of interest that are different from the respondents. In order for response bias to occur, respondents must have different response rates and responses to particular survey variables. The magnitude of unit nonresponse bias is determined by the response rate and the differences between respondents and nonrespondents on key survey variables. Although the bias analysis cannot measure response bias since the SCS is a sample survey and it is not known how the population would have responded, the SCS sampling frame has several key student or school characteristic variables for which data are known for respondents and nonrespondents: sex, age, race/ethnicity, household income, region, and urbanicity, all of which are associated with student victimization. To the extent that there are differential responses by respondents in these groups, nonresponse bias is a concern. In 2005, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of bias for the race, household income, and urbanicity variables. White (non-Hispanic) and Other (non-Hispanic) respondents had higher response rates than Black (non-Hispanic) and Hispanic respondents. Respondents from households with an income of $35,000-$49,999 and $50,000 or more had higher response rates than those from households with incomes of less than $7,500, $7,500-$14,999, $15,000-$24,999, and $25,000-$34,999. Respondents who live in urban areas had lower response rates than those who live in rural or suburban areas. Although the extent of nonresponse bias cannot be determined, weighting adjustments, which corrected for differential response rates, should have reduced the problem. In 2007, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of bias by the race/ethnicity and household income variables. Hispanic respondents had lower response rates than other races/ethnicities. Respondents from households with an income of $25,000 or more had higher response rates than those from households with incomes of less than $25,000. However, when responding students are compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable differences between the responding students and the eligible students, suggesting that the nonresponse bias has little impact on the overall estimates. In 2009, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for the race/ethnicity and urbanicity variables. White students and students of other races/ethnicities had higher response rates than did Black and Hispanic respondents. Respondents from households located in rural areas had higher response rates than those from households located in urban areas. However, when responding students are compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable differences between the responding students and the eligible students, suggesting that the nonresponse bias has little impact on the overall estimates. In 2011, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for the age variable. Respondents 12 to 17 years old had higher response rates than did 18-year-old respondents in the NCVS and SCS interviews. Weighting the data adjusts for unequal selection probabilities and for the effects of nonresponse. The weighting adjustments that correct for differential response rates are created by region, age, race, and sex, and should have reduced the effect of nonresponse. In 2013, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for the age, region, and Hispanic origin variables in the NCVS interview response. Within the SCS portion of the data, only the age and region variables showed significant unit nonresponse bias. Further analysis indicated only the age 14 and the west region categories showed positive response biases that were significantly different from some of the other categories within the age and region variables. Based on the analysis, nonresponse bias seems to have little impact on the SCS results. In 2015, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for age, race, Hispanic origin, urbanicity, and region in the NCVS interview response. For the SCS interview, the age, race, urbanicity, and region variables showed significant unit nonresponse bias. The age 14 group and rural areas showed positive response biases that were significantly different from other categories within the age and urbanicity variables. The northeast region and Asian race group showed negative response biases that were significantly different from other categories within the region and race variables. These results provide evidence that these subgroups may have a nonresponse bias associated with them. Response rates for most SCS survey items in all survey years were high-typically 95 percent or more, meaning there is little potential for item nonresponse bias for most items in the survey.

Respondent and nonrespondent distributions were significantly different for the race/ethnicity subgroup only. However, after using weights adjusted for person nonresponse, there was no evidence that these response differences introduced nonresponse bias in the final victimization estimates. Response rates for key SCS items were about 98 percent or higher, meaning there was little potential for item nonresponse bias for most items in the survey.

The YRBSS focuses on priority health-risk behaviors established during youth that result in the most significant mortality, morbidity, disability, and social problems during both youth and adulthood. The YRBSS includes a national school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) as well as surveys conducted in states, territories, tribes, and large urban school districts. This report uses 1993uses , 1995uses , 1997uses , 1999uses , 2001uses , 2003uses , 2005uses , 2007uses , 2009uses , 2011uses , 2013uses , 2015uses , and 2017 The national YRBS uses a three-stage cluster sampling design to produce a nationally representative sample of students in grades 9-12 in the United States. In each survey, the target population consisted of all public and private school students in grades 9-12 in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The first-stage sampling frame included selecting primary sampling units (PSUs) from strata formed on the basis of urbanization and the relative percentage of Black and Hispanic students in the PSU. These PSUs are either counties; subareas of large counties; or groups of smaller, adjacent counties. At the second stage, schools were selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size. The final stage of sampling consisted of randomly selecting, in each chosen school and in each of grades 9-12, one or two classrooms from either a required subject, such as English or social studies, or a required period, such as homeroom or second period. All students in selected classes were eligible to participate. In surveys conducted before 2013, three strategies were used to oversample Black and Hispanic students: (1) larger sampling rates were used to select PSUs that are in high-Black and high-Hispanic strata; (2) a modified measure of size was used that increased the probability of selecting schools with a disproportionately high minority enrollment; and (3) two classes per grade, rather than one, were selected in schools with a high percentage of Black or Hispanic enrollment. In 2013, 2015, and 2017, only selection of two classes per grade was needed to achieve an adequate precision with minimum variance. Approximately 16,300 students participated in the 1993 survey, 10,900 participated in the 1995 survey, 16,300 participated in the 1997 survey, 15,300 participated in the 1999 survey, 13,600 participated in the 2001 survey, 15,200 participated in the 2003 survey, 13,900 participated in the 2005 survey, 14,000 participated in the 2007 survey, 16,400 participated in the 2009 survey, 15,400 participated in the 2011 survey, 13,600 participated in the 2013 survey, 15,600 participated in the 2015 survey, and 14,800 participated in the 2017 survey. The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993 survey, 60 percent for the 1995 survey, 69 percent for the 1997 survey, 66 percent for the 1999 survey, 63 percent for the 2001 survey, 67 percent for the 2003 survey, 67 percent for the 2005 survey, 68 percent for the 2007 survey, 71 percent for the 2009 survey, 71 percent for the 2011 survey, 68 percent for the 2013 survey, 60 percent for the 2015 survey, and 60 percent for the 2017 survey. NCES standards call for response rates of 85 percent or better for cross-sectional surveys, and bias analyses are generally required by NCES when that percentage is not achieved. For YRBS data, a full nonresponse bias analysis has not been done because the data necessary to do the analysis are not available. A school nonresponse bias analysis, however, was done for the 2017 survey. This analysis found some evidence of potential bias by school type and school poverty level, but concluded that the bias had little impact on the overall estimates and would be further reduced by weight adjustment. The weights were developed to adjust for nonresponse and the oversampling of Black and Hispanic students in the sample. The final weights were constructed so that only weighted proportions of students (not weighted counts of students) in each grade matched national population projections. State-level data were downloaded from the Youth Online: Comprehensive Results web page (http:// nccd.cdc.gov/YouthOnline/). Each state and district school-based YRBS employs a two-stage, cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in grades 9-12 in their jurisdiction. All except one state sample (South Dakota), and all district samples, include only public schools, and each district sample includes only schools in the funded school district (e.g., San Diego Unified School District) rather than in the entire city (e.g., greater San Diego area). In the first sampling stage in all except a few states and districts, schools are selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size. In the second sampling stage, intact classes of a required subject or intact classes during a required period (e.g., second period) are selected randomly. All students in sampled classes are eligible to participate. Certain states and districts modify these procedures to meet their individual needs. For example, in a given state or district, all schools, rather than a sample of schools, might be selected to participate. State and local surveys that have a scientifically selected sample, appropriate documentation, and an overall response rate greater than or equal to 60 percent are weighted. The overall response rate reflects the school response rate multiplied by the student response rate. These three criteria are used to ensure that the data from those surveys can be considered representative of students in grades 9-12 in that jurisdiction. A weight is applied to each record to adjust for student nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade, sex, and race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction. Therefore, weighted estimates are representative of all students in grades 9-12 attending schools in each jurisdiction. Surveys that do not have an overall response rate of greater than or equal to 60 percent and that do not have appropriate documentation are not weighted and are not included in this report. In 2017, a total of 39 states and 21 districts had weighted data. Not all of the districts were contained in the 39 states. For example, Texas was not one of the 39 states that obtained weighted data, but it contained two districts that did. For more information on the location of the districts, see https://www.cdc.gov/ healthyyouth/data/yrbs/participation.htm. In sites with weighted data, the student sample sizes for the state and district YRBS ranged from 805 to 51,807. School response rates ranged from 68 to 100 percent, student response rates ranged from 67 to 90 percent, and overall response rates ranged from 60 to 89 percent. Readers should note that reports of these data published by the CDC and in this report do not include percentages where the denominator includes less than 100 unweighted cases. In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office of Management and Budget's standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity, the YRBS item on race/ethnicity was modified. The version of the race and ethnicity question used in 1993, 1995, and 1997 2007,2009,2011,2013,2015, and 2017 surveys, race/ethnicity was computed from two questions: (1) \"Are you Hispanic or Latino?\" (response options were \"yes\" and \"no\"), and (2) \"What is your race?\" (response options were \"American Indian or Alaska Native,\" \"Asian,\" \"Black or African American,\" \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,\" or \"White\"). For the second question, students could select more than one response option. For this report, students were classified as \"Hispanic\" if they answered \"yes\" to the first question, regardless of how they answered the second question. Students who answered \"no\" to the first question and selected more than one race/ ethnicity in the second category were classified as \"More than one race.\" Students who answered \"no\" to the first question and selected only one race/ ethnicity were classified as that race/ethnicity. Race/ ethnicity was classified as missing for students who did not answer the first question and for students who answered \"no\" to the first question but did not answer the second question. CDC has conducted two studies to understand the effect of changing the race/ethnicity item on the YRBS. Brener, Kann, and McManus (2003) found that allowing students to select more than one response to a single race/ethnicity question on the YRBS had only a minimal effect on reported race/ ethnicity among high school students. Eaton et al. (2007) found that self-reported race/ethnicity was similar regardless of whether the single-question or a two-question format was used.

Data reported by districts, schools, principals, teachers, and library media centers provide a variety of statistics on the condition of education in the United States that may be used by policymakers and the general public. The SASS system covers a wide range of topics, including teacher demand, teacher and principal characteristics, teachers' and principals' perceptions of school climate and problems in their schools, teacher and principal compensation, district hiring and retention practices, general conditions in schools, and basic characteristics of the student population. SASS data are collected through a mail questionnaire with telephone and in-person field follow-up. SASS has been conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for NCES since the first administration of the survey, which was conducted during the 1987-88 school year. Subsequent SASS administrations were conducted in 1990-91, 1993-94, 1999-2000, 2003-04, 2007-08, and 2011-12. SASS is designed to produce national, regional, and state estimates for public elementary and secondary schools, school districts, principals, teachers, and school library media centers; and national and regional estimates for public charter schools, as well as principals, teachers, and school library media centers within these schools. For private schools, the sample supports national, regional, and affiliation estimates for schools, principals, and teachers. From its inception, SASS has had five core components: school questionnaires, teacher listing forms, teacher questionnaires, principal questionnaires, and school district (prior to 1999-2000, \"teacher demand and shortage\") questionnaires. A sixth component, school library media center questionnaires, was introduced in the 1993-94 administration and has been included in every subsequent administration of SASS. School library data were also collected in the 1990-91 administration of the survey through the school and principal questionnaires. Although the five core questionnaires and the school library media questionnaires have remained relatively stable over the various administrations of SASS, the survey has changed to accommodate emerging issues in elementary and secondary education. Some items have been added, some have been deleted, and some questionnaire items have been reworded. During the 1990-91 SASS cycle, NCES worked with the Office of Indian Education to add an Indian School Questionnaire to SASS, and it remained a part of SASS through 2007-08. The Indian School Questionnaire explores the same school-level issues that the Public and Private School Questionnaires explore, allowing comparisons among the three types of schools. The 1990The -91, 1993The -94, 1999The -2000The , 2003The -04, and 2007 administrations of SASS obtained data on Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) schools (schools funded or operated by the BIE), but the 2011-12 administration did not collect data from BIE schools. SASS estimates for all survey years presented in this report exclude BIE schools, and as a result, estimates in this report may differ from those in previously published reports. School library media center questionnaires were administered in public, private, and BIE schools as part of the 1993-94 and 1999-2000 SASS. During the 2003-04 administration of SASS, only library media centers in public schools were surveyed, and in 2007-08 library media centers in public schools and BIE and BIE-funded schools were surveyed. The 2011-12 survey collected data only on school library media centers in traditional public schools and in public charter schools. School library questions focused on facilities, services and policies, staffing, technology, information literacy, collections and expenditures, and media equipment. New or revised topics included access to online licensed databases, resource availability, and additional elements on information literacy. The Student Records and Library Media Specialist/Librarian Questionnaires were administered only in 1993-94. As part of the 1999-2000 SASS, the Charter School Questionnaire was sent to the universe of charter schools in operation in 1998-99. In 2003-04 and in subsequent administrations of SASS, charter schools were included in the public school sample as opposed to being sent a separate questionnaire. Another change in the 2003-04 administration of SASS was a revised data collection procedure using a primary in-person contact within the school intended to reduce the field follow-up phase. The SASS teacher surveys collect information on the characteristics of teachers, such as their age, race/ethnicity, years of teaching experience, average number of hours per week spent on teaching activities, base salary, average class size, and highest degree earned. These teacher-reported data may be combined with related information on their school's characteristics, such as school type (e.g., public traditional, public charter, Catholic, private other religious, and private nonsectarian), community type, and school enrollment size. The teacher questionnaires also ask for information on teacher opinions regarding the school and teaching environment. In 1993-94, about 53,000 public school teachers and 10,400 private school teachers were sampled. In 1999-2000, about 56,300 public school teachers, 4,400 public charter school teachers, and 10,800 private school teachers were sampled. In 2003-04, about 52,500 public school teachers and 10,000 private school teachers were sampled. In 2007-08, about 48,400 public school teachers and 8,200 private school teachers were sampled. In 2011-12, about 51,100 public school teachers and 7,100 private school teachers were sampled. Weighted overall response rates in 2011-12 were 61.8 percent for public school teachers and 50.1 percent for private school teachers. The SASS principal surveys focus on such topics as age, race/ethnicity, sex, average annual salary, years of experience, highest degree attained, perceived influence on decisions made at the school, and hours spent per week on all school activities. These data on principals can be placed in the context of other SASS data, such as the type of the principal's school (e.g., public traditional, public charter, Catholic, other religious, or nonsectarian), enrollment, and percentage of students eligible for free or reducedprice lunch. In 2003-04, about 10,200 public school principals were sampled, and in 2007-08, about 9,800 public school principals were sampled. In 2011-12, about 11,000 public school principals and 3,000 private school principals were sampled. Weighted response rates in 2011-12 for public school principals and private school principals were 72.7 percent and 64.7 percent, respectively. The SASS 2011-12 sample of schools was confined to the 50 states and the District of Columbia and excludes the other jurisdictions, the Department of Defense overseas schools, the BIE schools, and schools that do not offer teacher-provided classroom instruction in grades 1-12 or the ungraded equivalent. The SASS 2011-12 sample included 10,250 traditional public schools, 750 public charter schools, and 3,000 private schools. The public school sample for the 2011-12 SASS was based on an adjusted public school universe file from the 2009-10 Common Core of Data (CCD), a database of all the nation's public school districts and public schools. The private school sample for the 2011-12 SASS was selected from the 2009-10 Private School Universe Survey (PSS), as updated for the 2011-12 PSS. This update collected membership lists from private school associations and religious denominations, as well as private school lists from state education departments. The 2011-12 SASS private school frame was further augmented by the inclusion of additional schools that were identified through the 2009-10 PSS area frame data collection. Additional resources available regarding SASS include the methodology report Quality Profile for SASS, Rounds 1-3: 1987-1995, Aspects of the Quality of Data in the Schools andStaffing Surveys (SASS) (Kalton et al. 2000) (NCES 2000-308), as well as these reports: Documentation for the 2011-12 Schools andStaffing Survey (Cox et al. 2017) and User's Manual for the 2011-12 Schools andStaffing Survey, Volumes 1-6 (Goldring et al. 2013 "}, {"section_title": "National Teacher and Principal Survey (NTPS)", "text": "The National Teacher and Principal Survey is a set of related questionnaires that collect descriptive data on the context of elementary and secondary education. Data reported by schools, principals, and teachers provide a variety of statistics on the condition of education in the United States that may be used by policymakers and the general public. The NTPS system covers a wide range of topics, including teacher demand, teacher and principal characteristics, teachers' and principals' perceptions of school climate and problems in their schools, teacher and principal compensation, district hiring and retention practices, general conditions in schools, and basic characteristics of the student population. The NTPS was first conducted during the 2015-16 school year. The survey is a redesign of the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), which was conducted from the 1987-88 school year to the 2011-12 school year. Although the NTPS maintains the SASS survey's focus on schools, teachers, and administrators, the NTPS has a different structure and sample than SASS. In addition, whereas SASS operated on a 4-year survey cycle, the NTPS operates on a 2-year survey cycle. The school sample for the 2015-16 NTPS was based on an adjusted public school universe file from the 2013-14 Common Core of Data (CCD), a database of all the nation's public school districts and public schools. The NTPS definition of a school is the same as the SASS definition of a school-an institution or part of an institution that provides classroom instruction to students, has one or more teachers to provide instruction, serves students in one or more of grades 1-12 or the ungraded equivalent, and is located in one or more buildings apart from a private home. The 2015-16 NTPS universe of schools is confined to the 50 states plus the District of Columbia. It excludes the Department of Defense dependents schools overseas, schools in U.S. territories overseas, and CCD schools that do not offer teacher-provided classroom instruction in grades 1-12 or the ungraded equivalent. Bureau of Indian Education schools are included in the NTPS universe, but these schools were not oversampled and the data do not support separate BIE estimates. The NTPS includes three key components: school questionnaires, principal questionnaires, and teacher questionnaires. NTPS data are collected by the U.S. Census Bureau through a mail questionnaire with telephone and in-person field follow-up. The school and principal questionnaires were sent to sampled schools, and the teacher questionnaire was sent to a sample of teachers working at sampled schools. The NTPS school sample consisted of about 8,300 public schools; the principal sample consisted of about 8,300 public school principals; and the teacher sample consisted of about 40,000 public school teachers. The school questionnaire asks knowledgeable school staff members about grades offered, student attendance and enrollment, staffing patterns, teaching vacancies, programs and services offered, curriculum, and community service requirements. In addition, basic information is collected about the school year, including the beginning time of students' school days and the length of the school year. The weighted unit response rate for the 2015-16 school survey was 72.5 percent. The principal questionnaire collects information about principal/school head demographic characteristics, training, experience, salary, goals for the school, and judgments about school working conditions and climate. Information is also obtained on professional development opportunities for teachers and principals, teacher performance, barriers to dismissal of underperforming teachers, school climate and safety, parent/guardian participation in school events, and attitudes about educational goals and school governance. The weighted unit response rate for the 2015-16 principal survey was 71.8 percent. The accuracy of any statistic is determined by the joint effects of nonsampling and sampling errors. Both types of error affect the estimates presented in this report. Several sources can contribute to nonsampling errors. For example, members of the population of interest are inadvertently excluded from the sampling frame; sampled members refuse to answer some of the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all of the survey questions (questionnaire nonresponse); mistakes are made during data editing, coding, or entry; the responses that respondents provide differ from the \"true\" responses; or measurement instruments such as tests or questionnaires fail to measure the characteristics they are intended to measure. Although nonsampling errors due to questionnaire and item nonresponse can be reduced somewhat by the adjustment of sample weights and imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling errors or gauging the effects of these errors is usually difficult. Sampling errors occur because observations are made on samples rather than on entire populations. Surveys of population universes are not subject to sampling errors. Estimates based on a sample will differ somewhat from those that would have been obtained by a complete census of the relevant population using the same survey instruments, instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a statistic is a measure of the variation due to sampling; it indicates the precision of the statistic obtained in a particular sample. In addition, the standard errors for two sample statistics can be used to estimate the precision of the difference between the two statistics and to help determine whether the difference based on the sample is large enough so that it represents the population difference. Most of the data used in this report were obtained from complex sampling designs rather than a simple random design. The features of complex sampling require different techniques to calculate standard errors than are used for data collected using a simple random sampling. Therefore, calculation of standard errors requires procedures that are markedly different from the ones used when the data are from a simple random sample. The Taylor series approximation technique or the balanced repeated replication (BRR) method was used to estimate most of the statistics and their standard errors in this report. Standard error calculation for data from the School Crime Supplement was based on the Taylor series approximation method using PSU and strata variables available from each dataset. For statistics based on all years of NCVS data, standard errors were derived from a formula developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, which consists of three generalized variance function (gvf) constant parameters that represent the curve fitted to the individual standard errors calculated using the Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR) technique. The coefficient of variation (CV) represents the ratio of the standard error to the mean. As an attribute of a distribution, the CV is an important measure of the reliability and accuracy of an estimate. With the exception of Indicator 2, the CV was calculated for all estimates in this report, and in cases where the CV was between 30 and 50 percent the estimates were noted with an \"!\" symbol (interpret data with caution). In Indicator 2, the \"!\" symbol cautions the reader that estimates marked indicate that the reported statistic was based on fewer than 10 cases or the CV was greater than 50 percent. With the exception of Indicator 2, in cases where the CV was 50 percent or greater, the estimate was determined not to meet reporting standards and was suppressed."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "Comparisons in the text based on sample survey data have been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. Findings described in this report with comparative language (e.g., higher, lower, increase, and decrease) are statistically significant at the .05 level. Comparisons based on universe data do not require statistical testing, with the exception of linear trends. Several test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the statement being tested. The primary test procedure used in this report was Student's t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. The formula used to compute the t statistic is as follows: (1) where E 1 and E 2 are the estimates to be compared and se 1 and se 2 are their corresponding standard errors. Note that this formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the estimates are not independent (for example, when comparing a total percentage with that for a subgroup included in the total), a covariance \u221ase 2 + se 2 E 1 -E 2 t = 1 2 term (i.e., 2 * r * se 1 * se 2 ) must be subtracted from the denominator of the formula: (2) where r is the correlation coefficient. Once the t value was computed, it was compared to the published tables of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels. For this report, an alpha value of .05 was used, which has a t value of 1.96. If the t value was larger than 1.96, then the difference between the two estimates is statistically significant at the 95 percent level. A linear trend test was used when differences among percentages were examined relative to ordered categories of a variable, rather than the differences between two discrete categories. This test allows one to examine whether, for example, the percentage of students using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school increased (or decreased) with their age. Based on a regression with, for example, student's age as the independent variable and whether a student was physically attacked as the dependent variable, the test involves computing the regression coefficient (b) and its corresponding standard error (se). The ratio of these two (b/se) is the test statistic t. If t is greater than 1.96, the critical value for one comparison at the .05 alpha level, the hypothesis that there is no linear relationship between student's age and being physically attacked is rejected. Some comparisons among categories of an ordered variable with three or more levels involved a test for a linear trend across all categories, rather than a series of tests between pairs of categories. In this report, when differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordered categories, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. To do this, ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts corresponding to successive levels of the independent variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors (that is, standard errors that were calculated by the Taylor series method), the variance between the means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used to partition the total sum of squares into within-and between-group sums of squares. These were used to create mean squares for the within-and betweengroup variance components and their corresponding F statistics, which were then compared to published values of F for a significance level of .05. Significant values of both the overall F and the F associated with the linear contrast term were required as evidence of a linear relationship between the two variables. \u221ase 2 + se 2 -(2 * r * se 1 * se 2 ) This page intentionally left blank.

High school A school in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 12. Homicide An act involving a killing of one person by another resulting from interpersonal violence. Incident A specific criminal act or offense involving one or more victims and one or more offenders. Instructional level Teachers are divided into elementary or secondary based on a combination of the grades taught, main teaching assignment, and the structure of their classes. Those with only ungraded classes become elementary level teachers if their main assignment is Early childhood/preK or Elementary, or they teach either special education in a self-contained classroom or an elementary enrichment class. All other teachers with ungraded classes are classified as secondary level. Among teachers with regularly graded classes, elementary level teachers generally teach any of grades preK-5; report a main assignment in an Early childhood/preK, Elementary, Self-contained special education, or Elementary enrichment program; or report that the majority of grades taught are K-6. In general, secondary level teachers instruct any of grades 7-12 but usually no grade lower than 5th. They also teach more of grades 7-12 than lower level grades.
