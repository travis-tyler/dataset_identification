[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "For over a century economists have been concerned that pressure from investors for shortterm results can damage the long-run growth of companies. For example, Alfred Marshall famously wrote in 1890 that people act like \"children who pick the plums out of their pudding to eat them at once.\" This paper examines the macroeconomic growth implications of shorttermism through the lens of analyst earnings targets, a particularly prevalent and observable manifestation of short-term pressure today. 1 The benefits from investments in research and development (R&D) or other intangible expenditures may either fail to materialize or appear only much later. Yet the costs of these long-term investments generally must be borne today. In a particularly important example of this tradeoff, R&D must be immediately subtracted or expensed from profits according to the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) governing public firms in the US. 2 If failure to deliver short-term results has adverse consequences, firms or managers may therefore be willing to sacrifice some long-term value to deliver higher profit now. Economic theory for decades has modeled overall growth and changes in aggregate productivity as the result of long-term investment at the microeconomic level. So a heavy dependence of long-term investment on short-term pressures can be crucial for understanding the process of economic growth in the macroeconomy. 3 Furthermore, factors impacting long-term growth disproportionately affect the economy in quantitative terms because of their compounding effects. This paper takes several concrete steps towards empirically documenting and structurally quantifying the costs of short-termism, through the lens of pressure to meet earnings forecasts, on innovative investments, long-term growth, and welfare. Research analysts at stock brokerages routinely forecast the earnings of public companies. Firms publicly release statements of earnings, an accounting measure of profitability also known as net income or simply profits, at the end of each fiscal quarter and year. The 1 See Marshall (1890) for the quote, as well as Haldane and Davies (2011), Mayer (2012), Markoff (1990), or Michie (2001) for additional perspectives on short-termism. See also Budish et al. (Forthcoming) for a recent empirical treatment of apparent short-termist distortions of long-term investment in cancer drugs. 2 See Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rule 730-10-25-1 for the explicit statement of the rule in 2014 US GAAP. By contrast, EU accounting guidelines do allow for discretionary depreciation or amortization of R&D development costs (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2013). 3 See, for example, work by Romer (1990), Aghion and Howitt (1992), Grossman and Helpman (1991), or Acemoglu et al. (2013). Also, note that a recent strand of papers models endogenous growth as the product of idea flows (Perla and Tonetti, 2014;Lucas and Moll, 2011;Alvarez et al., 2008;Sampson, 2014). Since exploiting idea flows remains costly for firms, the tradeoff between growth and performance remains. financial press as well as equity market participants follow these releases closely during earnings season. Around 90% of the respondents to a broad survey of managers in Dichev et al. (2013) report systematic pressure, internal and external to their firms, to meet earnings benchmarks. Consistent with these reports, Figure I displays the annual distribution of the difference between realized and forecast earnings (forecast errors), scaled by firm assets for a panel of US public firms. A disproportionate number of firm-years report zero or just positive earnings forecast errors, i.e. display profits that just meet or beat analyst forecasts, while the mass of forecast errors is hollowed out just below zero. 4 Earnings benchmarks and potential concerns about short-termism are not exclusive to public firms. Interestingly, surveys of private and public firm managers reveal quite similar rates of reported earnings pressure. 5 However, the pressures and incentives surrounding innovation at large public firms, measured directly in this paper, are independently interesting for our broad understanding of innovation in the macroeconomy. Public firms undertake almost two-thirds (67%) of all non-government R&D expenditures in the United States. 6 A long history of research into apparent real earnings manipulation by public firms also suggests that R&D investments systematically and discontinuously change around earnings benchmarks or targets including analyst forecasts of profits. 7 More broadly, a literature on investments in technology notes that budgeting deadlines and agency frictions within firms can constrain the ability of organizations to invest in improved productivity, and other work in economic history suggests that the presence of sharp performance targets may contribute to overall inefficiency. 8 My paper first establishes two empirical facts using a merged database of analyst forecasts 4 Marinovic et al. (2012) and Hong and Kacperczyk (2010) overview analyst earnings forecasts. Burgstahler and Chuk (2013) emphasizes that the discontinuity in Figure I is robust. The McCrary (2008) sorting test strongly rejects continuity of the distribution at the zero forecast error level. See Garicano et al. (2013), Gourio and Roys (2012), Chetty et al. (2011), Daly et al. (2012), and Allen and Dechow (2013), respectively for evidence of similar bunching in French firm sizes around regulatory thresholds, Danish income around tax kinks, nominal wage changes around zero, and even marathon finish times around focal points. 5 See Dichev et al. (2013), Table 13. 6 The R&D statistic reflects the aggregation of R&D expenditures in my baseline sample from Compustat (xrd) compared to aggregate research expenditures in 2000 from the NSF Survey of Industrial Research and Development (total private R&D). Note that recent empirical studies by Bernstein (2012), Aghion et al. (2013), or Asker et al. (2014) suggest that the quality and quantity of innovation and investment at publicly traded firms can either be lower than in their private counterparts or hinge crucially upon factors such as institutional ownership with long horizons. 7 See for example, Bhojraj et al. (2009), Baber et al. (1991), Roychowdhury (2006), or Gunny (2010). 8 See Liebman and Mahoney (2013) for a study in the US government and Atkin et al. (2014) for an experiment Pakistani manufacturing. See Meng et al. (Forthcoming) for evidence that food procurement quotas across regions may have contributed to the severity of the Great Famine in China. and firm accounting data. First, firms that just meet or beat analyst forecasts in a particular year exhibit discontinuously lower R&D and broader intangibles investment growth. There is a drop of around 30% in mean R&D and intangibles growth relative to firms that just fail to meet earnings forecasts. Such discontinuities, detected using flexible nonparametric regression discontinuity estimators, are consistent with systematic manipulation of long-term investment to meet analyst forecasts of earnings. Relatedly, a survey of executives at large US public firms in Graham et al. (2005) corroborates the result: almost half of managers reveal that they would reject a positive net present value project if taking the project meant missing analyst forecasts of earnings. 9 In a second empirical contribution, the paper then applies the same techniques to inspect manager incentives and stock returns. CEOs just failing to deliver profits above consensus analyst expectations face drops of around 7% in total compensation. Earnings pressure is not limited to solely the CEO of a company. The several most highly paid executives in a company face around 5% less total compensation for just failing to meet analyst targets. Furthermore, stock returns are discontinuously lower for firms just failing to meet earnings targets. Firms that just fail to meet earnings targets see around 0.64% lower abnormal cumulative returns in a ten-day window to the earnings release date. The finding of apparent compensation incentives for managers to deliver short-term results, together with capital market pressures, helps to motivate real earnings manipulation but also concurs with a large literature on performance-based incentives and the relationship between earnings announcements and returns. 10 Building off of my empirical findings, the second part of the paper builds a theoretical model linking earnings targets and aggregate growth. The model features managers of heterogeneous firms making R&D investment decisions together with pure paper or accounting manipulation choices subject to both persistent and transitory profitability shocks. R&D expenditures by firms result in random innovation arrival according to a quality ladder structure that aggregates in general equilibrium. Earnings forecasts, endogenously produced by an outside sector of analysts, provide short-term pressure on managers who seek to avoid costs resulting from failure to meet earnings forecasts. The model is agnostic about the source of these costs for managers, but in practice earnings miss costs may be purely private to the manager due to reputational or career concerns (Dichev et al., 2013), borne by the firm due to higher external finance costs or disrupted communication costs with outsiders (Graham et al., 2005), or even the result of explicit manager compensation policies chosen by firms (Matsunaga and Park, 2001). 11 After laying out the model structure, the paper employs numerical solution methods and parametrizes the model using a combination of calibration and structural GMM estimation. Structural estimation here exploits the moments of R&D expenditures, sales, and forecast errors in a panel of firm-level data on thousands of large US public firms to produce a \"Baseline\" quantitative model economy. My main quantitative results in the paper compare the Baseline environment with a \"No Targets\" counterfactual economy in which there are no costs or incentives for managers to meet or beat earnings forecasts. The Baseline model with earnings targets for firms qualitatively reproduces the kinked earnings forecast error distribution in Figure I, with a disproportionate mass of firm-years just above targets and a hollowing out the forecast error distribution below zero. The counterfactual No Targets economy, by contrast, fails to reproduce a kinked distribution. Furthermore, while the No Targets economy produces a smooth distribution of R&D growth across the zero forecast error threshold, the Baseline model leads to a cut in R&D growth for firms just meeting earnings targets, consistent with the empirical evidence from the first portion of the paper. Finally, the counterfactual exercise reveals insights into a body of research in corporate finance studying the release of information contained within earnings releases and surprises (Stein, 1989;MacKinlay, 1997). Firms in the Baseline model with mediocre profitability shocks are able to find the resources, either in long-term investment manipulation or paper obfuscation, to boost earnings above target. Therefore, firms that miss an earnings forecast in equilibrium are far less profitable than firms meeting or beating earnings forecasts, a quantitative difference which is positive but muted by contrast in the No Targets economy. Such considerations may help to explain why firms report increased pressure from outsiders to explain or divulge more information about the prospects of the firm if they miss analyst expectations. The information revelation upon missing an earnings target also naturally helps to motivate the change in stock returns I document empirically for firms just failing to meet earnings targets. Within the model, short-termism can be defined as responsiveness of forward-looking R&D policies to purely transitory or short-term shocks to profitability, even when those shocks contain no information about the profitability of innovation in the long term. The Baseline economy features such short-termism, resulting in lower and more volatile R&D expenditures. 12 Increased volatility impacts the overall efficiency of R&D expenditures for firms even absent any effects on levels, since my theoretical structure includes curvature or diminishing returns to R&D. Just as Barlevy (2004) theoretically links business cycle volatility to reduced growth in the macroeconomy in the presence of diminishing returns to investments, my model implies that firms subject to transitory profitability shocks and choosing more volatile R&D expenditures have fewer innovation arrivals than would result from a smoother long-term investment path. 13 At the microeconomic level the result is lower firm value on average, an approximately 1% reduction in mean firm value in the Baseline economy relative to the No Targets case. By studying the distortion to longterm investments resulting from earnings targets, I contribute to a literature on structural estimation in dynamic corporate finance which outlines the costs to firms resulting from, for example, financial frictions, CEO firing costs, or agency frictions surrounding cash holding and investment. 14 At the macroeconomic level, the Baseline economy with earnings targets is characterized by lower aggregate growth of around 2.25% per year relative to a growth rate of around 2.31% per year in the No Targets environment. By exhibiting short-termism and responding to purely transitory profitability shocks with their long-term R&D investments, manager earnings pressure causes a sort of research misallocation, whereby the efficiency of aggregate innovation declines. 15 Small changes in permanent growth rates translate into quantitatively large differences in welfare, because these changes are continuously compounded over time. In my model, the removal of earnings targets results in an overall increase in welfare of 0.44%, i.e. consumption in each period would need to be increased by almost half a percent in the Baseline to make the aggregate household as well off as in the No Targets balanced 12 High R&D sensitivity to profitability echoes empirical work in corporate finance. See, for example, Borisova and Brown (2013), , and Mairesse et al. (1999). 13 For further macroeconomic work on the link between volatility and growth, see for example Ramey and Ramey (1995) or Imbs (2007). 14 See Hennessy and Whited (2007), Taylor (2010), and Nikolov and Whited (2010), respectively. Strebulaev and Whited (2012) provides an overview of structural estimation in dynamic corporate finance. 15 The misallocation from profitability volatility is distinct from but related to the broader literature on misallocation in Hsieh and Klenow (2009), Restuccia and Rogerson (2008), Peters (2013), Asker et al. (2013), or Yang (2014). growth path. 16 For comparison, recent quantitative estimates of the welfare gains from the elimination of business cycles are around 0.1-1.8%, or the static gains from trade according to recent work could be approximately 2.0-2.5%. 17 Overall, short-termism from earnings targets results in a quantitatively large distortion to long-term growth and the macroeconomy. The main quantitative contribution of the paper should be interpreted as the delineation of the costs of earnings targets as outlined above. However, earnings targets may of course also provide benefits to firms or society, omitted from the baseline cost measurements. 18 For example, earnings forecasts may contribute to more accurate valuation of firms or alleviate financial frictions at otherwise healthy firms. In fact, a series of recent theoretical and empirical papers indicates that alleviation of financial frictions or the liberalization of equity markets can indeed reap efficiency gains from better allocation of resources throughout the macroeconomy. 19 A second source of potential benefits from earnings targets operates within firms through the provision of discipline to managers in the presence of agency conflicts. Compensation schemes which explicitly or implicitly punish managers for failure to meet publicly observable earnings forecasts may lead to firm or social gains. The final portion of the paper analyzes multiple sources of agency conflicts within the existing model of dynamic manager investment used initially to estimate the costs of earnings pressure. A corporate finance investment literature emphasizes that firms are riddled with agency frictions leading to a wedge between the interests of managers and firms as a whole (Stein, 2003). Two classic forms of agency conflict include unobservable shirking by managers (Edmans et al., 2009;Grossman and Hart, 1983) and empire building motivated by private manager benefits from size or investment (Nikolov and Whited, 2010;Jensen, 1986). When managers can provide low effort, I show that for strong enough shirking motives earnings targets within manager compensation contracts may improve value for firms as well as social welfare. The dynamic distortion to long-term investment, while costly, may be overwhelmed 16 US consumption was around $11,500 billion in 2013 according to the BEA as of March 2014, so a 0.44% increase in consumption is equivalent to a permanent increase in consumption of around $51 billion each year. The overall welfare gains decompose into 1.32% dynamic gains from growth rate changes and a static loss of -0.86% due to higher initial investment in R&D. 17 See Krusell et al. (2009) for the welfare consequences of business cycles, Costinot and Rodr\u00edguez-Clare (2015) or Melitz and Redding (2013) for the welfare gains from trade. Also, see Hassan and Mertens (2011) for the social cost of \"near-rationality\" in investment, around 2.4% in consumption-equivalent terms. 18 An interpretation of this sort is the norm for cost calculations in macroeconomics, with the most prominent example being the literature on the costs of business cycles (Lucas, 2003;Barlevy, 2004;Krusell et al., 2009). Gains from the elimination of business cycles may not be achievable if their elimination is costly. 19 See, for example, Midrigan and Xu (2014), Moll (Forthcoming), Buera and Shin (2013), Buera et al. (2011), or Campello et al. (2014. by the gains to levels obtained from increased discipline. In a second case, when firm agency conflicts are instead characterized by empire-building tendencies for managers, earnings targets may improve firm value by restraining R&D investments. If the social and private returns to R&D differ, however, restraint of R&D through earnings pressure can lead to an exacerbation of underinvestment from the social perspective and an increase in social losses from earnings targets. So, the model's implications depend crucially on assumptions about the exact form of agency conflicts within firms. Motivated by this consideration, I focus on qualitative results within my discussion of the benefits of earnings targets, demonstrating possibilities over a broad range of model parametrizations. Section 2 of the paper describes my data and lays out the empirical results linking earnings forecasts, long-term investment, and CEO incentives. Section 3 describes the quantitative model of earnings pressure and growth, together with my numerical solution and estimation strategy. Section 4 performs the main quantitative analysis estimating the costs of shorttermism for firms and the macroeconomy. Section 5 explores potential agency benefits from short-term pressure. Section 6 concludes. Appendixes follow describing the data (Appendix A), theory (Appendix B), and numerical solution method (Appendix C)."}, {"section_title": "Data and Empirical Discontinuities", "text": "This section empirically investigates the manipulation of long-term investment and incentives for executives surrounding earnings targets for firms. First, after joining analyst forecasts of earnings with the accounting releases of US public firms, my analysis reveals that firms just meeting earnings targets exhibit substantially lower long-term investment growth in R&D as well as broader intangibles. Similarly, CEOs and other executives at firms just failing to meet earnings targets receive discontinuously lower compensation. This paper draws on data from two main sources. First, I use millions of earnings forecasts at the firm-analyst level from the Institutional Brokers Estimates System (I/B/E/S) database. Actual or realized values of firm \"Street\" earnings per share accompany the analyst forecasts in I/B/E/S. 20 I also use Compustat data drawn from the annual accounting reports of public firms. Linking the I/B/E/S and Compustat datasets results in a panel of around 25,000 firmfiscal year observations with consensus analyst forecasts, Street realizations, and basic accounting outcomes. Around 4,000 firms from 1983-2010 are available in the combined unbalanced panel. The sample primarily consists of larger firms, accounting for around 11% of US employment, 67% of all US private R&D expenditures, and total sales of around 31% of US GDP. 21 See Data Appendix Table A.I for descriptive statistics on the sample. I also incorporate Execucomp data on CEO and executive compensation where possible, as well as Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) data on stock returns. Data Appendix A provides further information on the datasets, the sample restrictions imposed, and the construction of individual variables. If managers face incentives to meet earnings forecasts, then firms should avoid reporting profits just below analyst forecasts if possible, instead taking actions throughout their fiscal year to satisfy expectations. In this section I employ a flexible empirical tool, nonparametric regression discontinuity techniques, to identify exactly this type of earnings manipulation through changes in the distribution of long-term investment as firms just meet forecasts. By the first application of regression discontinuity estimators to my knowledge in this context, I contribute to a literature which treats similar results as prima facie evidence of earnings manipulation by firms. 22 Throughout the empirical analysis, my preferred measure of the forecast error for a particular firm j in year t is the realized value of Street earnings Street jt minus the median analyst forecast of firm earnings made from the middle of the same fiscal year Street f jt scaled by firm assets. This measure of earnings forecast errors is a standard one used in accounting studies (Burgstahler and Eames, 2006;Burgstahler and Chuk, 2013 22 See, for example, Roychowdhury (2006), Gunny (2010), Baber et al. (1991), or Burgstahler and Eames (2006). change in tangible investment rates for firms just meeting earnings targets. By contrast, two measures of long-term investment, R&D expenditures and broader \"Intangibles\" expenditures are both immediately expensed from earnings in the period incurred. 23 A growing empirical literature within economics and finance concludes that long-term investment expenditures contribute to long-term profitability for firms, to aggregate productivity over the business cycle, and to an improved explanation of stock returns in the cross section of firms. 24 The first three columns of Table I above report regression discontinuity estimates of the predicted difference in the tangible investment rate, overall intangible expenditures growth, and R&D growth for firms just meeting their earnings targets in a given year relative to firms failing to meet an earnings target. I compute results using outcomes demeaned by firm then year, controlling for both permanent trend heterogeneity across firms in long-term investments as well as business cycle effects. 25 I detect no discontinuity in tangible investment rates. By contrast, R&D growth and overall intangibles growth are both approximately 2.5% lower for firms just meeting an earnings target. The discontinuities are statistically significant and economically meaningful, each representing a cut of around 30% of average annual long-term investment growth. 26 Note that I make no direct causal claims from my regression discontinuity results of the form that is typically relied upon in applied microeconomics (Lee and Lemieux, 2010). By contrast, the apparent endogenous \"sorting\" of firms to the right of the zero forecast error cutpoint, which would typically be considered a threat to identification, lies at the very core of my argument for the economic impacts of earnings targets. In a later section, I build and estimate a quantitative model of R&D investment and earnings forecasts. The model demonstrates that reduced R&D growth around the zero forecast error threshold 23 Intangibles expenditures are equal to selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenditures. SG&A, a basic accounting item, enjoys extensive coverage within the Compustat database and include not only R&D expenses but also a range of other nonproduction expenses such as management labor compensation, training expenditures, and advertising costs. 24 See for example Papanikolaou (2013, 2014), Gourio and Rudanko (2014), McGrattan and Prescott (2014), Hall (2004), Corrado et al. (2009), Corrado et al. (2013), or Corrado et al. (2012). 25 Of course this implies that the results from Table I are based upon a two-stage procedure. Table I follows the literature by relying upon straightforward clustering at the firm level in the calculation of standard errors. For robustness, however, Table A.III in Data Appendix A reports the results with no qualitative changes from a block bootstrap procedure taking into account within-firm correlation as well as uncertainty associated with the first-stage demeaning of outcome variables. 26 For all the regression discontinuity tests in this section, see Table A.II in Data Appendix A for placebo checks. Data Appendix Figure A.I plots a range of robustness checks with bandwidth choice alternatives to the optimal Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2011) value used in Table I. Placebo checks reveal no significant breaks at alternative cutpoints away from 0, and bandwidth plots reveal robustness. should be expected in the presence of incentives for managers to meet earnings targets but would otherwise be absent. Such results structurally support the convenient use of regression discontinuity methodology as a detection mechanism in this context. Pressure to meet earnings targets can represent the product of explicit efforts of the distributed shareholders or boards of firms to provide discipline to CEOs and managers with interests divergent from their own. Therefore, discipline for managers may be evident in observed compensation for the CEO or for the several most highly paid executives in a firm. 27 Table I displays estimated discontinuities in pay. CEOs that generate earnings just below analyst forecasts earn approximately 7% less, while the top managers as a whole receive around 5% lower compensation. Discontinuous manager incentives in my sample link to a literature in corporate finance and accounting that documents either discontinuities in manager compensation at earnings benchmarks or interaction between investment responses to earnings targets and CEO equity incentives (Matsunaga and Park, 2001;Edmans et al., 2013). However, just as in the case of long-term investments, my results represent to my knowledge the first application of regression discontinuity methodology to the study of earnings target incentives. Finally, Table I also documents a discontinuity in abnormal returns. Firms just failing to meet targets have approximately 0.64% lower cumulative abnormal returns in a ten-day window to the earnings release date. This result corroborates literature on the information content within earnings releases as well as on a capital market premium to meeting or beating analyst expectations. 28 However, also note that horizon matters for the interaction between earnings targets and outcomes. Changes in long-term investments such as R&D expenditures over the course of the year naturally take time to implement. The results in this paper therefore reflect earnings forecasts made for the full fiscal year from the perspective of the middle of the year, i.e. from a two-quarter horizon. The single exception to this rule is the discontinuity in abnormal returns, which I document using a forecast horizon of one quarter. Following the related discussion of forecast horizons in Bhojraj et al. (2009), I feel that these timing choices strike the appropriate balance between allowing for R&D and investment choices to be implemented, on the one hand, and incorporating a fuller range of information available to capital market participants when examining return patterns on the other hand.  The household also makes a savings choice B t+1 in a one-period bond with interest rate R t+1 . As is standard, in general equilibrium household Euler equations will link growth rates and firm policies to this interest rate. Furthermore, on the balanced growth path which I will consider in this paper, interest rates will be fixed at a value R. The numeraire final good is produced by a competitive, constant returns to scale, and price-taking sector which combines intermediate goods X jt from each firm j, and demands labor in the amount L D t to produce output Y t in each period. The labor share is \u03b2, and the final goods technology is As will be discussed in more detail below, each intermediate goods firm at time t possesses both a quality level Q jt , together with an exogenous profitability shock a jt + \u03b5 jt . 29 Together, these quantities determine the marginal product of intermediate input X jt in final goods 29 The intermediate goods firm profitability shock is the sum of persistent a jt and transitory \u03b5 jt . 13 production. The final goods problem is The form of the final goods sector optimization problem above, which follows Acemoglu and Cao (Forthcoming), yields a standard isoelastic downward-sloping demand curve for variety j, given by  The transitory shock process \u03b5 jt buffets firm profitability in each period, while the AR 1process a jt persists. A number of recent papers apply a similar basic structure, decomposing  The isoelastic form of the final goods sector's demand for input j implies an optimal constant markup pricing rule for p jt over marginal cost \u03c8, 32 so that eventually variable profits take 30 Throughout the paper, I abstract from entry and exit with a fixed set of intermediate goods firms. This assumption is made more palatable by my structural estimation of the model with data from large public firms with lower exit hazards. However, I abstract from the Schumpeterian interactions between entry and innovation studied in endogenous growth models starting with Aghion and Howitt (1992). 31 Such papers for firm investments include Aguiar and Gopinath (2007), Franco and Philippon (2007), Roys (2011), and Gourio (2008), while Blundell et al. (2008) and many others consider household persistent and transitory shock decompositions in the presence of a consumption/savings choice. 32 For notational convenience, following Acemoglu and Cao (Forthcoming), I make the assumption that \u03c8 = 1 \u2212 \u03b2, leading to a monopoly price of p jt = 1\u2212\u03b2 1\u2212\u03b2 = 1. the following homogenous form in Q jt : Firm j's scaled R&D choice z jt leads to a total expenditure of z jt Q jt and results in an innovation with probability \u03a6(z jt ) = Az \u03b1 jt . The parameter \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) governs the elasticity of innovation arrival with respect to R&D. Innovations embody a proportional improvement up a quality ladder by amount \u03bb > 1, so that the level of long-term quality Q jt+1 for firm j . Eventually, if firm j lags and does not innovate for long enough, the firm will receive a diffusion of some small fraction \u03c9 of the average quality level Q t+1 of the economy as a whole. 33 Managers also make discretionary accounting choices which affect reported earnings. Empirically, paper manipulation by public firms can be accomplished through judicious use of tools such as heavy revenue accrual or recognition into earnings within a fiscal period. Through their accounting discretion, managers may also shift their reported Street earnings from a value which would be determined by strict application of GAAP principles to the more flexible value reported in the financial press. However, activities such as accruals manipulation bear costs for at least two reasons. First, by recognizing revenues now firms constrain their ability to count those revenues towards earnings in future. Second, more discretionary accounting manipulation involves more disruption of manager time, higher auditor expenses, or even higher probability of fraud detection and prosecution. 34 In the model, by choosing manipulation level m jt firm j can induce a net paper shift of its reported earnings by m jt Q jt subject to a quadratic cost \u03b3 m m 2 jt Q jt . Overall earnings \u03a0 Street jt reported in the model are defined as variable profits net of R&D expenditures and paper manipulation: 33 The diffusion structure follows Acemoglu and Cao (Forthcoming) and is useful to deliver existence of a stationary distribution of normalized firm-level quality levels Q jt on a balanced growth path for the economy. 34 See Dichev et al. (2013) for a survey-based discussion of the costs of earnings manipulation perceived by managers at large firms in the United States. See Bradshaw and Sloan (2002) for a further discussion of the distinction between Street and GAAP earnings in practice. See Zakolyukina 2013 2014revealing that large fractions of equity analysts incorporate recent earnings performance into the production of their earnings forecasts. 35 Further motivated by empirical evidence suggesting that analysts face career concerns and pressure to produce accurate forecasts of earnings, 36 in the model forecasts \u03c0 f jt (\u03c0 jt\u22121 ) minimize the following ex-ante expected quadratic loss function: Optimally forecasts in the model therefore satisfy \u03c0 f jt (\u03c0 jt\u22121 ) = E(\u03c0 jt |\u03c0 jt\u22121 ), and firm j is aware of its earnings forecast \u03c0 f jt when making R&D investment and paper manipulation choices in period t. The manager of firm j maximizes the expected discounted flow of their personal utility. 37 Their decisions solve Manager compensation depends on a constant, exogenous share \u03b8 d of ownership in their firm. Given manager choices for R&D, accounting manipulation, and pricing, firm dividends in period t equal variable profits minus R&D expenditures and resource costs of paper manipulation: Manager flow utility, linear in consumption and other payoffs, is given by The first term in D M jt simply represents the manager's dividend share. The second term contains the impact of firm earnings forecasts on the manager objective and hence firm policies. A manager who fails to deliver earnings which meet or beat analyst expectations suffers a fixed loss governed by the parameter \u03be \u2265 0. In particular, however, when \u03be = 0 the manager problem results in firm profit maximization. Although in Section 5 I will explicitly examine the potential for other agency frictions such as a manager taste for shirking or empire-building, note that these channels are shut down in my initial framework. The discontinuous, fixed nature of the miss cost is a natural choice given the kinked forecast error distribution in Figure 1 as well as the evidence for discontinuous manager incentives from Section 2. In principle, earnings miss costs can represent three separate sources of loss for managers The first potential component of miss costs for managers, \u03be manager , is purely private and could include career or reputational concerns for managers. Surveyed managers report that such reputational concerns loom large (Dichev et al., 2013). Alternatively, managers may suffer increased effort costs due to higher rates of more negatively focused communications with outsiders upon an earnings miss (Yermack and Li, 2014). 38 The second potential component of miss costs, \u03be f irm , reflects any resource, disruption, or other costs borne by firms rather than directly by managers for failure to meet analyst expectations. Such firm-borne costs still affect managers through their ownership shares \u03b8 d . Surveyed managers report that efforts to avoiding earnings misses are important to maintain a low cost of external finance, to avoid triggering debt covenants, and even to avoid higher likelihood of lawsuits from shareholders (Graham et al., 2005). The third and final component of miss costs, \u03be pay , represents the potential for a firm to explicitly condition manager compensation on meeting earnings targets.

Empirically, managers failing to meet earnings benchmarks suffer reduced bonuses (Matsunaga and Park, 2001), and the empirical evidence from Section 2 suggests that total compensation is discontinuously lower for managers just failing to meet analyst forecasts.

When making quantitative statements about the overall cost of earnings targets in Section 4, I conservatively assume that the entirety of the term \u03be represents personal costs \u03be manager .

An economy-wide resource constraint, labor market clearing, asset market clearing, and aggregation consistency conditions complete the characterization of general equilibrium for the model. I use numerical techniques to solve the model. Given homogeneity of manager returns in long-term quality, I first normalize their dynamic problem by the average quality level in the economy Q t . This normalization yields a stationary recursive formulation reported in Theory Appendix B as a function of four state variables: q (normalized endogenous longterm quality), a (exogenous persistent profitability), \u03b5 (exogenous transitory profitability), and \u03c0 f (endogenous analyst forecasts of earnings).

For the most part I follow a structural estimation strategy based on GMM using firm-level moments from my joint sample of Compustat and I/B/E/S data. However, before estimating the model I externally calibrate some of the parameters involving common quantities from the macroeconomics or innovation literature. Table II reports the values of these parameters. The model period is one year. Together, an intertemporal elasticity of substitution of 0.5 or \u03c3 = 2, a subjective discount rate of \u03c1 = 1/1.02 \u2248 0.98, and a targeted growth rate 39 Table C.III in the Numerical Appendix C records forecast accuracy or robustness statistics to alternative forecast systems with higher order approximations in \u03c0 \u22121 above the baseline implementation (a linear rule), as well as to different information sets including forecast errors and R&D expenditures. In all cases, the higher-order approximations and extended information sets yield little quantitative gain in forecast accuracy.  My GMM approach requires selection of informative moments to use for identification of the remaining six parameters of the model, including the persistence and volatilities of profitability shocks (parameters \u03c1 a , \u03c3 a , and \u03c3 \u03b5 ), as well as the magnitude of manager miss costs associated with earnings targets \u03be, the productivity level for innovation A, and the costs of paper accounting manipulation \u03b3 m . Table III lists the seven selected moments together with their values in the data and model. 41 At the macroeconomic level I target the aggregate growth rate, while the covariance matrix between sales growth, R&D growth, and forecast errors provides a useful corresponding set of microeconomic moments. First, I lay out the structure of the GMM estimation algorithm for the vector of parameters \u03b8 = (\u03c1 a , \u03c3 a , \u03c3 \u03b5 , A, \u03b3 m , \u03be) , with further details available in the Data Appendix A. After choosing a weighting matrix W , I estimate\u03b8 through numerical minimization of the objective\u03b8 = arg min where m(X) and m(\u03b8) are the vector of moments from the data X and model with parameters \u03b8, respectively. xjt+xjt\u22121 . 42 The numerical minimization is carried out using a standard global stochastic numerical optimization routine called particle swarm optimization which is simple, robust, and broadly comparable to other global stochastic optimization routines such as simulated annealing. 43 See for example, the derivations and formulas in Gourieroux and Monfort (1997), but note that the stationary distribution of model state variables is directly computable and doesn't require simulation. Therefore, my approach can be classified as GMM and avoids the need for the variance inflation factor of SMM With seven moments and six parameters, the estimation algorithm is overidentified GMM. The mapping between moments and estimated parameters in the model is joint and not oneto-one. However, certain moments are particularly influential for the identification of a given parameter. In the absence of a proof of identification, I conduct a formal investigation of this mapping by computing Gentzkow and Shapiro (2014)  I also broadly discuss the estimation mapping here, giving economic intuition. First, the estimate of the innovation productivity parameter A in the model depends heavily upon the data's aggregate growth rate, because higher innovation arrival rates in the model imply higher growth. Identification of the remaining parameters typically places significant weight on the covariance matrix of R&D growth, sales growth, and forecast errors. Forward-looking R&D investments feed into realized forecast errors, and this link implies that the structural estimates of persistent profitability volatility \u03c3 a load particularly upon R&D growth as well as forecast error volatility moments. By contrast, the estimated level of transitory profitability volatility, \u03c3 \u03b5 , depends relatively more upon overall sales growth volatility in the data. Estimation of the persistence \u03c1 a of profitability shocks again links to the behavior of forward looking R&D, placing weight both upon each of the volatility moments in the data but also crucially on the correlation or covariance between sales and R&D growth. Since easier paper manipulation in the model can obscure the passthrough of sales growth to earnings, the cost parameter \u03b3 m for paper manipulation is determined in large part by the observed correlation between sales growth and forecast errors. Finally, we will see below that the primary model manifestation of earnings pressure from miss costs \u03be is higher R&D volatility, as firms sometimes react to profitability shocks by cutting R&D to boost earnings above targets. Naturally, therefore the estimated level of \u03be depends crucially upon both R&D growth volatility in the data as well as the correlation between forecast errors and R&D growth.  Note: The parameter estimates above are computed from an unbalanced panel of income statement and earnings forecast data, with 4,839 firms and 32,597 firm-years from 1982-2010 in the US, together with data on the US per capita real GDP growth rate. The estimation procedure is standard overidentified GMM, with a moment covariance matrix reflecting time series correlation of the aggregate growth rate using a stationary bootstrap and arbitrary time series correlations within firm-level clusters for all microeconomic moments. Optimization was performed using particle swarm optimization, a stochastic global minimization routine. The weighting matrix is chosen so that the GMM objective equals the sum of squared percentage deviations, with 10 times extra weight placed on the aggregate moment. Asymptotics are computed in the number of firms while assuming independence between aggregate and microeconomic moments in the data. parameters are quite precisely estimated. Comfortingly, the persistence and volatility estimates are comparable to the structural estimates of the parameters of firm-level productivity or profitability processes found in both Gourio and Rudanko (2014) as well as Hennessy and Whited (2007), which are also based on dynamic firm-level problems and Compustat data. Naturally, however, I estimate higher persistence in the profitability shock a jt than found in those studies because I also allow for purely transitory variation \u03b5 jt . The accounting manipulation and R&D productivity parameters \u03b3 m and A are in model units difficult to map directly to observable quantities. However, I can naturally examine the plausibility of the estimated costs\u03be by expressing them in terms of observables. In the baseline model, managers are indifferent between missing an earnings targets and a loss of around 3.6% of firm revenues on average, with the miss cost statistically distinguishable from zero at the 5% level. Benchmarks for direct comparison with the 3.6% figure are scarce. Given the overidentified and highly nonlinear structure of the model, I can not in general expect an exact match between model and data moments. However, Table III demonstrates that the Baseline model with incentives to meet earnings forecasts leads to a broadly successful fit to the data moments. 45 In particular, the Baseline delivers an aggregate growth rate around the 2% level seen in the data, together with substantial variation in sales growth rates as in the data. Note that the Baseline model delivers somewhat less volatile forecast errors than observed in the data, but higher volatility than a model without earnings pressure (moments also reported in Table III). Furthermore, in both the Baseline and the data, forecast errors negatively covary very slightly with R&D growth. In other words, the presence of earnings targets implies that cuts to R&D growth can be driven in the model by a desire to meet or beat earnings forecasts and therefore be correlated with higher forecast errors. By contrast, the model without earnings targets, in which R&D innovations are exclusively motivated by persistent profitability innovations, naturally produces a positive correlation of forecast errors with R&D growth. Furthermore, the presence of earnings targets in the Baseline causes dependence of R&D policies on transitory shocks to profitability, increasing the volatility of R&D growth substantially, while a model without a motive to meet earnings forecasts underpredicts the R&D volatility seen in the data by a large margin. Finally, the paper obfuscation in a model with earnings targets leads to lower correlation between sales growth and forecast errors, closer in line with the data, while a model without earnings targets overpredicts this correlation by a large amount.

An imperfectly informed market expects manipulation and therefore updates its inferences about firms with poor earnings reports particularly harshly. Anecdotally, this intuition is consistent the survey of large US firm managers in Graham et al.

These differences are quantitatively larger than they may at first appear, since growth changes lead to compounded differences across economies far into the future. The driving force behind diminished growth in my economy with earnings targets is curvature in the model link \u03a6(z) between R&D expenditures and innovation. Given concavity or diminishing returns to R&D in \u03a6(z), randomly more volatile R&D causes fewer innovation arrivals on average, even ignoring level changes in R&D expenditures. 51 A negative relationship between volatility and growth, crucial to the quantitative results here, is familiar from the macroeconomics literature. For example, Barlevy (2004) describes the manner in which at the aggregate level, higher volatility of tangible investment caused by business cycles can increase the theoretical cost of business cycles by reducing the aggregate growth rate. The same mechanism appears at the microeconomic level in my Baseline model. Since macroeconomists routinely infer much higher volatility or variation in profitability at the disaggregated level than on aggregate (Bloom et al., 2012), my firm-level link between profit shocks and R&D naturally provides a potent source of changes in the innovative efficiency of the economy as a whole. To gain a better sense of the quantitative magnitude of the distortion to aggregate growth rates, I also engage in an accounting exercise for aggregate welfare. The second column of Table V displays  Overall, consumption equivalent gains on the order of 0.44% are large. For perspective, recent quantitative estimates of the welfare costs of business cycles range from 0.1-1.8% (Krusell et al., 2009), and measures of the static gains from trade range from 2.0-2.5% (Costinot and Rodr\u00edguez-Clare, 2015;Melitz and Redding, 2013). I conclude from the sizable changes in growth and welfare in my model that the dynamic distortion to R&D investment induced at firms by the presence of earnings targets matters for the macroeconomy. A final quantitative perspective in Table V on earnings target costs comes from the firm level. In the Baseline economy, the change in average firm value which would result in partial equilibrium from the removal of pressure to meet earnings forecasts is around 1%. 54 For perspective on the size of this firm-level distortion we can turn to work in structural dynamic corporate finance that quantifies the loss in shareholder value from CEO turnover frictions at around 3% (Taylor, 2010), or from manager agency frictions affecting cash holding at around 6% (Nikolov and Whited, 2013). Distortions to manager R&D policies and the resulting losses in firm value, growth rates, and welfare laid out above represent the costs of pressure to meeting earnings targets. However, earnings targets may provide a range of benefits as well. In principle the benefits could be external to the firm, functioning for example through more precise valuations of companies on the equity market and more socially efficient allocations of capital across firms. Or, 52 Recall that to remain conservative I assume that the entirety of the term \u03be in the manager payoff is apportioned to personal costs for the manager, implying that these costs should be rebated back to the household in aggregate consumption. If the effect of the miss costs is included as entirely due to firm resource costs or disruptions \u03be miss , overall household gains are 0.48% instead. 53 The change in growth rates due to the removal of earnings targets is around 0.1% in the version of the model with calibrated target measurement error for firms, with a total change in aggregate welfare of 1.39%. The increase in the effects of targets is due to the increased mass of managers who perceive a possibility of missing an earnings target, given the addition of uncertainty surrounding the target itself. Overall, the dynamic distortion to long-term investment in strengthened, and the Baseline results in the main text should therefore be considered conservative. 54 This 1% figure is derived from computing average firm value from optimal policies in an environment with \u03be = 0, or no manager cost from missing earnings targets, with the aggregate growth rates, interest rates, and forecasting in the Baseline economy held fixed. The average is taken with respect to the equilibrium stationary distribution of state variables \u00b5 in the Baseline model. For conservatism I assume such costs are private to the manager. If disruption costs are borne as resource costs to the firm, the change in firm value is 1.3%. by contrast, earnings pressure could yield benefits for firms themselves if agency considerations drive a wedge between the interests of managers and firm owners which is alleviated by earnings discipline. Consideration of such benefits from earnings targets seems important for two reasons. First, and crucially, the gains from removal of earnings pressure embodied in the No Targets counterfactual considered so far could fail to materialize in practice if policymakers were to take action preventing earnings targets and simultaneously extinguish the benefits from earnings pressure. Second, a significant portion of earnings targets could represent explicit or implicit compensation contracts with some portion of overall pay for managers dependent upon meetings earnings forecasts. In this case, a countervailing benefit from earnings targets for firms might in principle provide a microfoundation for the existence of pressure on managers to meet short-term benchmarks, even if such benchmarks lead to a loss in investment efficiency. In the next section, I build off of the baseline model structure and include two sources of agency frictions in the firm-manager relationship."}, {"section_title": "Agency Benefits from Short-Term Pressure", "text": "Empirically, Section 2 demonstrates that CEOs and other executives at large US public firms which just fail to meet an earnings target or forecast receive lower total compensation on average. These results open up a suggestive possibility: pressure to meet earnings forecasts or targets may arise from the efforts of the boards or distributed shareholders of firms to exert discipline on managers. In this section, I consider two forms of agency frictions which may serve to both microfound and to provide countervailing benefits from the distortions to long-term investment induced by earnings targets."}, {"section_title": "Manager Shirking and Effort Provision", "text": "I first consider the possibility of shirking by managers. In particular, firm owners may be unable to observe whether managers continually exert effort, and compensation contracts can serve as a tool to mitigate the possibility of low effort provision (Grossman and Hart, 1983;Edmans et al., 2009;Beyer et al., 2014). In this framework, managers can in each period choose either to shirk (s jt = 1) or to exert normal effort (s jt = 0). If managers shirk, then they receive some private benefit governed by the parameter \u03bb s \u2265 0. Shirking comes at the cost of firm variable profits, with a proportional disruption to firm quality equal to some fraction \u03b3 s \u2208 (0, 1). The remainder of the economic environment is similar to before, where managers now solve Manager payoffs are given by D M jt where Manager flow returns reflect two components. First, D M jt includes an exogenous compensation contract with a fixed dividend share \u03b8 d \u2208 (0, 1) and clawback by the firm of jt )Q jt conditional upon missing an earnings target. 55 Endogenization of such a contract is beyond the scope of the paper, but I will demonstrate in a quantitative exploration of the extended framework that earnings-target conditional compensation can be value-improving for firms on average. The second component of manager flow returns is a private benefit \u03bb s s jt Q jt accruing to the manager when shirking. In practice shirking might represent increased leisure at the firm's expense or some sort of resource diversion towards managers. The countervailing costs of shirking for the firm enter the expression for dividends, written here net of manager clawback compensation: At this point it is worth exploring the tradeoffs involved for managers considering shirking. In the absence of earnings targets managers weigh a private gain from low effort equal to \u03bb s Q jt versus a firm-wide loss diluted through their equity share of \u03b8 d \u03a0 vjt \u03b3 s . However, by conditioning compensation on meeting a publicly available earnings forecast, the owners of the firm can augment the immediate costs of shirking by the net amount (1 \u2212 \u03b8 d )\u03be pay I(\u03a0 Street jt < \u03a0 f jt )Q jt . For those firm-years in which shirking would lead to an earnings miss, i.e. in which earnings prospects are near earnings targets ex-ante, the prospect of lost compensation can induce effort provision by managers. Therefore, in an environment with manager shirking, the owners of firms face a fundamental tradeoff between the dynamic distortion to long-term R&D investments from earnings pressure and the level gains which may accrue to the firm from disciplining managers. I more rigorously investigate the tradeoffs involved through the following experiment. First, I fix \u03be pay so that managers perceive a cost to missing equivalent in magnitude to the estimated miss costs\u03be from the structural estimation exercise above. Then, I vary the strength of the private motive for shirking \u03bb s . represents the ratio between the private returns perceived by managers and the average loss from shirking for a given value of \u03bb s , both normalized by firm quality q. 56 As the shirking motive grows, managers unsurprisingly shirk more on average. However, there is a humpshaped pattern to the increase in shirking seen if earnings discipline were to be removed. For very low levels of shirking motive, managers already provide effort almost always, so the presence of pressure only prevents a small increase in shirking. By contrast, for intermediate levels of private value to shirking, managers are close to indifferent between shirking or not, and the presence of earnings pressure can shift a relatively larger portion of managers to provide effort. Finally, if managers have very high private returns to shirking, the lost compensation for managers upon an earnings miss does not dissuade shirking much at all. The hump-shaped pattern to the prevention of shirking feeds into counterfactual changes in firm value and social welfare: for intermediate levels of private shirking benefits, firm value would decrease on average if a firm removed miss costs for managers even though a dynamic investment distortion remains. The reduction in quality levels and hence production induced by shirking if earnings pressure were to be removed also leads to a static loss for the aggregate household, which crucially implies that the presence of earnings targets can be welfare-enhancing if they prevent a substantial amount of costly shirking by managers. The patterns in Figure VI suggest that discontinuous and short-term incentives for managers may play a useful disciplinary role. Firms as well as the economy as a whole can benefit from imposing earnings miss costs if managers subsequently shirk less overall, even while targets distort the R&D decisions of firms. A disciplinary role may therefore provide a rationale for the existence of earnings targets within firms, since the use of a readily observable performance benchmark can improve firm value on average. Importantly, however, the next section considers an alternative agency justification for earnings targets and demonstrates that the exact nature of the conflict between managers and firms matters for the relationship between the firm and social implications of earnings benchmarks."}, {"section_title": "Manager Empire Building", "text": "If managers obtain some private benefit from the size or scale of the firm under their control, then overinvestment or empire building may occur. This type of empire building mechanism plays a role in a range of recent quantitative corporate finance studies (Nikolov and Whited, 2010;Glover and Levine, 2014) and conceptually dates to early work in Jensen (1986). If the owners of a firm do not perfectly observe the ex-ante expected profitability of R&D investments, then such overinvestment may be difficult to curtail in practice. However, earnings targets provide a convenient and readily observable benchmark against which manager decisions may be measured. This subsection analyzes a structure in which manager decisions are influenced by empire building and solve By contrast with the previous subsection, managers are not motivated by a shirking possibility but instead face personal returns given by Again, there remains a fixed equity share \u03b8 d \u2208 (0, 1) of firm dividends, as well as the potential for compensation contracts to impose an earnings miss cost on managers through \u03be pay > 0. However, the final term \u03bb e Q jt indexes the strength of the empire-building motive for managers, where higher values of \u03bb e give managers a more potent intrinsic taste for firm scale as determined by long-term quality Q jt . Here, dividends are standard and can be written net of manager clawback compensation as Exactly as in the analysis of manager shirking behavior above, I broadly explore the potential impact of earnings targets in the presence of empire building by first fixing \u03be pay to duplicate the magnitude of the earnings miss costs\u03be. Subsequently varying the strength \u03bb e of the empire motive yields the four panels of results in Figure VII, each of which plots against a horizontal axis equal to the ratio between the manager's private return to size and their average return to variable profits, both normalized by firm quality q. The top left panel plots the average R&D to sales ratio for the economy with earnings targets. As the private return to empire building grows, the R&D to sales ratio unsurprisingly increases. The top right panel plots the increase in the R&D to sales ratio which would be observed in an economy with target removal, i.e. with \u03be pay set to 0. As overinvestment from a firm's perspective becomes more severe, the scope for earnings targets to provide discipline on managers grows as well. Recall that by imposing miss costs through manager compensation, firms induce a distortion to R&D investment through excess sensitivity to short-term or transitory profitability shocks. For relatively low empire motives, the bottom left panel reveals that firms would in fact gain overall in partial equilibrium from the removal of targets, since they would remove the inefficiency associated with induced short-termism. However, for higher empire building pressures at firms the tradeoff shifts in favor of targets, and firms would lose value on average from their removal because of the resulting overinvestment by managers. The bottom right panel of Figure VII reveals that for the parametrizations considered here the aggregate household always experiences higher welfare if targets are removed. Intermediate goods firms realize profits and producer surplus from sales to a final goods sector, but managers ignore the consumer surplus accruing to the final goods sector and eventually to the aggregate household. In general this \"surplus appropriability problem,\" as coined by Jones and Williams (2000), causes firms to undervalue innovation and R&D relative to their social value, leading to inefficiently low growth rates. 57 Therefore, as shown in Figure  and social returns to R&D depends on a markup structure which, while computationally convenient, links to the inverse capital share. Also, other potentially important factors such as the interplay between firm valuations, financial frictions, and earnings forecasts are omitted from the current structure. Therefore, I view a precise quantification of the benefits to firms or society from earnings targets as beyond the scope of the paper, preferring to instead outline that such benefits do exist."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Empirically, earnings realizations bunch directly above analyst forecasts. Firms that just meet or beat analyst targets of earnings display discontinuously lower long-term investment growth, while CEOs and other executives just failing to meet benchmarks face lower compensation. Together, these results suggest a pervasive tradeoff in the data between the short-term prospects of firms versus their long-term investments. This paper builds and structurally estimates a quantitative endogenous growth model with R&D investment by managers subject to idiosyncratic profitability shocks and incentives to meet or beat earnings targets. Discontinuities in earnings forecast error distributions and R&D growth naturally arise, and a counterfactual exercise comparing the baseline model to an economy without earnings pressure on firms reveals that managers choose lower and more volatile R&D when short-term targets are incentivized. Such short-termism, manifested in sensitivity of R&D to purely transitory variation in profitability, leads to quantitatively significant costs for firm value, aggregate growth rates, and household welfare. The estimation of such costs is the primary quantitative contribution of the paper. Although short-termism distorts long-term investments and imposes costs on firms and the broader economy, the presence of discipline may provide benefits if managers are motivated by agency considerations such as a desire to shirk or to empire build. These benefits might help to motivate the existence of short-term incentives for managers. In particular, for some parametrizations of my model, a compensation contract which conditions manager pay upon meeting observable earnings forecasts leads to higher firm value on average. The final impact on social welfare can still be detrimental however, validating classic concern with short-termism.

Numerical comparative statics have been smoothed using a polynomial approximation. I/B/E/S makes available forecasts for earnings per share as well as realized \"Street\" earnings per share on two reporting bases: \"adjusted,\" in which the entire time series for a security is continuously adjusted for both stock splits and primary/dilution factors, as well as \"unadjusted,\" in which the originally reported forecasts and actuals are stored. Information is also available as \"summary\" or \"detail\" data, with summary files containing consensus forecasts for a firm as well as reported actuals, rounded to 2 digits (i.e. cents of earnings per share) and detail files containing the history of analyst forecast rounded to 4 digits. As Payne and Thomas (2003) note, the joint presence of stock splits and rounding in the adjusted summary files can lead to a severe loss of information as some earnings hits or misses are misclassified as zeros due to the ex-post adjustments made by I/B/E/S. Because accurate classification of earnings hits or misses is crucial to my research agenda, I base my analysis on the unadjusted detail files. However, this requires that all analyst forecasts from the unadjusted files be readjusted to the reporting basis as of the earnings announcement date, since reporting conventions for some securities may change in between a given analyst forecast and the earnings announcement. To readjust analyst forecasts to the same basis as announced unadjusted actuals requires the following process: 1.

Therefore, I must make a choice of horizon at which to compute earnings forecasts. In the baseline analysis, I consider forecasts made from a two-quarter horizon, i.e. from 91 to 180 days before the data release. Given a horizon, I construct, for a given firm and fiscal year combination (ticker and pends in I/B/E/S), a dataset with realized Street actuals as well as median analyst forecasts of earnings per share within that horizon window More precisely, my forecast for a particular firm-fiscal year of earnings per share with horizon window"}, {"section_title": "A.3 Linking Compustat and I/B/E/S", "text": "Linking the Compustat and I/B/E/S data requires all observations from the underlying Compustat data, which are uniquely identified by a combination of permanent security identifier gvkey and datadate, with I/B/E/S observations of realized EPS and forecast EPS, which are uniquely identified by the permanent ticker ticker and forecast period end date variables pends and fpedats.

Note that in the discontinuity detection exercises, I wish to focus on behavior near the earnings forecast targets and to remove the influence of observations with an unusually high number of analyst forecast records (and potentially dramatic changes in firm news between forecast generation and earnings releases). Therefore, before estimating the regression discontinuities reported in the main text I further restrict the sample to remove observations with forecast errors greater than than 1% of firm assets in absolute value or with higher than the 99.5 percentile of forecast frequency in the aggregation period. Table A.I reports descriptive statistics on the resulting sample for estimation of the investment regression discontinuities in Section 2 of the paper.

Then, I also deflate sales, SG&A, and research and development expenditures xrd by the value of the GDP deflator current as of December 2013. 58 Given real vales for a series x t , I compute percentage growth rates as This measure of growth rates as the difference relative to the average follows Davis and Haltiwanger (1992) and has the advantage of being bounded within [\u22122, 2]. Selection out of R&D with zero spending for a particular year results in a bounded rather than missing growth value. Following the construction of growth rates and real series from Compustat data, I use the linking process described above to I/B/E/S to obtain a dataset with merged accounting (from Compustat) and earnings forecast (from I/B/E/S) data. After the link, unscaled values of Street earnings (Street jt ) and forecasts (Street f t ) can be computed by multiplying either the primary or diluted share count as of the fiscal year end date from Compustat (cshpri or cshfd, respectively, with choice determined by I/B/E/S dilution flag pdi) by the unadjusted earnings per share actual value (EPS unadj jt ) or forecast value (EPS f jt ) from I/B/E/S. Once unscaled forecasts and actual Street earnings values exist, forecast error is defined as actual Street earnings minus forecast earnings:  1983-2010 1983-2010 1983-2010 1992-2010 1992-2010 1983- Note: *,**,*** denote 10, 5, 1% significance. The results reflect a block bootstrap procedure. Draws of data blocks were sampled with replacement from the distribution of firms, taking into account within-firm correlation as well as uncertainty surrounding variable demeaning by firm and year and the estimation of the regression discontinuity itself. The point estimates are the mean, and the standard errors are the standard deviation, over 250 bootstrap replications. The regression discontinuity estimation relies on local linear regressions and a triangular kernel, with bandwidth chosen via the optimal Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2011) approach. The estimates represent the mean predicted differences for firms just meeting earnings forecasts relative to firms just failing to meet forecasts. Earnings forecast errors are Street earnings minus median analyst forecasts from a 2-quarter horizon, scaled by firm assets as a percentage. Investment Rate is the percentage tangible annual investment rate. Intangibles growth is annual percent selling, general, and administrative expenditures growth. R&D growth is annual percent research and development expenditure growth. CEO Pay, Executive Pay are the log of total compensation for the CEO and several most highly compensated executives at a firm, respectively. Abnormal Returns are the cumulative abnormal returns for a firm in a ten-day window to the announcement date, market adjusting using the returns of the S&P 500. For returns analyst forecasts are drawn from a 1-quarter horizon. a Executive pay and stock returns are already in normalized form, and these values duplicate discontinuity estimates. Note: The moments sample is as described in the text above, with 32,597 firm-fiscal year observations in an unbalanced panel with Davis and Haltiwanger (1992)  For correspondence with model moments, I compute percentage forecast errors defined asf This measure of forecast error relative to the average absolute value of actual and forecasted Street earnings has several advantages. First,f e jt is bounded in [\u22122, 2] and can flexibly accommodate zeros in forecast or actual earnings series together with differences in sign. I construct estimation moments from data which includes the following series: sales growth, R&D growth, and percentage forecast errors. To avoid the influence of outliers, I further remove observations more extreme than the 0.5% or 99.5% quantiles for accounting series and observations exactly equal to \u22122 or 2 for percentage forecast error. As noted in the main text, I consider a total of six micro moments for estimation. The values of the moment covariance matrix, in raw form as utilized in the GMM estimation procedure itself, are reported in Table A.IV. I now turn to the details of the overidentified GMM structural estimation of\u03b8 in the baseline model based on the vector of moments m(X). Recall that the aggregate growth rate is used as a targeted moment in the estimation, together with the micro-level covariance matrix of sales growth, R&D growth, and forecast errors. The growth rate is the average annual growth rate of US per capita GDP from 1961-2010, FRED series USARGDPC. Under an assumption of independence between micro and macro data samples, the covariance matrix of the joint set of moments m(X) is computed in a two-stage process. First, I compute the variance of the aggregate growth rate g,\u03c3 2 g , taking into account arbitrary stationary time series correlation in my sample of length T using the stationary bootstrap of Politis and Romano (1994). Second, note that the vector of micro moments can be written as a smooth function of unscaled first and second moments, say\u03bc, of sales growth, R&D growth, and forecast errors, so that the estimated covariance matrix of the micro moments,V , is immediately implied by an estimate of the covariance matrix of the raw moments, \u2126, and the Delta method. I compute\u03a9 with asymptotics in the number of firms N allowing for arbitrary clustering within firms. If each firm j has T j observations in the sample and the average number of , then in particular where x jt is the stacked vector of levels and cross-products of R&D growth, sales growth, and forecast errors for firm j in period t. Under an assumption that\u03b3 = T N \u2192 \u03b3 asymptotically as N \u2192 \u221e, which adjusts for relative sample sizes, together with the assumption of independence between the micro and macro samples, I can write the joint asymptotic covariance matrix of the vector m(X) of the aggregate growth rate and micro moments together as Given the asymptotic distribution of the moments used in the estimation of the underlying structural parameters \u03b8, the definition of\u03b8 as the minimizer of the GMM objective function and standard GMM arguments yield the result that where the covariance matrix of the estimated parameters is given by Here, the weighting matrix W is chosen so that the GMM objective is equal to the sum of the squared percentage deviations of model from data moments, with one modification. The aggregate growth rate, of crucial importance economically given my endogenous growth framework, is assigned 10 times more weight than the micro moments. Estimates of\u03b8 are computed using particle swarm optimization, a robust and standard global stochastic optimization routine. Given\u03b8 and W in hand, an estimate of the Jacobian \u2202m(\u03b8) \u2202\u03b8 of model moments with respect to parameters is computed using straightforward numerical differentiation averaging over relative step sizes of 0.75%, 1%, and 1.25%. second period of life in period t each manager j \u2208 [0, 1] born in period t \u2212 1 must make R&D investment, paper manipulation, monopoly pricing, and managerial franchise pricing offer choices z jt , m jt , p jt , and \u03c7 M jt .

The manager seeks to maximize their period t utility, i.e. they solve the problem max . From the perspective of the manager, perceived miss costs are a combination \u03be = \u03be manager + \u03b8 d \u03be f irm + (1 \u2212 \u03b8 d )\u03be pay , and dividends net of manager clawback compensation and firm-borne miss costs are"}, {"section_title": "Intermediate Goods Firm Values", "text": "Given exogenous persistent and transitory profitability shocks a jt , \u03b5 jt , long-term quality level Q jt , and analyst forecasts \u03a0 f jt , as well as manager-determined intermediate goods firm R&D investments z jt , monopoly prices p jt , shirking decisions s jt , and accounting manipulation choices m jt , the value of intermediate goods firms j at time t is given by the present-discounted value of firm dividends"}, {"section_title": "Analyst Sector Optimizes", "text": "Taking as given normalized Street earnings last period Q jt\u22121 , an outside analyst sector forecasts normalized Street earnings \u03c0 jt today, where the forecast earnings levels jt must minimize analyst loss as follows Labor and Asset Markets Clear Government Budget Balances Managers Consume Their Endowments Resource Constraint and Aggregation Conditions are Satisfied"}, {"section_title": "B.2 Normalization and Recursive Firm Problem", "text": "Consider a stationary balanced growth bath equilibrium where average quality in the economy Q t = Q jt dj grows at a constant rate g and there exists an invariant distribution \u00b5(a jt , \u03b5 jt , q jt , \u03c0 f jt ) of intermediate goods firm manager state variables with q jt = Q jt Qt and \u03c0 f jt defined above. Then, immediately, all of the aggregates in the economy grow at the rate g as well, since Therefore, the household intertemporal Euler equation for savings in one-period bonds yields the standard result of a constant interest rate R t+1 = 1 \u03c1 (1 + g) \u03c3 = R. Note, as will be shown below, that manager value maximization solves max The above trivially omits the monopoly pricing decision p jt = 1 from the firm problem. Also, if \u03c3 \u2265 1 then 1+g R = \u03c1(1 + g) 1\u2212\u03c3 \u2264 \u03c1 < 1. D M jt , the manager flow return written in full in the equilibrium above, is homogenous in Q jt and hence stationary since Qt is stationary. Therefore, the intermediate goods firm manager's objective exists in stationary, normalized form. Manager policies can be obtained as the result of maximization of manager flow returns discounted by the market interest rate, the objective written and analyzed above. To justify this, first note that manager j born in time t\u22121 will accept the offer of a managerial franchise (i.e. set r jt\u22121 = 0) for the following period t at price \u03c7 M jt\u22121 if and only if Via backward induction, since \u03c7 M jt\u22121 is a take-it-or-leave it price from the previous manager and since the previous manager's utility is strictly increasing in \u03c7 M jt , it must always be the case that market clearing for managerial franchises pins down the price \u03c7 M jt\u22121 : Repeated forward substitution into the expression for manager consumption in period t therefore implies that in period t the manager born in t\u22121 maximizes the present discounted stream of manager utilities from period t onwards, exactly the objective stated in the text. Note that because they are exogenous to the manager's linear payoffs, the manager consumption endowmentsC M Q t and transfers T M t do not impact manager policies or intermediate goods firm values. However, both terms are useful technically. A high enough value ofC M ensures that potentially negative dividends and clawbacks \u03be pay do not result in negative manager consumption levels. Meanwhile an appropriate and maintained choice of Q jt dj ensures that manager consumption on aggregate is equal to exogenous endowment levelsC M Q t exactly. Hence, household consumption can be backed out via the resource constraint, i.e. which is the expression used to argue for R t = R above. Also, trivially note that the analyst problem yields \u03c0 f jt = E \u00b5 (\u03c0 jt |\u03c0 jt\u22121 ) given the mean squared error loss function for analysts. Omitting t and j subscripts for clarity, using to denote future periods, and writing the manager problem recursively yields The stationary, recursive, normalized intermediate goods firm manager problem above features discounting at rate (1 + g)/R rather than 1/R, and sees \"depreciation\" of normalized relative long-term quality levels q by the rate g each period. The manager problem also allows for the influence of corporate taxes, through the \u03c4 c marginal rate, on firm decisions. 60 In this form, the problem can be solved using standard numerical dynamic programming techniques, as discussed in the Numerical Appendix C below. Also, once optimal policies are obtained, a similar recursive structure obtains for intermediate goods firm values themselves through direct substitution of manager optimal policies. Now I explicitly define the notion of stationarity which must be satisfied by the distribution of normalized state variables \u00b5(a, \u03b5, q, \u03c0 f ). The distribution must be invariant to forward iteration on both the exogenous driving profitability processes a and \u03b5 as well as the endogenous forecast and long-term quality transitions. Let z(a, \u03b5, q, \u03c0 f ), m(a, \u03b5, q, \u03c0 f ), and \u03c0(a, \u03b5, q, \u03c0 f ) be the optimal R&D policy, optimal accounting manipulation policy, and induced normalized Street earnings functions, and let f a (a |a) and f \u03b5 (\u03b5) be the transition and density functions for the exogenous processes. Formally, the stationary distribution \u00b5 satisfies the following condition: The aggregation condition which must further be satisfied on a stationary balanced growth path, which guarantees that the aggregate growth rate of long-term quality is generated by firm policies and the stationary distribution \u00b5, repeats here from the main text. \u03a6(z(a, \u03b5, q, \u03c0 f )))\u03c9(1 + g)d\u00b5(a, \u03b5, q, \u03c0 f ) The first term represents quality growth generated by quality ladder innovation arrivals, the second term represents quality growth from lagging-quality firms away from the diffusion bound \u03c9, and the final term represents quality growth from lagging quality firms at the diffusion boundary. Note that the model used for cost estimation in Section 4 imposes \u03bb e = \u03bb s = s jt = 0 and \u03be = \u03be manager , i.e. the model assumes away agency conflicts and mechanical resource costs of earnings misses, while the shirking model in Section 5 assumes \u03bb e = 0 and the empire building case in Section 5 assumes \u03bb s = s jt = 0. Both models of Section 5 assume \u03be = (1 \u2212 \u03b8 d )\u03be pay , i.e. that the costs of earnings misses represent explicit manager compensation policies."}, {"section_title": "B.3 Welfare and Firm Value Change Formulas", "text": "The total consumption equivalent welfare gains from the removal of earnings targets, i.e. moving from \u03be > 0 \u2192 \u03be = 0 comparing balanced growth paths only, can be written as 100\u2206 where \u2206 satisfies the following equation: All \"targets\" subscripts refer to cases with \u03be > 0 and \"notargets\" subscripts refer to cases with \u03be = 0. Trivially, this yields the following formula and decomposition of the welfare gains from removal of the earnings target friction: The above welfare calculations are general equilibrium, in that they take into account all aggregate changes in growth rates, forecasting systems, and the stationary distribution of the economy when targets are removed. By contrast, the partial equilibrium change in firm value resulting from the removal of earnings targets is computed leaving these quantities unchanged, since from the perspective of the firm such aggregates are fixed. The resulting formula for the average change in firm value used in the text is aggregate consumption level and firm value by assuming costs are private to the manager, \u03be = \u03be manager . Therefore, there is no mechanical effects of the target removal on aggregate household consumption or firm dividends through a resource channel. By contrast Section 5, which assumes that miss costs are based on manager compensation, prevents a mechanical impact of miss costs on aggregate consumption through the lump-sum transfers away from managers but does allow for clawback to increase firm flow dividends for valuation purposes."}, {"section_title": "B.4 Adding Measurement Error", "text": "The main text shows results for a version of the baseline model with \"target measurement error\" \u03bd jt for firms. \u03bd jt is a transitory white noise disturbance with variance \u03c3 2 \u03bd for firm j in period t which is unknown at the time manager policies are determined but shifts the realized profits for firms and hence the relevant earnings target.
