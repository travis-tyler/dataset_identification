Non-residential fathers who reported higher levels of depression and drug or alcohol abuse were less likely to be involved with their child at age 2. These findings may prove useful in better understanding nonresidential fathers' involvement with their children, and particularly for the development of policies and programs to encourage increased father-child involvement. Non-resident father-child Involvement Page 3 Non-resident father involvement with their two-year-old children: Findings from the ECLS-B Due to societal changes in family structure, researchers and policy makers have been increasingly interested in identifying factors associated with non-residential fathers' contact with their biological children. Father involvement has been associated with children's academic and social outcomes. The current investigation utilizes data collected from non-residential fathers by the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) to examine correlates of involvement when children were approximately 2-years old. Based upon the literature that has focused on residential fathers, we know that residential fathers spend a higher proportion of their time interacting with young children engaged in play (Lamb, 2010) than do mothers. Moreover, the quality of play between fathers and young children differs from that between mothers and young children (Lindsey, Mize, & Pettit, 1997). Parent-child interaction may play an important role in children's subsequent interaction with peers (Mize, Pettit, & Meece, 2000), and father-child interaction may be particularly important for children's development of peer-based social behaviors (Meece & Mize, 2011). However, there have been few studies of father-child interaction among non-resident fathers and their children."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "Non-resident father-child Involvement Page 4 The ECLS-B is a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of 14,000 children. Data were collected from non-residential fathers (NRF) when the children were approximately 9-months, and 2-years. At the 2-year follow-up, mothers of 2,050 of the children reported that there was no resident father living in the home. The Nonresident Father Questionnaire (NFQ) was administered to children's biological fathers who did not reside in the household with the child, when the mother gave permission and reported he had contact (by phone or in person) with the child in the last month or talked with the mother about the child several times a year. Of an estimated 1,600 fathers who would be eligible (an estimated 500 NRF would not meet eligibility) as non-residential fathers, the NFQ at 2-years was completed by biological fathers of 650 children (350 girls, 300 boys; 23% white, non-Hispanic; 46.7% African American; 17.2% Hispanic; 0.6% Asian American, 3.5% Native American or Alaska Native; and 8.8% more than one race, non-Hispanic).

Measures of child characteristics and NRF characteristics were taken from the 2-year NFQ and one composite measure of NRF closeness to the child at 9-months (e.g., carries picture of child, talks about child; 5 items \u03b1 = .52) was computed from the 9-month NFQ."}, {"section_title": "Direct child assessments using the Bayley Short Form-Research Edition (BSF-R)", "text": "were used to assess children's mental ability and motor ability at 9-months and 2years.

Table 1 presents t-scores between the five NRF involvement measures and dichotomous child and father variables. No significant difference was obtained between child sex, if NRF had ever married the mother, and NRF's report that they wanted the child.
