[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The modern Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) is a key oceanographic region for regulating the Earth\u00b4s climate system, accounting for between 5-10% of global marine production whilst also representing a major source of carbon dioxide efflux to the atmosphere.

Yet, the full extent of the climate and oceanic teleconnections and the mechanisms promoting the observed increase of productivity occurring at glacial terminations remain poorly understood. Here we present multi-proxy, micropaleontological, geochemical and sedimentological records from the easternmost EEP to infer changes in atmospheric patterns and oceanic processes potentially influencing regional primary productivity over glacial-interglacial cycles of the mid-late Pleistocene (~0-650 ka). These proxy data support a leading role for the northsouth migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in shaping past productivity variability in the EEP. Productivity increases during glacial periods and notably peaks at major and \"extra\" glacial terminations (those occurring 1-2 precession cycles after some major terminations) coincident with the inferred southernmost position of the ITCZ. The comparison of our reconstructions with proxy records of climate variability suggests the intensification of related extratropical atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections during deglaciation events.

Yet, it accounts for 5-10% of the global oceanic primary production while comprising only 9% of the ocean area (Pennington et al., 2006). Nutrients and CO 2 -rich waters are currently supplied to the EEP thermocline via Subantarctic Mode Water (Sarmiento et al., 2003). Modern biogeochemical models suggest that Subantarctic Mode Waterprovides a substantial fraction (30-50%) of the nutrients that reach the EEP, thereby sustaining a large proportion of the export production in this area (Palter et al., 2010). However, the mechanisms driving glacial to interglacial changes in the biological productivity and export production in the EEP remain equivocal. The supply of micronutrients (i.e., iron) have long been proposed as one of the main influences on the efficiency and strength of the oceanic biological pump in the past (e.g. Murray et al., 2012). Yet, a recent study have argued that variability in the atmospheric dust input (a major source of iron) to the EEP was not large enough to trigger a substantial increase in glacial productivity and that nutrient supply from the Southern Ocean might have played a crucial role in controlling the equatorial Pacific productivity over the Late Pleistocene (Winckler et al., 2016). The south to equatorial connection, through so called \"oceanic tunnelling\" (Spero and Lea, 2002) appears to have been active in the past, in particular during the last deglaciation (Martinez-Boti et al., 2015) and likely during older deglaciations (Rippert et al., 2017). However, little is known about the functioning of the oceanic tunnelling during other mid-late Pleistocene terminations and its influence on the biological pump in the EEP and therefore global climate. Furthermore, the EEP is involved ininterhemispheric thermal and moisture transport through changes in the mean position and strength of the Hadley circulation cells, which are intimately linked to the meridional position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) (Schneider et al., 2014). Changes in the average position of the ITCZ are relevant not only at a global scale, controlling global atmospheric reorganizations (Chiang et al., 2014), but also regionally, involving changes in the position of oceanographic structures such as the Costa Rica Dome (CRD). The CRD is an open-ocean upwelling system in the EEP that develops seasonally off the coast of Central America (Fiedler, 2002). It has been previously suggested that past changes in the intensity and location of the CRD upwelling system depends on the intensity of the trade winds linked to the meridional position of the ITCZ (Hofmann et al., 1981), and that such variability could influence regional productivity patterns in the EEP duringthe last glacial cycle (Ivanova et al., 2012). It is unclear to what extent atmospheric processes (e.g., ITCZ-related CRD variability), in addition to oceanic processes (e.g., ocean tunnelling), might have influenced past productivity patterns in the EEP during the mid to late Pleistocene. Here we present a multi-proxy record to investigate the mechanisms controlling past variability in productivity in the EEP at glacial-interglacial time scales. The record is obtained from the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP), Expedition 344, Site U1381 (Hole U1381C) located off the Costa Rica margin (Figure 1). The core site is ideally located to capture signals related to the past changes in the EEP productivity which might have occurred either through variations in the position of the ITCZ, which controls the extension and location of the CRD, and/or through fluctuations in the nutrient supply from southern sourced waters. Accordingly, we use proxies providing information for the quantity and quality of the organic carbon supply to the seafloor (e.g., benthic foraminiferal faunal composition, planktonic foraminiferal abundance, organic carbon and opal content) and sediment chemical composition (e.g., calcium carbonate and major elemental content). These multi-proxy derived records allow us to investigate the mechanisms controlling past variability in productivity and make inferences on the contribution of atmospheric and oceanicprocesses at the glacial terminations throughout the Middle to Late Pleistocene (the last 650 ka)."}, {"section_title": "Core location and oceanography", "text": "The Hole U1381C (08\u00b025.7027\u2032N; 84\u00b009.48\u2032W, Harris et al., 2013, Figure 1) is located ~4.5 km offshore the Osa Peninsula, on the Costa Rica margin at the southern end of the East Pacific Warm Pool (Fiedler and Talley, 2006). The core site was recovered at 2065 meters, well above the depth of the modern sedimentary lysocline, which is established at ~ 2900 meters water depth for the Panama basin (Thunell et al., 1981). At present, primary production in surface waters at Site U1381 is relatively low as its location is not directly influenced by the seasonal (wind-driven) upwelling or the current position of the open ocean upwelling center of the CRD (Figure 1a-b) . The lack of seasonal coastal (winddriven) upwelling at our site is because of the proximity to the Talamanca mountains (3000-4000 m height) which favour the convergence of local wind curl patterns (Pennington et al., 2006). This contrasts with the seasonal coastal upwelling processes occurring south (Gulf of Panama, Panam\u00e1) and north (Gulf of Papagayo, Nicaragua) of the Site U1381 (Figure 1c-d). The CRD is a \"permanent\" anticlinal thermal structure flowing cyclonically and is currently centred around 9\u00baN and 90\u00baW with a diameter ranging between 100 to km (Figure 1a-b).

The oldest radiocarbon age was too old for calibration and was discarded for the age model construction. The last occurrence of the planktonic foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber (pink variety) occurring at 8.95 mbsf which corresponds to an age of ~127 ka (Ivanova et al., 2012), was also used as a dating point (See supplementary information S.I.1).

However, previous studies in the area have identified some episodes of carbonate dissolution during the last glacial cycle (Ivanova et al., 2012). In order to interpret the CaCO 3 variability at the core site and to assess whether carbonate dissolution influenced the composition of benthic foraminiferal assemblages, we used several independent proxies for CaCO 3 dissolution and CaCO 3 production (e.g., LaMontagne et al., 1996): % CaCO 3 and mass accumulation of CaCO 3 , major elemental ratios (Ca/Ti), % >63 \u03bcm coarse fraction, relative abundance of benthic to planktonic plus benthic foraminifera (B/P+B), % C org , and the absolute abundances of benthic and planktonic foraminifera (number of BF or PF/g) ( Figure 2b-f). TheCaCO 3 record (% and mass accumulation) of Hole U1381C shows high values during glacial periods (5-15%) and low values during interglacials (<5%) (Figure 2b). The % CaCO 3 concentrations (and indirect proxies for sedimentary CaCO 3 content such as Ca/Ti) peaks at major and so-called \"extra terminations\" (i.e., terminations exhibiting patterns of events similar to main terminations, but occurring 1-2 precession cycles before), such as Termination IIIa (TIIIa, between MIS 7c and 7d) and Termination VIIa (TVIIa, between MIS 15a and 15b) (Cheng et al., 2016). Paleoproductivity related proxies; % C org , abundance of planktonic and benthic foraminifera and % >63 \u03bcm (which is mainly composed by planktonic and benthic foraminifera with occasional skeletons of diatoms and radiolaria) exhibit generally high values during glacial periods and terminations and low values during interglacial periods (Figure 2 c-f). The observed trends are statistically supported by positive correlations (see Supplementary Table S.I.2). The relationship between parameters seems to be noticeable at major and extra terminations, where there is a significant correspondence with peaks in % CaCO 3 (and indirect proxies i.e., Ca/Ti, Figure 2b), % >63\u03bcm fraction (Figure 2c) benthic foraminifera absolute abundance ( Figure    2d) and % C org (Figure 2f).

The C org/ N values range from 4.4 to 13 (mean=9, see supplementary data), suggesting that the C org at the core site is mainly of marine provenance (Meyers, 1997). In contrast to %C org , the % opal, which varies between 7% and 11%, shows only minor glacial-interglacial variability, (Figure 2g), but a clear decrease in % opal at terminations. The Si/C, a proxy for the abundance of siliceous to non-siliceous primary producers, shows higher values during interglacials than during glacials, with the lowest values occurring at terminations (Figure 3g). The record of Ti/Al, a proxy for the terrigenous provenance of the sediments, varies between 0.05 and 0.09 (Figure 3h). This variability range is comparable to other published Ti/Al records used to infer terrigenous influence in marine sediments (e.g., Yarincik et al., 2000, Figure 3i). The values of Ti/Al in the core U1381C show anincreasing trend from interglacials to terminations when ratios show the highest values (Figure 3h)."}, {"section_title": "4.3.-Benthic foraminifera assemblages", "text": "The abundance of benthic foraminifera increases during glacial periods and peaks at terminations (Figure 3a "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The carbonate record of Hole U1381C", "text": "The factors explaining EEP CaCO 3 variability are still under debate (Winckler et al., 2016) with some studies suggesting that CaCO 3 productivity is the main driver (Lyle et al., 2002) and others instead proposing deep water carbonate chemistry (Sexton and Barker, 2012). Separating the signals of production anddissolution in CaCO 3 related proxies is difficult because both influences might have acted either concurrently or differently over time. It therefore requires the use of several independent proxies for both CaCO 3 production and dissolution (see section 4.1). The overall correlation between % CaCO 3 and indirect proxies for paleoproductivity (% Corg, absolute abundance of benthic and planktonic foraminifera) suggests that CaCO 3 production played a prime role in shaping sedimentary CaCO 3 content at our EEP Site (Figure 2b-d). The strong correspondence between peaks of % CaCO 3 and foraminiferal absolute abundance suggests that CaCO 3 production, rather than minimum dissolution (preservation), is also the most likely cause for CaCO 3 deglacial peaks at the core site. As an exception to this general relationship is a period of moderate dissolution identified between ~ 20 and 110 ka. This interval is characterized by high B/P+B ratios (Figure 2e) and planktonic assemblages dominated by dissolution resistant species, such as Globorotalia menardii (see Supplementary Information, Figure S2). Intense dissolution intervals are identified around the transition between maximum interglacial and glacial declines of MIS 11 and MIS 5 (Figure 2; brown bars). These intervals are represented by the extremely low abundance of whole shells of planktonic foraminifera, low numbers of benthic foraminifera, low mass accumulation rate of the coarse fraction, and depressed % CaCO 3 content. These samples might be affected by dissolution and paleoenvironmental interpretation has been considered with caution. Inferred peaks of organic export and CaCO production occur at all seven major glacial terminations (except for Termination V) and the \"extra terminations\". Notably, the CaCO accumulation and benthic foraminiferal abundance peaks exhibit comparable values at both major and extra terminations (including terminations occurring during the period of mild interglacials MIS13 and MIS15). The pattern described by our records at Termination V differs from the other terminations in that the high % CaCO 3 values do not occur at the termination but rather during mid glacial MIS 12 (Figure 2a-b, f)."}, {"section_title": "Paleoproductivity from benthic foraminifera: the influence of the CRD", "text": "As outlined above, the productivity proxies at Site U1381C (e.g., C org and benthic foraminiferal abundance) at Site U1381C typically exhibit high values during glacial periods and terminations and low values during interglacial periods (Figure 2a, d-f, Figure    3a-b). The deglacial productivity maxima are consistent with results from other studies in the EEP for the last deglaciation (Ivanova et al., 2012) and older terminations . Benthic foraminiferal assemblages can provide additional information about the potential mechanisms involved in those paleoproductivity changes over the last 650 ka. The group Uvigerina ssp. occurs in higher relative abundances during interglacial periods (Figure 3c). One of the species within the group, Uvigerina auberiana is an infaunal species considered well adapted to high fluxes of organic carbon under perennial upwelling regimes and low to moderate oxygenation environments (e.g., Licari and Mackensen, 2005). Similar ecological preferences are considered for U. peregrina, for which some studies also indicate its preference for refractory organic material (Morigi et al., 2001). Therefore, high relative abundance of Uvigerina spp. during interglacials is suggested to indicate relatively high to moderate, but sustained organic carbon flux to the seafloor. At the same time, glacial periods and terminations (TII-TVII) are characterized by higher benthic foraminifera abundances and increased numbers of Cassidulina carinata and secondary species Valvulineria glabra and Rotamorphina laevigata (Figure 3e,f). Ecological studies indicate that C. carinata favours the seasonal delivery of food to the seafloor occurring during phytoplankton bloom events (Goineau et al., 2011) and that the species of the genus Valvulineria (V. bradyana, V. mexicana) prefer eutrophic conditions (Mojtahid et al., 2010). This allows for the interpretation of the occurrence of C. carinata (and secondary species) as an indicator of the seasonal delivery of fresh and abundant organic carbon to the seafloor (likely from phytoplankton blooms) in an overall context of high productivity during glacials and terminations. This suggests that glacial-interglacial changes in productivity are related to a variable influence of organic carbon supply from a seasonal versus permanent source. There are at least two potential sources to consider that which might have driven the seasonal productivity changes at Hole U1381C: (i) coastal upwelling and (ii) the CRD upwelling system. Coastal (wind-driven) upwelling is not favoured at the core site because of proximal high mountain ranges (See description of core location and oceanography in Section 2); therefore, the most plausible source of a seasonally variable organic carbon supply to Site U1381, during glacial periods and their terminations, is the seasonal CRD open-ocean upwelling system. Thus, interglacial conditions characterized by species related to sustainable organic carbon flux to the seafloor, are interpreted as prevailing during a weak influence of the CRD over the study site (similarly to the present conditions) in contrast to glacials and terminations, which are interpreted as occurring when the influence of the CRD over the core site is at its highest and the organic carbon input to the seafloor occurs seasonally. The similar composition of modern benthic foraminiferal assemblages, as those described above, under the influence of the CRD (9-11\u00baN; Heinz et al., 2008) and outside its influence (4-8\u00baN; Betancur and Martinez, 2003) supports our interpretation. Recent foraminiferal assemblages under the influence of the CRD show increased abundances of Cassidulina carinata (Heinz et al., 2008) in comparison with assemblages from areas not directly affected by (or outside) the influence of this open ocean upwelling system, which are dominated by Uvigerina species (Betancur and Martinez, 2003). Following the arguments discussed above, we suggest using the abundance of Uvigerina spp. group as an indirect proxy for the relative influence of the CRD at Hole U1381C, with increased (decreased) abundance of these species being related to distal (proximal) influence of the CRD (Figure 3c). The suggestion of increased influence of the CRD over the core site during glacials and terminations is also consistent with the record of sedimentary Si/C ratios (Figure 3g). The CRD is a unique open ocean upwelling system as, in contrast to other upwelling systems where productivity is dominated by large size diatoms, productivity is governed by cyanobacteria of the Synechococus group (Krause et al., 2016 and references therein). Consequently, the contribution of diatoms to the organic matter export is low (Krause et al., 2016). Therefore, low sedimentary Si/C ratios are expected when the CRD is close to the Site U1381. Indeed, Si/C ratios are low during glacials and reach their lowest values coincident with terminations ( Figure 3g) further supporting the interpretation of changes in the position of the CRD based on the benthic foraminiferal assemblages. The foraminiferal assemblages characterizing the last deglacial period and the early Holocene suggest the occurrence of intermediate to strong oxygen depletion in the bottom waters, based on the known tolerance of Bolivina interjuncta, Bolivina seminuda, Bolivina cf. plicata and Epistominella smithi and E. pacifica for hypoxic conditions (Silva et al., 1996) (Figure 3e). Intermediate hypoxic conditions in the bottom waters are likely the result of a combination of physical (i.e., reduced oxygen ocean solubility, water stratification and warming) and biological processes (Tetard et al., 2017 and references therein) including the excess of organic carbon supply to the sea floor delivered from enhanced productivity under the influence of the CRD. The latter is supported by low Si/C ratios. A similar hypoxic deglacial event has been also described in areas to the north of our location such as Baja California and Santa Barbara basin (Tetard et al., 2017)."}, {"section_title": "5.3.-Atmospheric control on the local oceanography", "text": "In the modern ocean, the trajectory of the CRD varies seasonally with the position of the ITCZ (Fiedler, 2002, Figure 1). Thus, change in the CRD position to be more (less) frequently over the site during glacial intervals and terminations (interglacials) requires a southward (northward, similar to nowadays) shift in the relative position of the ITCZ. Additionally, a northern (southern) position of the ITCZ would lead to increased (decreased) precipitation in the EEP (Chiang et al., 2014). Hence, an increased influence of the CRD over our site should parallel evidence for decreased precipitation and fluvial input. The influence of freshwater inputs to Site U1381 can be assessed from the relative influence of the detrital signal recorded in the elemental ratios Ti/Al (Figure 3h). The variations in the Ti/Al ratios are interpreted to be driven by changes in the terrestrial run off with low (high) ratios indicating more (less) run off (Yarincik et al., 2000). There is an overall clear relation between low relative abundance of the Uvigerina spp. group interpreted as increased influence of the CRD over the site (southern position of the ITCZ), with high Ti/Al values indicating low terrestrial runoff. This correspondence, together with other available proxies for the migration of the ITCZ in the tropical Atlantic (i.e., Ti/Al record from the Cariaco Basin (Figure 3i, Yarincik et al., 2000), strongly supports the suggestion that Hole U1381C is primarily recording the relative position of the ITCZ and its influence on the regional hydrography of the EEP. This interpretation is further supported by the similarity of the U1381C Ti/Al record and foraminiferal patterns during terminations to the \uf044\uf064 18 O record from Chinese speleothems (Figure 4e). The speleothem \uf064 18 O record is interpreted to represent abrupt changes in the precipitation regime in Central Asia related to the seasonal shifts in the ITCZ position that influences the strength of the Asian Monsoon (Cheng et al., 2016). When the ITCZ is displaced northward (southward) the northern hemisphere summer monsoon strengthens (weakens), increasing precipitation and yielding lower (higher) speleothem \uf064 18 O values (higher \uf044\uf064 18 O, Figure 4e). The correspondence between the southernmost position on the ITCZ recorded in U1381C and the weakening of the Asian monsoon supports previous suggestions that such ITCZ shifts are coherent over long distances (Schneider et al., 2014). Notably, our data extends previous inferences from marine records (Jacobel et al., 2016) for the southward migration of the ITCZ during the last two glacial terminations, indicating that comparable latitudinal ITCZ variability likely characterised earlier terminations as well, such as TIV, TV, TVI, TVII and the extra terminations TIIIa, TVIIa. This finding reinforces the idea that tropical atmospheric changes play an essential role in the deglaciation process (Denton et al., 2010)."}, {"section_title": "5.4.-Potential contribution of extra-tropical waters to EEP productivity during terminations", "text": "The deglacial productivity maxima observed at U1381C are related to the southward migration of the ITCZ.

Thus, the inferred southward shifts in the ITCZ are coincident (within age model uncertainties of ~ 4ka) with evidence for the delivery of ice-rafted debris (IRD) to the high latitude North Atlantic sediments (Figure 4f), an indirect proxy for perturbations in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (e.g., Barker et al., 2015). This linkage can be explained by atmospheric teleconnections which are reproduced in coupled ocean-atmosphere models showing that large reductions in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation can induce a southward shift in the ITCZ over the Pacific (Chiang et al., 2014). Climate models indicate that a southward migration of the ITCZ during Atlantic Meridional Overturning slowdown in the Northern Hemisphere could also cause a southward shift and intensification of the Southern Hemisphere westerlies (Ceppi et al., 2013). A southward displacement of the southern hemisphere westerlies would have contributed to warming the Southern Ocean and Antarctica (Denton et al., 2010). Besides, a weak mode of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation triggers a heat transport to the Southern Hemisphere, also warming the Southern Ocean and Antarctic continent via the thermal bipolar seesaw (Stocker and Johnsen, 2003). Ocean warming (i.e., retrieval of glacial ice) and the shift in the Southern Ocean wind pattern would have favoured the upwelling of nutrient rich deep waters in the Antarctic sector of the Southern Ocean,as inferred from marine sedimentary records (Anderson et al., 2009;Jaccard et al., 2013). The nutrient and carbon laden southern waters would also have advected northward, via Subantarctic Mode Water (Spero and Lea, 2002), and upwelled at the EEP providing extra nutrients to the equatorial thermocline, promoting primary production during the last deglaciation and possibly at older terminations (Winckler et al., 2016). The effective transfer of nutrients northwards is also conditioned by nutrient utilization in the Southern Ocean. Low nutrient utilization in the Antarctic Sector during deglaciations, caused by low iron fluxes to the Southern Ocean (Jaccard et al., 2013), implies a large proportion of nutrients being transported to low latitudes. The discussed ocean and atmospheric teleconnections set a favourable scenario for an active connection between Southern Ocean and Equatorial waters during deglacial periods as suggested by other authors for the last two glacial cycles (Rippert et al., 2017). The correspondence between the peaks in productivity during glacial terminations at thecore site and the abrupt rise in productivity in the Antarctic sector of the Southern Ocean (ODP 1094, Ba/Fe, Jaccard et al., 2013) suggests an intensification of the ocean tunnelling and an additional supply of nutrients from the Southern Ocean to the U1381C site. This supply of nutrients could have contributed to the increase in the productivity occurring at terminations in the easternmost part of the EEP. The data and interpretation discussed in this study provide a strong case for the contribution of the EEP to the regulation ofpast ocean-atmosphere exchange of CO 2 . The intensification of the ocean tunnelling during terminations, evidenced by interhemispheric productivity patterns, would have brought up CO 2 rich waters to the surface of the EEP potentially contributing to the increase of the CO 2 atmospheric pool (e.g., Martinez-Boti et al., 2015). However, a portion of this carbon would be taken up and exported by the biological pump at the EEP, counterbalancing this oceanic CO 2 outgassing by transferring carbon to the EEP interior. Although the net ocean-atmosphere flux at the tropical Pacific over Middle to Late Pleistocene is yet unknown, the increase of productivity at terminations might have acted to dampen the global atmospheric CO 2 increase occurring at terminations (Bereiter et al., 2015). The described pattern might be applicable to other tropical areas where the injection of southern sourced nutrients to low latitude Atlantic has been interpreted to increase the productivity during the last deglaciation (Poggemann et al., 2017)."}, {"section_title": "6.-Conclusions", "text": "In this study, we obtained a multiproxy data set of independent proxies (geochemical, micropaleoecological, sedimentological) that provide progress in our understanding of the mechanisms promoting productivity changes within the easternmost part of EEP region. We infer that the main processes promoting the increase of productivity in the EEP at major and extra terminations over the last 650 ka is the shift of the ITCZ to a more southerly position (increased influence of the high productivity upwelling centre of the CRD) together with additional nutrient dvection from the Southern Ocean. From these arguments we infer that both interhemispheric oceanic and atmospheric mechanisms were involved in the productivity increase at terminations at the EEP. This deglacial productivity increase potentially played a role in the glacial-interglacial atmospheric CO 2 regulation by dampening the deglacial rise in atmospheric CO 2 . The new data presented here suggest that the EEP is a key region in climate regulation playing a role in the global atmospheric and ocean reorganizations occurring at Middle to Late Pleistocene terminations.

The increased (decreased) abundance of Uvigerina spp. is related to the northward (southward) position of the ITCZ.
