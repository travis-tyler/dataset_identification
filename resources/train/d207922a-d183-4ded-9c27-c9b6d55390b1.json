[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) carries a high risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Previous clinical trials testing whether cholinesterase inhibitors can slow the rate of progression from MCI to AD dementia have yielded disappointing results. However, recent studies of the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in AD have demonstrated improvements in cognitive function. Because few rTMS trials have been conducted in MCI, we designed a trial to test the short-term efficacy of rTMS in MCI. Yet, in both MCI and AD, we know little about what site of stimulation would be ideal for improving cognitive function. Therefore, two cortical sites will be investigated in this trial: (1) the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which has been well studied for treatment of major depressive disorder; and (2) the lateral parietal cortex (LPC), a novel site with connectivity to AD-relevant limbic regions.\nMethods/design: In this single-site trial, we plan to enroll 99 participants with single or multi-domain amnestic MCI. We will randomize participants to one of three groups: (1) Active DLPFC rTMS; (2) Active LPC rTMS; and (3) Sham rTMS (evenly split between DLPFC and LPC locations). After completing 20 bilateral rTMS treatment sessions, participants will be followed for 6 months to test short-term efficacy and track durability of effects. The primary efficacy measure is the California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II), assessed 1 week after intervention. Secondary analyses will examine effects of rTMS on other cognitive measures, symptoms of depression, and brain function with respect to the site of stimulation. Finally, selected biomarkers will be analyzed to explore predictors of response and mechanisms of action.\nDiscussion: The primary aim of this trial is to test the short-term efficacy of rTMS in MCI. Additionally, the project will provide information on the durability of cognitive effects and potentially distinct effects of stimulating DLPFC versus LPC regions. Future efforts would be directed toward better understanding therapeutic mechanisms and optimizing rTMS for treatment of MCI. Ultimately, if rTMS can be utilized to slow the rate of progression to AD dementia, this will be a significant advancement in the field.\n(Continued on next page)"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The goal of this study is to test the efficacy of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) as a treatment for amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). MCI describes a clinical entity between healthy cognitive aging and dementia, in which individuals are cognitively impaired but do not meet the full criteria for dementia [1, 2] . Amnestic MCI (aMCI), in which individuals experience mild memory impairment with or without impairments in other cognitive functions [3] [4] [5] , can presage dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), though not every person with aMCI will progress to AD dementia [6] . Among adults aged 65 or older, 16 to 20% are likely to fit the overall entity of MCI [3, 7] . Once diagnosed, the annual rate of conversion to dementia averages 12% per year [7, 8] . MCI is an important public health concern due to its prevalence, risk of progression to dementia, and lack of effective treatment.\nDuring the past decade, clinical trials testing whether cholinesterase inhibitors could slow the rate of conversion from MCI to dementia, or at least provide a temporary boost to cognitive performance, yielded disappointing results [9] [10] [11] . Reviews of cholinesterase inhibitors, as well as a meta-analysis involving well over 4000 MCI patients, concluded that the low efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors is outweighed by their adverse effects (e.g. gastrointestinal discomfort, unusual dreams, and leg cramps) [12] [13] [14] [15] . A more specific augmentation of the cholinergic system is currently being tested in a 24-month clinical trial of transdermal nicotine (NCT02720445). This clinical trial follows a 6-month pilot trial that demonstrated nicotine improved the primary efficacy measure, attention, in older adults with MCI (standardized mean difference; SMD = 0.78) [16] . To date, no pharmacological treatment has been approved for MCI, and no non-pharmacological treatment has shown satisfactory efficacy for MCI. Systematic reviews of treatments for MCI [12, 13, 17] indicate that the treatment investigated was ineffective; or if the treatment showed promise of efficacy, the finding still needs to be independently replicated; or the clinical trial was underpowered [12] . Presently, healthy behaviors-particularly exercise, control of cardiovascular risk factors, and cognitive/social activities-are the recommended approaches for coping with MCI. In summary, aside from general health recommendations, there are currently no effective treatments for MCI.\nAt the leading edge of innovative and safe pilot treatments for improving cognitive function in older adults is rTMS [18, 19] , a noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) technique. In the Discussion, we outline the therapeutic rationale for rTMS with respect to targeting aMCI abnormalities in brain function. Here, we summarize emerging findings on the efficacy of multiple-session rTMS for improving cognitive function in MCI. Two sham-controlled, blinded trials involving nondemented older adults with MCI have been published [20, 21] . These two trials, which follow up on promising studies showing improvements in cognitive function in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , employed roughly similar rTMS treatment protocols, in which 10 Hz high-frequency \"excitatory\" rTMS [28] was applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 10 weekday sessions. The first rTMS-MCI trial, involving 34 MCI patients, used a parallel groups design [20] . Participants in the active group received 10 Hz rTMS delivered as 2000 pulses per session (5-s train duration; 25-s inter-train interval (ITI); 110%MT). Compared to sham, rTMS treatment significantly improved the primary outcome, scores on the Rivermead Everyday Memory Test. This improvement in memory performance was sustained at the 1 month follow-up time point (SMD = 0.78). A second rTMS trial, involving 9 patients with apathy and MCI used a cross-over design [21] . Participants received 10 Hz rTMS (4-s train duration, 26-s ITI; 120%MT; 3000 pulses per session) for 10 weekday sessions in the active condition. After a 4-week treatment-free period, the cohorts crossed over and repeated the 10 weekday sessions. Participants showed significant improvement in the primary outcome, the Apathy Evaluation Scale (p = .045), after active treatment compared to sham. Three of the six secondary cognitive outcomes also showed significant improvement; these were the Modified and original Mini-Mental State total scores and the Trail Making Test, Part A time score.\nSupplementing the scant literature on the efficacy of rTMS for MCI are three additional studies on rTMS for memory improvement: [1] a controlled cross-over trial in \"prodromal AD\" [29] (i.e., the participants had mild memory loss and were positive for amyloid and tau AD biomarkers [30] ) [2] ; a single-session rTMS experiment in aMCI [31] ; and [3] a single-session rTMS experiment involving older adults with below-normal memory performance [32] . In the single-session experiments, 5 Hz highfrequency rTMS applied over the left DLPFC for 5 min significantly improved face-name associative memory performance relative to the sham treatment [32] , and 1 Hz low-frequency rTMS (i.e. \"inhibitory\" rTMS [33] ) applied over the right DLPFC for 10 min following the study of non-verbal stimuli led to enhanced recognition accuracy [31] . In the multisession sham-controlled trial in \"prodromal AD\" [29] , participants (n = 14) received 20 Hz excitatory rTMS (2-s train duration; 28-s ITI; 100% resting MT; 1600 pulses per session) over the precuneus for 10 weekday sessions in the active rTMS condition. There was a 2-week washout period before crossing over to the other condition. The authors hypothesized that stimulation of the precuneus region of the medial parietal lobe would selectively improve episodic memory. Indeed, participants showed significant improvement in memory, as measured by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning delayed recall score, following active rTMS; other cognitive scores were not significantly changed [29] .\nTogether, these preliminary findings suggest that rTMS can enhance memory and cognition in MCI patients. Of nine other randomized, controlled rTMS studies in patients with AD dementia [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [34] [35] [36] , eight studies demonstrated significant improvement of cognitive function [22-27, 35, 36 ]. Yet, we know little about how long the effects of rTMS last, which is key to knowing how frequently rTMS would need to be repeated to slow or prevent progression of impairment. The limited follow-up data published so far come primarily from AD trials, and indicate that five or more sessions of rTMS can produce cognitive benefits lasting up to 4 months [23] [24] [25] . Moreover, it is not clear what site for noninvasive stimulation is ideal, given the pattern of neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits in MCI and AD [37] . In the rTMS studies to date on treatment of MCI and AD, the site most frequently targeted was the DLPFC, the same stimulation site used for treatment of depression. Is the DLPFC truly the ideal stimulation site for MCI and AD? Stimulation of the LPC gained proof of concept in a study of healthy young adults, in which 5 daily sessions of rTMS over the LPC led to significant improvement of associative memory [38] . Ultimately, stimulating both prefrontal and parietal regions might provide superior clinical outcomes given the profound effects of AD on widespread interconnected brain regions [39, 40] . Clearly, a greater understanding of how rTMS applied over a cortical site leads to changes in cognitive and brain function is important in deciding whether one site is ideal and sufficient, or whether stimulating multiple sites could be superior [41] . The current protocol is designed to rigorously test the short-term efficacy of rTMS in aMCI, while also commencing to address crucial questions about choice of stimulation site and durability of effects."}, {"section_title": "Study aims", "text": "The primary aim is to test the hypothesis that patients receiving active rTMS will show more improvement in memory at the 1-week post-intervention assessment than the sham-control group. Secondarily, we aim to: 1) Assess the durability of rTMS effects on memory over a 6-month follow-up period, which is longer than assessed in previous studies; 2) Examine effects of rTMS on behavior and brain function related to the site of stimulation, which is a novel approach in the AD spectrum; 3) Explore patient characteristics that could be useful in identifying who responds preferentially to rTMS or to a particular stimulation site."}, {"section_title": "Methods/design", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design and overview", "text": "Our hypotheses regarding the effects of rTMS on memory in persons with aMCI will be tested in a randomized, 2-stimulation-site, sham-controlled, 3arm double-blind design, in which bilateral rTMS is delivered as: [1] active rTMS of the DLPFC, [2] active rTMS of the Lateral Parietal cortex (LPC), or [3] sham/inactive rTMS (evenly split between each coil location).

Typically, a participant will have a morning session and an afternoon session. The intervention uses rTMS stimulation procedures that have proven evidence of efficacy to improve cognitive function in AD dementia, based on two meta-analyses [44, 45] . Specifically, high-frequency (10 Hz) rTMS is delivered bilaterally, as this procedure was significantly effective in improving the cognition of AD patients [44] . Stimulation will be applied over the right hemisphere first, and immediately followed by the left hemisphere, following the procedure of two previous bilateral stimulation trials [23, 24] . Coil placement is guided by a Localite neuronavigation system (Localite GmbH, Bonn, Germany) using the MRI data acquired at the baseline visit. By using neuronavigation, we aim to optimize subjects' clinical responses, irrespective of whether the subject is assigned to DLPFC or LPC stimulation. DLPFC participants will be stimulated on the left at the MNI coordinate x = \u2212 38, y = 44, z = 26, which was identified by Fox et al. [46] as a DLPFC site associated with more efficacious outcomes in rTMS treatment of depression. LPC participants will be stimulated on the left at the MNI coordinate x = \u2212 47, y = \u2212 68, z = 36, which was the MNI centroid used by Wang et al. [38] for fMRI-guided neuronavigation of rTMS; Wang et al. [38] successfully modulated cortical-hippocampal connectivity and improved associative memory performance in healthy, young adults. For both DLPFC and LPC participants, stimulation of the right hemisphere is targeted to the corresponding coordinate on the right (e.g. x = 47, y = \u2212 68, z = 36 to target the right LPC).\nThe same stimulation parameters are used to deliver both of the active interventions (DLPFC and LPC); specifically, a pulse frequency of 10 Hz with a 4-s train duration (40 pulses) and 11-s ITI. During each session, 2000 pulses will be applied over each hemisphere at 120% of the participant's resting motor threshold, which is individually measured for each hemisphere. In summary, this 10 Hz stimulation protocol delivers 4000 pulses per session and up to 8000 pulses per day, with a total of 80,000 pulses over 2-to 4-week period."}, {"section_title": "Equipment and masking procedures", "text": "The intervention is delivered using a MagPro X100 magnetic stimulator.

Potential differences in the magnitude of effects on semantic clustering and delayed recall sub-scores of the CVLT-II will be particular interest.\nFunctional connectivity With respect to therapeutic effects of rTMS on functional connectivity, changes in connectivity within the posterior Default-mode network (DMN), and changes between the DMN and networks that support task engagement [74, 75] are of particular interest. This is because of reports that aMCI patients, compared to cognitively unimpaired older adults, show 1) abnormal connectivity within the DMN, as well as 2) abnormal interactions between the DMN and other networks, in particular the Salience network and the Central Executive network (CEN) [76] . To examine effects of rTMS on functional connectivity, two sets of analyses will be performed on the baseline (t 2 ) and 1-week post intervention (t 13 ) rs-fMRI data: [1] rTMS effects on connectivity within the DMN. The aim of these analyses is to discover the extent to which rTMS restores connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) within regions of the DMN; and [2] rTMS effects on between-network connectivity. We will examine if rTMS reduces abnormally strong functional connectivity between the CEN and DMN, i.e. makes the two networks more anti-correlated. Change in connectivity from baseline to 1-week post intervention will be computed, and contrasts will be made between each active rTMS group and the sham group, and between the LPC and DLPFC groups. Appropriate corrections for multiple comparisons will be made to provide an overall alpha probability of a type I error of < 0.05."}, {"section_title": "Exploratory analyses", "text": "Change in BDNF levels from the beginning to the end of intervention will be examined using ANCOVA. Our working hypothesis is that BDNF levels will increase more in either active rTMS group, compared to that in the sham group. Though a direct link between rTMS and synaptic plasticity remains to be demonstrated in humans, an effect of rTMS on BDNF levels would be consistent with a beneficial effect on brain plasticity. Finally, baseline functional connectivity, genetic, and selected clinicodemographic variables will be explored as potential moderators of response to rTMS. The results of these exploratory analyses are useful toward generating hypotheses directed toward ultimately identifying who responds preferentially to rTMS or to a particular stimulation site."}, {"section_title": "Dissemination of research results", "text": "Following completion of the study, a manuscript will be prepared for the primary outcome (change in CVLT-II performance observed 1 week following intervention) and for the secondary memory-related outcomes, such as the durability of effects of rTMS on memory over the study period.

The DSMB will discharge itself from its duties when the last participant completes the study."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "There is increasing evidence from clinical trials that rTMS can improve cognitive function in older adults with MCI [20, 21, 31] , prodromal AD [29] and probable AD dementia [22-27, 35, 36] . These trials involved relatively small sample sizes and limited follow-up after intervention. Some studies did not have the benefit of a convincing sham coil system. The current protocol is designed to achieve rigorous, reproducible methods to test the efficacy of rTMS to improve memory in aMCI, while commencing to address essential questions of the duration of therapeutic effects and selection of stimulation site. To our knowledge, this would be the first study to investigate differences between the effects of rTMS applied over a DLPFC versus an LPC site within the same study design. Stimulating the DLPFC could have effects that would not be achieved with LPC stimulation, such that stimulating the DLPFC may differentially improve executive function, encoding of new information, and depressive symptoms. Conversely, stimulating the LPC may differentially improve memory retrieval and retention-the core cognitive domain of aMCI.\nThis would be the first clinical trial of rTMS in aMCI to measure changes in brain function, as assessed with pre-post rs-fMRI and functional connectivity metrics. It is believed that rTMS offers a means to modulate the brain's large-scale networks [77, 78] such as the DMN [79] [80] [81] and fronto-parietal /CEN [82] networks by positioning the rTMS coil over a cortical node of that network [83] . The effects of targeted stimulation are measurable weeks later in distal regions that are directly or indirectly connected with the cortical site stimulated [84] . Thus, precisely guided rTMS has the potential to improve brain network dynamics that are selectively abnormal in an individual patient or certain condition [85] .\nFor patients with aMCI, abnormal connectivity involving the DMN is a therapeutic target for rTMS. Network nodes that are accessible include parietal cortical sites, which in turn show connectivity to other DMN regions in the limbic, medial temporal, and inferior temporal cortices. In aMCI, the PCC of the medial limbic lobe most consistently shows reduced resting-state activity [86] . The PCC is a key node within the DMN [87] [88] [89] and a cortical hub that dynamically participates in interactions of the DMN with other brain networks [88, 90] . An rTMS-fMRI study in healthy young adults showed that multiple sessions of rTMS, when applied to a site over the LPC, increased connectivity between the LPC and PCC, the LPC and hippocampus, and other regions within the posterior DMN [38] . Thus, stimulating the LPC of aMCI patients has the potential to help restore loss of functional connectivity within the posterior DMN and help restore the PCC's connectivity with other DMN regions in the inferior temporal and medial temporal cortices (in particular, parahippocampal and fusiform gyri and the hippocampi).\nOn the other hand, rTMS delivered to the right or left DLPFC region can potentially improve network interactions between the CEN and DMN regions, based on rTMS studies involving adults with major depressive disorder [91] and healthy young adults [83] . Importantly, rs-fMRI studies of aging and the AD spectrum have revealed altered network interactions between the DMN and networks such as the CEN, which in turn correlate with lower cognitive performance [40, [92] [93] [94] . Thus, stimulating the DLPFC using rTMS has potential to improve DMN: CEN interactions in older adults with MCI. In summary, the present clinical trial aims to gain novel insights as to how rTMS could improve brain network function in aMCI patients by investigating changes in functional connectivity after noninvasive cortical stimulation.\nIf this clinical trial obtains a signal of improved memory performance or favorable changes in functional connectivity, the next step in the clinical development of rTMS for aMCI would be a multi-site Phase III trial with the inclusion of AD biomarkers. For individuals who are in the Alzheimer's spectrum [95] , the progression of AD from MCI to dementia reflects a cascade of neurodegenerative processes, of which amyloid-\u03b2 facilitated tauopathy is a leading account of AD progression [96] [97] [98] . If it could be shown that neuromodulation via noninvasive brain stimulation could actually move an AD biomarker of pathologic A\u03b2, tau, or neuronal status in a positive direction, this would be a major step forward in developing disease-modifying treatments for AD.\nThe prediction of responsivity to noninvasive brain stimulation is a parallel goal of future clinical development. There is evidence that individuals with mild dementia show a better cognitive response to rTMS than do those with more severe dementia [23, 36] . The pattern of differential response to rTMS in relation to dementia severity is plausibly due to decline of inherent neuroplasticity, greater skull-to-cortex distance, or other factors. Conceivably, indices of baseline functional connectivity, genetic variants (e.g. BDNF and Apolipoprotein E (APOE), or more easily measured, low-cost clinico-demographic variables will ultimately help predict response to rTMS and other modes of noninvasive brain stimulation. There are currently no effective treatments for MCI, aside from general health recommendations. If rTMS can be effectively utilized in older adults with MCI to delay progression to dementia, this would represent a significant advance in the field of AD and related disorders."}, {"section_title": "Study status", "text": "At the time of submission, the study has enrolled 24 study participants and has not completed participant recruitment or data collection."}]
