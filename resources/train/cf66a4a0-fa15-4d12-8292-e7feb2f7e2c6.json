Especially in the case of mixed-income neighborhoods, where it appears that schools might play a particularly important function (see Varady et al., 2005) , there is little conceptual clarity that can guide policy implementation and ongoing research on the effectiveness of this approach.\nDrawing from current literature and prevailing policy discussions, this article elucidates five main channels through which schools might influence the viability of mixed-income neighborhoods, which are as follows:\n1. Schools' primary function is to socialize and build the skills of local children and thus could promote prosocial behavior and ongoing school and career success and, when effective, could prevent delinquent and socially costly behavior. 2. Schools could be vital amenities that attract new middle-income families and retain residents, particularly those with school-aged children. 3. Schools could provide a unique forum for interpersonal interaction among children and parents, building relationships that promote stronger social networks beyond the school. 4. Schools could foster a sense of shared membership in their constituents, building collective identity that could potentially lead to collective action on behalf of the school or even the neighborhood. 626 Education and Urban Society 5. Schools could be an institutional resource for the entire community providing not only education to children but also community access to physical, human, financial, and programmatic resources.\nThe remainder of this article will discuss these five channels in more detail, exploring the theoretical basis for each and assessing available empirical evidence about their relevance. First, we present a model that describes the desired outcomes of mixed-income development and introduces the channels through which an investment in schools as an input might promote those outcomes. We then examine each of the channels in turn and review relevant literature. We conclude by considering the implications of this review for practice and future research."}, {"section_title": "Modeling School Influences on Mixed-Income Communities", "text": "In Figure 1 , we present a model of how schools might contribute to the success of mixed-income neighborhoods. In determining ways to generate and sustain a successful mixed-income neighborhood, how might those responsible-government officials, real estate developers, community members, and others-evaluate the relative value of prioritizing the development of high-quality local public schools? How exactly might such an investment promote the aims of creating a sustainable mixed-income neighborhood? The model in Figure 1 specifies some key outcomes associated with a successful mixed-income neighborhood, delineates schools as one of several inputs in which investments could be made, and indicates the five channels through which schools might influence neighborhood-and individual-level success. We now consider these model elements briefly in turn and then consider in more detail what can be gleaned about each of the channels from the relevant literature."}, {"section_title": "Inputs", "text": "Although our focus in this article is on schools as a neighborhood asset, our model lists a variety of other types of investments that could arguably contribute to the success of a mixed-income neighborhood. This list is found on the lefthand side of the model. Those seeking to promote neighborhood revitalization need to make investment choices, with limited resources to invest, from a range of possible options. We also want to acknowledge that schools alone could not be expected to influence the successful creation and sustenance of a mixedincome neighborhood.\n2 A future task for researchers is to consider the comparative benefit of various investments depending on the neighborhood and regional context in which socioeconomic integration is to be generated and to consider the relationship among these various inputs. We place housing at the top of the list of inputs because the creation of broad residential opportunities is a critical starting point for establishing a neighborhood of economically diverse households.\nIn this model when we refer to schools we focus on elementary schools (kindergarten-eighth grade) due to the greater engagement of parents in the daily routines and school activities of younger children and the stronger link between elementary schools and specific neighborhood attendance areas (Silverman et al., 2005 ). Our conceptual model could certainly be applied to high schools. To fully serve the variety of functions that we will discuss in this article, it is necessary that the school be a public good-accessible without exclusion to all residents of the neighborhood. Although private schools can certainly be an important asset in a healthy neighborhood, institutions that fully advance the goals of a mixed-income neighborhood are inclusive of the breadth of the population. By extension, if the school effectively recruits students from the full neighborhood population and the school is in a mixed-income neighborhood, then the school must cater to students from families with a range of incomes. The simplicity of this concept belies the complexity of operating an educational institution that must be prepared to teach students with a wide variety of levels of preparation, aptitude, and familial support. To make a compelling argument for the connection between school-level investments and neighborhood-level impacts, the school must have an attendance boundary within which all school-age residents are eligible to enroll in the school.\n3 Local school catchments imply that the parent constituency of the school will also be a neighborhood constituency; relationships formed in the context of school activities could have currency in the broader neighborhood as well."}, {"section_title": "Outcomes", "text": "To build the conceptual model, an important task is to define what is meant by a successful mixed-income neighborhood. 4 On the right-hand side of the model, we have listed several outcomes that would be characteristic of a successful mixed-income neighborhood. On one level, a successful mixed-income neighborhood would be defined by the same indicators as in any neighborhood: a high quality of life for its residents and other community members and a strong local demand for real estate, goods, and services that contribute to a vibrant local economy. However, promoting a mixed-income neighborhood also implies additional requirements. First, the neighborhood must sustain or create an economically diverse population and achieve some level of stability and balance in that economic diversity. Recent analyses by Galster, Metzger, and Cutsinger (2005; Booza, Cutsinger, & Galster, 2006) and Turner and Fenderson (2006) suggested that although neighborhoods in the largest 100 metropolitan areas of the United States are generally more economically diverse than conventional wisdom might suggest, that economic diversity is declining and high-and low-income families are increasingly being sorted into neighborhoods predominated by others in their income range. By definition, to be successful, a mixedincome neighborhood must somehow break this trend and attract and retain families of low-, moderate-, and high-income levels (Varady et al., 2005) ."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "Given that a central policy rationale for promoting mixed-income neighborhoods is to counter the negative effects of concentrated poverty on low-income families, a successful mixed-income neighborhood must also generate some upward mobility among the lower-income households in the neighborhood. Thus, a further important outcome of successful mixedincome neighborhoods occurs at the individual level. It is true that if individuals' gains in socioeconomic status cause them to move out of the neighborhood, then there is no lasting benefit retained by that neighborhood from the ongoing presence of those individuals. However, it can be argued that a healthy neighborhood functions as a stepping stone, broadening residents' subsequent residential choices (Briggs, 2004) .\nThe positive outcomes indicated in Figure 1 are not the only possible outcomes from an investment in local schools. As we will discuss in detail later in the article, there are alternative, and less desirable, outcomes that might result. For example, increased demand for housing by affluent families with school-age children could lead to increased rents, which could lead to the displacement of low-income households. A well-intentioned policy of investing in local schools might have adverse consequences for the local low-income population."}, {"section_title": "Channels", "text": "Five channels connect schools as an input on the left-hand side of the model to the community-and individual-level outcomes on the right-hand side. We contend that there are a variety of ways in which investment in a high-quality school might serve to promote the goals of a mixed-income neighborhood. As we will discuss, each channel can be hypothesized to be linked to particular outcomes pertinent to a mixed-income neighborhood. No single channel is directly linked to all four major outcomes, but together the channels address the full set of outcomes. Intended as a starting point for discussion and further research about a complex topic, the models try to highlight the most important elements of the process as we currently understand it. We now turn to a detailed consideration of the theoretical and empirical basis for each channel."}, {"section_title": "Channel 1: Schools as Institutions for the Socialization and Human Capital Development of Local Youth", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Rationale and Theory", "text": "The first channel addresses two basic functions that schools have-skill building and socialization-whether or not they are located in a mixed-income neighborhood. These basic functions are worth considering briefly here because they are an important component of an argument for investing in a high-quality school as a component of neighborhood revitalization. Skill building and socialization are commonly understood as the primary function of schools (Akin & Garfinkel, 1977; Griffin & Alexander, 1978; Hanushek, 1986; Jenkins, 1995; Ogbu, 2003; Roeser, Eccles, & Sameroff, 2000; Wilcox & Moriarty, 1976) . As Ogbu (2003) stated, \"A public school education not only imparts to the individual the specific skills and knowledge necessary to function in modern societies, but it also socializes the individual in values and behaviors necessary to adapt in the workplace\" (p. 47). Although other factors, such as parental income and education strongly influence later outcomes, in theory, an investment in elementary education could contribute to upward mobility for local youth, including those from low-income families (Stone et al., 1999; Turnham & Khadduri, 2004) .\nIn Figure 2 , we suggest that high-quality education would help increase the skills and academic confidence of local students and would help expose the students to norms and modes of behavior needed to navigate broader society. This could increase the prosocial behavior of the students and decrease their involvement in delinquent activities. Stanton-Salazar (1997) focused in particular on the challenges for minority youth from working-class backgrounds of learning how to decode the broader institutional and social system. Increased skills and more prosocial behavior could lead to greater success in and out of school, and could also be associated with increased attendance and decreased drop-out rates. Lower drop-out rates and less delinquent behavior among a critical mass of youth could contribute to a decrease in neighborhood-level delinquency and have a direct benefit on the quality of life for others in the broader neighborhood. Ultimately, though there are many intervening variables and the theoretical connection is far more tenuous, it can be argued that greater in and out\nThe third channel suggests that schools are unique forums for social interaction.\n6 From school meetings to sporting and cultural events to daily dropoff and pick-up routines, school activities and school facilities provide parents with many opportunities for social interaction. Interaction may occur informally, as parents meet the parents of their children's friends, greet each other on the schoolyard, or volunteer together on class field trips. Schools also supply parents with opportunities to interact in more structured organizational settings, such as parent-teacher associations or schoolwide meetings.\nA core objective of mixed-income development is to reduce the social isolation of low-income families. Through proximity to more affluent families, it is hoped that families who have been previously disconnected from mainstream resources and opportunities will be able to establish personal relationships that link them to a broader set of resources and information and in this way they will build valuable social capital (Joseph, 2006; Joseph et al., 2007; Silverman et al., 2005) . However, existing evidence in mixed-income developments suggests that, in general, there is very minimal social interaction across income levels (Brophy & Smith, 1997; Joseph, 2006; Joseph et al., 2007; Smith, 2002; Varady et al., 2005) . There is even some evidence that even when families of different income levels in the development have children, the presence of children is not an influential source of social connection (Kleit, 2005) . This suggests a potentially vital role for schools: If residents with children are not interacting of their own volition across classes in developments, perhaps schools can play a positive socializing role in mixed-income developments (Berube, 2006) .\nIn theory, repeated school-based social interaction among parents in schools in mixed-income neighborhoods could lead to the development of relationships among parents of different income levels. This cross-income mixing could have at least two important outcomes. First, it could facilitate the building of social capital among parents, namely, relationships that can serve as productive assets (Bourdieu, 1986; Coleman, 1988; Loury, 1977; Putnam, 2000) . Coleman (1988) elucidated his landmark formulation of social capital with examples of the benefits of relationships among parents in a school setting. The expansive literature on social capital has been criticized for promulgating multiple and vague definitions (Portes, 1998) . To be specific, in this instance, we are most interested in social capital as an asset held between individuals that each can use for individual benefit (later, in our discussion of collective action, we will draw on treatments of social capital; e.g., Putnam, 2000 -which focus on its collective benefits). Literature on social networks indicates a large degree of homophily among social groups, that is, individuals who tend to connect with others like themselves (Fischer, 1982; Cohen, 1977; see McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001 , for a review). In particular, African Americans and low-income families have been shown to rely heavily on localized social networks (Campbell & Lee, 1992; Fischer, 1982; Lee, Campbell, & Miller, 1991; Oliver, 1988) . Thus, in considering schools in mixed-income neighborhoods, we are most concerned with the creation of bridging social capital or weak ties: the connection of low-income parents into valuable social networks to which they would otherwise not have access (Briggs, 1998; Gittell & Vidal, 1998; Granovetter, 1973 Granovetter, , 1985 . These new networks could lead to benefits for parents as they obtain information about employment or other resources, perhaps ultimately contributing to upward mobility.\nA second important outcome of the cross-income mixing is that these new relationships could lead to social learning, or what is commonly referred to as role modeling, as parents observe and emulate the actions and decisions of others (Bandura, 1977; Wilson, 1987) . Wilson (1987) argued that one of the most harmful outcomes of the exodus of middle-income families from innercity neighborhoods in the 1960s and 1970s was the loss of role models who could demonstrate a daily routine of work and productive behavior. According to Bandura (1977) , most human behavior is learned observationally through a process in which individuals identify others whom they regard as successful and attempt to reproduce actions that they observe. Thus, the repeated exposure to parents with differing lifestyles and parenting styles could lead to individual change in aspirations and behaviors, and, along with other factors, could contribute to upward mobility.\nThe fourth channel suggests that schools are institutions that engender common interest and identity.\n7 Regardless of income level, students and parents, as well as administrators, teachers, and staff, have a common interest in the success and stability of the school and, over time, usually come to identify themselves as members of the school community. Those common interests and identity could theoretically facilitate collective action on behalf of the school, which can then be leveraged into action on behalf of the neighborhood (Keith, 1996) . This is particularly important in a neighborhood with families from a variety of backgrounds who may not naturally see themselves as having much in common. Belonging to the same school community might have a galvanizing effect. An obvious example is the uniting effect of a successful school sports team with which all members of the community, across socioeconomic backgrounds, can identify. Part of that common identity might include a common set of norms and values that influence the behavior of students and perhaps even influence action among members of the broader community.\nThere could be two processes at play here. Above, we discussed the possibility that interpersonal interaction could benefit the individuals in the relationship. Here, interpersonal interaction becomes relevant again as we consider the possibility for the creation of social capital among parents in a school as a communal resource (Coleman, 1988; Putnam, 2000) . Through repeated interactions, trust and norms could be established that facilitate collective action on behalf of the school. The second possible contributor to collective action is the existence of issues of common interest and a shared sense of identity as members of the school community. Khadduri et al. (2003) and Turnham and Khadduri (2004) described the unifying potential of schools as an important element of schools' value to a neighborhood. This sense of shared identity and interest could lead parents to engage collectively in school affairs and attempt to exert whatever influence they might have over decision making. Collective action at the school level could be leveraged to support neighborhood-level organizing efforts (Keith, 1996; Stone et al., 1999; Warren, 2005) . Voluntary parent associations, formed to address particular objectives, represent potentially durable sets of relationships onto which individuals or groups can successfully transfer other organizational goals. Coleman (1988) discussed the potential for relationships among parents in schools to become appropriable social organizations that could be used to address other issues. In discussing the value of schools as an organizing platform, a national housing developer described schools as \"universal points of access for mixed-income communities\" (Moore, 2006) . If successful, the neighborhood-level collective action could lead to improvements in local goods and services, increasing the quality of life for local residents.\nSchools, according to our fifth and final channel, can also serve as valuable institutional resources within neighborhoods. School grounds and facilities represent important physical assets to host and support community activities (Stone et al., 1999) . Schools attract and manage financial resource flows to support various on-and off-site activities. Schools employ a cohort of individuals who possess human, social, and cultural capital. Chung (2002) argued that community development efforts should take advantage of schools as \"a point of entry . . . to address the social, economic and physical needs of a neighborhood\" (p. 1; see also Warren, 2005) . Myerson (2001) suggested that schools are particularly an important form of neighborhood facility to promote stability. As an institutional resource then, a school represents both a resource stock, with various forms of capital, and resources flows. These institutional resources can be leveraged to generate services and activities for the broader neighborhood, potentially increasing the quality of life for residents.\nThe community schools movement represents a growing effort to capitalize on schools as potential resources for their surrounding neighborhoods (Dryfoos, 1994 (Dryfoos, , 2005 Dryfoos, Quinn, & Barkin, 2005; Keith, 1996 Keith, , 1999 Moses & Coltoff, 1999; Quinn, 2005; Warren, 2005) . Although community schools vary in their types of programs and levels of engagement with external actors, their common commitment is to be an asset to a community constituency that is much broader than just the children who attend the school. A recent report by Voices for Illinois Children (2001) described community schools as \"hubs for school-linked or school-based services that promote lifelong learning and development throughout a community\" (p. 2). Dryfoos (2005) suggested that in addition to encouraging parent involvement, providing after-school enrichment and facilitating individual attention for children, community schools may also foster social capital in otherwise disadvantaged neighborhoods."}, {"section_title": "Figure 2 Schools as Socialization and Human Capital Development", "text": "of school success could be one factor in helping to promote ongoing achievement throughout the educational process and greater upward mobility during adulthood."}, {"section_title": "Evidence", "text": "Much has been written about the impact of elementary and secondary education on student outcomes and later adult functioning (see, e.g., reviews of the literature by Griffin & Alexander, 1978; Hanushek, 1986; Mincer, 1974; Wilcox & Moriarty, 1976) . The famous Coleman Report concluded that family background was a more powerful predictor of school performance than any measurable characteristics of schools themselves, excluding the makeup of the student body (Coleman et al., 1966) . Hanushek (1986) indicated that subsequent examination has identified serious flaws in the Coleman analysis and that studies with appropriate corrections for measurement error find unequivocally that schools have important effects on student performance. From their review of the literature, Griffin and Alexander (1978) concluded that although a substantial body of research suggests that between-school differences are modestly consequential on cognitive growth and educational outcomes, the available evidence, including their own research, suggests that there is a substantial impact of schooling on socioeconomic achievement. Though relatively weak compared to a model that included postschooling investments, Mincer (1974) found that years of schooling had a positive and statistically significant association with later earnings. Akin and Garfinkel (1977) found a strong association between expenditures in schools and wage rates of student graduates, particularly among Blacks. On the other hand, Hanushek (1986) pointed out the data and methodological limitations in the analysis of school quality and concluded that the literature is ambiguous about the relationship between school quality and subsequent attainment (see also Rizzuto & Wachtel, 1980) . More recent work by Card and Krueger (1992) using the Biennial Survey of Education and the U.S. census suggested that there is a positive relationship between school quality and earnings (see also their literature review, Card & Krueger, 1998) . Most recently, Ashenfelter and Rouse (1998) have used data on genetic twins to control for innate differences and found a positive return to schooling (see also twin studies by Ashenfelter & Krueger, 1994; Miller, Mulvey, & Martin, 1995) . There is also evidence that higher-quality education promotes more healthy adult social functioning (for a review, see Kahlenberg, 2001) . From their analysis of middle-school youth's perceptions and outcomes, Roeser and colleagues (2000, p. 467) concluded, \"Schools are a central context affecting adolescent development,\" both academic and socioemotional.\nA number of surveys and opinion polls of families with school-aged children have found that public schools are clearly a critical factor in decisions about where to live (Jud & Bennett, 1986) . Extensive economic research has demonstrated that housing prices are sensitive to local public-school quality (as measured by standardized test scores; Bayer, Ferreira, & McMillan, 2004; Black, 1999; Bogart & Cromwell, 2000; Brasington, 1999; Haurin & Brasington, 1996; Kane, Staiger, & Reigg, 2005; Walden, 1990) . Although a variety of methods-including simple ordinary-least-square regression techniques, difference-in-difference models, and natural experiments designed around exogenous shocks such as court-ordered redistricting-yield differences in the predicted magnitude of school quality's impact on housing prices, all of the literature we reviewed found positive and significant effects of an increase in test scores on local housing prices. Jud and Bennett (1986) estimated a model of intraurban migration and find that the quality of public school education shapes location decisions.\nThe real estate industry is keenly aware of the importance of schools as an amenity. Realtors have long recognized and espoused the value of quality public schools in bolstering neighborhood value. Private developers are beginning to invest in schools as a component of their development strategy (Francisco, 2005; Kelley, 2002) . A member of a development team working on a major new mixed-income development in Chicago (T. Stokes, personal interview, December 16, 2005) explained his organization's support for a new charter school within the development site:\nThe schools are such an important magnet for families and to be able to have that charter school . . . is an incredibly powerful difference [from other developments] where we have had no opportunity to work with the schools in the neighborhood . . . [Our objective is that the school is] such a shining star that everybody would want to live [here] because that's the best school in town.\nAlthough the available evidence suggests that schools play an important role in residential location decisions, several caveats should be made. Although school quality might drive decision making for households with children, in general family life cycle position and lifestyle may be equally or more important factors in explaining the urban-suburban location decision (Varady & Raffel, 1995) . There are also important questions about how parents assess school quality. Housing prices are most strongly associated with high proficiency test rates, high per-pupil expenditure, and a low teacher-student ratio, and less associated with graduation rates, valueadded measures of student performance, and teacher education levels (Brasington, 1999) . Research by Holme (2002) suggested that many parents make locational decisions based on perceptions about school quality, which they draw from more easily accessible information such as racial and socioeconomic makeup of the student population rather than visits to the school or statistics on the school.\nAlthough there is strong theoretical and empirical basis for the link between school quality, school demand, and local housing demand, we found little empirical investigation of other key components of our model of schools as an amenity. According to our model, high-quality public schools should not only attract middle-income homebuyers, they should also help retain current populations. This stemming of out-migration should increase neighborhood residential stability, a factor that has been demonstrated to contribute to higher levels of informal social control and thereby lower levels of local crime and delinquency (Sampson & Groves, 1989; Shaw & McKay, 1942) . However, we found little empirical investigation of the impact of school quality on changes in the composition of a neighborhood. The research by Bayer et al. (2004) cited earlier raised an important caveat: Sorting into a high-quality school attendance area may in fact lead to greater residential stratification. As the composition of the neighborhood begins to change in response to increased school quality, further household sorting may result because \"households place a high value directly on the characteristics of peers and neighbors\" (Bayer et al., 2004, p. 2) . Their research suggests that, ultimately, the full sorting effects on neighborhood composition may be substantially larger than the initial direct effect of a change in school quality on demand.\nThus, though the literature suggests that increasing the attractiveness of the local school as an amenity may indeed spur local housing demand and neighborhood revitalization, the school may affect the market such that the retention of an economically diverse population becomes extremely difficult.\nTwo conditions must hold in order for the interpersonal interaction channels specified in our model to even be possible. First some of the middle-income families that move into mixed-income neighborhoods must have children (or intend to remain in mixed-income neighborhoods in the event they have children). Second, those middle-income families with children must use the local public school system. The limited evidence available from the early experience in planned mixed-income developments across the United States suggests that middle-income families with children thus far have not been attracted to mixed-income housing in substantial numbers. Several studies have found that the middle-income residents of mixed-income developments are largely childless. In Brophy and Smith's (1997) overview of seven national mixed-income developments, the prevalence of market-rate families with children ranged from 6% of residents in the Harbor Point development in Boston to 2% to 3% of residents in the Emery Bay development in California to a single middle-income family with children at a development in New Haven, Connecticut. Varady and his colleagues (2005) examined the efficacy of efforts to attract middleincome families with children in four HOPE VI developments: City West in Cincinnati, Ohio; Park DuValle in Louisville, Kentucky; The Townes at the Terraces in Baltimore, Maryland; and Townhomes on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. They found that attracting middleincome families with children was not an explicit goal at any of the four sites. Accordingly, there was a minimal presence of such families across the sites, and, except in Louisville, the developers had limited collaboration with the local school system. Khadduri and her colleagues (2003) , in a study of the Centennial Place development in Atlanta, Georgia, reported that 91% of the families in market-rate units were childless. The demographics at Centennial Place are of particular interest here given that a new school was created as a part of the development. Although the school has turned out to be one of the highest-performing in the Atlanta public school system (Moore, 2006) , in its initial 4 years it had not yet attracted significant numbers of children from middle-income families (Khadduri et al., 2003) . It is possible that a considerable lag time is needed for the reputation of the school to be well-enough established to serve as an attraction to middleincome families.\nSilverman and her colleagues reported a contrasting set of findings based on their case studies of four mixed-income developments in the British cities of Manchester, Glasgow, and London (Silverman et al., 2005) . They found that recruiting middle-income families with children was an intentional element at each development and that, by providing units designed for families and investing in local amenities, the sites were successful in recruiting families. Although the proportions of families with children remained much lower than the average in the respective cities, at least 12% of families in market-rate housing had children in each of the four sites, and at one site the proportion was 19%. Most important in the context of this article, Silverman and her colleagues found that schools were of major importance for the families in the development. Those with previous social ties in the area tended to be comfortable with their children in the local schools. Those without previous social ties to the area were much more hesitant to put their children in the local schools and many expressed an intention to leave the area when their children were of school age. An exception was in one of the developments in London where a new elementary school had been opened as part of the new development, and families from all tenures and income levels were using the school and pleased with it. Although these findings from Britain are promising, further comparative analysis is necessary to identify factors-such as housing markets and racial dynamics-that might make similar achievements more difficult in the United States.\nLeaving aside for a moment the question of recruiting middle-income families, what can we learn about the possibilities for parent interactions across incomes from studies that have compared parent involvement in schools by socioeconomic status? Research in this area has framed parental distinctions in terms of class, thus incorporating issues of parental education and profession, as opposed to simply income. Existing research suggests that meaningful parent interaction across income and class will not emerge naturally due to enrollment in the same school or even assignment to the same classrooms. Horvat, Weininger, and Lareau (2003) and Muller and Kerbow (1993) used different methods to provide evidence that intergenerational closure, the existence of networks among parents of children who know each other, is primarily a middle-class phenomenon. Horvat and colleagues suggested that because interpersonal ties appear to form most effectively among parents who frequent children's extracurricular activities, middle-class parents have greater opportunities to form connections: In their data set middle-class students participate in, on average, three more activities than poor students and two more activities than working-class students. Muller and Kerbow analyzed the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 and found that as parents' level of education increased, so did their network connections to other parents.\nThus, it appears that in order for schools to serve as forums for crossincome relationship building, not only must special effort be made to recruit middle-income families into the schools, but also an intentional effort must be made to facilitate relationships within the school. Separation into different academic tracks is a common approach to managing schools with a wide variety of student levels of aptitude and preparation (Wells & Serna, 1996) . The task of facilitating relationship building is even more difficult in schools with tracking.\nWe found only anecdotal evidence of instances in which parents already organized in parent-teacher associations or connected by children's common membership in a classroom have coalesced around common threats or interests. Horvat et al. (2003) observed just such a phenomenon when a group of parents in a classroom quickly mobilized through a series of phone calls in response to a perceived threat. Warren (2005) provided a detailed case study of parent organizing efforts by the Logan Square Neighborhood Association in Chicago, including ways in which the parent organizing effort expanded to address broader neighborhood issues beyond the school, such as health and affordable housing.\nThe available evidence suggests that middle-class parents tend to engage very differently in school than working-class or low-income parents. Kahlenberg (2001) reviewed the literature on parental involvement and reported that socioeconomic status is the primary predictor of parent involvement. Furthermore, the engagement of middle-class parents can often be aimed to maintain the privilege of their own children as opposed to promoting the interests of all children. Lareau (1989 Lareau ( , 2003 , in detailed ethnographic investigations of class differences in parenting styles and school engagement, observed that differential child-rearing practices translate into differential strategies for parental engagement with school personnel. Lareau found that although middle-class parents actively shepherd their children through childhood with strategies of \"concerted cultivation,\" working-class parents adopt a more laissez faire approach. At school, middle-class parents often actively intervene in classroom and schoolwide practices and policies, whereas working-class parents tend to defer to the school's authority and see no need for intervention. In their comparative case study of three schools, Horvat and colleagues (2002) observed that working-class parents deal with school issues on an individual level rather than collectively. Stone et al. (1999) provided an explanation for the lack of engagement of low-income parents in schools, summarizing studies that describe the often troubled relationships between 642 Education and Urban Society schools and neighborhoods in poor urban areas and the sense of alienation that parents have often felt from schools in their neighborhoods.\nThe Lareau and Horvat and colleagues studies drew conclusions about class differences in parental involvement from school settings that were socioeconomically homogeneous. Studies of socioeconomically integrated schools that sort students into academic tracks provide some evidence about dynamics in schools with a mixed-income population. Examining efforts to detrack classes at 10 racially and socioeconomically integrated public high schools, Wells and Serna (1996) suggested that parents in mixed-income schools and school districts do not act on behalf of the student body as a collectivity. Instead, they observe that middle-class parents act to protect their class-based interests and not in concert with or on behalf of less privileged families in the school or district (see also Brantlinger, 2003; Wells & Crain, 1997) .\nFurthermore, residents of various income levels, and, more important, various levels of connection to the neighborhood, may not automatically form an affective or emotional connection with the local school. Ethnographic research by Small (2004) at the neighborhood level has shown that residents' perceptions of their neighborhoods, and the role that the neighborhood plays in their lives, help determine their willingness and propensity for neighborhood involvement. These same perceptions may shape individuals' decisions regarding whether and how to be involved in their local schools, particularly in instances where there is significant and perhaps contentious change. New residents and long-time neighborhood residents may feel a very different sense of connection to a new or restructured neighborhood school. For the new residents it could represent revitalization and growth and for the long-time residents it could represent gentrification and displacement.\nThus, the evidence suggests that parents may interact differentially with schools and within schools based on their socioeconomic background, which calls into question the extent to which income mixing within a school will naturally lead to collective action among parents of different class backgrounds. It will likely take more than simply having children in the same school to promote bonding social capital among parents, certainly at a level that could have a broader, neighborhood-wide impact.\nMore than 1,000 community schools have been successfully created in neighborhoods across the country, capitalizing on the existing physical and human assets associated with the school to provide an array of programs and activities engaging the broader community (Quinn, 2005) . According to Keith (1999) , \"Although there is considerable variety, most of these schools sponsor family-support initiatives and school-linked services, including programs such as extended-day and Saturday activities, family centers, summer camps, health clinics, adult evening classes, and mental health and other services\" (p. 225). Quinn (2005) added early childhood programs and community and economic development efforts to that list.\nMuch of the assessment of the impact of community schools focuses on the benefits to students of a broader array of neighborhood resources 644 Education and Urban Society offered within the school building (see, e.g., Dryfoos, 2005; Quinn, 2005) . Beyond the provision of a variety of programs, it is unclear what cumulative effects community school efforts have had on their surrounding neighborhoods. Whalen (2005) cautioned that though community schools may hope to contribute to neighborhood revitalization, in practice their neighborhood impact focused primarily on engaging community members in programs within the school building. The neighborhood-level impact of community schools is still undertheorized and empirically untested (Whalen, personal communication, July 19, 2006) ."}, {"section_title": "Education and Urban Society", "text": "A key element of our proposed model is that, not only can schooling promote positive behavior and outcomes, but ineffective schooling can promote negative outcomes, which in turn have broader community-level consequences. Several studies have established that school failure is strongly associated with delinquent behavior (see, e.g., Elliott, 1996; Jenkins, 1995; Joseph, 1996; Silberberg & Silberberg, 1971) . Based on her review of the literature and her own survey research, Janice Joseph (1996) concluded that, particularly among youth of lower socioeconomic status, failure in school can lead to a sense of alienation from the school, which in turn leads to delinquency.\nFurthermore, there is a wealth of evidence that low-income children perform poorly when they attend schools where most other students are also low-income and perform better in schools where there is a mix of incomes (see, e.g., Briggs, 2005; Coleman et al., 1966; Kahlenberg, 2001 Kahlenberg, , 2002 Piton Foundation, 2006; The Century Foundation, 2002; Thrupp, 1995; Varady et al., 2005) . Hoxby (2000) provided evidence of such peer effects and suggests these effects are primarily driven by the achievement level of other students, not necessarily their background characteristics.\nThis review of the literature demonstrates what many of us accept as common knowledge, that through skill building and socialization, schools can be an important investment in the well-being and future success of local youth. Whereas this first channel pertains to the value of schools for any neighborhood, including those with high socioeconomic diversity, we now turn to four other channels with particular relevance to mixed-income neighborhoods.\n\n\n\u2022 How to most effectively complement an investment in local schools with other strategies designed to attract middle-class families, by, for example, increasing public safety and enhancing local cultural and recreational activities? Concurrently, to prevent displacement, attention must be given to strategies to retain affordable housing of sufficient size and quality to accommodate families of more modest means.\nIf current trends continue, an increasing number of neighborhood-based efforts that include local school reform as a means of promoting economic integration will provide opportunities for important further research investigation into the role of schools as amenities and local resources, the nature of social interaction among students and parents in mixed-income schools, and the possibility for individual benefits and spillover effects with neighborhood-level impact."}, {"section_title": "Channel 2: Schools as Amenities Rationale and Theory", "text": "The second channel posits that high-quality public schools can serve as attractive amenities for current and potential residents, affecting neighborhoods in several ways (see Figure 3 ). Increased demand for the school may have two subsequent effects on the neighborhood population (with school-age children). First, it may help decrease out-migration as families choose to remain in the neighborhood in order for their children to attend the school. Second, it may increase the demand for local housing, as families seek to move into the neighborhood so that their children can attend the school. Depending heavily on factors in the neighborhood housing market, this in-migration and outmigration could increase and eventually help stabilize the neighborhood population, as well as increase and maintain the economic diversity of the neighborhood. The increased demand for local housing would also boost local real estate values and increase the demand for local services and other amenities, thus helping to strengthen the local economy.\nSeveral researchers considering ways to promote community revitalization have concluded that schools can be powerful marketing tools to attract or retain residents (see, e.g., Grogan & Proscio, 2000; Khadduri et al., 2003; Orfield, 1999; Turnham & Khadduri, 2004) . Grogan and Proscio (2000) discussed school improvement as a critical target that has eluded community development efforts:\nFor decades . . . [community development groups] could fix housing, revive shopping areas, raise the level of public services, even help reduce crime. But the schoolsprobably the biggest factor in families' decision about whether to remain or fleewere simply beyond the reach of the organized community. (p. 220)\nThe most fully developed theoretical and empirical case in the literature for the value of schools as an investment in neighborhood development pertains to their role as an amenity. The core theory operating here, given its classic articulation by Tiebout (1956) , is that individuals \"vote with their feet,\" making decisions about where to live by selecting among \"bundles\" of public goods offered by local municipalities. Schools are one such good amongst which households, specifically those with (or anticipating) schoolage children, select when deciding where to live. Varady and his colleagues (2005) emphasized the importance of highquality schools for attracting middle-income families into mixed-income Vale (2006) argued, a more careful investigation is needed of the extent to which schools are a factor in the decisions of higher-income families to move into mixed-income communities."}, {"section_title": "Channel 3: Schools as Forums for", "text": "Interpersonal Interaction"}, {"section_title": "Channel 4: Schools as Source of Common", "text": "Interests and Identity"}, {"section_title": "Channel 5: Schools as Institutional Resources", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Conclusion and Implications", "text": "Based on our review of the literature, we conclude that schools may indeed be uniquely positioned to play integral roles in the development and maintenance of successful mixed-income neighborhoods. Studies thus far have found very little interaction among residents of different income levels in mixed-income neighborhoods. The presence of families with children is widely held as a key to such interaction. To date, mixed-income developments, particularly in the United States, have failed to attract middle-class families with children. Highquality local public schools could serve not only as an attractive amenity to draw families with children to the neighborhood, but also as an unique forum for interaction and collective action, as well as an academic and institutional resource for local families.\nHowever, despite this theoretical promise, our review suggests that there are considerable barriers to schools playing this role and, furthermore, some potential for efforts on this strategy to produce the unintended effect of creating greater economic stratification in the neighborhood. The barriers include the difficulties of overcoming external perceptions among middleclass families about school quality and the likelihood that parents of differing socioeconomic backgrounds may engage in school activities and with school personnel differently and with differing agendas. Further, if the school is successful in recruiting affluent families to the neighborhood, their market power may increase housing costs, displacing low-income families from the neighborhood.\nOur own assessment of the conceptual model we proposed here is that available empirical evidence suggests that schools' most important roles may be as educational resources for local children, as amenities to increase demand for the neighborhood, and as institutional resources for the broader community. Evidence is less promising on the possibility of schools as social forums for relationship building and agenda setting, especially without the dedication of specific resources to promote this. Major voids in our knowledge base prevent complete assessment of the model at this time, including the association between individual school success or failure and neighborhood-level outcomes, the link between school quality and neighborhood composition and resident mobility, the existence of any natural social interaction across incomes among parents and the import of such interaction, the link between parental involvement at the school and collective action at the neighborhood-level, and the impact on neighborhoods of expanding schools' roles as community assets.\nA mixed-income neighborhood strategy, then, should include consideration of the following:\n\u2022 How to generate investments in the local schools that will make the schools more attractive to families with children of all income levels, including highquality classroom instruction, strong arts, foreign language, and music programs, supports for students in need of accelerated as well as remedial support, and an array of extracurricular programming? \u2022 How to market schools more effectively to middle-class families, making conventional indicators of quality such as test scores readily available as well as publicizing other indicators of the school's commitment to meeting the needs of students with a diverse range of backgrounds and abilities? \u2022 How to facilitate and nurture interactions among parents of different income levels within schools? Though this may occur naturally in some cases due to repeated interactions over time, in most instances it may require additional attention and activity to surmount natural inclinations to build social networks within one's own social group. It is not clear whether responsibility for this community building within the school belongs to school representatives, participants in the broader neighborhood development effort, or perhaps even parent leaders. Certainly, where schools elect to divide students into different tracks based on academic ability, the enduring racial and socioeconomic achievement gap (Ferguson, 2001; Ogbu, 2003) could create stratification within the school that makes the task of facilitating parent connections even more difficult.\n\u2022 How neighborhood-level actors can effectively and creatively engage local schools as collaborative partners and institutional resources? Evidence suggests that mixed-income efforts have thus far failed to fully incorporate the local schools and school system in the design and implementation of the neighborhood revitalization effort (Silverman et al., 2005; Varady et al., 2005) . Given that the primary inclination of schools will be to focus internally, it may require strong support and facilitation from neighborhood-level actors to encourage school leaders and personnel to also focus on the schools' broader neighborhood roles."}, {"section_title": "Notes", "text": "1. In this article we use the term mixed-income neighborhoods to imply that the conceptual frameworks and analysis here are relevant both to developments built and managed by a single entity as well as larger, more organic neighborhoods.\nClosely related to the question of economic diversity is the question of racial diversity, on which there is a substantial literature, particularly on the topic of schools. However, most of the scholarly and policy focus on mixed-income development focuses on integration by income not race and, in the interest of space, we focus on income and class in this article. The role of schools in neighborhood racial integration is an important topic to be pursued and incorporated into this discussion.\n2. It is important to keep in mind the likely reciprocal influence of the neighborhood and its residents on the school, as well as the myriad other individual, neighborhood, and macrosocial factors that may work in tandem with schools to promote successful neighborhoods. According to Khadduri et al. (2003) , the proponents of schools as a development tool propose that we should expect a synergistic effect between simultaneous school and neighborhood development, with concurrent development efforts creating a larger positive impact than either effort pursued in isolation.\n3. By neighborhood schools we mean something different from community schools, which refers to schools that are used as centers for multipurpose community activities (although a neighborhood school may indeed be a community school). We will discuss community schools later in the article.\n4. There is no consensus about what level of economic integration constitutes a mixedincome neighborhood. Obviously, all neighborhoods have some level of income diversity. The term is intended here to refer generally to neighborhoods with a broad representation of households across the socioeconomic spectrum, including a substantial proportion with incomes well below the area median income. See Galster (2005) and Turner and Fenderson (2006) for more technical definitions derived for their analyses of economic diversity in the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas using census data.\n5. For the purposes of this article, we assume that the starting point for the creation of a mixed-income community is either a predominantly low-income community that seeks to attract more affluent residents, or a formerly affluent community that is losing affluent residents and gaining lower-income residents. Given the absence of current real-world application, we do not consider the case of a stable affluent community that seeks to attract a critical mass of low-income households, even though conceptually this would be a conceivable route to a mixed-income community.\n6.
