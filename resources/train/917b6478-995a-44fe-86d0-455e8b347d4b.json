[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "A labor supply model is used to examine the relationship between farm ownership and operators' participation in the off-farm labor market for the Northeast region. The results indicate that ownership significantly influences operators' off-farm employment participation. In particular, part-owners significantly allocate labor services to off-farm activities. The results also show that the participation rate among part-owner operators is high partly because the availability of other income sources accelerates the process of acquiring assets to become full-owner operators.\nAmong the factors influencing the decisions of owners, and tenants) has been ignored in the litfarm operators to participate in off-farm work, erature. farm ownership has received little attention in the This study hypothesizes that farm ownership inliterature. 1 The failure is particularly salient be-fluences decisions regarding off-farm work particicause of the increasing importance of off-farm in-pation because operators in different categories are come to farm families (Ahearn, Johnson, and likely to have different objectives and face differStrickland 1985; Ahearn and Lee 1991).
