[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Malignant cutaneous granular cell tumors (mcGCTs) are rare and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The literature includes single-institution studies."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Granular cell tumors (malignant and nonmalignant) account for approximately 0.5% of all softtissue tumors and often present as asymptomatic, slow-growing, solitary lesions that can be multifocal. 1 They were first described by Abrikossof in 1926 and named myoblastoma because of their histopathologic appearance similar to that of skeletal muscle cells. 2 Ultrastructural analysis revealed schwannian features. For the past half century, they were considered rare neoplasms of neural origin. 3 Recent reports of nonneural granular cell tumors in the literature have introduced another distinctive entity that shows no obvious lines of differentiation and is not well characterized. [4] [5] [6] [7] The literature addressing the differences between the 2 subtypes is extremely limited. One study highlights the fact that nonneural granular cell tumors present in a younger age group and with sharper circumscription than do those of neural origin. 4 Additional differences in behavior and clinical features have not been well described. It has been suggested that these may not be distinct entities at all but rather a reflection of the heterogeneity of granular cell tumors. 5 Our understanding of the histopathologic nature of granular cell tumors is evolving.\nThis rare tumor is most often located in the dermis or subcutaneous tissues. 8 It is expected to become malignant in less than 2.0% of cases. 9 Local recurrence and metastasis of malignant granular cell tumors when they do occur, however, are thought to be common and associated with a poor prognosis. Malignant tumors have historically been reported to be more likely to develop in the lower extremity versus in the head and neck, which are sites more frequently associated with benign lesions of similar origin. 10, 11 The most common sites of metastasis in malignant granular cell cases are reported to include the regional lymph nodes, lungs, and bones. 10, 11 Although the literature includes a number of case series and reports about granular cell tumors as a whole, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] population-level data on malignant cutaneous lesions are limited. The largest study on cutaneous granular cell tumors that included malignant cases analyzed 34 patients with granular cell tumors; only 1 was malignant. 17 Clinical presentation and histopathologic analysis of malignant cases has been well profiled for small sample sizes. 11, 18, 19 However, the understanding of patient characteristics and treatment modalities is lacking owing to limited data. To that end, the goal of this study was to determine the incidence and survival of patients with all primary malignant cutaneous granular cell tumors (mcGTCs)dof both of neural and non-neural origindin a larger population. We used data from the population-based US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry to analyze patient and disease characteristics of patients with mcGTCs and to determine factors affecting both overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) after diagnosis."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "Data on patients with a diagnosis of mcGTC were obtained from the SEER program for the years 1973 to 2013. The database is a widely used cancer registry that covers an estimated 27.8% of the US population. Geographic regions covered include San Francisco-Oakland, metropolitan Detroit, Seattle (Puget Sound), metropolitan Atlanta, San JoseeMonterey, Los Angeles, greater California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, Utah, Kentucky, New Jersey, rural and greater Georgia, Kentucky, and Alaska. The SEER database contains no personal identifying information; therefore, this study was deemed exempt from full review by the Yale Human Investigation Committee.\nPatients were identified by using the histology code 9580 (malignant granular cell tumor) and primary site codes for the skin (C44.0-C44.9) or for subcutaneous, connective, and soft-tissue (C49.0-C49.9). OS was defined as the time in months from diagnosis to death from any cause; DSS was as the time from diagnosis to death specific to the cancer-related diagnosis. The SEER cause-specific death classification field was used for DSS, a variable that uses algorithms to process a single, disease-specific underlying cause of death from death certificates. Though there is a risk of misattribution, this is largely mitigated by the coding scheme for this variable which accounts for tumor sequence, site of original cancer diagnosis, and comorbidities. Therefore, our results should provide reliable estimates of death due to granular cell tumor malignancy"}, {"section_title": "CAPSULE SUMMARY d", "text": "Knowledge of the epidemiology of malignant cutaneous granular cell tumors is extremely limited. These results may facilitate identifying and managing high-risk patients and prioritizing surgical treatment.\nspecifically. Year of diagnosis, continuous age at diagnosis, sex, race, residency demographic, tumor extent and size, body site, treatment with surgery and/or radiation therapy, and OS and DSS in months were extracted from the database for analysis.\nRace was categorized as white or black; all other groups combined comprised less than 5.0% of the cohort. Residency demographics were defined by using US Department of Agriculture Rural-Urban Continuum codes. 20 The 9-level scale codes gradations of metropolitan areas (ie, population $20,000) (codes 1-3) and nonmetropolitan areas (ie, population \\20,000) (4-9 or Alaska and Hawaii), 21 thus allowing for the extraction of a dichotomous metro versus nonmetro variable.\nTumor (T) stage, lymph node involvement (N), and metastasis (M) were retroactively determined where possible by using extent of disease and collaborative stage staging codes for tumor size and location, number of positive lymph nodes, and metastatic flags, as well as lymph node and metastasis data. Stages were determined following the seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer soft-tissue tumor classification protocol. 22 As data quality made it impossible to distinguish between stage II and stage III lesions, the SEER staging criteria groupings were applied as follows: (1) Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Cell counts of fewer than 5 were redacted to protect patient confidentiality. The OS and DSS curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences were formally tested for univariate analyses using log-rank tests. A risk-adjusted multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the independent relationship of reported disease and patient characteristics with OS and DSS. Patient fields with missing data were recoded as empty cells to avoid inaccurate regressions on ordinal variables. Threshold for significance was based on a 2-sided P value of .05 or less. Significant univariate variables were included as covariates along with age, sex, and year. To quantify the degree of survival difference, risk-adjusted 50th percentile (median) quantile regression for DSS was used. All statistical analyses were conducted with SAS University Edition software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Statistically significant increased risk of secondary malignancies was determined by using the multiple primary standardized incidence ratio function in SEER*Stat.

Of the selected cohort, 65.0% were female and 70.8% were white. The mean age at diagnosis was 49.2 years. At presentation, 15.9% of tumors were metastatic (stage IV) and 17.1% demonstrated regional involvement (stage II/III). The most frequent body site of the lesion was the trunk (in 32.5% of the cohort). Surgery was performed in 85.0% of patients, and radiation therapy was given to 11.3% of patients. Patients in whom mcGTC has been diagnosed are at an increased risk (P\\.05) for subsequent diagnosis of either renal (93.03 per 10,000 person-years [PYs]) or pancreatic cancer (89.56 per 10,000 PYs) from 60 to 119 months thereafter compared with the general population. They were also at increased risk for pancreatic cancer (16.41 per 10,000 PYs) during their entire lifetime (Table I) . Patients developed either renal or pancreatic cancer but not both. The mean time to diagnosis of a second tumor was 113 months (Table I) .\nSurvival analysis from Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that the 5-year OS and DSS rates for mcGTCs were 63.3% and 62.8%, respectively. DSS for patients with a diagnosis of local (stage I) tumor was roughly 20 years; for diagnosis of a regional (stage II/III) tumor, DSS was less than 5 years, and for diagnosis of a distant (stage IV) tumor, it was less than 0.5 years (Table II) . The median OS and DSS were 11.6 years and 20.1 years, respectively (Fig 1) .\nBoth (Table III) . On risk-adjusted multivariable analysis, advanced age (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08; P\\.01), advanced stage (HR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.23-3.53; P\\.01), and lack of radiation therapy (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.09-0.79; P = .02) were found to be independent predictors of OS. Despite statistical significance, adverse mortality outcomes associated with receipt of radiation therapy are expected to be reflective of more advanced or disseminated disease versus any implicit harm to patients. Advanced age (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09; P\\.01), male sex (95% CI, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06-0.82; P = .02), advanced cancer stage (HR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.40-3.72; P\\.01), and receipt of surgical resection (HR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01-0.59; P = .02) independently predicted DSS (Table IV) . With risk adjustment for all other covariates, a patient's DSS (1) decreased by 0.68 years (95% CI, -0.22 to -0.02) for each additional year of life lived, (2) increased by 1.39 years because of male sex, (3) decreased by 0.60 years (95% CI, -2.15 to 0.00) for each advancing stage, and (4) increased by 5.34 years (95% CI, 3.39-28.52) through receipt of surgery (Supplemental Table I : available at http:// www.jaad.org)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Our findings support the previously reported high mortality associated with mcGTCs, 11, 18 with a 5-year DSS of 62.8%. This study also reveals a number of prognostic factors, of which the most important is J AM ACAD DERMATOL VOLUME 78, NUMBER 3 thought to be cancer staging. Although there is no clear staging scheme for these tumors, the stratification used here may be clinically useful for physicians in relaying a prognosis to patients with mcGTCs. The divisions introduced (ie, local, regional, and distant) are consistent with SEER classifications and, perhaps most importantly, are correlated with DSS in both univariate and multivariable models. The profound differences in median DSS time in yearsdfrom 21.5 and 3.6 for local and regional tumors, respectively, to 0.4 for distant tumorsdis striking and clinically applicable. Analyses in SEER*Stat of the multiple primary standardized incidence ratio also revealed an increased risk for subsequent pancreatic or renal cancers among these patients. Clinically, this finding is important in counseling patients on future risks and has implications for postdiagnosis screening and monitoring. Combined, fewer than 10 renal 24 and pancreatic 25-31 granular cell tumors have been reported in the literature. Though these cases may contribute to the increased incidence of renal and pancreatic cancers observed in patients with mcGTCs, the biologic underpinnings of any such relationship has not been explored. Furthermore, the cases described in this study were coded as true independent renal and pancreatic tumors rather than as metastases or second granular cell primaries. Future work may consider potential molecular and genetic causes of this increased risk.\nAn analysis of patient characteristics demonstrated demographic, race, and sex-based disparities that have not yet been reported in the literature. These disparities have been demonstrated for a number of other cutaneous malignancies, including but not limited to melanoma, 32 dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, 33 and Merkel cell carcinoma, 34 Univariate models demonstrated poorer outcomes for OS among patients who resided in nonmetro areas and those who were black. Sex differences in DSS in adjusted models were statistically significant, with females suffering worse outcomes; comparatively, their male counterparts lived 1.39 years longer with adjustment for all other covariates for DSS. Females accounted for the majority of cases, representing 65.0% of this cohort. Importantly, female sex has been found to be related to a prediction of malignancy for intramuscular granular cell tumors, 35 suggesting a biologic cause of our findings.\nContrary to the current understanding, [35] [36] [37] [38] our results indicate that radiation therapydadjuvant or otherwisedis not associated with improvements in OS or DSS according to our risk-adjusted models. It is important to note that the finding that lack of radiation therapy is associated with improved riskadjusted OS is likely to be due to an underlying clinically derived selection bias among patients who undergo radiation. They are more likely to include those who are too sick to tolerate surgery or present with more advanced disease that is not amenable to surgical resection. Overall, radiation and nonsurgical therapy does not correlate with improved survival in patients with mcGTCs. However, the multivariable analyses revealed that surgical management of disease improves DSS by 5.34 years (3.39-28.52). Supported by our findings, surgical resection with wide local excision has been repeatedly reported as the standard of care. [39] [40] [41] Category in parentheses defines the strata the hazard ratio represents. CI, Confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio. *Residency demographic and body site were included because of their significance on univariate analysis. Inclusion in the risk-adjusted model resulted in insufficient power to make the individual categorical HRs meaningful.\nThere are limitations in this study design. There is a potential for absent or incorrect reporting in retrospective data, variations in coding practices over time, migration of patients in and out of SEER registry areas, and varied reports on the representativeness of the database itself (ie, not all hospitals participate, and those that do are more likely to be large academic centers [42] [43] [44] ). Despite these limitations, the use of SEER data to consider determinants of rare cutaneous malignancies has been validated in the literature. 33, [45] [46] [47] Given the rare nature of the tumor, limited sample size means that significant results are likely to be even more pronounced. The geographic and socioeconomic diversity of the SEER registries make our findings likely to be generalizable across care settings and patient populations in the United States."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Herein, we have reported on the characteristic epidemiology of mcGTCs by using available population-level data. Determinants of survival include age at diagnosis, sex, stage, and surgical resection, and there are apparent demographic, race, and sex-based disparities in survival. Patients in this population also are at an increased risk for pancreatic or renal cancers. These data underlie the importance of early diagnosis and surgical treatment of mcGTCs for optimal outcomes and outline characteristics that may be used to inform future guidelines to identify and manage high-risk patients."}]
