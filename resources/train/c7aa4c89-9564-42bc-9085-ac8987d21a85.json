Although the well-being of the population as a whole has risen sharply, the average economic standing of country's nearly 114 million ethnic minorities has improved relatively less than that of the Han majority \u00f0Gustafsson and Li 2003; Gustafsson and Sai 2009a , 2009b\u00de. Between 1988 and 1995 Hannum et al. 2008; Hannum and Wang 2012\u00de . Analyzing midcensus survey data from 2005, Hannum and Wang \u00f02012\u00de find that-among 16-21-year-olds-minorities were nearly one-third as likely as Han to have attained 9 years of compulsory schooling. Minorities are also significantly less likely to enroll at the tertiary level. In a 2008 census of entering freshman at four tier 1 universities in western China, only 4% were non-Han, while minorities comprise approximately 11% of the population cohort \u00f0Wang et al. 2013\u00de . The same survey shows female minority students to be at a particular disadvantage in college admissions: in this entering class, female minority students were only 25% of their population share.\nIf the Han-minority differences in educational attainment persist, the relative well-being of minority populations is likely to continue to fall as China's economy increasingly demands a higher-quality workforce. Tightening demographics and a nearly complete transition into off-farm labor in China \u00f0more than 80% of 16-30-year-olds are now employed off farm\u00de are driving up wages for unskilled labor at close to 10% per year \u00f0Park, Cai, and Du 2010; Zhang et al. 2013\u00de . As unskilled wages rise and low-paying basic manufacturing jobs are replaced with jobs involving more sophisticated tasks, China's economy will increasingly demand a high-quality, educated workforce \u00f0Zhang et al. 2013\u00de. Educationally disadvantaged minorities will find it more difficult to participate in this new labor market and benefit from the higher wages that will come with it.\nIn the context of rural China, poor academic performance in school may play a significant role in reducing educational attainment or years of schooling \u00f0Yi et al. 2012\u00de . In competitive educational systems-such as China's-lower expectations of poorly performing students to thrive in the system may discourage continued enrollment \u00f0Chuang 1997; Clarke, Haney, and Madaus 2000; Reardon and Galindo 2002; Rumberger and Lim 2008\u00de . Heavy emphasis on testing may further lead teachers to direct more attention to higherperforming children and even lead schools to push at-risk students out in an effort to raise overall test scores \u00f0Vickers 1994; V\u00e9lez and Saenz 2001; Fortin et al. 2006\u00de . These influences are compounded by rising unskilled wages, which drive up the opportunity costs of schooling \u00f0Angrist and Lavy 2009; Fiszbein, Schady, and Ferreira 2009\u00de . Indeed, the available evidence highlights the correlation between poor performance and dropout among poor students in western China \u00f0Yi et al. 2012\u00de. Thus, if minority students perform worse than their Han peers, they are likely to attain fewer years of schooling as they forgo school and opt to enter the labor force in unskilled jobs.\nDespite the implications of an achievement gap between Han and minority students, no study that we know of has compared their achievement \u00f0either grades or test scores\u00de. Likewise, we find almost no research on the how the determinants of achievement may vary between the two groups. Existing empirical work on the disparity between Han and minority educational outcomes has focused on attainment. Hannum \u00f02002\u00de, for example, using a 1992 national survey of children in China, finds large differences in enrollment between Han and minority children of primary school age, with enrollment rates lowest among minorities in western China. She concludes that much of this difference is attributable to geographic composition and family background. Research like this, however, is focused on attainment and, presumably due to the absence of data, has not examined achievement.\nThe overall goal of this article is to document and analyze the achievement gap between Han and minority students in rural China. To meet this goal we have two specific objectives. First, we estimate the overall achievement gap \u00f0henceforth, the \"Han-minority achievement gap\"\u00de. We also measure two other subgaps: the gap between Han and minority students that speak Mandarin as a first language and the gap between Han and minority student that speak Mandarin as a second language. Second, we assess what factors contribute most to these achievement gaps. To do this, we first decompose the achievement gap into two parts: one part representing the portion of the gap due Han-minority differences in endowments of student, household, peer, teacher, and school characteristics and a second part due to differences in returns to these char-acteristics. We then asses what effect specific schools have on the Han-minority achievement gap and what types of schools narrow or widen this gap. That is, we analyze how returns to attending specific schools \u00f0school fixed effects\u00de differ between Han and minority students and what school characteristics are most strongly associated with these Han-minority differences in returns to specific schools.\nTo achieve these objectives, we draw on a large-scale survey of schools sampled from across rural Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces covering nearly 21,000 students, approximately 13% of whom are minorities. We measure achievement of Han and minority students using curriculum-based standardized exams in math and Chinese given as part of the survey. To assess factors that contribute to the Han-minority achievement gap, we use detailed information on students, households, teachers, and schools and apply decomposition methods pioneered by Oaxaca \u00f01973\u00de and Blinder \u00f01973\u00de. OaxacaBlinder type decomposition, originally used to analyze wage differences between groups, has now been applied in a wide variety of contexts. In education, previous research has used this approach to analyze differences in academic achievement across countries \u00f0e.g., Our analysis yields three primary findings. First, we find that minority students in our sample score significantly below Han students on standardized exams in math and Chinese. The Han-minority achievement gap is nearly 0.3 standard deviations \u00f0SD\u00de in math and more than 0.2 SD in Chinese. Among minorities in our sample whose primary language is not standard Mandarin \u00f0Salar and Tibetan-henceforth, \"Non-Mandarin minorities\"\u00de, the achievement gap is even more striking: these students score 0.62 SD lower than Han in math and 0.65 SD lower than Han in Chinese.\nSecond, our decomposition analysis suggests that the Han-minority achievement gap for Mandarin-speaking minority students \u00f0Hui and Tuhenceforth, \"Mandarin minorities\"\u00de is almost fully explained by differences in student, peer, teacher, and school characteristics. Of these, the largest contributor is student and family background. Differences in school quality play a relatively small role. Endowments, however, explain very little of the achievement gap between Han students and non-Mandarin minorities.\nThird, we find that-in \"mixed\" schools with both Han and minority students-the effects of individual schools play a role in widening the Hanminority achievement gap. In these mixed schools, returns to Han students of \u00f0observed and unobserved\u00de specific school attributes are higher than those for similar minority students attending the same school. Teachers appear to play a central role in affecting the relative returns of Han and minority students.\nThe rest of this article is organized as follows. Section II reviews the background of minorities in China. Sections III and IV describe the survey and data that we use for the analysis. Sections V and VI discuss the empirical approach and results. The final section concludes and discusses the policy implications of our findings."}, {"section_title": "II. Background: The Education of Minorities in China", "text": "In addition to the Han majority, there are 55 officially recognized minority nationalities in China. According to the 2010 census, minorities comprised 8.5% of the total national population, approximately 114 million people \u00f0Cherng, Hannum, and Lu 2012\u00de. Geographically, minorities in China are concentrated in relatively poor regions of western China: 71.6% of the minority population lives in western provinces, and 91.6% of ethnic autonomous counties are located in western China. Approximately 40% of these autonomous counties are nationally designated poverty counties \u00f0Hannum and Wang 2012\u00de.\nBeyond geographically targeted antipoverty funds \u00f0from which minorities disproportionately benefit due to concentration in poor areas; Park, Wang, and Wu 2002\u00de, a number of policies and programs have aimed to expand access to education among minority groups. For example, the 1980 Law on Regional and Ethnic Autonomy recommended subsidization of education in minority areas beyond standard educational funding \u00f0Cherng et al. 2012\u00de. More recently, as part of the Tenth 5-Year Plan \u00f02001-5\u00de, the central government invested approximately \u00a534.2 billion for boarding schools and ethnic universities in western China and minority areas \u00f0Cherng et al. 2012\u00de. A number of affirmative action policies have also been implemented in higher education, such as university admissions spots reserved for minority students and acceptance of minority students with lower entrance exam scores \u00f0Hannum and Wang 2012\u00de.\nAlthough certain policies have been designed to improve educational attainment among minorities, the structure of education for minority groups is largely similar to the rest of the country \u00f0Cherng et al. 2012\u00de. Curriculum and assessment are generally the same for minority and Han students \u00f0Cherng et al. 2012\u00de. One exception is the language of instruction. While official policy regarding language of instruction emphasizes the use of Mandarin, schools with more than 50% minority students who speak a local language are permitted to use the local language \u00f0Cherng et al. 2012\u00de. In practice, however, there are significant challenges to bilingual instruction. For example, some minority groups with their own language do not have a written language. In addition, there seldom are financial resources available to develop a local language curriculum. Schools also are often integrated with students attending class with Han students or students belonging to other minority groups \u00f0Hannum and Wang 2012\u00de. In our survey of schools in northwest China \u00f0described in the next section\u00de, only 5% have no Han students. No schools provide instruction or teaching material in minority languages."}, {"section_title": "III. Survey Design", "text": "The data used in this study come from a survey of 300 schools in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces in western China during the 2011/2012 academic year. Schools were sampled as follows. We first obtained a list of all schools in the following regions: Haidong \u00f0in Qinghai\u00de, Longnan, Dingxi, Tianshui \u00f0in Gansu\u00de, and Ankang \u00f0in Shaanxi\u00de. A map of these regions is provided in figure 1 . In total, 26 counties were included in the sampling frame. Within each township located in these five regions, one school was selected from among all schools with 150-300 students as reported by the local education ministry. The survey is thus roughly representative of primary schools in these regions of northwestern China. Due to the survey's geographical coverage, our sample includes both completely Han \u00f037%\u00de and completely minority schools \u00f05%\u00de. A significant number of schools \u00f058%\u00de are mixed Han and minority schools. We focus most of the study on the full sample but, in some parts of the analysis, restrict the sample to mixed schools only.\n1 In the analysis, we define \"mixed\" schools as schools with at least two minority and two Han students. By restricting the analysis to mixed schools, we are better able to pick up differences between Han and minority students not confounded by differences in location; however, limiting the sample both limits variation in the data \u00f0leading to less precise parameter estimates\u00de and reduces representativeness.\nWithin each school, we collected information on all fourth and fifth graders \u00f0more than 21,000 students in total\u00de. A survey questionnaire administered to students collected detailed information on students and their families. Table 1 lists all additional variables that we use in our analysis and provides descriptions of each. All of these variables were asked or measured at the beginning of the school year.\nAs our measure of academic achievement, we use student scores on standardized exams in math and Chinese administered by the survey team at the end of the school year. Within each classroom, half of the students were randomly assigned to take a math exam, and the rest took a Chinese exam. To ensure coherence with the national curriculum, the tests were developed with assistance from local department/bureaus of education. Questions used in the math exam were drawn from the question bank of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, an international assessment of mathematics and science knowledge of primary and lower-secondary school students. Questions used in the Chinese exam were taken from national fourth or fifth grade textbooks. To minimize cheating, two versions of each exam \u00f0with reordered questions\u00de were randomly assigned to students. The exam also was proctored closely by the enumerators. For analysis, scores for both subject tests are normalized by the distribution of scores in each grade. Exams were given in Mandarin, just like year-end tests usually given in the schools in our sample.\nIV. Characteristics of Students, Peers, Teachers, and Schools A. Minority Status We solicited minority status directly from students as part of the survey. Out of the full sample, 12.5% of students identified themselves as belonging to a For comparison, table 2 also gives the ethnic composition of 10-year-olds for the counties in our sample from the 2010 national census. The composition found in the school survey largely mirrors census data. Our survey covers a slightly larger proportion of minorities overall \u00f00.8% more\u00de and a slightly larger proportion of Tu and Salar and smaller proportion of Hui and Tibetans. Note that some difference is to be expected given time trends and that the school survey covers a wider age range."}, {"section_title": "B. The Achievement Gap", "text": "According to our data, there is a significant achievement gap between Han and minority students \u00f0fig. 2\u00de. Leftmost bars show the mean standardized exam scores in math \u00f0dark gray\u00de and Chinese \u00f0light gray\u00de for Han students; the next pair of bars shows mean scores for all minority students; and the remaining bars show mean scores by minority group. The gap between all minority students \u00f0all ethnic groups pooled together\u00de and Han students is substantial: 0.29 SD in math and 0.25 SD in Chinese.\nThe data also show a striking amount of heterogeneity in exam scores among individual minority groups. For example, students from the Tu minority perform comparably to Han students. In contrast, the scores of Salar students are nearly 0.75 SD below those of the Han students. Importantly, figure 2 suggests that language may be a factor contributing to China's Hanminority achievement gap. The students from the two minority groups that typically speak non-Mandarin languages \u00f0Salar and Tibetan\u00de perform much worse than Han students. At the same time, the achievement gap between students from the two minority groups that generally speak Mandarin as their primary language \u00f0Tu and Hui\u00de and Han students is much narrower. Given substantial differences between the achievement of Mandarin-speaking and non-Mandarin-speaking minority students, we analyze these two minority groups separately in addition to analyzing the pooled sample of all minority students."}, {"section_title": "C. Endowments of Background Characteristics", "text": "The statistics in table 3 highlight some significant differences between Han and minority students in terms of student and household characteristics. First, minority students from both categories are significantly older than Han stu- Standardized exam results by ethnic group. Uses all observations in the data set. \"Other minority\" group excluded from graph due to small sample size. Error bars give 95% confidence intervals constructed using 500 bootstrap replications accounting for clustering at the school level.\ndents by around 0.2-0.3 years \u00f0table 3\u00de. In our sample, Han students were more likely to have repeated a grade compared to all minority groups; thus, this age difference likely reflects longer delays in primary school enrollment on the part of minorities. 3 Available evidence from other countries suggests that delayed enrollment may have a positive influence on academic achievement \u00f0Glewwe, Jacoby, and King 2001; McEwan and Shapiro 2008\u00de; however, delayed enrollment may be due to malnutrition in early childhood \u00f0Glewwe and Jacoby 1995; Glewwe et al. 2001\u00de . Second, minority students live in significantly larger households, likely a reflection of differential treatment under family planning policies. Given evidence that there is a strong qualityquantity trade-off in rural China, having more siblings may disadvantage minority students \u00f0Li, Zhang, and Zhu 2008\u00de. The third significant difference between Han and minority students in our sample is that parents of minority children are significantly less educated themselves. Numerous studies from a variety of contexts have shown evidence that parental education-particularly the mother's-has a causal influence on the academic achievement of children. Interestingly the one area in which minority students appear to be unambiguously better off is in terms of household asset ownership \u00f0although this could reflect cheaper prices in regions where minorities are likely to live\u00de. Table 3 also shows differences in class peer characteristics. Minorities attend classes with peers whose mothers are significantly less educated but whose families possess more durable household assets compared to Han students. They also attend classes with a significantly smaller proportion of peers of the same ethnicity as their own. To examine the distribution of Han and minority students across schools in more detail, figure 3 plots kernel density estimates of this variable. These plots clearly show that Han students are much more concentrated in ethnically homogenous schools than are minority students. Nearly 33% of minority students are in the ethnic minority of their class, while this figure is only 1% for Han students.\nA priori it is unclear what affect peer ethnic composition may have on student achievement for minority and Han students. Minorities \u00f0and their minority peers\u00de are of generally lower socioeconomic status; however, there may be advantages to attending school with peers of the same ethnicity. Beyond theories related to social identity \u00f0Akerlof and Kranton 2002\u00de, nonMandarin minority students may benefit from classes in which teachers are more likely to teach \u00f0entirely or partly\u00de in the local language. 4 3 In our sample, 39.5% of Han students repeated a grade. This is significantly more likely than for Hui \u00f07 percentage points, p 5 .04\u00de and Tu \u00f011 percentage points, p 5 .01\u00de students. 4 In our sample, no teachers report doing so. In terms of teacher and school quality \u00f0table 3\u00de, minorities appear to be, if anything, better off than their Han counterparts. For example, teachers of minority students are significantly more likely to have a higher education degree and to have attended a specialized teaching college. Schools attended by Han and minority students are similar in terms of size, student-teacher ratio, remoteness, and infrastructure \u00f0although minority schools are slightly less likely to have provided teacher training in the past year\u00de. This may be a result of significant government educational investment focused on minority areas. Characteristics of students in mixed Han and minority schools \u00f0with at least two Han and two minority students\u00de are given in the appendix \u00f0ta-ble A1\u00de. We construct mixed school samples for both types of minority students. Mixed Mandarin minority schools have at least two Mandarin minority students, and mixed non-Mandarin minority schools have at least two nonMandarin minority students. For the most part, mean differences in characteristics between Han and minority students attending the same schools are less significant than the full sample, as would be expected."}, {"section_title": "V. Returns to Minority Status", "text": "We take a first look at the relationship between the achievement gap and observed characteristics directly by estimating how the Han-minority achieve- ment gap changes as we adjust for characteristics collected as part of our survey. That is, we estimate variants of the following regression\nwhere Y is is the normalized test score of student i in schools; Mandarin Minority is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the student is Hui or Tu; Non _ Mandarin Minority is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the student is Tibetan or Salar; X 0 is a vector of student and household, peer, teacher, and school characteristics; and \u03b5 is is an error term possibly correlated at the school level. The coefficients of interest are b 1 and b 2 . How these two coefficients change as we add characteristics to the X 0 vector from the error term provides a first look at the ability of these characteristics to account for differences in achievement between Han students and Mandarin and non-Mandarin minority students.\nThe results of this analysis for standardized math scores are shown in table 4 . 5 The raw mean differences are 20.17 SD for Mandarin minority students and 20.62 SD for non-Mandarin minority students \u00f0col. 1\u00de. Controlling for student and household characteristics reduces the size of these estimates to 20.12 and 20.51 SD, respectively \u00f0col. 2\u00de. Sequentially adding peer, teacher, and school characteristics \u00f0cols. 3-5\u00de shows that once student and peer characteristics are controlled for, the Mandarin minority coefficient decreases in size and becomes insignificant. The coefficient on non-Mandarin minorities remains large \u00f020.2 SD\u00de and significant even after controlling for school fixed effects \u00f0col. 6\u00de. In other words, Mandarin minority students score an average of 0.2 SD less than Han students with similar individual, peer, and teacher characteristics in the same schools. Adding school fixed effects \u00f0i.e., controlling for all observed and unobserved school-level characteristics\u00de does reduce the estimated gap for this group by more than half, which suggests that-despite detailed controls-unobserved school-level heterogeneity is an important factor."}, {"section_title": "VI. Decomposing the Han-Minority Achievement Gap", "text": "To decompose the Han-minority achievement gap, we first estimate educational productions functions, or achievement regressions, that quantify returns to individual, family, teacher, and school-level characteristics for each of our student classifications \u00f0Han, Mandarin minority, and non-Mandarin minority\u00de. We then use the traditional Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method \u00f0Blinder 1973; Oaxaca 1973\u00de to decompose the achievement gap-between Han students and both types of minority students. We decompose the gap into two components. First, there is a component that can be explained by differences in student, peer, teacher, and school characteristics. In the rest of the analysis, we refer to this component as that due to \"differences in characteristics.\" The second component is due to between-group differences in returns to characteristics.\nThe achievement regressions that we use in the decomposition are based on the following linearized specification of the educational production function:\nwhere, as above, Y is is the observed test score of student i in schools, I is is a vector of individual student and household variables, P is is a vector of peer group variables, T is is a vector of teacher characteristics, S is is a vector of school variables, and \u03b5 is is an error term. The error term is allowed to be correlated at the school level to account for clustering effects. In some specifications, we substitute S is for school fixed effects \u00f0g s \u00de to control for unobserved heterogeneity at the school level.\nThe Han-minority achievement gap \u00f0difference in test scores\u00de can be expressed as are the mean characteristics of Han and minority students \u00f0I is , P is , T is , and S is \u00de; and b H and b M are the returns to characteristics for Han and minority students estimated using equation \u00f02\u00de above. Note that, because individual school fixed effects cannot be estimated for minority \u00f0Han\u00de students in schools where no minority \u00f0Han\u00de students attend, we restrict the sample to only mixed schools with at least two Han and two minority students in analysis that includes school fixed effects.\nThe overall difference in exam scores can, therefore, be decomposed into two components. One is the portion attributable to differences in the quantity of characteristics, evaluated using Han returns:\nis that attributable to differences in returns to the characteristics of Han and minority students. Table 5 reports the results of separate math achievement regressions for Han students, Mandarin minority students, and non-Mandarin minority students. 6 The odd-numbered columns in the table include all characteristics in table 3; even-numbered columns substitute school characteristics for school fixed effects. The coefficients from these regressions \u00f0which are the measured achievement returns to the characteristics\u00de are used in the Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions below."}, {"section_title": "A. Returns to Characteristics by Ethnic Group", "text": "A few insights emerge from comparing the estimated returns to inputs across groups. First, the pattern of returns for Han and Mandarin minority students are similar \u00f0comparing the coefficients in table 5 cols. 1 and 2 for the Han students with the coefficients in cols. 3 and 4 for the Mandarin minority students\u00de. While some coefficient estimates for Mandarin minorities are not significant, point estimates largely coincide. One exception is the coefficient on age: after controlling for school-level fixed effects, it appears that Mandarin-speaking minority students benefit from delayed school enrollment.\nBut, some estimated returns for non-Mandarin minority students differ from the other two groups. For example, non-Mandarin students appear to be strongly and negatively affected by a larger proportion of classmates of the same ethnicity \u00f0cols. 5 and 6\u00de. The differences in estimated returns to class peer ethnic composition are highlighted in figure 4. While both Han students and Mandarin minority students benefit slightly from being in classes with more students of their same ethnicity, there is a negative correlation among non-Mandarin minority students even after controlling for fixed school-level factors. In other words, having more class peers of a students' same ethnicity has a large, negative relationship with achievement of non-Mandarin minority students. Given the large degree of underperformance of students from the nonMandarin minority group, this correlation may be in part due to the effect of having lower-achieving peers. Non-Mandarin-speaking students also appear to be strongly influenced by the quality of teaching. Both the coefficient on having a teacher who has received a teaching award \u00f0cols. 3 and 6\u00de and the coefficient on the school having provided teacher training are large and significant for this group but not in others. Table 6 repeats these regressions for the sample of mixed schools. 7 Compared to the full sample, estimated returns are much more similar for Han and minority students \u00f0of both types\u00de attending the same schools. This suggests that the large differences in returns observed in the full sample are largely due to differences between Han students in Han-only schools and minorities in minority-only schools."}, {"section_title": "B. Returns to Schools by Ethnic Group", "text": "While estimated returns to observed school characteristics are similar for Han and minority students, there may still be differences in estimated school fixed effects for Han and minority students. That is, returns to specific schools \u00f0accounting for observed and unobserved characteristics\u00de may differ between Han and minority students. To examine this in more detail, we estimate the school fixed effect version of equation \u00f02\u00de for Han and minority students separately, using the sample of mixed schools with at least two Han students and two minority students:\nwhere X includes the same student, peer, and teacher characteristics as above, and g s is a vector of school dummy variables. We interpret the estimated school fixed effects for Han students \u00f0\u011d H s \u00de and minority students \u00f0\u011d M s \u00de as the return of attending a specific school for Han and minority students, respectively, relative to a reference school \u00f0the school whose dummy variable is omitted from the regressions\u00de. 9 We estimate that, on average, school fixed effects estimated for Han students are 0.3 SD higher in math and 0.39 SD higher in Chinese compared to those for minority students. Both of these differences are significant at 1%. To compare the effects of a specific school on Han and minority students directly, figure 5 plots the school coefficients for Han \u00f0\u011d H s \u00de against those estimated for minority students \u00f0\u011d M s \u00de. Figure 5A does this for math scores, and 5B for Chinese scores. In these figures, the majority of schools \u00f063% of schools for math and 72% for Chinese\u00de lie below the 45\u00b0line \u00f0where\u011d H s and g M s are equal\u00de. Individual schools tend to generate larger returns for Han compared to similar minority students attending the same school. In other words, the benefits that Han students receive from \u00f0observed and unobserved\u00de attributes of individual schools tend to be larger than the benefits received by minority students.\nWhat types of schools have larger differences in their effect on Han and minority students? We examine school-level differences in Han and minority effects by estimating the following regression:\nwhere X s is a vector of school-level characteristics and \u03b5 s is an error term. Here, the X s vector includes the same teacher characteristics \u00f0aggregated to the school level\u00de and school characteristics as above, as well as the proportion of students belonging to a Mandarin minority group and the proportion belonging to a non-Mandarin minority group. We use White-Huber standard errors to account for heteroskedasticity. The results of this analysis are in table 7. In the full models for math and Chinese, observed covariates explain more than 25% of the variation of the difference between the return of school characteristics to Han students and to minority students. Focusing on the results for math, it appears that teachers play the most significant role in reducing the Han-minority difference in returns. Coefficients on variables related to teachers' education and experience are negative and highly significant. Assuming that these variables \u00f0having a higher education degree, attending a normal college, and teaching experience\u00de reflect teaching quality, these results suggest that pedagogical practice in the classroom highly influences how much Han and minority students benefit from specific schools.

Estimated subtotals for each category of included characteristic \u00f0student and household characteristics, peer characteristics, teacher characteristics, and school characteristics or fixed effects\u00de add up to row 2. The penultimate row gives the portion of the gap due to differences in returns to characteristics. The first key result of the decomposition analysis is that, for both groups, differences in student and household endowments are the largest explained contributor to the Han-minority achievement gap \u00f0first row\u00de. For Mandarin minorities, differences in these variables account for 29.4% of the gap in math. Likewise, for non-Mandarin minority students these variables explain 16.1% of the math gap-more than any of the other explained components.\nThe second key finding is that a much larger portion of the gap can be explained for Mandarin minority students compared to non-Mandarin minority students. We estimate that differences in endowments explain 88% of the math gap for Mandarin minority students while only explaining 29% of the gap for non-Mandarin minority students \u00f0cols. 2 and 3, second row\u00de.\nA third key finding is that the gap between Han and Mandarin minority students disappears when we restrict the sample to schools with both Han and minority students but remains large for non-Mandarin minority students \u00f0cols. 4-9\u00de. The achievement gap between Han and Mandarin minority students is thus nearly entirely due to the high performance of Han students in schools without minority students. The math gap for non-Mandarin minority students \u00f0cols. 6 and 9\u00de is reduced by 0.38 SD \u00f061%\u00de yet remains large with nonMandarin minority students scoring 0.24 SD below their Han counterparts. This gap is fully due to differences in returns to characteristics. Results change little when we substitute school characteristics for school fixed effects.\nFollowing this set of findings, the decomposition analysis implies that differences in characteristics are unable to explain 0.44 SD \u00f071%\u00de of the gap in math 11 between Han students and non-Mandarin minority students in the full sample and none of the gap after restricting the sample to mixed schools only. This unexplained gap has several possible interpretations. First, it may indicate that some inputs that are important determinants of learning for these students are omitted. However, it is likely that the influence of these is limited given the large portion of the gap explained between Han and Mandarin minority students.\nAnother explanation is that, even when given similar educational resources \u00f0or inputs\u00de, non-Mandarin minority students benefit less from these inputs. This could be due to these students facing a different schooling environment, even when in the same class as Han students. For example, lower teacher expectations could lead them to focus instruction on Han who they believe may benefit more from their instruction \u00f0cf. McEwan and Trowbridge 2007\u00de. This could also be due to students having difficulty comprehending instruction in Mandarin. Even though instruction in local ethnic languages is permitted in China, this is often difficult in practice \u00f0Cherng et al. 2012\u00de. For example, instruction in Salar and Tibetan languages is not feasible when these students attend school with students of other ethnicities, a common occurrence in our sample."}, {"section_title": "VII. Summary and Conclusions", "text": "The goal of this article was to document and explain the gap in educational achievement between Han and minority students in primary schools in western China. In our survey of 300 schools in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces \u00f0involving nearly 21,000 fourth-and fifth-grade students\u00de, we find large differences in achievement on standardized exams between Han and minority students. On average, minority students perform 0.25 SD lower in math and 0.22 SD lower in Chinese. Most strikingly, minority students who do not generally speak Mandarin as their primary language score 0.62 SD lower than Han in math and 0.65 SD lower than Han in Chinese.\nUsing decomposition methods pioneered by Oaxaca \u00f01973\u00de and Blinder \u00f01973\u00de, we find that most of the achievement gap between Han and minority students with no alternative ethnic language can be explained by differences in endowments of student, family, and school characteristics. Of these, differences in students and family characteristics appear to contribute the most to differences in achievement. Little of the gap between Han students and non-Mandarin minority students \u00f0Salar and Tibetan in our sample\u00de, however, can be explained by endowment differences. Comparing these students only to Han students in the same schools significantly reduces the size of the achievement gap, yet a difference of more than 0.2 SD persists. None of this remaining gap is explained by differences in endowments. Although several explanations are possible, we believe that a likely explanation is that the ability of students to learn may be hindered by difficulty comprehending instruction in Mandarin \u00f0given that no schools in our sample provided instruction or texts in minority languages\u00de. While we cannot say with certainty why these students may benefit less from a given amount of schooling inputs, our analysis suggests that teachers play a significant role.\nWhile we believe that the findings of this article are important, admittedly, the study has a number of limitations. First, although our sample contains sufficient numbers of minority students to conduct analyses, studies involving a larger sample of minority students \u00f0particularly non-Mandarin minority students\u00de would provide further insight into the achievement gap. Second, our survey did not collect information on the Mandarin ability of individual students \u00f0although we tested students on the Chinese curriculum, this may be distinct from pure language ability\u00de. Future studies should employ such information to assess to what degree language is contributing to the underperformance of students belonging to groups that do not speak Mandarin as their primary language.\nDespite these limitations, however, our results call for the attention of policy makers to approaches to address the underperformance of minority students in China's rural areas. Given the large and increasing importance of educational attainment to economic well-being, addressing the large achievement gap between Han and minority students may help to mitigate economic disparities in the future. On the basis of our results, promising approaches to address the achievement gap would include those focused on improving the returns to minority students of given schooling inputs \u00f0e.g., through pedagogical practice\u00de. Further, if future studies show language to contribute significantly to the gap, interventions such as remedial tutoring in Mandarin may also yield large benefits. "}]
