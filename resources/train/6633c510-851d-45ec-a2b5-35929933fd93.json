Numerous studies investigated the performance of these biomarkers for prediction of Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Many of them investigated one of these biomarkers separately [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] or focused on finding the best multivariable model. Most of the latter studies considered only a preselected combination of biomarkers and/or did not include neuropsychological test performance in their multivariable model [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Furthermore, previous studies often focused on finding the best multivariable model with respect to prediction accuracy, assuming that all variables are available in all patients. This is the case in prospective MCI trials such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In clinical routine, it reflects reality only at some academic sites with strong scientific focus on biomarkers for AD diagnosis, but it does not reflect reality in the majority of memory clinics. Most memory clinics have implemented a step-bystep approach of the diagnostic workup in patients with suspicion of AD, that is, patients are referred to additional diagnostic procedures depending on the results of the preceding procedures. The step-by-step diagnostic workup stops when the etiological diagnosis is sufficiently certain. In particular, expensive procedures such as PET are considered only at the very end of the diagnostic workup when all other procedures have been inconclusive so that the etiological diagnosis is still largely uncertain. Knowledge of the incremental benefit of performing an additional diagnostic procedure depending on the results of the diagnostic procedures performed so far might support clinicians in optimizing this diagnostic stepby-step workflow in individual patients. The primary aim of the present study, therefore, was to evaluate the incremental benefit of image-based and CSF biomarkers according to the typical order in which they are collected in routine clinical patient care. The model started with cognitive performance, because objective characterization of cognitive performance in general is the first diagnostic step in patients with impaired cognition and suspicion of AD. The modified Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Score with 13 items (ADAS-13) [15] and the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) [16] were evaluated as cognition scores with which to start.\nStructural MRI is also part of the basic diagnostics in patients with suspicion of AD in order to exclude other causes of cognitive impairment such as cerebrovascular disease or brain tumor. Thus, MRI-based hippocampus volume can be easily made available in the majority of patients in clinical routine without large additional costs. This was the rationale to include MRI-based hippocampus volume as a neurodegeneration marker next after cognitive performance.\nThe brain amyloidosis marker A\u2424 in CSF was added after MRI-based hippocampus volume. Lumbar puncture for extraction and analysis of CSF is usually performed after MRI, as MRI might show signs of increased intracranial pressure which is a (relative) contraindication to perform lumbar puncture. Finally, CSF tau and PET with the glucose analog F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) were compared with MRI-based hippocampus volume as neurodegeneration marker.\nThe secondary aim of the study was to evaluate the benefit of adding total volume of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) derived from FLAIR MRI as marker of cerebral small vessel disease to ADAS-13 and hippocampus volume for prediction of ADD in MCI. The rationale was that this model represents some 'medium-cost' scenario in which MRI is available but neither CSF nor PET.\nKaplan-Meier survival analysis was used for stepwise assessment of the incremental benefit of each marker in 402 MCI subjects from the ADNI [17] . In contrast to ROC analysis, survival analysis does not require to fix the time point (after diagnostic workup) to which the patient's status is to be extrapolated and, therefore, allows one to assess the whole time course of the disease within a single model. The latter simplifies the derivation of practically relevant conclusions. For the Kaplan-Meier analyses, MCI subjects were dichotomized as 'negative' or 'positive' for AD characteristic alteration with respect to each marker. Previously published cutoffs determined in independent patient samples were used for this purpose in order to avoid circularity bias and overly optimistic performance estimates."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "Data used in this study were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).

Progression to non-AD dementia was an exclusion criterion. There were no further exclusion criteria, in particular, no subject was excluded based on limited image quality in MRI or PET.

A previous study reported the FAQ to be the best single feature for ADD prediction in ADNI MCI subjects [18] . Neither ADAS-13 nor FAQ was adjusted for age, gender, or education (in order to facilitate integration in daily routine and to avoid the requirement of an appropriate normal cohort for standardization). Dichotomization of the MCI subjects with respect to ADAS-13 or FAQ was based on cutoffs derived from the results of Korolev and colleagues [19] for prediction of ADD in an independent ADNI1 MCI cohort over 36 months (both cutoffs were computed as unweighted mean of the mean in progressive and the mean in stable subjects given in figure 5 in [19] ): MCI subjects were classified as \"positive\" for AD-characteristic alteration with respect to ADAS-13 if ADAS-13 > 18 points and \"negative\" if ADAS-13 \u2264 18 points.

The first of the two baseline T1 scans was consistently used to mimic clinical routine in which often only a single scan is acquired. MRI had been acquired with 11 different scanner models.\nFor hippocampal volumetry, T1 MRI data was automatically segmented and stereotactically normalized to the anatomical space of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) using SPM8's unified segmentation algorithm with default settings [20] . Hippocampal volume (HV) was determined by multiplying the stereotactically normalized and modulated gray matter (GM) component image with a predefined binary mask for both hippocampi as described in [8] . Total intracranial volume (TIV) was estimated as the sum of GM, white matter (WM), and CSF volume. Dichotomization of MCI subjects into positive and negative for hippocampus atrophy was based on the cutoff of 8.12 ml for age and TIV corrected HV reported by Suppa and colleagues for prediction of MCI-to-ADD progression over 36 months in an independent ADNI1 sample [8] . In order to account for potential field strength dependence of the SPM-based HV (and TIV) (1.5T in the study by Suppa and colleagues versus 3T in the present study), SPM-based HV (and TIV) was obtained for an independent sample of ADNI1 subjects that had been scanned on two scanners, one with 1.5T field strength and the other with 3T (51 normal controls, 74 MCI and 28 AD patients) [21] . The mean of the ratio C o r r e c t e d P r o o f HV(1.5T)/HV(3T) over all of these ADNI1 subjects was used to scale the 3T HV estimates of the MCI subjects of the present study to 1.5T (analogously for TIV). Then, HV was corrected for TIV and age using the bilinear regression coefficients reported in [8] .\nFor automatic segmentation of white matter hyperintensities (WMH), the \"lesion growth algorithm\" of the lesion segmentation toolbox (LST) under the freely available Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software package was employed (version SPM8, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, UCL, London, UK) [22, 23] . Processing and parameter settings (kappa = 0.30, binarization threshold = 0.50) were exactly as described previously [24] . Dichotomization of MCI subjects into positive and negative for WMH burden used 13.5 ml as cutoff. This cutoff had been determined in a sample of hospitalized geriatric patients in whom the severity of WMH load was categorized by an experienced neuroradiologist as either \"normal for age\" or \"more than normal for age\" based on visual inspection of FLAIR MRI [24] . The neuroradiologist was blinded for all clinical information including cognitive performance of the patients. ROC analysis of the total WMH volume for differentiation between \"normal for age\" and \"more than normal for age\" revealed a high area under the ROC curve of 0.944. The Youden criterion resulted in a total volume of 13.5 ml as optimal cutoff [24] . Thus, a cutoff of 13.5 ml provides the best accuracy for detection of WMH load that, according to visual inspection of FLAIR MRI by an experienced neuroradiologist, is more than normal for age."}, {"section_title": "Cerebrospinal fluid data", "text": "Baseline CSF data was obtained from the master table provided at the ADNI homepage by the University of Pennsylvania (\"UPENNBIO MK MASTER.csv\").

Maximum follow-up of the included ADNI MCI subjects was 60 months. Subjects that did not progress during their individual follow-up time were categorized as censored and were included in the survival analysis.\nIn the primary analyses, Kaplan-Meier analysis started with the neuropsychological (NP) test score as only factor (2 strata).

Determination of image-based biomarkers for prediction of MCIto-ADD progression can involve different levels of complexity. In the present study, the complexity was limited to a level compatible with daily routine patient care. In particular, only fully automatic methods were used to compute biomarkers from MRI and FDG PET.\nThe major findings of the study are the following. First, fully automatic processing of structural MRI (MPRAGE, FLAIR) and FDG PET for computation of hippocampal gray matter volume and FDG t-sum score as neurodegeneration markers as well as total C o r r e c t e d P r o o f Table 4 Cox regression for prediction of dementia-free survival by adding dichotomized MRI-based total volume of white matter hyperintensities to dichotomized cognitive status (ADAS-13) and dichotomized MRI-based hippocampus volume.

The number of subjects is given in round brackets for each stratum. HR, hazard ratio; HV, hippocampal volume adjusted for total intracranial volume and age; NP, neuropsychological testing based on modified Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Score with 13 items; WMH, total volume of white matter hyperintensities Second, among all features (including the biomarkers) ADAS-13 showed the highest effect size for differentiation of MCI stable subjects and MCIto-ADD progressors (Table 1) . This is in line with previous studies that often found cognitive markers to be more robust predictors of MCI-to-ADD progression than biomarkers [26] . Moreover, it supports selecting ADAS-13 as the starting point of the stepwise Kaplan-Meier analyses. Using the predefined cutoff of 18 points on ADAS-13 to dichotomize MCI subjects according to cognitive status, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated the risk to develop dementia to strongly differ between the resulting subgroups (HR = 6.84, p < 0.0005; Fig. 3A, Table 2 ).\nThird, adding HV as neurodegeneration marker provided additional risk stratification (Fig. 3B , Table 2 ). This effect was independent of ADAS-13 status.\nFourth, using CSF concentration of phosphotau 181p (pTau) as neurodegeneration marker in step 2 considerably improved risk stratification compared to HV for both, subjects with low risk and subjects with high risk according to ADAS-13 (Fig. 3C, Table 2 ). For example, among MCI subjects with low risk according to ADAS-13, the HR of pTau positivity was 9.43 (p < 0.0005), that is, about four times higher as the HR of 2.37 (p = 0.021) of HV positivity.\nIt might be noted that both CSF tau measures, pTau and tTau, were equally considered as neurodegeneration markers here. That one of the two was selected for the multivariable survival analyses that performed best in univariate ROC analysis. This approach is in agreement with the AD diagnostic schema of the International Working Group [27] and of the National Institute on Aging -Alzheimer's Association [2, 3] , which both recommend pTau and tTau in CSF as neurodegeneration marker on an equal footing. Jack and co-workers recently proposed the A/T/N classification scheme for AD biomarkers [28] . \"A\" refers to A\u2424 biomarkers, \"T\" refers to biomarkers of ADspecific tau pathology (neurofibrillary tangles), and \"N\" refers to biomarkers of neuronal injury / neurodegeneration / neuronal dysfunction [28] . A particularly promising aspect of this new classification scheme is the separation of T-and N-markers that has the potential to differentiate neurodegeneration that is attributable to AD from non-AD neurodegeneration [28] . However, reliable differentiation between T-and N-pathology is required in order to fully exploit this potential. There is some indication that CSF-pTau is somewhat more specific for T-pathology, whereas CSF-tTau somewhat more reflects N-pathology [28] . However, there is a tight correlation between both CSF tau measures. Mattsson and colleagues, in a recent study on the relationship between CSF-tTau, CSF-pTau and tau PET with 18F-AV-1451 across the whole spectrum of AD (including preclinical AD, prodromal AD, and AD dementia), found CSF-pTau and CSF-tTau to be highly correlated (R = 0.92), but both were only moderately associated with local or global retention of 18F-AV-1451 [29] . This suggests that the combination of pTau and tTau in CSF might not be sufficient to reliably differentiate between T and N pathology for A/T/N classification. The use of tau PET as T-marker appears more promising for this purpose."}, {"section_title": "C o r r e c t e d P r o o f", "text": "Fifth, the FDG t-sum score provided improved risk stratification in the second step compared to HV particularly in MCI subjects with relatively preserved cognitive performance (ADAS-13 \u2264 18) (Fig. 3B and D, Table 2 ). This might be explained by the fact that 1) FDG PET becomes positive for AD characteristic alterations somewhat earlier than hippocampus volume [30] , and that 2) FDG PET might be considered as objectified neuropsychological testing that becomes positive earlier than true neuropsychological testing (perhaps due to better test-retest stability [31, 32] ). However, the FDG t-sum score was inferior to CSF-pTau for additional risk stratification in the second step, independent of cognitive status. For example, in MCI subjects with low risk according to ADAS-13, the HR of CSF-pTau positivity was almost twice the HR of FDG PET positivity (Table 2 ). This is in line with the fact that CSF markers become positive for AD characteristic alteration prior to FDG PET (and HV) [30] and that CSF-pTau is the most frequently impaired biomarker in ADNI subjects [33] . In this context, it is important to mention that about 65% of the MCI subjects included in this study were early MCI. It is expected that the relative predictive power of the imaging-based neurodegeneration markers compared to the CSF biomarkers improves in more advanced (late) MCI stages [30, 34] . Furthermore, FDG PET not only allows detection (or exclusion) of the AD typical pattern, but it is also useful for the diagnosis and differentiation of other diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration or autoimmune encephalitis, an emerging indication of FDG PET [35] . Good specificity of FDG PET for the differentiation of a wider range of diseases compared to HV and CSF markers might be an argument for the use of FDG PET in the diagnostic workup of patients with clinically uncertain cognitive impairment and several possible etiological causes, which is not very rare in clinical routine. In addition, FDG PET might be used in patients with contraindications for / technical difficulties with lumbar puncture. In the ADNI MCI sample included in this study CSFpTau was missing in 7% of the subjects. In clinical settings, this fraction is probably larger (10-20%).\nSixth, CSF concentration of A\u2424 1-42 provided additional risk stratification in MCI subjects with increased CSF-pTau. CSF-A\u2424 1-42 positivity did not reach the level of statistical significance in CSF-pTau negative subjects, independent of cognitive performance. The incremental predictive power of CSF-A\u2424 in CSF-pTau positive MCI subjects most likely is related to improved specificity for detection of AD by the combination of pTau and A\u2424 compared to pTau alone. It is in line with results of Prestia and co-workers who found the combination of biomarkers for amyloidosis and neurodegeneration to provide particularly good predictive power in MCI [36] . It is an important advantage of CSF analysis that it provides markers of amyloidosis (CSF-A\u2424) and neuronal injury (CSF-tTau and CSF-pTau) from a single probe. However, CSF analysis for AD characteristic proteins is rather sensitive to variability in drawing, handling, transport and analysis of the sample, all of which require careful standardization [37] . This is a disadvantage compared to the more stable HV and FDG PET markers. According to the Canadian Consensus Guidelines on the use of amyloid imaging in Canada, CSF analysis is still not ready for use in clinical routine and, therefore, currently should be restricted to university hospitals and academic institutions [38] .\nSeventh, adding the total volume of WMH in FLAIR MRI as marker of cerebral small vessel disease to cognition (ADAS-13) and neurodegeneration status (HV) provided additional risk stratification in MCI subjects with low risk according to both, ADAS-13 and HV. The rationale for testing the additional benefit of the WMH lesion load in a 'medium-cost' scenario without CSF and PET was that structural MRI including T2-weighted sequences is part of the standard diagnostic procedure in subjects with cognitive impairment and suspicion of neurodegenerative, cerebrovascular or mixed disease. Quantification of WMH load, therefore, results in only little additional costs. The utility of WMH load as early predictor of ADD has been demonstrated previously [39] . This, however, does not proof causality, since even low WMH burden is often associated with detectable neurodegeneration that might drive the cognitive decline rather than WMH load [40, 41] . A study on the heterogeneity of WMH using postmortem quantitative MRI and neuropathology by Gouw and colleagues found significant differences between WMH of AD patients and WMH of non-demented age-matched controls [42] . In particular, WMH in AD patients had more severe microglial activation, in line with the important role of microglial activation in the AD pathological process [42] . This suggests that not only cerebrovascular disease but also AD is a major contributor to WMH.\nWMH load did not provide further risk stratification if ADAS-13 and / or HV was positive for AD typical change (Fig. 3F) . To some extent this might be explained by the strong imbalance of sample size that was generally considerably smaller in the C o r r e c t e d P r o o f strata with large WMH load compared to strata with small WMH load. The rather low fraction of subjects with large WMH load is a characteristic of ADNI samples, as ADNI excluded subjects with modified Hachinski ischemic score (mHIS) > 4. However, mHIS is particularly sensitive for the detection of acute events such as stroke as the cause of cognitive impairment. It is less sensitive to seamless and incremental decline of cognitive performance that might be caused by chronic cerebral small vessel disease underlying WMH in the brain. In line with this, a small (13.4%) but non-negligible fraction of the ADNI MCI subjects included in this study showed WMH load above the 13.5 ml cutpoint (Fig. 4) . However, the frequency distribution of WMH load above the cutpoint was very similar in the ADNI MCI subjects compared to two clinical patient samples with cognitive impairment (Fig. 4) . In particular, maximum WMH burden was not very much smaller in the ADNI MCI sample than in the two clinical samples, although one of the clinical samples comprised patients with clinical diagnosis of vascular dementia.\nThe cutpoint of 13.5 ml appears very small at first sight, considering a typical total white matter volume of 400-500 ml. However, it provides the best accuracy for detection of WMH burden that is more than normal for age according to visual inspection of FLAIR MRI [24] . This is illustrated by the two representative MCI patients shown in Fig. 2 . The second patient presents with 20.2 ml total WMH (bottom left in Fig. 2 ), which clearly attracts attention, in contrast to the 3.5 ml WMH load of the first patient (top left). Furthermore, DeCarli and co-workers in a study of 51 healthy subjects aged from 19 to 91 years found WMH burden of more than 0.5% of the total intracranial volume to be associated with increased atrophy and reduced cognitive performance [40] . Assuming a typical intracranial volume of 1500 ml, the cutpoint of 0.5% corresponds to 7.5 ml. More recently, Habes and co-workers reported on the relationship between WMH load and brain atrophy in the general population [41] . Total WMH load larger than 2 ml started to appear after the fifth decade of life. \"High\" WMH load was associated with reduced cognitive performance (immediate recall score of the verbal learning and memory test) and significantly contributed to brain atrophy beyond normal ageing in the general population [41] . The cutpoint for high WMH load was defined by the 80th percentile of WMH volume as a function of age in this study. At 80 years of age the cutpoint was about 5 ml (Fig. 2 in [41] ). WMH load between 5 and 20 ml at this age was associated with age atrophy of subjects of about 90 years of age, i.e., one decade older. The studies by DeCarli et al. [40] and by Habes et al. [41] clearly demonstrate the potential clinical relevance of WMH load in the 5-20 ml range. An excellent recent review of the relationship between WMH and cognitive performance is given in [43] .\nIt might be noted that even the normal control subjects of the ADNI, an extremely healthy group, include a considerable fraction of subjects with substantial brain atrophy and WMH [44, 45] . Nettiksimmons and co-workers, using unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on CSF, serum and MRI markers (but no cognitive test scores) identified three clusters among ADNI controls [45] . The first cluster (33% of all subjects) comprised typical healthy subjects with high brain volume and high CSF A\u2424 1-42. The subjects in the second cluster (10%) showed CSF and MRI profiles similar to ADNI MCI and ADNI AD groups suggesting that these subjects were at early AD stages. The third cluster was characterized by higher brain atrophy (exceeding the level of atrophy in the second cluster in some brain regions), increased WMH load, but lack of AD typical CSF profile. Total volume of WMH was 0.9% of TIV larger in the third cluster than in both the first and the second cluster [45] . Assuming a typical TIV of 1500 ml, this difference corresponds to 13.5 ml. This confirms that a cutpoint of 13.5 ml on total WMH volume is useful to categorize subjects based on WMH load. In a second study of the same ADNI control subjects, Nettiksimmons and co-workers found that subjects in the third cluster had a worse cognitive trajectory on the Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test 30-min delay test and the FAQ than subjects in cluster 1, although there was no difference at baseline [44] .\nFinally, the combination of cognition, neurodegeneration and amyloidosis status provided very strong overall risk stratification. For example, the hazard ratio of subjects with the high risk combination ADAS-13+/pTau+/A\u2424+ compared to subjects with the low risk combination ADAS-13-/pTau-/A\u2424-was as large as 58.2 (p < 0.0005). To put this into perspective, many studies suggest a capping of prognostic accuracy in MCI patients considerably below 100%, independent of the criteria and/or biomarkers and/or combination of biomarkers used [13, 18, 26, 46] .\nThe following limitations of the present study should be mentioned. First, CSF data was incomplete (Table 1 ). In particular, CSF-pTau was available in only 373 of the 402 included MCI sub- . Frequency distribution of the total volume of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) up to the cutpoint of 13.5 ml (left) and above the cutpoint (right) for the ADNI MCI patients included in the present study (A). For comparison, the WMH distribution is shown for two clinical patient samples described in [24] , patients with a clinical diagnosis of vascular dementia from the NACC database (B), and acutely hospitalized geriatric patients with newly manifested cognitive impairment (C).\njects (93%) which might have caused some bias to the disadvantage of CSF-pTau compared to the other (complete) neurodegeneration markers HV and FDG PET. Second, the SPM-based HV estimate used in the present study does not follow the European harmonization of hippocampal segmentation protocol [47] and, therefore, might be considered a kind of hippocampal integrity measure rather than an estimate of actual hippocampus volume (similar to the index of hippocampal integrity proposed by Ardekani and colleagues [48, 49] ). However, the SPM-based pipeline used in this study is very fast computationally and the resulting hippocampus integrity measure provides similar C o r r e c t e d P r o o f power for prediction of progression to ADD in MCI subjects as computationally more expensive methods [8] . Furthermore, there was a statistically significant age difference between cognitively stable MCI subjects and MCI-to-ADD progressors at baseline. However, only the HV was adjusted for age which might have introduced some bias (probably to the disadvantage of HV) compared to all other features including ADAS-13. The rationale for ageadjusting HV was the use of the cutoff of 8.12 ml given in [8] , as this cutoff refers to age-adjusted HV. Finally, WMH load represents only one out of several MRI features associated with cerebrovascular disease. Small infarcts, lacunes, microbleeds and widening of perivascular space were not taken into account here [50] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Stepwise integration of biomarkers of neurodegeneration and brain amyloidosis results in stepwise refinement of risk estimates for MCI-to-ADD progression. The incremental benefit from making the next step (that is, adding the next marker) strongly depends on the results of the preceding diagnostic steps. Thus, the stepwise Kaplan-Meier model can support clinicians in optimizing the diagnostic workflow for each individual patient. Kaplan-Meier analysis might also be useful to communicate findings to patients and their relatives, because it provides the full time course of the dementia risk during the following years. "}]
