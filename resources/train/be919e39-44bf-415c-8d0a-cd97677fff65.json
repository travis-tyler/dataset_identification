The salt marshes serve as an interface between the Bay and surrounding urban areas. Currently, over a dozen marsh islands span the Bay. Their landscapes are composed of mudflats, a variety of salt marsh plant species, sediment deposited to rebuild drowning salt marsh, transitional vegetation denoting the shift to upland, and human created upland areas. Salt marshes provide numerous ecological benefits such as high biodiversity, improved water quality, flood reduction, and carbon sequestration [1]. The wetland ecosystems of New York State, including salt marshes, were reduced by 60% from 1780 to 1980 [2]. Nationally, salt marshes have been under particular stress with increasing rates of loss from 2004 to 2009 caused in part by coastal storms [3]. In the past, these trends were exacerbated in the urban-impacted Jamaica Bay. Jamaica Bay's salt marsh loss is severe. Since 1951, approximately 60% of the Bay's salt marsh has converted into mudflats due to a combination of factors including a reduction in sediment supply, changes in tidal regime, nutrient enrichment and increased hydrogen sulfide concentrations [4]. This estimate does not include areas of wetlands around the estuary lost to land filling and urbanization. From 1989-2003, Jamaica Bay's salt marshes were in rapid decline losing 13.4 ha/year [5]. The nitrogen load of the Bay is one factor that may contribute to this high rate of loss [6]. Remote sensing is uniquely suited for monitoring coastal environments, due to the difficulty of in situ access and the high temporal resolution required to understand these dynamic landscapes [7]. Remote sensing monitoring of the salt marsh landscape can be used to determine vegetation trends for the entire bay and individual islands, facilitating an assessment of restoration impacts. Remote sensing is an important tool for furthering our understanding of how Jamaica Bay's salt marshes are affected by anthropogenic and natural factors [8,9]. This study used imagery data spanning a decade and two high resolution sensor systems. In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy impacted the coast of New York and surrounding states with high winds and storm surge. It was a 1 in 500-year storm surge event at the Manhattan Battery [10]. The boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens directly surrounding Jamaica Bay were inundated; the storm caused 2 million New Yorkers to lose power [11]. This study seeks to understand the impact of Hurricane Sandy on salt detrimental effects on coastal salt marshes [12]; thereby, enhancing the need for accurate remote sensing monitoring and assessment of coastal wetlands to inform decision-makers."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Area", "text": "Jamaica Bay is an urban estuary residing within the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. Kings County, synonymous with Brooklyn, is the most populated county in New York State [13]. Approximately Figure 1) have undergone salt marsh restoration. After restoration, sites were monitored in situ for 5 years [4]. These marsh restoration projects involved the deposition of dredge sediment from channels in the Bay onto the marsh surface then the transplanting and seeding of salt marsh vegetation [16]."}, {"section_title": "Remote Sensing Data", "text": "High spatial resolution Quickbird-2 and Worldview-2 data were employed for salt marsh mapping and change analysis. This study uses object-based image analysis (OBIA) which first divides an image into objects, using a segmentation algorithm, and then classifies those objects based on their spectral and spatial attributes [18]. Object-based change detection (OBCD) utilizes image objects to conduct a change analysis between multiple time periods. The change analysis can be conducted with object attributes, classified objects, multi-temporal image objects, or a hybrid of these techniques [19]. This study compared the classified 2003, 2008, 2012 and 2013 objects to understand restoration and Hurricane Sandy's impact on wetlands within Jamaica Bay."}, {"section_title": "Segmentation", "text": "An important component of OBIA classifications is the determination of segmentation scale, which determines the size and similarity of resulting image objects, and parametrization i.e. the inclusion of texture [20]. Texture is the use of a moving window to quantify measures that represent ideas such as coarseness and roughness [19]. This study arrived at an appropriate segmentation scale with the comparison of multiple segmentation scales for each time period to maximize intrasegment homogeneity and intersegment heterogeneity [21,22]. The parametrization of the resulting image objects included spectral values, texture, geospatial attributes, upland data, vegetation indices, and neighborhood and scene difference attributes (Described in Section 2.4). Segmentation scale is the key to accurately mapping a landscape. Scale parameters can be arrived at through \"trial-and-error\". However, this method risks determining an inappropriate segmentation scale. Over or under segmenting an image can result in lower classification accuracy [23]. In addition, segmentation scale can impact the land cover classes that can be accurately mapped [20]. This study used the mean shift clustering approach to determine segmentation. Mean shift is a non-parametric segmentation algorithm which groups pixels based on their spectral mean in a feature space. The algorithm has improved accuracy when compared to other clustering techniques [24,25]. Mean shift considers a spectral radius in the feature space as the scale parameter, which results in a hierarchical relationship between segmentation scales [26]. These factors make the algorithm suitable for multiscale segmentation. There are different methods for assessing the quality of segmentation. This study assessed segmentation scales with an index of intra-segment homogeneity and intersegment heterogeneity [21]. Intersegment heterogeneity was assessed through computation of Global Moran's I that were normalized and then combined with the intra-segment homogeneity, as determined by normalized area controlled variance, to create a single parameter measuring segmentation quality [22]. The mean shift segmentation parameters that were determined were minimum size and spectral radius. Minimum size refers to the fewest number of pixels that can compose a segment, and spectral radius is the distance in the feature which a pixel must be within to merge into the segment. Each image date was tested with the parameters from 5-50 spectral radii in increments of 1 and minimum size from 5-50 in increments of 5. Appropriate segmentation scale for the Worldview-2 2012 data was determined to be a spectral radius of 15 and a minimum size of 5 pixels. The 25% most over segmented objects were segmented again at a quantitatively determined appropriate scale of spectral radius 20 and minimum size 5 pixels. The same was done for 25% most under segmented objects, for which the appropriate scale was spectral radius 6 and minimum size 5 pixels. The appropriate scale for the Worldview-2 2013 data was determined to be spectral radius 22 and minimum size 20 pixels. The 25% most over segmented objects were segmented again at a quantitatively determined appropriate scale of spectral radius 27 and minimum size 5 pixels. The 25% most under segmented objects were re-segmented at a scale of spectral radius 7 and minimum size 5 pixels. The Quickbird-2 data were segmented at a spectral radius of 8 and a minimum size of 20 pixels. No additional levels of segmentation were done as this scale adequately captured the landscapes and spectral complexity of the Quickbird-2 data. The classification was conducted with the Random Forest classifier. Random Forest is a non-parametric ensemble learning algorithm that has been demonstrated to achieve appropriate classification accuracy in a variety of landscapes [25, 28, and 29]. The 9 classes used in this study included 6 from a previous study of the Bay [8]. These classes included water, mudflat, sand, high marsh, patchy S. alterniflora, and S. alterniflora (\u226550% vegetation cover). The two S. alterniflora classes were based on percent cover with patchy being between 10%-49% vegetation cover and S. alterniflora (\u226550% vegetation cover) being above 50%. Salicornia species are present within the Bay as a small component of the salt marsh [30], and were not prevalent enough to classify on their own. Additional classes included in this study are wrack, upland vegetation, Phragmites, and shadow, however shadow was removed with a decision tree post-classification. The 2003 classification did not include wrack due to the limited separability of the class in those images. These additional classes were included to expand our understanding of the Bay and inform management decisions."}, {"section_title": "Object Attributes", "text": "Spectral attributes included the mean and standard deviation of all available spectral bands. The spatial variables computed were perimeter, area, and nodes. The panchromatic band was utilized to create Grey-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) textural measurements, including inverse difference moment, entropy, contrast, correlation, and uniformity. GLCM and other texture measures have been shown to improve classification accuracies in both Very High Resolution image classification [28] and object-based wetland classification [32]. Red Edge-based vegetation indices, have been shown to more accurately discern differences between high density vegetation species [33]. In this study, Worldview Vegetation Index (WVVI), Worldview Water Index (WVWI), Red Edge-based NDVI, NDVI, and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) were calculated after pan-sharpening due to its benefits for detecting small vegetation patches (formulas in Table 1) [34]. Ancillary data included an upland GIS layer created from a geomorphological map of Jamaica Bay [35] and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from 2014 Topo-bathymetric Light Detection and Ranging [36].

Hurricane Sandy breached West Pond, resulting in salt water intrusion into the fresh water environment [43]. Prior to this breach, West Pond's wetlands were dominated by Phragmites australis. The area represents the most drastic change from Hurricane Sandy; alterations to the upland and freshwater wetlands are evident ( Figure 4, Table   4). Since the mid-2000s, the Bay has had a 30% reduction in nitrogen load [44]. Nutrient enrichment in salt marsh systems can lead to creek bank collapse and conversion to mudflat [6]. The Waste Water Treatment Plants in Jamaica Bay account for 89% of all nitrogen inputs into the Bay; due to the Bay's currents, the highest nitrogen concentrations were in the south and eastern sides of JoCo [15]. The different responses of salt marshes in the Bay to nutrient enrichment was partly explained by lower elevation marshes having longer periods of inundation increasing decomposition and loss of organic matter [45]. The nitrogen load reduction coincided with the slowing of salt marsh loss, however, the impact is unknown and in situ analysis would be necessary to explore this possible connection."}, {"section_title": "Restoration", "text": "In 2003, the first salt marsh restoration in Jamaica Bay began at Big Egg. The project utilized dredge sediment to increase marsh elevation and then S. alterniflora plugs were planted 50 cm apart [17].  [46]. The storm impacted Yellow Bar at an early stage of restoration, which led to a slowing of the process. However considerable vegetation was gained in the post-storm growing season."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Sandy", "text": "The response of salt marshes to storm events vary and include net elevation increases leading to vegetation growth [48] and accretion varying with distance to an inlet [49]. The natural and restoration salt marshes responded differently to Hurricane Sandy. The analysis of natural salt marsh separated the restoration and storm impacts. In 2012-2013, larger salt marshes and those further from Rockaway Inlet tended to gain vegetation. This is in agreement with past hurricane impacts which had a wide variation in sediment deposition and salt marsh response including edge erosion [50]. The large salt marshes may have been less impacted by Hurricane Sandy, and captured more of the accompanying sediment pulse. The response of vegetation in Jamaica Bay to Hurricane Sandy depended on the location and the ecosystem. Saltwater intrusion into freshwater ecosystems is a major source of storm event derived vegetation loss; evident in both coastal wetland environments [51] and forests [52]. The survival and recovery of freshwater wetland vegetation depends on the species [53] and replanting of coastal forests can be limited by the increased soil salinity and herbivory [54]. These long-term impacts emphasize the importance of monitoring the West Pond breach. Post-storm, both freshwater wetland and upland vegetation lost extent declining from 13.3 ha to 10.2 ha and 11.5 ha to 6.0 ha, respectively (Table 4). There was 2.9 ha of change from upland vegetation to freshwater wetland, which can be understood as a loss of vegetation biomass but not a complete loss of vegetation. Excluding those areas, 5.9 ha of freshwater wetland was lost. The majority of vegetation lost became mudflat. The loss of upland vegetation suggests the approximate extent of salt water intrusion into the upland areas around West Pond. The environmental assessment of the site has resulted in the decision to close the breach and restore the freshwater wetland environment [55]. This approach will create early successional habitat. Continued monitoring of West Pond is necessary to understand both the recovery of the freshwater ecosystem and unforeseen impacts of the management decision."}, {"section_title": "Wrack", "text": "Wrack Throughout the Bay most wrack became S. alterniflora, capturing the removal of wrack and regrowth of impacted salt marsh vegetation in the following growing season.

Land cover extent of salt marsh islands (ha).    [2]. Salt marsh losses in Jamaica Bay, an estuary within New York City, are driven primarily by nutrient enrichment, an increased tidal range, a lack of sediment, and increased sulfide concentrations [3]. Jamaica Bay has a long history of salt marsh mapping and monitoring using remote sensing. Salt marshes mapped from aerial photographs acquired in the 1950s demonstrated significant losses [4]. Since 2003, very high-spatial-resolution satellites have been used to monitor and determine the change in the bay [5], [6]. An object-oriented classification using the Worldview-2 satellite imagery has been used to map the salt marsh extent and the change caused by a storm event and restoration activities in the bay [6]."}, {"section_title": "Marsh", "text": "The accurate determination of the salt marsh extent and the change by remote sensing is impacted by the tidal stage at the time of image acquisition. When mapping a vegetation change in tidal environments, differences in the tidal stage can lead to an erroneous identification of change [7]. The influence of the tidal stage on salt marsh vegetation mapping is a topic that has been addressed infrequently in the literature. Salt marsh vegetation zonation and extent are dependent on many factors driven by tidal inundation. For example, the lower bound of the growth range of smooth cordgrass, S. alterniflora, is limited by physical stress from abiotic factors [8]. A tidal stage above mean low water (MLW) can reduce the extent of vegetation mapped; an imagery acquired above mean highest high water corresponded with a 40% reduction in the mapped vegetation extent [9]. That study led to the recommendation that when mapping salt marsh, an imagery should be acquired within 0-0.6 to a maximum of 0.9 m above MLW. These guidelines have been applied to the Coastal Change Analysis Program protocol and other salt marsh mapping projects [10], [11]. The spatial resolution of remote-sensing data can influence many aspects of image classification and the coastal change analysis [12]. A variety of high-spatial-resolution imageries, including Worldview-2, Quickbird-2, orthoimagery, and historic imageries, have been utilized for mapping salt marshes [13]. Therefore, understanding the impact of the tidal stage on a very high resolution (VHR) imagery in coastal mapping is necessary. In this study, impact is defined as an increase in misclassification of salt marsh vegetation due to tidal inundation muting spectral differences. The study quantifies this as those areas with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) < 0 in the imagery and inundated areas in the models. There have been several approaches to quantifying and accounting for tidal uncertainty in remote-sensing classifications. In situ measurements and the Quickbird-2 satellite-obtained spectra have been found to be similar despite a variety of tidal stages [14]. For a medium-resolution imagery, a digital elevation model (DEM) in combination with a satellite imagery has been used to quantify and limit the impact of the tidal stage on vegetation mapping [15]. In this paper, we explored a novel approach to understand the impact of the tidal stage on the vegetation extent using VHR satellite remote-sensing data and topobathymetric light detection and ranging (LiDAR). LiDAR is often incorporated into salt marsh classifications with the creation of LiDAR-derived vegetation indices [16] or LiDAR-derived elevation to augment spectral classifications [17]. The limited penetration of LiDAR into the salt marsh canopy can result in a bias toward higher elevations [18]. However, areas of dense canopy are minimally impacted by tidal inundation unless completely submerged. This makes the bias toward including the salt marsh vegetation height in ground elevations within salt marshes a minor concern for this paper. Bathtub models are a method to determine inundation. A DEM is used to determine whether a pixel is inundated or not at a certain tidal stage or flood elevation. Additional nuance can be added by adjacency rules, i.e., a number of adjacent pixels must be inundated before a pixel is considered inundated [18]. Bathtub models have been used to determine SLR [19] and storm surge impacts [20] for coastal landscapes. Inundation has been shown to increase with the spatial resolution of the DEM [19]. Local tides can influence these predictions, and tidal variation can be included in bathtub models by converting elevation data to a tidal datum with software, such as VDatum [21]. Bathtub models are commonly used to assess SLR and have yet to be utilized to understand tidal impacts on VHR salt marsh mapping.  [22]. From 2007 to 2012, there was a 3-cm mean increase in the tidal range within the bay [23]. Alterations to the bay have resulted in an increase in volume coinciding with a decrease in surface area [24]. The bay's salt marsh islands are a combination of restored and natural salt marshes. Restoration in the bay began in 2003 with thin-layer deposition, a process of depositing sediment from channel deepening, onto the marsh surface followed by revegetation [25]."}, {"section_title": "B.

Bay wide inundation of the salt marsh vegetation was minimal before 0.6 m above MLW (Fig. 4). However, the salt marsh islands, including Black Wall, Rulers Bar, and Pumpkin Patch, had \u223c20% of the S. alterniflora inundated at 0.6 m above MLW; these salt marshes had significantly different inundation regimes than other salt marshes (see Fig. and  alterniflora was impacted. However, due to the restoration activity on the island, this model was not representative of other salt marsh islands in the bay (Table IV) alterniflora. Inundated areas can still be mapped as vegetation, though it is likely that spectra will be altered leading to more variability in the spectral signature for the S. alterniflora vegetation class. The impact of the tidal stage on the VHR mapping of S. alterniflora was similar to past estimates with a medium resolution imagery [8]. The image analysis method is preferred for determining local tidal impacts. However, the acquisition of several VHR images is often prohibitively expensive, making the modeling approach reasonable for understanding local tidal characteristics. The tidal impact on S. alterniflora was varied by a salt marsh island. These differences were due to Jamaica Bay's tidal variability, vegetation characteristics, and restoration actions. S. alterniflora marshes have an area of taller high biomass vegetation along the marsh edge [38]. The finer spatial resolution would pick up some of these differences between edge and interior salt marsh. In addition, ground elevation was used in this analysis not accounting for differences in the vegetation height. These taller edge areas were less impacted by canopy inundation than shorter interior S. alterniflora. The use of the VHR imagery did not, on its own, limit the impact of the tidal stage on the mapped vegetative extent. Salt marsh mapping requires accurate measure of fine-scale changes in land cover; therefore, even minor tidal impacts are of concern and should be quantified. Previous classifications and the change analysis of the study site (2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013) used imagery acquired at a range of tidal stages [6]. The tidal stage of the 2003 imagery was 78.1 cm and outside the recommended 60 cm of MLW (Table I) observed rates and is likely to continue to increase due to global warming [39]. Regional SLR in the mid-Atlantic is projected to be between and 50 cm greater than global SLR by 2100 [40]. SLR is a major concern for Jamaica Bay. A 30-cm SLR scenario is projected to cause extensive salt marsh loss in the western portion of the bay [41] and could be further exacerbated by eutrophication [42], [43]. This tidal inundation analysis can be utilized to understand the areas of potential salt marsh loss within Jamaica Bay. 1) Tidal stage is even more a concern for VHR coastal mapping due to the desire for fine-scale measurements. 2) Tidal stage variation throughout a study site can be modeled improving the estimates of uncertainty. 3) When mapping S. alterniflora, the lower growth range of the species can be used to ensure limited impact and allow for an understanding of tidal impacts in microtidal areas.        The approach has been used for many remote sensing time series studies (  ."}, {"section_title": "Biomass modeling and change", "text": "The ability of the time series trend component to reveal salt marsh change was evident in the identification of both losses and gains across the watersheds.

In the Chincoteague watershed, declines were most common and interior loss along the back-barrier of Assateague Island National Seashore was apparent (Figure 3). Increases in aboveground green biomass were most prominent in the prograding areas to the south of Assateague Island (Figure 3c) and on the overwash fans on northern Assateague Island (Figure 3b). In general, Chincoteague, Eastern Lower Delmarva, and Southern Long Island all had moderate declines in biomass (Table 1) (Table 2).

These watershed-wide declines were driven by clusters of significant loss, even stable watersheds had areas of significant loss (Figure 3; Figure 6-8; Figure 10). The analysis of tidal range makes it clear that ditched salt marshes with < 0.8 m tidal range were more prone to loss of aboveground green biomass than the relatively more stable areas (> 0.8 m). This result is supported by previous modeling which found for the same suspend sediment concentrations macrotidal marshes (>4m tidal range) can adapt to much higher rates of SLR than microtidal (<2 m tidal range) salt marsh (Kirwan et al. for Chincoteague, suggests a relationship between these losses with SLR (Table 3). Tidal loss corresponded with high magnitude disturbances, but were much less common ( Figure 11). Small declines (<100 g m -2 ) across the salt marsh were of little concern as they fall well within the uncertainty of this data. and from the results of the Moran's I analysis ( Table 1). The Eastern Lower Delmarva watershed, had a significant average rate of loss ( Figure 3) and a low average biomass, 529 g m -2 over July, August, and September of 2017 ( Figure 11b). Salt marsh losses in the region are driven by barrier island migration at rates of 1-6 m yr -1 (Deaton et al. 2017), including shifts in the barrier island extent (Figure 11c). Edge erosion driven by sediment supply and salt marsh basin width have been proposed as significant contributors of salt marsh loss within the Eastern Lower Delmarva watershed (Mariotti & Fagherazzi, 2013). This represents a different change regime than the other barrier island watersheds in this study. Migration of the seaward salt marsh boundary, minor shifts in the interior back bay salt marsh, and significant edge erosion due to inlet shifts were evident from the aboveground biomass change maps ( Figure 11). The BFAST algorithm determined disturbances (>100 g m -2 ) corresponded with changes evident in the NAIP image record (Figure 11d). These moderate, but temporally discrete, changes represent a significant reduction in percent aboveground green biomass for many of the back bay areas. In the Eastern Lower Delmarva, 17% of all areas analyzed experienced a disturbance of this magnitude. Previous studies of this area were focused on salt marsh edge erosion and loss through barrier island migration. This study demonstrates that the site's salt marshes are low biomass, creating even greater likelihood of loss in the watershed. This watershed demonstrates the ability of this method to monitor salt marsh under a variety of change regimes."}, {"section_title": "Disturbance", "text": "The BFAST algorithm detected many disturbances. However, a large number of these disturbances were brief which is to be expected in salt marsh environments i.e. high inundation event or algal deposition on mudflats. Positive disturbances were common. However, these did not correspond with long-term increases (Figure 9). Both the long-term trend analysis and disturbance analysis identified areas of loss ( Figure   11). The disturbance pixels had less correlation with 2018 aboveground biomass than 2012 biomass in non-disturbed pixels. This correlation suggests that disturbed areas were less stable areas of the salt marsh. These disturbances illustrate the highly dynamic nature of these systems and the importance of monitoring salt marshes with time series data. Disturbances with an increase in aboveground green biomass could correspond with increased vegetation, changes to vegetation composition, algal deposition on mudflats, or algal blooms in pools. Temporary decreases could correspond with droughts, which have been observed as a driver of temporary salt marsh die-off in the southern United States (Alber et al. 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This study puts forth an approach for understanding salt marsh change with a combination of medium resolution imagery and time series analysis.
