Abstract While an opportunity cost argument suggests that recessions are ideal times to undergo R&D aimed at enhancing productivity, empirical measures of U.S. R&D activity are procyclical. To resolve this discrepancy, I propose a calibrated real business cycle model featuring R&D-based growth through horizontal innovations.

Empirical evidence for the post-war U.S. economy shows that R&D activities are procyclical. Specifically, aggregate measures of real R&D expenditures and employment of scientists and engineers tend to rise during booms and fall during recessions, as most recent studies show."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "Basic knowledge-driven models of R&D-based growth are not able to replicate this procyclicality. The reason is that business cycle fluctuations induce workers to move between goods production and R&D. During recessions labor productivity in goods production is lower than in booms, whereas it is acyclical in R&D. This means that the opportunity cost of R&D, expressed in terms of foregone output, goes down in recessions. Consequently, workers move from production to R&D activities during recessions and vice versa during booms. This opportunity cost argument, which was first studied by Aghion and Saint-Paul (1998) , predicts countercyclical R&D. This is, however, at odds with the empirical evidence.\nThe main objective of this paper is to resolve this discrepancy. To this end, I develop a plain real business cycle model featuring endogenous growth. The model introduces a new mechanism to explain the procyclicality of R&D, namely complementarity among multiple R&D inputs. Then, I employ a calibrated version of the model economy to conduct a quantitative analysis of the business cycle patterns. The key question is whether the calibrated model is able to capture the cyclical properties of R&D activities, namely procyclical R&D investment and procyclical employment of scientists. The paper primarily aims to shed some light on the different mechanisms that determine the cyclicality of R&D, rather than trying to match the cyclical properties of R&D activities exactly. Nevertheless, my analysis is a step in that direction, being -to the best of my knowledge -the first quantitative investigation into the determinants of the procyclicality of R&D. Besides, I also consider long-run consequences of business cycle shocks since short-run economic fluctuations affect the intertemproal allocation of R&D resources over the cycle and, that way, have a persistent impact on the economy's productivity level.\nThe model proposed in this paper generates R&D-based growth through horizontal innovations along the lines of Romer (1990) . However, I extend the basic knowledgedriven growth framework in two respects. First, I propose a specification of the R&D process that allows for multiple R&D inputs which complement each other: labor and goods. As goods are scarcer in recessions than in booms, the complementarity of R&D inputs dampens the reallocation of labor implied by the opportunity cost argument. This way, I introduce a new mechanism to explain the procyclicality of R&D. Besides, this description of R&D is based on detailed evidence from the National Science Foundation and, hence, more realistic than knowledge-driven or lab-equipment models studied by the literature. Second, I consider endogenous labor supply, as suggested by Fat\u00e1s (2000a) . In that case, total employment expands in booms and contracts in recessions. This mitigates the opportunity cost effect. As both extensions work against the opportunity cost effect, in the end it is a quantitative question, which effect is dominating.\nThe quantitative analysis shows first that endogenous labor supply alone is not sufficient to replicate the cyclical patterns of R&D observed in the data. In particular, the popular knowledge-driven specification of the R&D process has a hard time to generate both procyclical R&D investment and procyclical R&D labor at the same time. Rather, R&D labor tends to be countercyclical due to the opportunity cost effect, unless labor supply is extremely elastic or innovations earn a very small markup.\n2 Thus, R&D output is typically countercyclical so that economic downturns would foster endogenous TFP. Moreover, due to its simplicity, the knowledge-driven model cannot match the empirical values of the share of R&D investment in GDP and the number of scientists and engineers simultaneously.\nThe second key finding is that the calibrated multi-input specification generates procyclical R&D investment as well as procyclical employment of scientists. Due to complementarities between R&D inputs, intersectoral reallocation of workers is much less relevant when the R&D process involves multiple inputs. Besides, the endogenous growth mechanism amplifies business cycle shocks. Therefore, the calibrated multi-input model implies that booms promote productivity growth. In sum, my findings point out that the specification of the R&D process is crucial. It requires a careful modeling of the R&D inputs to replicate the cyclical properties R&D activities. Specifically, under the baseline calibration endogenous labor supply and R&D complementarities reinforce each other and overturn the intersectoral reallocation of workers caused by the opportunity cost effect.\nThis paper adds to a growing literature on growth and business cycles which views cyclical fluctuations and productivity growth as closely interrelated. Many economists have recently studied growth effects of business cycle shocks (see, among others, Aghion and Saint-Paul, 1998; Barlevy, 2004; Comin and Gertler, 2006; Fat\u00e1s, 2000a,b; Posch and W\u00e4lde, 2011; W\u00e4lde, 2002) . Some authors argue that economic downturns may well be ideal times to enhance productivity. In particular, Aghion and Saint-Paul (1998) propose a model of optimal productivity growth under demand fluctuations. Based on an opportunity cost argument, their favorite model specification predicts productivityenhancing activities, such as R&D, to be countercyclical. This implication is, however, at odds with the data. This paper is most closely related to studies which aim at resolving this discrepancy. Aghion, Angeletos, Banerjee, and Manova (2010) propose binding credit constraints. Barlevy (2007) employs fixed costs of production to generate procycical profits that drive R&D. In contrast to this integral view of R&D, Comin and Gertler (2006) and Francois and Lloyd-Ellis (2009) consider multi-stage models of innovation in which the creation of knowledge is procyclical but its adaption to productive use may not. W\u00e4lde (2005) , in turn, argues that R&D activities result in occasional technology jumps which give rise to endogenous business cycle fluctuations. My paper contributes to this literature in two respects: First, the paper contributes a new explanation for the observed procylicality of R&D activities. My results suggest that complementarity among R&D inputs plays a vital role. Unlike previous studies which neglect distinct inputs into R&D, this paper models the R&D process in line with detailed evidence on R&D inputs from the National Science Foundation. One merit of this approach is that the calibration procedure allows to impose discipline on the mechanism because the cyclical properties of R&D inputs are directly observable. Second, the quantitative analysis contributes to settle the dispute about role of labor supply (Barlevy, 2007; Fat\u00e1s, 2000a; Nu\u00f1o, 2011) .\nFinally, the paper provides an empirical contribution, too. First, the paper widens the perspective of the empirical literature on the cyclicality of R&D. Unlike previous studies, the present paper employs the classical RBC approach, pioneered by Kydland and Prescott (1982) , and documents a set of new business cycle facts related to R&D activities for the U.S. post-war economy.\n3 Using data from the National Science Foundation, this analysis extends the well-known procyclicality result for R&D expenditures to several distinct R&D inputs. Second, the RBC analysis is built on national accounts that are conceptually in line with the model. This requires R&D to be an investment rather than an expense. Consequently, R&D investment constitutes a component of GDP. To this end, I construct corresponding aggregate macroeconomic data, based on the BEAs R&D Satellite Account (see Lee and Schmidt, 2010) .\nIn short, this paper makes an empirical contribution by providing new business cycle facts on R&D activities, a theoretical contribution by proposing complementarity among R&D inputs as a new explanation for their observed procylicality, and a quantitative contribution by showing that a calibrated version of the multi-input specification is able to capture procyclical R&D, whereas a calibrated knowledge-driven model does not replicate the data. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis for the multi-input specification shows that business cycle shocks get amplified, suggesting that booms promote productivity growth.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents empirical evidence on the cyclicality of R&D activities. Section 3 sets up the model. Section 4 calibrates the model, discusses impulse responses, and reports the findings on the business cycle properties of R&D activities. Section 5 summarizes the paper and discusses the empirical relevance of the model's main mechanism as well as directions for future research."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Evidence", "text": "Most recent empirical studies for the U.S. find that real R&D expenditures are procyclical.\n4 This procyclicality is documented at both the aggregate (Barlevy, 2007; Comin and Gertler, 2006; Fat\u00e1s, 2000a; Nu\u00f1o, 2011) and the industry (Barlevy, 2007; Ouyang, 2011) level, for total as well as industry-funded R&D, and for both National Science Foundation (NSF) and S&P Compustat data. However, these results are based on NIPA national accounting standards which treat R&D as expense while from an economic point of view R&D is seen as investment.\nThe present study considers a new data source: the BEAs R&D Satellite Account (henceforth R&DSA) which extends the NSF-scope of R&D and incorporates it into national accounting by treating R&D as investment (Lee and Schmidt, 2010) . Consequently, the R&DSA does not only include R&D investment into GDP but also provides a measure of the stock of R&D capital. During the post-war period, R&D investment contributed on average 2.7% to GDP and R&D capital made up about 4.5% of produced assets. Figure 1 displays the growth rates of private R&D investment and employment of scientists and engineers (henceforth S&E) together with GDP growth from the R&DSA. Both measures of R&D activity covary positively with GDP growth. Private R&D investment tend to move through troughs during NBER-recessions. The growth rate of scientists and engineers shows a pattern similar to the growth rate in R&D investment, but appears to slightly lag behind the latter. Indeed, the correlation between these two time series is 60% at a one-year lag, while it is only 46% contemporaneously. This suggests that S&E employment captures R&D activity only partially. In sum, the evidence presented in Figure 1 confirms the procyclicality result of previous literature also for R&DSA data."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "The view that scientists and engineers are only one aspect of R&D activity is also supported by data on the distribution of R&D costs. Figure 2 reveals that only 46% of industrial R&D funds are wages and salaries of R&D personnel. Interestingly, the 4 W\u00e4lde and Woitek (2004) document procyclical contemporaneous correlations of R&D expenditures with GDP for six out of seven G7 countries.\n5 Barlevy (2007) and Fat\u00e1s (2000a) provide essentially the same time-series plots. However, their measure of R&D expenditures stems from the NSF. In Mand (2014, Ch. 3), I compare the growth rates of private R&D investment from the R&DSA and total funds for industrial R&D from NSF. Both show, by and large, the same pattern and correlate at 85%. However, NSF time series does not show a trough for the recession of 1981/82, while the R&DSA data do. Notes: Other R&D related costs include books and periodicals, software, travel costs and professional dues, utilities, maintenance and repairs, insurance expenses, property taxes, depreciation on R&D as well as an appropriate share of company overhead. The shaded regions correspond to NBER-recessions.\nSource: National Science Foundation, Survey of Industrial Research and Development R&D-cost data suggest that both labor and goods are about equally important for R&D. Materials and supplies account for 17% of R&D costs. Furthermore, other R&D related costs, which include scientific equipment, travel costs and professional dues, maintenance and repairs as well as depreciation on R&D, average to 37% of industrial R&D funds. This evidence casts doubt on the widespread view that labor is the primary R&D input. The second fact is that the R&D wage bill is split 3:2 between scientists and engineers, on the one hand, and supporting personnel on the other hand. Specifically, the wage share of R&D supporting personnel in R&D funds is less than 20%. Both wage bill shares in industrial R&D funds remained quite stable during the period under observation.\nNext, turn to standard business cycle measures of R&D activities. Following the RBC literature, I employ the HP-filter to extract cyclical components for which I compute firstorder autocorrelations, standard deviations, and cross-correlations with cyclical output. Table 1 reports these summary statistics for R&D related series.\n6 Several features of the data are worth noting. First, I report four facts about the comovement of R&D activities with the cycle.\n1. Private R&D investment is procyclical, with a cross-correlations of 0.52. The cyclicality of R&D has attracted most attention. Recently, a consensus has emerged that total and private R&D expenditures are procyclical. My findings for R&D investment (from the R&DSA) confirm this procyclicality result. Contemporaneous crosscorrelations with GDP in the range of 0.5 to 0.6 match the findings in the literature for industrial R&D expenditures (from NSF) well.\n8 The current analysis extends the business cycle measures to several cost components of R&D, S&E labor, as well as R&D capital and establishes procyclicality except for the latter.\n6 Business cycle summary statistics for standard series based on annual data are provided in Table 8 in Appendix A. More business cycle statistics for R&D related series, in particular series based on NSF data, are reported in Mand (2014, Ch. 3) .\n7 Note that the corresponding correlation for total R&D investment, which in addition includes federally funded R&D, is a bit higher, namely about 0.6.\n8 Barlevy (2007) reports a correlation of 0.39 between R&D expenditure growth and GDP growth, while Nu\u00f1o (2011) computes 0.27. Comin and Gertler (2006) decompose R&D expenditures into trend, medium-frequency oscillation, and high-frequency fluctuation and find a contemporaneous correlation of 0.3 at both frequencies. Following the RBC approach, Cahn (2012) finds a contemporaneous correlation coefficient of 0.48. W\u00e4lde and Woitek (2004) provide similar evidence for most G7 countries. "}, {"section_title": "Model", "text": "The aim of the analysis is to investigate how relevant the opportunity cost hypothesis is quantitatively for business cycle patterns of R&D activities in the light of endogenous labor supply. For this, I incorporate endogenous growth into an otherwise standard RBC model. This facilitates the calibration of the model's parameters and allows me to compare the business cycle properties of the model to the RBC literature. The building blocks of the model are: a competitive final goods sector that benefits from an increasing division of labor; a monopolistically competitive machine production sector; a R&D sector employing both goods and labor inputs; a representative household that takes a consumption-savings decision, labor-leisure decision, and a portfolio choice decision.\nThe model focuses on the R&D sector which generates economic growth endogenously through horizontal innovations\u00e0 la Romer (1990) . Guided by detailed evidence from the National Science Foundation, the model considers a more realistic framework of the R&D process that allows for multiple inputs. In this way, substitution possibilities and complementarities between R&D inputs, which will be crucial for the cyclical properties of R&D activities, are introduced into the analysis. Therefore, my paper contributes a novel channel to explain the procyclical nature of R&D. The existing literature, in contrast, has so far only focused on a single R&D input, studying either the knowledge-driven specification or the lab-equipment specification of R&D.\nThe model enables an examination of how the cyclicality of R&D investment depends on the relative importance of labor inputs in R&D activities. By successively switching on features like endogenous labor supply or R&D labor, their importance for the cyclical properties of equilibrium R&D are assessed. Finally, the paper also addresses the question of how does the cyclicality of R&D activities influence long-run productivity growth."}, {"section_title": "Economy", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Final goods production", "text": "Final goods Y are produced by competitive firms that hire production workers l Y and rent a set of machines, X(m), m \u2208 [0, M t ].

The parameters \u03c9, \u03c8 \u2208 [0; 1] control the wage shares of scientists and R&D supporting workers, respectively.\nWhile single input specifications have been very popular with the endogenous growth literature, the proposed IPF, which I call multi-input specification, is more general. It allows for three different input factors and nests both well-known special cases: the labequipment specification for \u03c9 = \u03c8 = 0 and the knowledge-driven specification for \u03c8 = 1, \u03c9 = 0. Besides, the literature usually considers only one type of labor, which is split up between production and R&D, whereas the present model distinguishes between two types: scientists, who can be employed only in the R&D sector, and workers, who can be employed in both producing goods and supporting R&D. This distinction is motivated by the objection that production workers may be a poor substitute for scientists and engineers in undertaking research and vice versa.\n11 Rather, S&E labor is found to be quite inelastic at business cycle frequencies (Goolsbee, 1998; Romer, 2001) . For this reason, I believe that separating scientists from R&D supporting workers is essential when assessing the quantitative relevance of the opportunity costs hypothesis.\nThe choice of a Cobb-Douglas functional form is motivated by NSF evidence (shown in Figure 2 ) that the wage bill shares of both scientists & engineers and R&D supporting personnel in industrial R&D funds remained quite stable during the postwar period. Besides, Table 1 reveals that the cyclical properties of private R&D investment by cost type are very similar.\nProfits of the representative R&D firm are sales revenues net of R&D costs which consist of the wage bill of scientists W S s R , the wage bill of supporting R&D personnel W l R , and goods costs Z.\nProfit maximization implies the following optimal relative factor demand functions\nwhich display substitution possibilities among R&D inputs.

Note that except for this knowledge spillover, the productivity of R&D does not change over time.

This link gives birth to a channel allocating relatively more labor to the R&D sector, which may counteract the opportunity cost argument.

On the one hand, Goolsbee (1998) argues that labor supply of scientists and engineers is quite inelastic in the short run, estimating elasticities of supply between 0.1 and 0.2. On the other hand, the business cycle statistics reported in Table 1 reveal that labor supply of scientists and engineers is about twice as volatile as labor supply of workers. Matching this business cycle fact, however, requires a high Frisch elasticity.\n18 See also the survey on estimates of the Frisch elasticity by Chetty, Guren, Manoli, and Weber (2011) and the discussion by R\u00edos-Rull, Schorfheide, Fuentes-Albero, Kryshko, and Santaeul\u00e0lia-Llopis (2012). innovators can charge should be higher than typical estimates for the average markup in the U.S. economy due to patent protection and upfront fixed costs.

Moreover, the classical knowledge-driven model assumes \u03c6 = 1 \u03c1 \u2212 1. Hence, returns to specialization are implicitly pinned down by the calibrated value of the markup.\n19 The resulting parameter values are reported in Table 4 ."}, {"section_title": "Inspecting the mechanism: impulse response functions", "text": "Before analysing the business cycle properties of both model economies, this section provides some intuition for the workings of both the knowledge-driven model and the multiinput model. To this end, I examine and compare the impulse responses to a shock to total factor productivity resulting from the calibrated models."}, {"section_title": "Impulse response functions of the knowledge-driven model", "text": "First, consider the knowledge-driven model in which labor is the only input into R&D. Recall that in this specification the household only supplies one type of labor which can be used in goods production as well as for R&D. Figure 3 shows the impulse responses to a 1% TFP shock (\u03b7 = 1%) which dies out gradually at an annual rate of 15 per cent.\nAs it is typical for the basic RBC model, output, investment and hours worked all jump together with exogenous productivity upwards and then vanish over time. Consumption and capital, in contrast, show a hump-shaped response due to the preference for smooth consumption paths.\nRegarding the response of R&D activities, the real wage is crucial in the knowledgedriven model. Initially, the marginal product of labor in goods production jumps up less than exogenous productivity. One reason is that this unusually high opportunity cost of leisure induces the household to supply more hours worked. Another reason is the reallocation of workers from R&D to goods production. Note that an equilibrium in the labor market requires the value marginal products of labor to equal in both sectors. As the knowledge-driven model assumes an innovation possibilities frontier that is linear in R&D labor, the value marginal product of labor is proportional to the value of an innovation. Hence, restoring equilibrium in the labor market after a positive TFP shock requires the value of an innovation to rise correspondingly, necessitating a reduction in R&D activities. In other words, R&D workers are dismissed and move to goods productions as long as their marginal product is higher there. Consequently, the initial response of R&D labor to a positive TFP shock is negative, while the response of production workers is not only positive but also stronger than the increase in labor supply. Furthermore, R&D investments, which correspond to the R&D wage bill in this case, show a positive hump-shaped response since the initial drop in R&D labor vanishes faster than the rise in the real wage. Finally, an immediate result of the decline in R&D labor is the discovery of less innovations. That is, R&D output is continually below trend. This endogenous growth repercussion dampens the original productivity shock and accumulates in the long run to a drop in total factor productivity relative to the pre-shock trend. Specifically, ensuing a positive shock of 1%, the level of TFP is 0.079% lower after 10 years than without this endogenous growth channel, as the lower right panel of Figure 3 shows."}, {"section_title": "Impulse response functions of the multi-input model", "text": "Now, turn to the multi-input model. In this specification there are three inputs into R&D: goods, scientists, and workers. These complement each other so that the reallocation of labor across sectors will be countered. This can be seen in Figure 4 which displays the impulse responses corresponding to a 1% TFP shock (\u03b7 = 1%) for the multi-input model. While the responses of output, consumption, investment, capital and hours worked show the usual patterns, the impact on R&D activities differs substantially from the knowledgedriven model discussed above.\nAs before, labor supply of workers jumps initially upwards and then gradually declines with the TFP shock. In sharp contrast to the knowledge-driven model above, employment of R&D supporting workers increases substantially ensuing the TFP shock -specifically much stronger than total supply of workers -and follows a hump-shaped response. The same is true for hours worked by scientists, but to a lesser extent. Lastly, goods inputs into R&D and, hence, R&D investments increase stronger than output. They also show a hump-shaped pattern. While the response of scientists' labor comes from the usual consumption-leisure tradeoff, the impact on R&D investment depends on how all the additional output is used. Typically, the household decides to consume only a small fraction and invest most of it. There are two investment opportunities in this economy: physical capital and innovations. The household chooses to invest in both in order to equalize their expected returns. Finally, the rise in both scientists' labor and goods inputs into R&D increase the marginal product of R&D supporting workers. This, in turn, allows employment of R&D supporting workers to rise compared to a situation with constant marginal product as in the knowledge-driven model. This effect works against the reallocation of workers from R&D to production that is the direct consequence of the productivity shock in the labor market. Under the current calibration, this complementarity effect actually dominates. As a result, all three R&D inputs and, hence, R&D output increase following a positive TFP shock. Again, the endogenous growth effect accumulates over time, as the lower right panel of Figure 4 illustrates. In this case, however, it fosters the original productivity shock so that total factor productivity increases in the long-run compared to the pre-shock trend. The calibrated multi-input model implies that a 1% positive TFP shock raises endogenous TFP A by additional 0.257% within 10 years. As a consequence, the deviation of TFP from its original trend is about twice as high with endogenous rather than exogenous growth. Besides, more than 40% of the original TFP shock become persistent in the long-run, while in an exogenous growth model the same TFP shock would not have any permanent effect.\nIn a nutshell, the key findings for the multi-input specification of the R&D process are: Firstly, positive TFP shocks foster R&D activities. Secondly, the endogenous growth mechanism amplifies business cycle fluctuations considerably and makes them cast long shadows. All variables are defined as logarithms of real per-capita measures. The business cycle component is calculated as deviation from trend, using the HP-filter with smoothing parameter \u03bb = 100. According to these transformations, one can interpret the cyclical components as percentage deviations from the trend.\nReported figures for the model economies are sample means of statistics computed for each of 67600 simulations, each of which was 49 periods long as is the U.S. time series."}, {"section_title": "Findings: cyclical behavior of the model economies", "text": "This section quantitatively analyzes the cyclical properties of R&D activities in both model specifications: the knowledge-driven model and the multi-input model.

Second, I demonstrate that the multi-input specification of the R&D process improves in matching business cycle moments of the U.S. economy. In the calibrated model economy booms foster TFP through the endogenous growth channel."}, {"section_title": "Business cycle moments of the knowledge-driven model", "text": "While for the U.S. economy both R&D investment and R&D labor are procyclical, the calibrated knowledge-driven model predicts countercyclical employment in the research sector as well as weakly countercyclical R&D investment (Table 5) . Figures 5 and 6 investigate how these cyclicality results depend on the calibrated parameter values of the labor supply elasticity and the markup, respectively. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the knowledge-driven model may generate procyclical R&D investment for reasonable parameter values: labor supply needs to be a bit more elastic than in the benchmark calibration or the markup a little lower.\nIn order to render R&D labor procyclical, however, either labor supply has to be very elastic (with values of the Frisch elasticity 1/\u03b3 exceeding 3; see Figure 5 ) or machine pro- ducers can earn only low margins of less than 10% (Figure 6 ). The reason is that for high values of the labor supply elasticity the procyclicality of total labor supply dominates the opportunity cost effect, which reallocates labor from R&D activities to goods production during a boom. However, such calibrations are at odds with the literature. Recently there has emerged a consensus that advocates an aggregate Frisch elasticity of around 1 (cf. Chetty, Guren, Manoli, and Weber, 2011; R\u00edos-Rull, Schorfheide, Fuentes-Albero, Kryshko, and Santaeul\u00e0lia-Llopis, 2012; Trabandt and Uhlig, 2011 , and the literature discussed therein). Moreover, the literature seems to agree that a markup of 20% constitutes a lower bound for capital goods (Barlevy, 2007; Comin, 2004; Comin and Gertler, 2006) .\nRather for a large range of standard parameterizations, the knowledge-driven model results in countercyclical R&D labor, which is counterfactual. Countercyclical employment in the R&D sector, in turn, implies that R&D output is countercyclical, too. Consequently, the endogenous growth mechanism weakens TFP growth. Figures 5 and 6 show that these growth repercussions are valid for a broad range of plausible parameter values. Therefore, I conclude that the knowledge-driven model predicts booms to weaken TFP growth.\nFinally, the knowledge-driven model predicts that R&D activities fluctuate little over the business cycle, while in U.S. data they are more than twice as volatile as GDP (Table 5). This holds true for the whole range of parameter values considered for the labor supply elasticity and the markup as Figures 5 and 6 show. First, employment of scientists fluctuates substantially less in the knowledge-driven model economy than the U.S. economy. Second, R&D investment is unrelentingly less volatile than GDP. Even worse, the model-implied volatility is particularly low for the preferred parameter values.\nIn conclusion, the popular knowledge-driven specification of the R&D process has a hard time to generate procyclical R&D: while R&D investments -which are identical to the wage bill of scientists in the knowledge-driven model -may plausibly be procyclical due to procyclical wage rates, the opportunity cost argument constitutes a strong incentive for R&D labor and R&D output to be countercyclical. This is clearly at odds with the empirical evidence. Moreover, the knowledge-driven model tends to predict that R&D activities are considerably less volatile than observed in U.S. data."}, {"section_title": "Business cycle moments of the multi-input model", "text": "In contrast to the knowledge-driven model, the multi-input specification of the R&D process is capable to generate procyclical R&D investment, procyclical employment of scientists, and procyclical employment of R&D supporting personnel. Therefore, it can replicate the data. Due to this procyclicality of inputs, the endogenous growth mechanism gives rise to amplification of business cycle shocks. In other words, booms promote productivity growth. In the following, I discuss my findings.\nThe calibrated multi-input model predicts that both employment of scientists and R&D investment are procyclical (Table 5 ). This is true independently of the parameter values for both Frisch elasticities and the markup, as the sensitivity analysis in Appendix B.2 shows (Figures 10 -12) . Interestingly, even for low values of the labor supply elasticity employment of R&D supporting workers is not countercyclical. This suggests that intersectoral reallocation of labor is much less attractive when the R&D process involves multiple inputs. One reason for this weak opportunity cost effect in the multi-input model is that substitution possibilities among inputs are not perfect. Rather, R&D inputs complement each other. Since a substantial share of them is supplied procyclically, the marginal product of workers in R&D increases during a boom. Everything else equal, this reduces the incentive to shift R&D workers to production activities. As a consequence, R&D output will be procyclical, too. That is, a positive TFP shock fosters R&D and improves total factor productivity. ity of R&D activities. The experiment underlying these graphs is to vary the combined share of labor inputs in R&D \u03c9 + \u03c8, simulate the corresponding model economy, and compute the cross-correlation of R&D activities with GDP. This exercise is motivated by the finding of Aghion and Saint-Paul (1998) that the cyclical pattern of R&D differs completely whether a lab-equipment or a knowledge-driven specification of R&D is employed. That is, this exercise explores the whole range of input combinations, whereas the previous literature has only studied the two the boundary cases of my multi-input specification. In contrast to Aghion and Saint-Paul (1998) , I allow for endogenous labor supply and consider different values of the Frisch elasticity because endogenous labor supply and intersectoral reallocation of labor work in opposite directions. To this purpose, I pick three values of the elasticity that cover the range of plausible parameter values.\nFigure 7 reveals that for low R&D labor shares R&D activities are clearly procyclical, independent of the labor supply elasticity. In this case goods, which are the main ingredient of R&D, impose their procyclical pattern upon both labor inputs. Consequently, booms foster TFP growth. This is in line with Aghion and Saint-Paul (1998)'s finding for a lab-equipment model. However, if labor were dominant in R&D activities (with the combined R&D labor share exceeding 50 per cent), R&D supporting personnel as well as S&E employment could become countercyclical. Note that the turning point depends on the Frisch elasticity: the less elastic labor supply is, the sooner the opportunity cost effect dominates and R&D labor becomes countercyclical. Finally, R&D output becomes countercyclical in this case despite R&D investment remains procyclical. Again, this is in line with Aghion and Saint-Paul (1998)'s finding that in a knowledge-driven economy recessions enhance productivity.\nTo sum up, procyclical R&D inputs -as observed in U.S. data -imply that endogenous TFP, i.e. R&D output, is procyclical, too. The sensitivity analysis shows that this outcome is largely independent of parameter values for both Frisch elasticities and the markup, whereas large R&D labor shares may overturn this finding. However, the latter does not seem to be the case for the U.S. economy. Its R&D labor share is moderate. Rather, the calibrated multi-input specification implies that TFP shocks are amplified through the endogenous growth mechanism. That is, booms enhance economic growth."}, {"section_title": "Robustness: targeting R&D capital", "text": "This section considers an alternative calibration exercise and discusses the robustness of previous findings. The R&D Satellite Accounts allow for another plausible way of identifying model parameters: as these accounts provide data on R&D capital, the R&D-capitaloutput-ratio can be targeted instead of the markup.

However, the markup-calibration slightly outperforms the R&D-stock-calibration with respect to volatilities.\nIn conclusion, the robustness analysis confirms that knowledge-driven models fail to explain procyclical R&D labor while multi-input economies perform reasonably well in quantitatively characterizing the cyclical properties of R&D activities."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Employing a calibrated real business cycle model featuring R&D-based growth, I quantitatively study the implications of business cycle shocks for R&D activities. First, the paper may settle the discussion on the role of endogenous labor supply for procyclical R&D activities in knowledge-driven model economies. I show that for reasonable values of the labor supply elasticity the opportunity cost effect dominates. Therefore, the knowledge-driven specification is not capable to generate procyclical R&D labor, as observed in the data. Second, I propose a multi-input specification of the R&D process, which is able to generate procyclical R&D activities. The main finding is that the multiinput model, calibrated to the post-war U.S. economy, captures both procyclical R&D investment and procyclical employment of scientists at the same time. Consequently, booms promote productivity growth. The reason is that business cycle shocks are amplified by the endogenous growth mechanism. This result stands in contrast to the prediction of the simple knowledge-driven model. This highlights that the specification of the R&D process is crucial for the cyclical properties of R&D activities, as already indicated by theoretical findings of Aghion and Saint-Paul (1998) .\nOne obvious extension to improve the quantitative performance of the multi-input model is to consider additional shocks. Specifically, I regard two shortcomings of the calibrated multi-input model as especially pressing: First, the benchmark model predicts that all measures of R&D are quite strongly correlated with GDP. Of course, this is not at all surprising in view of the fact that this simple model considers only one shock, namely the TFP shock. Second, the benchmark model does not produce enough volatility in R&D activities. To address these dimensions, the introduction of a shock to the productivity of R&D effort seems to be promising. When the productivity of both goods production and R&D is stochastic, the opportunity cost effect will depend on the relative productivity of both sectors. As long as both productivity shocks are uncorrelated, I expect R&D activities to remain procyclical, but the size of this correlation to be lower. Furthermore, the fluctuations in the productivity of R&D effort should make R&D inputs more volatile. Unfortunately, it is not possible to estimate such a R&D-productivity-shock process as a Solow residual in R&D, because R&D output is not observable. Lacking this discipline, all one can do is to calibrate such a R&D-productivity-shock process so that it matches the cyclical properties of R&D by construction. However, in my view such an exercise does not shed much light on the determinants of procyclical R&D activities.\nThe novel determinant this paper proposes is the complementarity of goods and labor inputs in the innovation process. In particular, the simulations of the multi-input model substantiate the importance of the R&D labor share for the cyclicality of R&D. As Figure 7 has shown, the correlations of all three R&D inputs -scientists, R&D supporting workers, and goods -decline in the combined R&D labor share. These three predictions which deal with the specification of the R&D process are, in principle, testable implications of the multi-input model. One way to implement such a test is to exploit the variation in R&D labor shares across U.S. industries. Unfortunately, the NSF does not collect data on the employment of R&D supporting workers which would have shed light on the intersectoral reallocation of workers directly. However, the NSF reports annual industry-level data on employment of scientists and engineers as well as R&D costs for the years 1962 to 1977. Figure 8 illustrates the correlations of R&D activities in 27 U.S. industries with aggregate GDP. The data reveal that the cyclicality of R&D activities differs considerably Corr(E i , GDP ) = 1.6617 * * * \u2212 0.0224\nCorr(E i , GDP ) = 1.7017 * * * \u2212 0.0202\nwhere\ni /E i denote industry i's average wage bill share of scientists and engineers and R&D supporting worker, respectively.\nData sources: Bureau of Economic Analysis, R&D Satellite Account; National Science Foundation across industries. In line with Ouyang (2011) , this suggest that R&D activities at the industry level are not completely synchronized with the business cycle. Nevertheless, the cyclicality of both R&D costs and of scientists and engineers are negatively related to the combined R&D labor share, as Figure 8 shows. In addition, robustness checks, not reported here, qualitatively confirm these connections when considering industry cycles, measured by value added or multifactor productivity, instead. These negative correlations are supportive for the multi-input specification of R&D which predicts the cyclicality of R&D activities to decline in the combined R&D labor share.\nHowever, these empirical findings may suffer from limited vigor due to lacking data. First, the available time-series of annual R&D inputs at the industry level typically cover only two or three cycles. Second, data on R&D inputs is only available for a limited number of industries. Third, the model simulations suggest to control for the volatility of R&D labor supply which fails in practice due to lacking hours-worked data of R&D supporting workers. Another shortcoming of this industry-level analysis is that the industry-level R&D data contains both R&D conducted within the industry and R&D purchased from outside which should be analysed separately. In sum, all these limitations call for empirical work using rich firm-level data to estimate the relationship between the cyclicality of R&D activities and the R&D labor share. Finally, the current paper has also implications for the work on optimal R&D over the business cycle. Some authors argue that due to market frictions such as dynamic R&D externalities (e.g. Barlevy, 2007; Nu\u00f1o, 2011) or credit constraints (Aghion, Angeletos, Banerjee, and Manova, 2010) equilibrium R&D is procyclical rather than countercyclical. Hence the equilibrium outcome is not Pareto-optimal and an optimal intervention should reverse the timing of R&D, e.g. by subsidizing R&D activities in recessions. However, such studies typically rely on either a knowledge-driven or a lab-equipment specification of R&D. While both of them abstract from complementarities between R&D inputs, my quantitative findings suggest that these complementarities are essential for shaping the cyclical patterns of R&D activities. Therefore, my analysis raises doubts as to whether findings regarding the cyclicality of R&D in a Pareto-optimal economy are robust to a generalization of the innovation possibility frontier. For example, one may infer from a knowledge-driven model that recessions are ideal times to conduct R&D. However, allowing also for goods inputs into R&D may overturn this conclusion. In other words, the main message of the multi-input model is to treat policy recommendations on cyclical R&D subsidies or stabilization policies derived from classical knowledge-driven or labequipment models with caution. Rather, a sound assessment of welfare-improving policy interventions calls for a careful modeling of the R&D process. -25 (1957-1970) and H-19 (1971-1999) , and for later years in various issues of its \"Research and Development in Industry\" reports.\nA.2 Adjustments to NIPA data to be in line with R&DSA definitions Currently, BEAs national economic accounts treat spending on R&D as expenses or consumption rather than investment. The 2013 NIPA Comprehensive Revision will capitalize R&D. By then, BEAs R&D Satellite Account provides data on U.S. R&D activity and shows the impact of treating R&D spending as investment on GDP and investment (Aizcorbe, Moylan, and Robbins, 2009; Mataloni and Moylan, 2007) . Mataloni and Moylan (2007) illustrate in detail how R&D investment is derived from NSF data on R&D 20 and how the incorporation of R&D investment into the NIPAs will affect the definition of core measures such as GDP, investment, government consumption etc. Table A of Mataloni and Moylan (2007) provides a brief overview of the revisions. Alas, BEA does not publish a R&DSA dataset comparable to the NIPAs. However, the data published in Lee and Schmidt (2010) , the current version of the R&DSA, allows me to reconstruct R&DSA-conform aggregates as follows:\n(49) P CE R&DSA = P CE N IP A \u2212 RDI N P I + CSRD and P CE denotes personal consumption expenditures, G government consumption, I physical investment, RDI R&D investment, SDC the R&D software double-count, and CSRD Capital Services generated by R&D. Superscripts N P I and Gov indicate nonprofit institutions and the government, respectively. According to Mataloni and Moylan (2007) , the R&DSA removes double-counted R&D software development from NIPA software investment and retains it in R&D investment. For the period 1978 -2001, I back out SDC from Table 1 .2 of Robbins and Moylan (2007) . Prior to 1978 no adjustment is made in the R&DSA. For recent years, which have been revised in Lee and Schmidt (2010) , I calculate the residual SDC = GDP N IP A +total adjustments\u2212GDP R&DSA from Table C. In principle, one would have to correct the NIPA software capital stock measures for the double-count of R&D software development. However, BEA does not publish corresponding corrections for the fixed asset account. Given a software-fraction of at most 1.5% in private fixed assets, the R&D software double-count issue seems to be negligible for the capital stock. Figure 9 displays R&D investment and R&D capital from the R&DSA. The left panel shows the share of R&D investment in GDP. The total R&D share displays some mediumrun fluctuations around its mean of 2.7%. These fluctuations stem from the phased decline in federal government's funding of extramural R&D combined with subsequent rise in private R&D funding. Adding both time series up, yields a stable share of 2.3% on average.\nThe right panel shows that since the mid-1960s R&D capital has amounted to a constant fraction of the physical capital stock, namely 4.5% for total R&D capital and about 4% for private plus extramural R&D. In the analysis of business cycle patterns I consider the sum of private and federal government's extramural R&D investment (capital) as the appropriate measure of R&D investment (capital) as they reflect industrially performed R&D best.\nA.3 More Business Cycle Statistics at annual Frequency All variables are defined as logarithms of real per-capita measures which are computed by normalizing with the price index for GDP and the civilian noninstitutional population, aged 16 years and over. The business cycle component is calculated as deviation from trend, using the HP-filter with smoothing parameter \u03bb = 100. According to these transformations, one can interpret the cyclical components as percentage deviations from the trend. a Standard deviations are reported in percentage terms. 1 Period 1962 1 Period -2007 between 1977 and 1997 "}]
