[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "To determine if APOE e4 influences the association between white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).\nA total of 289 patients (AD = 239; DLB = 50) underwent volumetric MRI, neuropsychological testing, and APOE e4 genotyping. Total WMH volumes were quantified. Neuropsychological test scores were included in a confirmatory factor analysis to identify cognitive domains encompassing attention/executive functions, learning/memory, and language, and factor scores for each domain were calculated per participant. After testing interactions between WMH and APOE e4 in the full sample, we tested associations of WMH with factor scores using linear regression models in APOE e4 carriers (n = 167) and noncarriers (n = 122). We hypothesized that greater WMH volume would relate to worse cognition more strongly in APOE e4 carriers. Findings were replicated in 198 patients with AD from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-I), and estimates from both samples were metaanalyzed.\nWhite matter hyperintensities (WMH) observed on structural MRI indicate cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) in most cases, 1 are risk factors for cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease (AD), 2,3 and are prevalent in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). 4,5 However, observed cognitive performance clinically does not always reflect the severity of the WMH burden. 6, 7 There are several reasons for the complex association between WMH and cognition: the etiology of WMH is heterogeneous, including vascular compromise and ischemia, venous collagenosis, leading to vasogenic edema, 8,9 cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), or a combination of these, 10 and genetic vulnerability to neurodegeneration.\nThe APOE e4 allele is the strongest known genetic risk factor for sporadic AD, and is a risk factor for DLB, 11,12 CAA, 13 and SVD. 14 Despite these associations, it remains unknown if APOE e4 modulates the relationship between WMH and cognition across the dementias, i.e., if APOE e4 is an effect modifier in this association. Therefore, we examined the role of APOE e4 on the association between WMH and cognitive domains in patients with AD and patients with DLB with varying degrees of SVD. We tested associations with domain-specific cognitive impairment instead of global cognition because at different disease stages, impairment might be more apparent in certain domains and not others. We hypothesized that (1) higher WMH burden would be more strongly associated with worse cognition in APOE e4 carriers than noncarriers and the association would be APOE e4 allele dosage dependent, (2) this association would be irrespective of the clinical diagnosis, and (3) if Glossary A\u03b2 = \u03b2-amyloid; AD = Alzheimer disease; ADNI-I = Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Phase I; ANOVA = analysis of variance; BDS = backward digit span; BNT = Boston Naming Test; CAA = cerebral amyloid angiopathy; CFA = Confirmatory Factor Analysis; CFI = comparative fit index; CI = confidence interval; CVLT = California Verbal Learning Test; DLB = dementia with Lewy bodies; DSST = Digit Symbol Substitution Task; FDS = forward digit span; MMSE = Mini-Mental State Examination; PD = proton density; PF-FAS = Controlled Oral Word Association task-Phonemic Fluency; RAVLT = Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test; RMSEA = root mean square error of approximation; SDS = Sunnybrook Dementia Study; SF = Semantic Fluency; SRMR = standardized root mean square; SVD = small vessel disease; TIV = total intracranial volume; WCST = Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; WMH = white matter hyperintensities; WMS = Wechsler Memory Scale."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "A significant interaction was observed between WMH and APOE e4 for language, but not for memory or executive functions.

For regression, model I was adjusted for age and sex only; II was additionally adjusted for education and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Analyses were also repeated in APOE e4 heterozygotes (n = 91) and homozygotes (n = 40).\nSince power was limited in both our study samples, we metaanalyzed the \u03b2-coefficients from SDS and ADNI-I for all 3 cognitive scores to obtain more robust estimates. 30 This was done using the metan command in Stata, 31 which uses inverse variance weighting method.\nLevel of significance was set at 0.05 (two-sided) for all statistical tests, and all analyses were performed using Stata Software Version 14.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).\nCharacteristics of the study sample are summarized in table 5.

The number of patients who completed each test differed; this variability was dependent on dementia severity. Ninety percent of patients had completed at least 8 neuropsychological tests.\nAge, sex, years of education, diabetes mellitus type 2 (present vs absent), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg), hypertension (present vs absent), smoking status (never, past, or current smoking), and dementia diagnosis (AD or DLB) were considered potential confounders.\nRelationships between the following cognitive factors and observed test scores were hypothesized and tested using CFA: (1) attention/executive functions (FDS, BDS, Trails A, WCST-perseverative errors, PF-FAS, DSST), (2) learning/ memory (CVLT-total acquisition score, trials 1-5, CVLTlong delay free and cued recall, WMS-immediate recall, delayed recall), and (3) language (BNT, SF, PF-FAS). Scores for WCST and Trails A were inverse-coded for consistency with other test scores.\nWe used the following multiple linear regression model in the SDS sample (n = 289) to test associations of WMH with executive functions, memory, and language, and an interaction between WMH and APOE e4 carrier status:\nCognitive factor score = \u03b20 + \u03b21 * WMH volume + \u03b22 * APOE e4 carrier status + \u03b23 * (WMH volume \u00d7 APOE e4 carrier status) + \u03b24 * age + \u03b2 5 * sex + \u03b26 * education + \u03b27 * diabetes mellitus + \u03b28 * systolic blood pressure + \u03b29 * diastolic blood pressure + \u03b210 * smoking + \u03b211 * clinical dementia diagnosis.\nFurther, we tested associations of WMH with the cognitive domains in APOE e4 carriers and noncarriers separately using a similar model, but without APOE e4 and its interaction term.\nFor each regression, 2 models were fitted. Model I was adjusted for age and sex; II was additionally adjusted for years of education, diabetes mellitus type 2, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, smoking status, and dementia diagnosis. We also repeated model II by replacing systolic and diastolic blood pressure by hypertension.\nThe following variables had missing values and were dealt with by multiple imputation using chained equations in Stata: systolic and diastolic blood pressure and smoking (2.8%, n = 8), diabetes (3.1%, n = 9), and years of education (0.3%, n = 1). All available covariates were used as predictors for imputation.\nSince studies suggest that WMH are not associated with cognition in DLB, but in AD only, 4, 5 we repeated the analyses in APOE \u025b4 carriers and noncarriers excluding DLB cases.\nIn a post hoc analysis, we tested if associations between WMH and cognitive domains in APOE \u025b4 carriers were dependent on APOE e4 allele dosage. After comparing study characteristics and WMH volumes by APOE \u025b4 allele dosage (0, 1, or 2 alleles) using analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Tukey post hoc) and \u03c7 2 tests for continuous and categorical variables, respectively, we repeated our analyses in APOE \u025b4 heterozygotes (n = 130) and APOE \u025b4 homozygotes (n = 37).\nWe explored the prevalence of CAA by APOE \u025b4 carrier status in our autopsy subsample (n = 34). This analysis was conditional on our primary results, i.e., to be performed if indeed WMH were associated with worse cognition more strongly in APOE \u00ab4 carriers than noncarriers. In this case, we hypothesized that since APOE e4 is a risk factor for CAA, the likely etiology of WMH in carriers is CAA, which might be more toxic than WMH caused by vascular compromise or ischemia due to cardiovascular risk factors alone. We compared the numbers of patients with CAA by APOE e4 carrier status and by allele dosage using the Fisher exact test. Since studies suggest that CAA is more prevalent in APOE e2 carriers, 29 we also examined the number of persons with CAA across genotypes: e2-e3 (n = 2), e3-e3 (n = 12), e3-e4 (n = 13), and e4-e4 (n = 7); however, statistical comparisons could not be made due to small numbers within some cells.\nCharacteristics of the study sample are presented in table 1. Participant characteristics or WMH volumes did not differ between APOE e4 carriers and noncarriers.

An interaction between WMH and APOE e4 (p value 0.02) was observed for language, but not for executive functions (p value 0.26) or memory (p value 0.11). With our a priori hypothesis that WMH relate to cognition differently in carriers and noncarriers, and a significant interaction observed between WMH and APOE e4 for language, we performed analyses separately in APOE e4 carriers and noncarriers for all cognitive domains.\nIn these analyses, greater WMH volumes were associated with worse attention/executive functions, learning/memory, and language in only APOE e4 carriers; no associations were observed in noncarriers (table 3) . Replacing blood pressure with hypertension did not change results.\nAfter excluding patients with DLB (n = 50), a similar pattern of results was obtained (table 4) .\nHomozygous APOE e4 carriers were younger than noncarriers and heterozygous carriers (ANOVA p value < 0.001).

Moreover, this was consistent across the AD/DLB spectrum, in contrast to previous studies. 4, 5 After excluding patients with DLB from the SDS sample, the associations of WMH volume with executive functions, memory, and language remained significant. Cerebral SVD can be considered a relevant copathology across the AD/DLB spectrum. Because of the high frequency of coexisting neurodegenerative pathologies, 32, 33 shared risk factors and pathologies cannot be disentangled if samples are segregated on clinical diagnoses alone. 15 Although a unified model with an interaction term is the optimum method to test effect modification, an important limitation is that more statistical power is required than for association testing, and thus false-negative results may be seen in smaller samples. The documented strong biological effects of APOE e4 28 formed the basis of our a priori hypothesis; that is, greater WMH burden relates more strongly with worse cognition in APOE e4 carriers, which is why we also tested associations separately in carriers and noncarriers irrespective of the interaction results. Given the strong biological rationale, limited sample size, and a significant interaction observed for the language domain, this was a valid approach, which has also been used by other groups. 34, 35 However, studies in larger sample sizes are warranted.\nThe replication of worse executive functions and language in relation to higher WMH in ADNI-I APOE e4 carriers is remarkable, and also validates our findings. Notably, ADNI-I comprises cases with relatively lower WMH burden compared to SDS, 17 and this finding indicates that APOE e4 may contribute to worse cognitive performance in those with even lower burden of cerebral SVD. Effect estimates for memory did not reach significance in the ADNI-I sample, which might be explained by lack of power. However, the significant association of greater WMH volume with cognitive impairment across all 3 domains observed in the meta-analysis supports our primary findings.\nWhile our data supported our hypothesis, it failed to show an allele dosage effect. This could be a result of the small size of the homozygous group; however, the similar pattern of results in both SDS and ADNI-I suggests that this is not just a power issue. There are several possible considerations. The first consideration is age and cardiovascular risk factor distribution. Although in both study samples, age did not differ between APOE e4 carriers and noncarriers, among carriers, homozygotes were younger. In the SDS sample, the homozygous group was not only younger, but it also had less WMH and cardiovascular risk factor burden, which might explain our findings. Second, since we adjusted for these pertinent confounders, a complex interaction may exist among APOE e4, vascular risk factors, WMH, and cognition. 36, 37 Specifically, a higher vascular risk factor burden combined with APOE e4 genotype results in reduced white matter integrity and predicts faster cognitive decline. 37 Third, the observed association might also be dependent on the disease stage in addition to age, such that the association of WMH and cognition becomes more apparent with advancing age and dementia progression. 38 Increasing age becomes an important determinant of cognitive decline when effects of APOE e4 and its interactions with other risk factors are at play. 39, 40 The mechanisms underlying this association may be A\u03b2-dependent, A\u03b2-independent, or both. In addition to causing accelerated cerebral amyloid deposition and impaired clearance of A\u03b2, APOE e4 can cause detrimental effects on brain through vascular pathways. APOE e4 is associated with neurovascular dysfunction, has a synergistic effect with atherosclerosis by disrupting cholesterol homeostasis, and also affects vessels via CAA. These synergistic effects can drastically compound the damaging effects of WMH in APOE e4 carriers. 41 Faster WMH progression rates were noted in APOE e4-positive patients with AD and healthy adults, supporting our interaction hypothesis. 38, 42 APOE e4 carriers might also have more covert white matter damage that is not detected by routine imaging, 43 but is reflected as worse cognitive outcomes. Future large prospective studies are needed.\nWMH burden reflects a worse cerebrovascular status, potentially increasing vulnerability to neurodegeneration. Higher WMH volume has been associated with reduced cerebral perfusion both in hyperintense areas and normalappearing white matter. 44 Normal-appearing white matter surrounding WMH already exhibits subtle damage, 43 and will likely develop into areas of T2 MRI-detectable WMH. Also, neuroinflammation is a key feature in AD, 45 and APOE e4 carriers have increased levels of plasma inflammatory markers compared to noncarriers, and may also have a differential regulation of neuroinflammatory responses compared to other APOE isoforms. 46, 47 WMH might be a consequence of neuroinflammation. 48 Our neuropathology data showed high agreement between our clinical diagnosis and the definitive pathologic diagnosis. Although our data showed that 100% of homozygous APOE e4 carriers had CAA compared to 64% of heterozygotes, it did not show that WMH burden was associated with worse cognition in people with 2 alleles, and should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size. While we cannot deduce that worse cognitive outcomes in APOE e4 carriers with WMH are due to CAA, we can speculate that CAA is the more likely etiology for WMH in APOE e4 carriers than in noncarriers, or the likelihood of CAA increases with each added APOE e4 allele. The accelerated amyloid deposition in APOE e4 carriers together with CAA may have a multiplicative detrimental effect on cognition. Findings from a recent population-based study concur with our data showing accelerated WMH-related decline in MMSE score in APOE e4 carriers only. However, this study employed a microvascular lesion load summary score, which ranked an individual from 0 to 3 based on the absence or presence of WMH volume, lacunes, and perivascular spaces beyond a predefined cutoff. In addition, this study did not examine the effects of APOE e4 allele dosage on the associations of microvascular lesion load and MMSE. Therefore, comparisons to our results in this regard could not be made. 49 In contrast, we used quantitative WMH volume as a continuous predictor and 3 cognitive domains as outcomes rather than global cognitive score in our study.\nWe examine the effect of APOE e4 on the association between WMH and cognition in the 2 most common neurodegenerative dementia diagnoses-AD and DLB-which is uncommon as most studies focus on AD. Strengths of our study include a well-characterized study sample of patients with dementia, rigorous image processing methods validated for older adults and mixed dementias, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, adjusting for confounders, use of an autopsy-confirmed subset of data, and replication of findings in an independent dataset. However, there are limitations. This was a crosssectional study and therefore causal inferences could not be deduced. The statistical tests in some subanalyses, such as those in homozygous APOE e4 carriers and the autopsy subsample, had limited power to detect associations, and the null association in the noncarriers of APOE e4 might be a result of the limited sample size (power) as well. Therefore, studies with larger sample sizes are required. However, in an attempt to obtain more robust estimates, we conducted meta-analyses of estimates from SDS and ADNI, which resulted in stronger results. The SDS and ADNI-I used a different neuropsychological battery; however, there were similar tests available in both cohorts tapping into the major cognitive domains. This would not have affected our results as replication is more robust if performed using a different methodology to test the same research question. The number of patients who completed each cognitive test differed, which was related to dementia severity. Missing data from more severe cases might have resulted in an underestimation of the associations.\nSmoking and diabetes were not documented for most ADNI-I participants, hence were not included as covariates; these were not significant confounders in the SDS sample, so models in the 2 samples are fairly comparable. The numbers in the autopsy-based dataset were not sufficient to draw definitive conclusions; however, they provided important insights and can possibly direct future research.\nAPOE e4 may influence the association of WMH with executive functions and language across the spectrum of AD and DLB. Our meta-analysis results showed significant associations of greater WMH volume with cognitive impairment across all 3 cognitive domains tested. Information about the APOE e4 status of patients may be useful to understand the relative contributions of different pathologies to an individual's unique dementia syndrome, and to guide therapy as well. Future studies should aim to extend these findings to other dementia diagnoses and larger datasets. These findings emphasize the importance of WMH (as a marker of SVD) across the AD/ DLB spectrum, and open avenues for further research to understand shared etiologies and risk factors across the dementias.\nAuthor contributions Saira Saeed Mirza: drafting/revising the manuscript, study concept or design, analysis or interpretation of data, accepts responsibility for conduct of research and final approval, acquisition of data, statistical analysis, study supervision.
