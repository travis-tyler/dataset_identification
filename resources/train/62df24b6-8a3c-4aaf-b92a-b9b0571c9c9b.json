[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia with an incidence of 60% to 80% [1] . In addition to the recognized risk factors of AD, including age, sex, apolipoprotein E4 (APOE \u01904) phenotype, and low education level, the influence of metabolic syndrome (Mets) related factors such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), dyslipidemia on AD has also begun to be emphasized. Studies have shown that unhealthy metabolic status has a significant impact on brain health and also increases the risk of AD [2] [3] [4] [5] . At the same time, several studies showed that obesity at midlife independently increases the risk of AD, while in later life it reduces the risk [6-9].\nAs overweight/obesity and Mets often coexist, both are used to define the risk of poor health outcomes for www.aging-us.com ABSTRACT A subgroup of overweight/obese individuals, who had favorable metabolic profiles, was termed as metabolically healthy overweight/obese (MHO). Several studies suggested that MHO individuals were not at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-course mortality. However, whether MHO is associated with excess risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in elders remains unclear. To explore the risk of AD among MHO phenotype and investigate whether MHO associates with neurodegenerative biomarkers of AD, we assessed body mass index-metabolic status phenotypes of 1199 longitudinal elders from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort using the Adult Treatment Panel-III (ATP-III) criteria. MHO subjects were at a significantly decreased risk for AD (adjusted HR=0.73, 95% CI: 0.54-0.97) compared with metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW) subjects. In multivariable linear regression models, the cross-sectional associations of MHO with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain A\u03b2 load, and cortical structure were explored. MHO was positively correlated with CSF- A\u03b2 (\u03b2=0.746, P=0.015), hippocampal volume (\u03b2=0.181,  P=0.011), and whole brain volume (\u03b2=0.133, P=0.004) . The MHO phenotype of the elder conferred a decreased risk of AD and its role may be driven by A\u03b2."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "overweight/obese individuals and divide subjects into four body mass index-metabolic status phenotype groups: metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW), metabolically healthy overweight/obese (MHO), metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW), metabolically unhealthy overweight/obesity (MUO) [10] . A subgroup of overweight/obese individuals, who had favorable metabolic profiles such as normal glucose and blood pressure and were free of dyslipidemia, were termed as MHO. Several studies suggested that MHO individuals are overweight/obese but they meet none of the Mets criteria except for body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference [11] . Meanwhile, it has been suggested that MHO individuals were at different risk of AD compared to the MUO group which already has metabolic and obesity problems, although obesity is associated with higher cardiac metabolic risk [12] . Several studies suggested that MHO individuals were not at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and allcourse mortality [13, 14] . And MHO individuals showed high insulin sensitivity as well as favorable lipid, inflammation, hormones, liver enzymes and immune status [15] . At present, the study of BMImetabolic status phenotypes has rarely involved AD. A large-scale population-based cohort study in South Korea has found that MHO subjects had a protective tendency [16] . However, whether MHO is associated with excess risk of AD in the European elderly remains unclear.\nIn our research, we explored the impact of the MHO phenotype on the development of AD in the elderly. Apart from that, we wonder if the effects of overweight/obesity on elders with different metabolic states are consistent since MUO subjects did not show a protective tendency in previous studies [16] . Furthermore, we make the assumption that BMImetabolic status phenotypes have differences in their AD-related biomarkers to explore possible mechanisms whereby MHO affects the occurrence of AD. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the participants included in the analysis, results of post hoc multiple comparisons are shown in Supplementary Table  1 . The mean age was 73.5 \u00b1 7.1 years and the mean BMI was 27.0 \u00b1 4.7 kg/m 2 . Among the 1199 participants, 495 (41.3%) were classified as metabolically unhealthy. The MHO group was the youngest (72.8 \u00b1 7.3 years). The metabolically unhealthy groups have higher blood pressure, fasting glucose, triglyceride (TG), and lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was higher in the metabolically healthy groups.

Risk in the metabolically unhealthy group (HR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.02-1.60) was 1.28 times higher than that in the metabolically healthy group after further adjustment for BMI status.\nThe Kaplan-Meier curves for cumulative survival free from, incident AD as a function of BMI-metabolic status phenotypes showed that these survival curves differ significantly from each other over the follow-up (logrank, P = 0.02). Unadjusted and adjusted HRs and 95% CIs of AD compared with MHNW group, according to BMI-metabolic status phenotypes are listed in Table 2 .\nWe present the association between BMI and incident AD in analysis stratified by metabolic status category; the metabolically healthy group was the reference within each strata of BMI. Figure 1 shows the Kaplan-Meier curves for the cumulative proportion of individuals free of AD, in which MHO group had a lower probability of developing AD compared to MHNW group (log rank P=0.006), while the metabolically unhealthy group did not show this trend (log rank P=0.22). There was still a significant difference in AD risk between metabolically healthy groups after multivariable adjustment: compared with the MHNW group, the MHO group had a lower risk for AD (adjusted HR=0.73, 95% CI: 0.54-0.97, Model3). However, there was no significant difference between metabolically unhealthy groups after multivariable adjustment: compared with the MUNW group, the MUO group did not show a different risk (unadjusted HR=0.80, 95% CI: 0.56-1.16, Model1; adjusted HR= 0.75, 95% CI: 0.52-1.09, Model2; adjusted HR=0.75, 95% CI: 0.52-1.09, Model3).

No statistical differences were observed in CSF total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) between the two groups. There were differences in several brain regions of interest (ROIs) (whole brain, hippocampus, entorhinal, and middle temporal) between MHO and MHNW group in the unadjusted model. It is worth noting that the correlations of MHO with larger volume of whole brain (\u03b2=0.133, P=0.004) ( Figure 3B ) and hippocampus (\u03b2=0.181, P=0.011) ( Figure 3C ) remained significant in multiple linear regression analyses adjusting for age, sex, APOE status, cognitive diagnosis, education, tobacco and alcohol use, LDL and intracranial volume. All these associations still achieved significance after false discovery rate (FDR) correction.\nNo difference was detected between MUO and MUNW groups in cortical thickness and florbetapir cortical standardized uptake values ratios (SUVRs).\nAs for metabolically unhealthy groups, we did not observe any difference in CSF biomarkers between MUNW and MUO groups.

"}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this longitudinal study of 1199 individuals initially free of AD, 321 developed AD during an average follow-up. Previous studies investigating the associations of AD with obesity and unhealthy metabolic profiles reported that late-life obesity reduced the risk and metabolically unhealthy individuals had an increased risk. Our results showed that after correcting for the metabolic state, the risk of AD in elderly obese individuals was significantly reduced (HR=0.70, 95% CI: 0.56-0.89), and the risk of metabolic abnormalities increased after correcting for the obese status (HR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.02-1.60), which is in line with the results of previous studies [17] . In addition, we analyzed the risk of incident AD according to late-life BMI-metabolic status phenotypes. The results showed that MHO individuals had a lower risk for AD compared with the MHNW group. This protective tendency was not observed in MUO individuals compared with the MUNW group. A large-scale population-based cohort study previously reported the association between BMI-metabolic status phenotypes and the risk of AD. It showed an increased risk of AD in the MUO group, which was inconsistent with our results [16] . However, the effect of APOE \u01904 status has not been corrected for in this study. We had carefully adjusted for most confounding variables, especially APOE \u01904 status which had a significant impact on the risk of AD. Therefore, we believed that the risk of AD in MUO group cannot be fully determined and deserves further population studies.\nMost previous studies on obesity did not separate metabolically healthy individuals from metabolically unhealthy individuals [18] . However, the effects of metabolic status cannot be ignored, because obesity and unhealthy metabolic states can exist independently, which means that it is necessary to study the effects of obesity on AD in different metabolic states [10] . Our results broke the \"obesity paradox\" to some extent, in which overweight and obese individuals are pretending to have lower mortality in various established studies [19] [20] [21] . Therefore, the emphases on the influence of metabolic status and early management of high BMI elder individuals with metabolic abnormalities may be beneficial in the prevention of AD events.\nIn this study, we further examined the relationship between BMI-metabolic status phenotypes and ADrelated biomarkers in this non-dementia sample. We now found MHO was positively associated with CSF-A\u03b2 pathology and this association remained significant after controlling for several possible confounders. We did not find evidence for a significant relationship between MHO and tau pathology in the CSF. Our study also demonstrated that MHO showed suggestive associations with hippocampal and whole brain volumes. We did not find associations between MUO individuals and any AD-related biomarkers. The results of our study also suggested a likely mechanism of overweight/obesity in preventing the onset of AD dementia when metabolism is normal. Although A\u03b2 plays an upstream role in the pathogenesis of AD, A\u03b2 alone is insufficient to cause the onset of clinically detected dementia directly. However, this may be sufficient to cause downstream pathophysiologic changes such as brain atrophy that ultimately led to AD dementia [22] . We speculated that in metabolically healthy individuals, overweight/obesity influenced A\u03b2 pathology first, and subsequently reduced downstream brain atrophy rate and the risk of AD dementia.\nThere are many possible mechanisms that explain the beneficial effects of MHO on the development of AD dementia. A decline in the levels of plasma insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1), which has been shown to be an independent risk factor for AD [23] , was observed in the underweight group [24] . IGF-1 exerted neurotrophic effects on the hippocampus, and high levels of IGF-1 were associated with better cognitive performance [25] .\nIn addition, certain adipokines secreted by adipose tissue, such as leptin, may play a key role [26] . A higher circulating leptin level is associated with better cognitive performance, a lower incidence of AD dementia and larger volumes of brain regions, such as the hippocampus [18, 27] . The results of previous studies also indicated that MHO individuals have fewer years of obesity than their MUO counterparts [28] . Evidence showed that MHO individuals had certain advantages in metabolism and other aspects compared with the MUO population, which may affect the occurrence of AD. Results from previous studies suggested that MUO individuals have been overweight/obese for longer years compared to MHO individuals [28] . Despite having a high accumulation of body fat, MHO individuals display lower levels of C-reactive protein [29] , higher adiponectin concentrations [30] , higher insulin sensitivity [31] , and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the estimation of AD risk in elderly obese people cannot ignore the impact of different metabolic statuses.\nIt is worth noting that this study has some limitations. First, BMI or metabolic status in a certain proportion of participants will change over time, but our study did not reflect longitudinal changes in body weight or laboratory results. Second, current research on ADrelated biomarkers is based on cross-sectional data, which do not represent individual longitudinal changes. Third, the study is limited to the ADNI cohort, which is not a population-based cohort. Nevertheless, studies including larger samples are needed to further examine the effects of MHO.\nIn conclusion, we showed different risks of AD in elderly overweight/obese individuals with different metabolism statuses. The MHO phenotype conferred a lower risk of AD when compared with MHNW or MUO. The protective effect of overweight/obesity in the presence of metabolic abnormalities was not apparent compared with MUNW. Metabolic abnormalities in the elderly should not be neglected. Further studies in other populations are warranted, to better understand the effects of metabolic status and obesity on AD."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in this study was obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu), which was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership led by Principal Investigator Michael W.
