[{"section_title": "\u25a0 INTRODUCTION", "text": "Horse owners in North America pay an estimated $50 million dollars per month 1 to properly dispose of 7 million tons of equine waste (horse manure and bedding); 2, 3 this is a cost that reaps no economic value. On the other hand, turning the feedstock into a value-added product could be a cost-effective means of using rather than disposing of the resource. One avenue for recovering value from horse manure is to convert it to biofuels and chemicals using thermochemical processes, such as fast pyrolysis. 4, 5 Such a strategy could support a renewable economy using biomass resources, 6\u22128 abate climate change, and support the development of rural communities. The successful contribution of biofuels to a renewable energy economy requires that they are energy efficient and cost-effective and that they do not introduce additional environmental impacts. 9 Currently, resource efficiency and cost limit the commercialization of biofuels. To date, biofuels cannot compete with petroleum-derived products such as aviation fuel ($0.42 L \u22121 ), 10 given the historic fluctuations and more recent drop in the price of petroleum, most noticeably demonstrated by gasoline ($0.87 L \u22121 in 2008 to $0.61 L \u22121 in 2015 11 ). Hence, added value can be sought in the production of biobased chemicals, which may sell for a higher unit price than liquid fuels, alongside biofuels. 8 In 2004, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) created a single biomass program that merged previous programs for biofuels, biopower, and biobased products. 12 The objective of this merger was to promote biorefineries producing multiple products, including higher-value chemicals, along with fuels and power. 12 Phenol, which is one of such chemicals present in pyrolysis oil, is examined in this paper. Phenol is a relatively valuable chemical commodity that sells for \u223c$1.3 kg ) and is typically synthesized from crude oil distillates through the cumene process. 14 In addition, phenolic compounds are used as partial phenol substitutes in the phenol formaldehyde resol resin process. 15, 16 With the goal of co-producing value-added chemicals, Mullen et al. 5, 17 used tail gas reactive pyrolysis (TGRP), which is a variation of fast pyrolysis in which the noncondensable gases generated during the reaction are recycled into the reactor, to convert horse manure to a bio-oil rich in naphthalenes that could increase the yield of value-added chemicals. 17 Unlike fast pyrolysis, TGRP creates a reductive atmosphere in the pyrolysis reactor, which results in a highly aromatic bio-oil with lower oxygen content than bio-oil produced from fast pyrolysis. 17 The reactive oxygenated compounds present in fast pyrolysis bio-oil render it incompatible with petroleum refinery infrastructure. The oxygenated compounds of TGRP oil are predominantly phenols (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information (SI)), 18 which, because of their thermal stability, can be distilled and recovered at relatively high purity, compared with fast pyrolysis bio-oil.\nThe oxygen-poor hydrocarbons obtained after distillation of TGRP oil can further undergo hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) over common catalysts to yield almost completely deoxygenated hydrocarbons that can be directly blended in a petroleum refinery (drop-in) as well as high levels of concentrated phenols that can potentially be separated. HDO has been widely studied as a method of upgrading fast pyrolysis bio-oil and, as such, has been the subject of techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) studies. 19\u221221 These include studies on the LCA of technologies and developments for the production and upgrading of fast pyrolysis bio-oil that are focused on upgrading via hydrotreating and hydrocracking with corn stover 20, 22 and poplar 19 as feedstocks. One study 23 concluded that the majority of the environmental impact is due to direct emissions to air and the production of natural gas and electricity consumed in the process. Another study 22 showed that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of biofuel produced from upgraded fast pyrolysis oil may be reduced by 88%, relative to gasoline, and 94%, relative to diesel fuel, exceeding the renewable fuel standard-2 (RFS-2) requirements, which states that the life cycle GHG emission reduction threshold for any biomass-based biofuel is 50%.\nThe overall objective of the current study is to use LCA and TEA to examine the environmental performance and cost of isolating and extracting value-added chemicals, in this case, phenol and its derivatives, and fuel from TGRP oil produced from horse manure, and compare it to the dual-stage HDO upgrading process that is required for bio-oil produced from fast pyrolysis. HDO upgrading consists of mild hydrotreating, followed by severe hydrotreating, which represents a sequence of unit operations that result in a stable bio-oil. 24 We use experimental results from Elkasabi et al., in whose study TGRP oil from three feedstocks (horse manure, eucalyptus and switchgrass) was analyzed. Whereas other studies performed comparative LCA of renewable fuels using biomass such as forest residue, 25 this study exclusively focuses on the use of horse manure, because of the favorable quality of its TGRP biooil and that the waste feedstock is available in New York State and Pennsylvania. 4, 18, 26 While horse manure can be disposed of via spreading, composting, and hauling, 27 these methods come with high capital and operating costs to comply with regulations and they still result in poor water quality. 28 Herein, we evaluate the conversion of horse manure to fuels as an alternative to disposal."}, {"section_title": "\u25a0 METHODS", "text": "Techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment (ISO 14040) 29 were used to investigate the economic and life cycle environmental and exergetic performance of processing horse manure using TGRP and upgrading the TGRP oil to phenol and jet-range fuel. Experimental data from Elkasabi et al. 18 were used to construct thermodynamic conversion models using Aspen Plus software, 30 which, in turn, were integrated into a comprehensive life cycle inventory that considers feedstock provision, biomass conversion, TGRP-oil upgrading to phenols and jet-range fuel, and final consumption.\nBiomass Supply and Logistics. Biomass supply was investigated to guarantee security of horse manure supply in the production of TGRP fuel in units of a 200 t per day (MTPD) projected capacity. 8 To illustrate the satisfactory supply potential of horse manure in New York State, we set spatial boundaries using a geographic information system (GIS) map. Data from the USDA 2012 census of agriculture 31 were merged with an equine waste study in New York State. 26 We estimated the total equine waste generated as the product of the number of farms across the state and the quantity of waste generated per farm. The total amount of equine waste available in New York State was estimated as the product of the total number of farms (10 207) taken from the USDA 2012 census 31 and the average dry equine waste generated per farm (0.17 MRPD) taken from Shayya et al. 26 Our study evaluated the production of TGRP oil, assuming a daily supply of 200 t of horse manure, which could be supported given the available supply in New York State. Horse manure, having a potential higher heating value of 19.5 GJ per dry metric ton 26 (seeTable S2 in the SI), represents \u223c25% of the total equine waste, 26 and the supply data on a county level was adapted accordingly, with respect to the obtained equine waste generation data.\nFurthermore, we used Arc GIS 32 to determine possible locations of the facility. We used county-level horse manure supply data to predict likely locations for constructing 200 MTPD production facilities; however, more-detailed logistics studies would consider additional factors such as road and rail infrastructures for feedstock transport, and access to labor.\n33, 34 We limit feedstock transport to an average distance (radius) of 80.5 km (50 mile), similar to prior literature on feedstockbiorefinery logistics, 33, 35 assuming that, beyond this radius, the environmental impact and cost of transportation of biomass become disproportionate.\nThe GIS map for the supply logistics of horse manure ( Figure 1 ) indicates that, in most areas of New York, there will be some generation of horse manure within a 80.5 km radius average. More details on data calculations for the map are found in Table S2 .\nAlthough TGRP technology may be feasible with other types of manure such as cow or poultry manure 36, 37 and fast pyrolysis has been used previously on poultry waste, we use horse manure, because of its geographical supply in the Northeast and that it has been tested using TGRP 18 at laboratory scale, yielding bio-oil compositions modeled in this paper.\nWhile a 200 MTPD facility is small in scale, relative to a conventional crude oil facility, we suggest that the TGRP process and subsequent extraction would address waste treatment issues as well as contribute to an existing supply of biojet fuel.\nBiomass Conversion. The TGRP and oil upgrading facility is assumed to receive horse manure feeds of 200 MTPD, which is a capacity compatible with the small clusters of the equine industry and a scale on par with small-to medium-sized fast pyrolysis facilities that could take agricultural residues 38 and forestry biomass. 39 The TGRP oil yield from horse manure is assumed to be 36.9 wt %, based on previous experimental work. 5 Major processing steps include biomass preparation, TGRP oil production, and TGRP oil upgrade. Biomass preparation and fast pyrolysis have been studied previously, 4 and these results are used to inform the current study. In this study, we build a 200 MTPD biomass conversion model using Aspen Plus, 30 based on TGRP processing conditions analogous to the work of Hammer et al., 4 who studied fast pyrolysis at a smaller scale of 5 MTPD, by increasing the process scale, adding a preheater, a blower, and recycling the stream of noncondensable gases into the fluidized bed (see Figure S1 in the SI).\nThe Aspen Plus model simulated for the conversion step was based on experiments that treated manure; however, in commercial production, equine waste, which consists of both manure and bedding, would be used as feedstock. The LCA feedstock harvest step includes manure and bedding collection but the conversion step assumes only the manure portion is converted to fuels and chemicals, giving a lower bound estimate of production volume. Also, because elemental compositions of horse manure and bedding are similar, 18 bio-oil yield would not vary significantly.\nThe LCA and TEA in this paper used data from previously published bench-scale experiments 5, 18 that demonstrated the upgrading of TGRP oil through extraction of bio-oil distillates and separation of phenols.\nAspen Plus 30 was used for process modeling to establish mass and energy balances of the studied TGRP process, scaled to 200 MTPD of horse manure. Furthermore, it was used to estimate utility inputs such as electricity costs for operating pumps and compressors and water utilities for cooling operations. Data for the preprocessing used in the fast pyrolysis Aspen Plus models of Hammer et al. 4 were applied to this TGRP model. The model was extended with the upgrading process of TGRP oil (distillation, extraction, and hydrogenation), using published experimental results. 5, 18 In the upgrading process, the thermodynamic models used for the unit operations vary, depending on the operation and the input streams. For instance, we used the Peng\u2212Robinson and RK-Soave equations of state in the simulation for major units such as reactors, vessels, and coolers, because they are suitable for modeling hydrocarbon systems. In the simulation, the condensed TGRP oil was heated to 150\u00b0C from 25\u00b0C using medium pressure steam ( Figure S3 in the SI). The heated oil was fed into a flash drum as a single-stage distillation process; we estimated a phase-equilibrium separating the vapor phase (VOC1 representing volatiles) from the liquid (see Figure S3 in the SI). The resulting liquid S10 (volatiles with a melting point of \u2265150\u00b0C) stream (see Figure S3 ) was heated to 420\u00b0C before entering another flash drum. Because of the high melting point of biorenewable coke (modeled as benzopyrene), it exited the flash drum as liquid and was separated from the process.\nThe vapor phase (VOC1 stream; see Figure S3 ) was cooled to 90\u00b0C and entered a decanter to remove any excess water from the process. The water-free volatiles stream (VOC2) was mixed with a cooled stream (VOC2B), which exited as a vapor from the second flash drum. After distillation, the distillates underwent a two-step extraction process that separated the phenols from the hydrocarbon stream. The first process step ( Figure S4 in the SI) was a phenol extraction; NaOH entered the stoichiometric reactor, which was operated at 138\u00b0C, deprotonating the phenols (phenol and cresols) by increasing alkalinity, giving sodium phenoxide and sodium cresolate as phenolic salts. In the second step (shown in Figure S4 ), the mixture with phenolic salts was acidified with HCl and decanted, forming phenols in one stream and aqueous NaCl in the other stream. The hydrocarbon stream, consisting of olefins and aromatics, was hydrogenated in two stages (see Figure S5 in the SI). Both stages were performed in continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs): RXTR3, which was operated at 80\u00b0C, 50 atm, and RXTR4, which was operated at 200\u00b0C, 75 atm.\nLife Cycle Assessment. The primary product that we evaluate is the fuel product with the phenol chemical serving as coproduct. The upgraded TGRP-fuel produced is similar in composition to aviation fuel; thus, we assume it will serve those markets. Hence, the functional unit was defined as 1 MJ of fuel and 1 person-kilometer (PKM) of travel by aircraft. The co-produced phenol is compared with petroleum-based phenol made using the cumene-phenol or hock process, which is an industrial process used to produce both phenol and acetone from benzene and propylene. A LCA model was constructed with Simapro 40 software, using input parameters specified in the feedstock harvest and collection, and the mass and energy balances derived from the chemical process model developed in Aspen Plus. The metrics that we evaluated, using life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), were the 100 year global warming potential (GWP) for CO 2 , CH 4 , and N 2 O, according to IPCC, 41 and the cumulative exergy demand (CExD). 42 These metrics were used to describe the products (jet-range fuels and phenol) of the separation and upgrading of condensed TGRP oil. We used the GWP-100 metric in accordance to the benchmark for new biofuel standards given by RFS-2, which states that advanced biofuels must reduce life cycle GHG emissions by 50%, according to the advanced fuel designation. 43 While many biofuel LCA studies include GWP as a life cycle assessment metric, 44\u221246 CExD has not been as widely used. 47 Exergy is a thermodynamic measure of the maximum theoretical available work from a substance if it were to achieve equilibrium with the environment. Since exergy is a measure of available work, it represents a more nuanced and complete indicator of resource use, compared to cumulative energy consumption (CED). 48\u221250 Energy can be converted to different forms, but exergy is consumed in all processes. CExD also takes into account the consumption of nonenergetic raw materials. However, for nonrenewable energy intensive products, results are similar to CED.\nThe system boundary ( Figure 2 ) of this study is from well to flight; whereby the end of life of the fuels produced coincides with their use.\nData used for the life cycle inventory model include the material and energy inputs for conversion of horse manure to upgraded biofuel ( Figure 2 ). Inputs such as electricity reflect the region's supply, the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) grid. We assumed that the average distance the horse manure is transported from individual sites to the equine facility is 80.5 km. 35 The equine facility will be the major site to which the other surrounding farms can deliver their horse manure. After delivery, the horse manure is dried as a preprocessing step ( Figure 2 ).\nAllocation of environmental burdens in multiple product systems such as this, in which fuels and phenols are coproduced, is required in LCA. ISO 14040-44 29 recommends that the allocation methods used shows the physical relationship, such as mass and energy content, or other significant variables, such as economic value of the products. 51 In the TGRP process, allocation of the impact between oil and char was done on a mass basis (90% oil, 10% char), since mass allocation is more appropriate for a mixture of chemical and fuel. In the TGRP oil upgrade, we use mass, energy, and economic allocation, similar to previous studies, 52,53 because the effect of phenols extraction can vary, depending on the allocation method used. Herein, mass fractions, market price, and energy values are shown in Table S5 in the SI. Energy values were obtained from Aspen Plus results of HHV and price references are listed in Table S7 in the SI. System expansion was used in the impact calculations, because phenols are produced as coproducts; hence, we seek to capture changes in environmental impacts as a consequence of displacing petroleum-based phenols.\nProcess inputs for the TGRP process (Table S3 ) and TGRP oil upgrading (Table S4) were used to construct the life cycle inventory (LCI). Fuel and coke are produced in the highest quantity, followed by phenol and sodium chloride (Table S5) ; these values are used to inform the LCI. Fractions of energy, mass, and market price (see Table  S6 in the SI) are used to allocate LCIA results to individual TGRP products. We assume the TGRP-fuel produced will be used in a short haul plane that travels less than 1609 km, similar to the Boeing 737\u2212 800W currently used by United Airlines\u2212Eco-skies. 54 According to the specifications of the Boeing 737\u2212800W, we assume the aircraft is a 162-seater with a fuel efficiency of 1.1 kg PKM \u22121 . 54 Finally, we examine the sensitivity of feedstock transportation and credits from the avoided GHG emissions from manure disposal on life cycle GWP. Techno-economic Analysis. To calculate the incremental cost of adding a TGRP oil upgrading system to a fast pyrolysis operation, the material and energy flows obtained from Aspen Plus were used to size the major equipment in the upgrade process. We estimated capital costs based on previous reports 7, 38, 55 and used the Aspen Plus Capital Cost estimator software. 56 Costs were estimated using a desired rate of return of 10% and projected in 2013 U.S. dollars, using a cost basis from the Aspen Process Economic Analyzer. All other assumptions made in the TEA are found in the SI.\nIn addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the effects that different model assumptions such as variation in the cost of individual raw materials (hydrogen, catalyst, and feedstock), market price of the major coproduct (phenol), and the biofuel yield have on the minimum fuel selling price (MFSP). To investigate the relationship between environmental and economic impacts of the processes, we use the social cost of carbon (SCC), which is a method that internalizes the cost of GHG emissions (and savings)."}, {"section_title": "\u25a0 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "Process Yield, Energy Use, and Production Volume. In the modeled TGRP facility, 200 MTPD of horse manure (8300 kg h \u22121 ) are fed into the system, producing \u223c74 t of TGRP oil per day (3075 kg h ), corresponding to a yield of 36.9% on a mass basis. The heat for the pyrolysis process is transferred from the char combustor by fluidization sand. Fuels, phenols, sodium chloride, and biorenewable coke are separated or formed during the TGRP oil upgrade. In the upgrade process, energy is internally generated by the enthalpies of solution and exothermic reactions such as the cooling of volatiles serve as a heating source for the flash drums, heaters, and separators.\nThe analysis shows that available horse manure supply in New York State could yield \u223c4.3 million gallons per year of biojet fuel (Table S2 ). Although we do not base our study on a regional scale, if we were to include equine farms in the Northeast region, biojet fuel supply from Pennsylvania alone would add an additional 5.7 million gallons per year ( Table S2 ). Given that the 4.3 million gallons produced would be 100% renewable jet fuel and that biorefineries may blend 25% biobased and 75% petroleum-based fuel in the near term (c. 2020), 57 New York State's equine waste jet fuel production would supply 5.5 billion gallons of 25%/75% biojet fuel to the market. Also, 4.3 million gallons per year is a conservative estimate, since we only consider horse manure (25% of the total equine waste) and not horse bedding. If all equine waste were converted with the same bio-oil yield for horse manure and bedding, then New York State could produce a total of 172 million gallons per year and meet \u223c3% of the total U.S aviation fuel demand."}, {"section_title": "58", "text": "Life Cycle Metrics. The life cycle GWP and CExD were calculated for the production of fuel and its coproduct (phenols) from the upgrade of TGRP oil, using functional units of 1 MJ of fuel (see Figures S6 and S8 in the SI) and 1 PKM (Figures 3a and 3d) . Because of the different values of the mass, price, and energy content of the coproducts, the allocation results found in the SI vary by method. The high market price of phenol ($1.28 kg \u22121 ), compared to fuels ($0.5 kg ), translates to a low economic allocation for both the GWP and CExD of fuel.\nCompared to other allocation methods, the fuel product has a higher GWP when allocated by mass, because of its high mass fraction among all product flows (see Figure S6) . Moreover, regardless of the allocation method, the TGRP fuel has a lower GWP than aviation fuel on a well-to-wheel basis. Herein, we assumed similar GHG emissions from the distribution distance of TGRP fuel and aviation fuel, because of similar distances from refinery to pump. The impact of horse manure biofuel is almost entirely caused by its cradle-to-gate emissions, whereas the major share of the GWP of petroleum-based aviation fuel comes from operation, i.e., CO 2 emissions during aviation fuel combustion. This is because the TGRP upgraded fuel is assumed to have zero net GHG emissions during combustion, because its carbon is biogenic. Overall, the analysis suggests that the TGRP-fuel emits <10% (10 g of CO 2 eq per PKM) of the GHGs of aviation fuel (110 g of CO 2 eq per PKM) (Figure 3a) . The GWP of the TGRP upgraded fuel product shown in Figure  3b meets the RFS-2 43 standards; hence, the TGRP fuel product is environmentally preferable, relative to aviation fuel on a life cycle basis. When the GWP of the TGRP process is allocated according to economic value, the GWP of phenol is slightly higher (9%) than that of petroleum-based phenol (30 g CO 2 eq per PKM of fuel) 40 (excluding the end-of-life impact of phenol applications), because of its high economic value, but lower using mass and energy allocations (see Figure S6) . This validates the results of other studies 59,60 that have argued that different allocation methods determine the outcome of the environmental impacts on the products and coproducts. Also, this suggests that it is more beneficial to separate the phenols in the TGRP upgrade process than to produce only fuels (as is the conventional hydrogenation (HDO) method). 19 Using system expansion yields a higher net GWP for TGRP-fuel than when it is allocated on an economic, mass or energy basis ( Figure S6 ). This is mostly because, in all of the allocation methods, a large share of the GWP is attributed to the byproducts, mainly phenol and coke. The total impact of the TGRP process is identical for all allocation methods, but a reduced GWP for TGRP fuel induced by shifting the impact to phenol or coke is artificial. Therefore, in the interest of the functional unit defined, i.e., the production of 1 MJ equivalent of TGRP-fuel or 1 PKM of distance traveled, we opt to discuss only system expansion hereafter. 25,61\u221263 This means that the entire GWP of the TGRP process is allocated to the fuel, and afterward corrected for the credits achieved by phenol and coke production, offsetting phenol from the cumene process and coke as byproducts from the production of liquid fuels from crude oil. Nonetheless, the entire GWP of the TGRP process (10 g CO 2 eq ), producing the fuel, coke, and phenols, is still significantly lower than the GWP of petroleum-based aviation fuel (110 g of CO 2 eq ) 40 combined with phenol from the cumene process (30 g of CO 2 eq ), per PKM of distance traveled.\nA previous study 64 determined that the GWP (Figure 3b ) of the conversion of poplar biomass to drop-in biojet fuel via the bioconversion platform ranges from 30 g of CO 2 eq to 70 g of CO 2 eq per MJ of fuel burned, depending on the hydrogen generation method used in the hydrogenation steps. Biojet fuel (LG) represents a fuel for which the hydrogen for upgrading comes from lignin gasification (LG) and natural gas is used for heat and steam. Biojet (LG-HF) represents a fuel produced from a process that uses lignin gasification for hydrogen generation and hog fuel (HF) for heat and steam. When comparing this range to the GHG emissions from the current process (TGRP oil upgrade) without the credits from the coproducts (40 g CO 2 eq per MJ), and the various process contributions, the GHG credit for phenol (30 g of CO 2 eq ) is larger than the extra impact of the separation process ( Figure  3a ). In addition, we explore the effects of not disposing the manure and including the GHG emissions as a credit ( Figure  3b ). These results show that the average GHG emissions from land application reduce the TGRP fuel GHG emissions to 4.4 g of CO 2 eq.\nThe results for CExD assessment are given in Figures S8 and S9 in the SI, in addition to Figures 3c and 3d . Previous studies used exergy assessment to evaluate the production of biofuels, such as biodiesel and ethanol. 49,65\u221268 Most relevant for our study is the work of Keedy et al., 49 who used CExD as an assessment metric for evaluating the sustainability of bio-oil production via fast pyrolysis using three feedstocks, one of which was horse manure. When analyzing the CExD metric, the trend in allocation results ( Figure S8 ) is similar to the GWP results; whereby the phenol contributes the highest CExD in economic allocation, compared to the other coproducts. According to the Ecoinvent database 69,70 from which data were drawn, the CExD for the production and combustion of aviation fuel is 1.8 MJ per MJ of fuel. This value is \u223c28% greater than the CExD of the TGRP-fuel produced in this study without coproduct credits (1.3 MJ per MJ of fuel).\nFigures 3c and 3d present the life cycle environmental impact of CExD per person kilometer (PKM) of travel by aircraft passenger (as in Figure 3a for GWP). These figures compare CExD of TGRP fuel with aviation fuel. Credits are also displayed for the TGRP fuel. The dashed bar for TGRP fuel indicates the net CExD (including credits). Figure 3c includes the contribution of CExD by resource for the net amount. Figure 3d indicates the TGRP contribution by process and details credits. Both figures indicate the cumulative exergy destruction per passenger kilometer is much higher for aviation fuel, compared to TGRP fuel. Figure 3d indicates that this is true, even without credits. The positive TGRP area on Figure  3d represents the CExD for total production. Of the individual process contributions shown on Figure 3d , the results indicate that the majority of the CExD in the overall process is attributed to horse manure preprocessing. The bulk of the energy consumed in the preprocessing step is from electricity used to operate milling, drying, and conveying equipment. This indicates that the material and energy needs of the preprocessing step could be targeted for CExD reduction. Figure 3c provides a breakdown of the net CExD by resource. The majority of the resource inputs used to produce aviation fuel are derived from fossil fuels (petroleum, natural gas, coal). A significant contribution to the CExD of the TGRP fuel is attributable to electricity production. The NPCC grid resources are \u223c50% fossil (including petroleum, natural gas) and 31% nuclear on an energy basis. However, the CExD percentages are 75% nuclear and 24% fossil. This results in the larger nuclear contribution to CExD on Figure 3c (compared to the fossil contribution). Note the fossil contribution is considered a credit, because of the production of phenol and coke. Figure S9 in the SI compares the CExD of phenol extracted in the TGRP process with the phenol produced by the cumene process. The former demands either more or less exergy than the latter, depending on the allocation method used. With energy and mass allocations, the CExD of phenol is smaller than the CExD of the cumene process, whereas, with economic allocation, the CExD of phenol is greater than the CExD in the cumene process. This difference due to allocation method choice is a result of phenol having a higher market value than fuel and the other coproducts.\nGlobal Warming Potential Sensitivity. Diverting horse manure from agricultural lands for fuel production may avoid GHG emissions. Manure is often land applied in agriculture to recycle nutrients. When manure is disposed by land, it releases GHGs predominantly in the form of N 2 O and CH 4 sources of carbon and water. 71 These emissions are in the range of 16 400\u221233 500 g of CO 2 eq per ton of manure, 72 depending on the size of the farm. By using thermochemical conversion to dispose of the manure, we can reduce CO 2 emissions from land application by 88%\u221294% (as shown in Figure S12 in the SI). A scenario that includes the GHG emissions released from land application as a credit (Figure 3b) shows that the average GHG emissions from the TGRP fuel process reduces to 4.4 g of CO 2 eq.\nIn addition, we examined the sensitivity of GWP on feedstock transportation by doubling the horse manure transportation distance to the equine facility. This increases the GHG emission by 0.5 g of CO 2 eq per passenger kilometer (5% increase in the total GHG emissions), which is a small amount that aligns with prior literature 62, 73 on the transport of biomass feedstocks for biofuels.\nTechno-economic Analysis. We estimate the capital and operating costs of TGRP bio-oil upgrading operations from the Aspen Plus simulations, and compare these incremental costs to fast pyrolysis to produce bio-oil from prior research 38 (see Table 1 ). Since TGRP and fast pyrolysis use the same equipment, are identical in scale, and the only difference between the two is that the TGRP process recycles the noncondensable gases, whereas fast pyrolysis uses the gases for process energy; we assume that the differences in costs between the two are negligible. The additional capital cost of bio-oil upgrading operations that produce value-added products (jet fuel, phenols, and green coke) is one-third ($7.7 million) of the cost of fast pyrolysis 38 ($24.7 million), which produce bio-oil alone (see Table 1 ). The project capital cost was determined based on 5% per year working capital, 74 which is a percentage of total capital expense per period showing the amount required to operate the facility until the revenue from product sales is sufficient to cover costs. 56 An economic life span of 10 years was chosen for this study for a side-by-side comparison with a similar 200 MTPD fast pyrolysis study. 38 The cost of raw materials and market prices of products are shown in Table S7 . The labor cost is estimated from the number of full-time equivalents required for operating the TGRP upgrade process for 7920 h per year. We use two operators per shift at a unit cost of $20 per operator per hour and one supervisor per shift with a unit cost of $35 per supervisor per hour. The total additional fixed operating costs include facility overhead and operating charges.\nTotal revenue consists of sales of the main product of the upgrade and byproducts. The price of fuel used in this analysis is based on the current price of aviation fuel; consequently, the outcome of this comparative study may change based on future market conditions. Sodium chloride (NaCl) and water (H 2 O) are considered waste products of the process; hence, they have a negative monetary value and incur waste treatment costs of $0.002 kg Using the economic analysis of Pourhashem et al. 38 with the incremental costs of TGRP upgrade, the MFSP of the final upgraded TGRP fuel is estimated to be $1.8 L \u22121 of fuel (MFSP Option B, Table 1 ), which is comparable to a similar study by Carracso et al., 55 who investigated the conversion of forest residue to biodiesel through fast pyrolysis and catalytic upgrading. The MFSP for Option A in Table 1 , assumes the agricultural residue feedstock cost from Pourhashem et al., 38 $0.055 kg \u22121 to approximate the cost of collecting and properly hauling the horse manure to the conversion facility and contrasts it with the Option B MFSP, a lower limit in which horse manure is assumed to be given freely 4 by the farmers as an alternative to paying for disposal and thus is $0 kg\n. Option A represents a conservative approximation of feedstock cost, given that the cost of a waste such as horse manure is expected to be low, or possibly zero or negative (if the horse keeper has to pay to have the manure hauled offsite for treatment). However, horse manure is an agricultural waste product with no value; therefore, the assumed feedstock cost of $0 kg . An investment analysis over a project life of 10 years results in a net present value of $1.6 million; hence, the project is economically feasible under the assumptions made.\nJones et al. 7 evaluated the production of fuels via pyrolysis and HDO upgrade and found a positive net present with a minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of $0.54 L \u22121 , which is far below the MFSP for the TGRP oil upgrade process; $1.1 L \u22121 . This variation in MFSP can be attributed to the significant difference in scale between the two processes; the biomass supply needed for the HDO process is 10 times higher than the distributed TGRP fuel process.\nSensitivity Analysis. The MFSP is most sensitive to feedstock cost and yield and, to a smaller extent, on the market prices of phenol and coke, but hydrogen and catalyst costs do not have a significant effect on the MFSP, because they are used in small quantity, compared to the other raw materials in the process ( Figure S10 in the SI). The MFSP value showing sensitivity analysis to feedstock cost depicts a significant reduction from $1.8 L \u22121 to $1.1 L \u22121 (Table S9 ) when the feedstock is treated as a waste ($0 kg \u22121 ), hence making TGRP fuel more economically competitive, compared to the base case. If the price of feedstock were to double, assuming that it has to be purchased from the farmers, the MFSP increases significantly to $2.4 L \u22121 . This can be the case if equine waste is in high demand and its supply is limited. Also, because the market price of green coke can change drastically, 76 it is important to see the effect of this change on the MFSP. However, the tornado plot shows little variation in MFSP due to changes in the price of coke; hence, the MFSP is not too sensitive to the price of coke.\nIf the yield increases by 25%, 20, 77 the MFSP decreases significantly to $1.4 L \u22121 . Similarly, if the market selling price of 24 700 000 7 680 000 annual operating costs ($/yr) 9 360 000 4 510 000 raw material 4 280 000 1 950 000 utilities 768 000 313 000 total operating labor and maintenance costs 1 130 000 1 060 000 total additional fixed operating cost 712 000 423 000 depreciation (10 yr, straight line) 2 470 000 768 000 total revenue ($/yr) 5 620 000 coproduct sales 3 020 000 sales from fuels 2 600 000 MFSP of bio-oil from fast pyrolysis and subsequent TGRP upgrade ($/L) phenol increases, the MFSP decreases, and if the selling price decreases, the MFSP increases. This implies that increasing process yields, increasing the price of coproducts and reducing the price of feedstocks, can render the process economically feasible."}, {"section_title": "ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering", "text": "Environmental and Economic Implications for Advanced Fuel Development and Policy. To fully account for the climate change mitigation benefits of biofuels and support policy decisions in their investment, it is important to include both internal and external costs and measure both direct and indirect costs of a process or product. In this section, we estimate all internal costs associated with TGRP and aviation fuel production and consider the social cost of carbon (SCC), an external cost. 78 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) 79 uses SCC to estimate the climate benefits of set standards. The SCC is a monetary value estimating the economic damages caused by a marginal increase in carbon dioxide emissions in a defined year. In order to overcome the high MFSP, SCC is expressed as a revenue equivalent to the difference in the monetary value of GHG emissions between the renewable fuel and petroleum-based aviation fuel. Using the 2007 year SCC value of $36 with a 3% discount rate, 79 the TGRP SCC value is $930 000 yr \u22121 , which is a quantity that represents the reduction in economic damages associated with CO 2 . Using Option A (MFSP, ), the SCC would need to be as high as $354 per metric ton, based on the assumption that the original SCC of $36 has been underestimated.\nFinally, to understand how sensitive the MFSP is to variability in the SCC, a sensitivity analysis (Figure 4 ) was carried out, using scenarios reflecting the highest and lowest MFSP. When the cost of raw materials (feedstock, hydrogen, and catalyst) is high, yield is low and coproduct (phenol and coke) selling prices are low, the MFSP ranges from $2.11 to\n. On the other hand, a scenario that includes the lowest price of raw materials, higher yields, and a high selling price of coproducts reduces the MFSP to a range of $0.53-$0.79 L \u22121 , which could be competitive with the price of petroleum-based aviation fuel on the market. If we add a manure management fee of $0.008/L, this would have a small effect on the MFSP, reducing it from $0.66/L to $0.65/L. Therefore, when all fuel conversion parameters are optimized, as would be expected of the nth biofuel conversion facilities, 81 and when external costs are reflected in the market price of energy, it is possible to economically produce low carbon jetrange fuels and value-added chemicals through TGRP technology.\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b01609.\nSupporting life cycle inventory data, coproduct allocation parameters and results, bio-oil characteristics, feedstock logistics and supply, and economic data are summarized; process flow diagrams from Aspen Plus simulations show details of feedstock conversion and fractionation to fuels and phenolic compounds (PDF) "}, {"section_title": "Notes", "text": "The authors declare no competing financial interest. The economic analysis includes the TGRP oil production and its upgrade to fuels and phenols. The literature shows that depending on the practice and farm size, GHG emissions per ton of manure range from 16,400 to 33,500 g CO2-eq 4 for land-application. Although the cited literature does not give sufficient breakdown for the N2O and CH4 emissions, it details that the major source of emissions is N2O from land application. We calculated the amount of GHG emissions from the TGRP fuel per ton of horse manure and this value is between 88% -94% less than the GHG emissions from land application.\nPage S10 *Sodium Chloride is considered $0 since it is in small quantities and will be disposed.
