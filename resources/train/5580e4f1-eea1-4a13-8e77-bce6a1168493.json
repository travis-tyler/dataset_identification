The MCI participants were divided into 2 groups (high vs. low) based on executive function task performance. Results demonstrated that although both MCI groups were impaired on all memory measures relative to HCs, MCI individuals with higher executive function (HEF) demonstrated better verbal memory performance than those with lower executive function (LEF), particularly on measures of learning. The 2 MCI groups did not differ in mesial temporal morphometric measures, but the MCI LEF group showed significant thinning in dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices bilaterally compared with the MCI HEF and HCs. Further, thickness in numerous regions of frontal cortex, and bilateral posterior cingulate, was significantly associated with memory performance in all MCI participants above and beyond the contribution of the mesial temporal regions known to be associated with episodic memory. Overall, these results demonstrate the importance of evaluating executive function in individuals with MCI to predict involvement of brain areas beyond the mesial temporal lobe."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Evidence from both neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies has suggested that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a clinical prodrome to degenerative dementias such as Alzheimer's disease (AD; Petersen et al. 2001) . Despite a primary emphasis on characterizing memory dysfunction and atrophy in related brain structures, such as hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, it is increasingly recognized that MCI may represent a highly heterogeneous group (Petersen et al. 2001; Nordahl et al. 2005; Busse et al. 2006) , based in part on demonstrated variability among MCI individuals in some cognitive domains, such as executive functioning (Nordahl et al. 2005; Belleville et al. 2007) . Executive dysfunction alone is not traditionally associated with profound memory loss; however, it is thought to interfere with a number of cognitive skills necessary for successfully engaging in the acquisition and retrieval of information (Stuss and Alexander 2000) . These may include, for instance, the organization and elaboration of material at encoding, strategic retrieval of information, and the ability to overcome the effects of interference. Studies based on normal aging (Crawford et al. 2000; Salthouse et al. 2003 ) and a variety of clinical populations (Tremont et al. 2000; Simard et al. 2003 ; Busch et al. 2005 ; Brooks et al. 2006; Temple et al. 2006; Elderkin-Thompson et al. 2007 ) have found that deficits on measures of executive function have detrimental impact on memory performance. However, little is known about the relationship between executive function and episodic memory in MCI. Brooks et al. (2006) measured executive functions and episodic verbal memory performance in a sample of mixed MCI, probable mild dementia, and individuals with other neurological diagnoses and found that those with executive dysfunction showed lower memory performance than those without. However, due to the nature of the mixed neurological sample, definitive conclusions about the relationship between executive function and memory in MCI could not be drawn.\nLesion and functional imaging studies indicate that episodic memory involves a widespread network of brain structures, including the hippocampal formation, cingulate gyrus, and frontal lobe (Cabeza and Nyberg 2000; Davidson et al. 2006; Dove et al. 2006) . Structural imaging studies (Van Petten et al. 2004 ) have reported a significant relationship between memory performance and gray matter volumes of the middle frontal gyrus and most temporal lobe gyri in healthy aging. There is considerable evidence for volumetric reduction in hippocampus and other medial temporal lobe structures in MCI compared with healthy controls (HCs) , and the link between medial temporal atrophy and memory decline is well established (Wolf et al. 2003; Petersen 2004) . However, morphometric changes in other regions, particularly frontal lobe and cingulate gyrus, and the impact of these changes on executive and memory function in MCI are less well understood.\nThe present study aimed to investigate the relationship between executive dysfunction and verbal memory in amnestic MCI and to elucidate the neural correlates of this dysfunction. Although memory impairment is a core feature of amnestic MCI, we hypothesized that amnestic MCI individuals with higher executive function (HEF) would perform better than those with lower executive function (LEF) on verbal memory tasks, particularly during the learning phase when executive support is likely to be critical for the successful organization of material for encoding. We also hypothesized that MCI individuals with LEF would show reduced thickness in frontal and cingulate areas relative to MCI individuals with HEF and that such frontal and cingulate differences would be associated with memory performance above and beyond the contribution of hippocampus and other mesial temporal regions."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "The raw data used in the current study were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http:// www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI). ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public--private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nThe Principle Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California-San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the United States and Canada. ADNI has recruited 229 cognitively normal older individuals to be followed for 3 years, 398 people with amnestic MCI to be followed for 3 years, and 192 people with early AD to be followed for 2 years.

Briefly, participants are 55--90 years old, nondepressed, with a modified Hachinski score of 4 or less, and have a study partner able to provide an independent evaluation of functioning. HCs have a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR; Hughes et al. 1982 ) score of 0. MCI participants have a subjective memory complaint, objective memory loss measured by education-adjusted scores on modified Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II (a score <8 for individuals with >16 years of education; a score <4 for individuals with 8--15 years of education; and a score <2 for individuals with 0--7 years of education), a CDR of 0.5, preserved activities of daily living, and an absence of dementia (Petersen et al. 2001 ). For the current study, we excluded 7 HCs who converted to MCI at any follow-up visit to minimize the possibility of misclassification of HC participants at baseline. Participants with missing or invalid data on any of the executive function and verbal memory measures used here were also excluded (40 MCI individuals). As a result, the present study consisted of 222 HC and 358 amnestic MCI participants.

Following presentation of a 15-word distractor list consisting of novel words, the participant was then asked to recall items from the first list (short delay\n[SD] recall). Long delay (LD) free recall and a recognition trial were given following a 20-min delay period. AVLT delay recognition discriminability score was calculated by the formula {[1 -(number of false alarms + number of misses)/30] 3 100} where 30 is the total number of test stimuli, of which 15 are targets (Underwood 1974; Delis et al. 1987) . A modified version of the logical memory (LM) subtest from the Wechsler (1987) Memory Scale-Revised was also given to participants. In this modified version, one short story (Story A) was read aloud to the participant and the participant was asked to recall immediately (LM I) and after a 30-min delay interval (LM II).

TMT-A requires participants to draw a line between the numbered circles that arranged randomly on a sheet of paper in ascending order as quickly as possible within 150 s. In TMT-B, half the numbers were replaced with letters, and the task was to connect the circles while alternating between numbers and letters in ascending order within 300 s. The time to complete TMT-A and B was recorded separately. The TMT-B is a commonly used test of prefrontal function (Lezak 1995) and is considered a measure of the ability to flexibly shift the course of an ongoing activity. To minimize influence of motor speed on TMT-B performance, analyses were conducted based on standardized residual values after the effect of TMT-A was regressed out. The Digit Span Backward task of the WAIS-R requires participants to repeat a series of verbally presented digits of increasing length in reverse order. Performance on the task strongly depends upon working memory, cognitive regulation, and manipulation, all of which are components of executive function (Lezak 1995) .

The participant is asked to name as many animals as possible within a 60-s time interval. Total number of correct responses was used for the analysis in the present study. To assess visuoconstruction ability, we used the visuoconstruction subtest of the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog; Rosen et al. 1984) . In this test, the participant is asked to copy 4 geometric designs of increasing difficulty. The test was scored in terms of number of errors committed (scores ranged 0--5).\nMCI Group Assignment MCI participants were divided into 2 subgroups (LEF and HEF) based on a composite factor derived from scores obtained on the 2 executive function tasks. Specifically, the participant's performance on each of the executive measures was converted to a z-score based on norms obtained from the whole participant pool in the present study. For ease of interpretation, the z-score of the TMT-B was inverted prior to averaging the z-scores of the 2 tests. The resulting composite z-scores thus represented the participant's relative performance on executive function, with positive numbers representing better performance. Based on the Kolmogorov--Smirnov goodness-of-fit test, the resulting distribution of the composite z-scores for all participants on the executive function factor was approximately normal with a mean z-score of 0.06 (standard deviation = 0.7). The MCI participants were divided into HEF and LEF groups based on scores above or below a composite z-score of 0, respectively. This resulted in 163 MCI participants in the HEF group and 195 MCI participants in the LEF group. Group clinical and demographic data are presented in Table 1 . .

To that end, we examined the relationship between morphometric measures and cognition (i.e., memory and executive function). Results showed that executive function modulates some aspects of memory ability and that MCI individuals with poorer executive function demonstrate greater thinning in frontal and cingulate cortices relative to those with HEF. Further, thinning in these areas was related to memory performance beyond effects attributable to hippocampal atrophy.\nWe hypothesized that amnestic MCI individuals with HEF would show better performance on memory relative to amnestic MCI individuals with LEF, particularly during the learning phase when executive support is likely to be critical for the successful organization of the material to be encoded. As predicted, and consistent with previous studies in normal aging (Crawford et al. 2000; Salthouse et al. 2003) , the MCI HEF group outperformed the MCI LEF group on the LM immediate recall, AVLT total learning, and LD recall. However, on other memory variables such as LM retention or SD recall of AVLT, the 2 MCI groups demonstrated comparable performance. The finding that greater differences occurred between the 2 MCI groups on learning components than on memory retention is consistent with literature regarding the differential roles of frontal and medial temporal lobes in memory, with the frontal lobe more associated with the acquisition of information, and the medial temporal lobe more associated with memory consolidation (Ferbinteanu et al. 2006) . Our findings also support the evidence that AVLT performance relies on executive function to a greater degree than does the LM. It has been suggested that differential performance between list learning and story recall measures reflects differences in the respective task demands on the encoding process (Tremont et al. 2000) . As opposed to the unstructured word list, the LM test is presented in a structured story format that provides contextual cues, thus potentially reducing the need to actively organize the information for learning and recall.\nRegarding the relationship between morphometric variables and executive function in MCI, we hypothesized that MCI individuals with LEF would show reduced thickness in frontal and cingulate areas relative to MCI individuals with HEF. Results showed that the MCI group as a whole demonstrated significant gray matter thinning in bilateral medial and lateral temporal lobe as well as frontal lobe regions compared with the HC group, consistent with previous studies (Wolf et al. 2003; Fennema-Notestine et al. 2009 ). In support of our hypothesis, the results indicated that relative to the HC group, the MCI LEF group showed greater and more widespread atrophy than the HEF group. Although the 2 MCI groups showed comparable morphometry in bilateral mesial temporal lobe regions, the LEF group demonstrated greater cortical thinning in left orbitofrontal region, left frontal pole, right rostral middle frontal lobe, bilateral middle temporal lobe, and left inferior temporal lobe regions relative to the MCI HEF. Cortical thinning observed in the MCI LEF group in the frontal regions is consistent with previous studies that have highlighted the role of prefrontal regions in executive functioning (for a review, see Stuss and Alexander 2000) . However, the results regarding the difference between the 2 MCI groups in middle and inferior temporal lobe regions and their significant correlations with executive function were unexpected because middle and inferior temporal cortices have not traditionally been associated with Note: AVLT SD 5 AVLT short delay recall; AVLT LD 5 AVLT long delay recall; and AVLT disc 5 AVLT discriminability on the recognition task. *P \\ 0.0025; **P \\ 0.001.\nexecutive function. These significant relationships, however, may reflect language or visual abilities required in the executive function tasks used in the current study. Significantly decreased thickness was also found in bilateral PCC but not ACC in the MCI LEF group compared with the MCI HEF group, which was somewhat unexpected given that ACC is considered to be involved in executive function and is part of the frontal circuitry Amaral 2003, 2007) . Cortical thinning in PCC in the MCI LEF group compared with the MCI HEF group was not unexpected given that the PCC is considered part of the limbic system and has reciprocal connections with the medial temporal lobe, including entorhinal cortex and hippocampal formation as well as frontal areas, particularly BA 46, 9, 10, and 11 Amaral 2003, 2007) . Hypometabolism and volumetric reduction in PCC has been identified as a feature of early AD (Chua et al. 2008; Choo et al. 2008; Pengas et al. 2008) , and several recent studies have reported PCC hypometabolism or/and volume reduction in individuals with MCI (Choo et al 2008; Chua et al 2008; Fennema-Notestine et al. 2009; Pengas et al. 2008) . Our findings support the notion that PCC abnormality can be detected in a preclinical stage of AD and suggest that atrophy in the PCC is associated with executive dysfunction. Overall, the results of cortical thinning in the frontal lobe and PCC region observed in the MCI LEF group compared with the MCI HEF group are consistent with prior studies (Bell-McGinty et al. 2005; Whitwell et al. 2007; Fennema-Notestine et al. 2009 ) that examined volumetric differences between different MCI subtypes (i.e., MCI-amnestic vs. MCI-multiple cognitive domain subtype) using criteria proposed by Petersen et al. (2001) .\nIn support of our final hypothesis, the results showed that thickness in numerous regions of frontal cortex and bilateral PCC were significantly associated with memory performance above and beyond the contribution of mesial temporal regions known to be associated with episodic memory. These relations remained significant when the analysis was restricted to the MCI groups, suggesting that they did not arise principally from the large difference between controls and MCI participants. These results correspond with the finding that MCI individuals with LEF showed lower memory performance and greater cortical thinning in frontal and PCC regions relative to those with HEF; despite equivalent hippocampal volumes and thickness of mesial temporal lobe regions (Supplementary Table 1) .\nThere are a number of interindividual differences that may account for the current executive function/memory findings including premorbid cognitive function, genetic factors, and diagnostic heterogeneity. It is unlikely that the relationship observed here between executive function and memory is an artifact of differences in general cognitive functioning because the HEF and LEF groups evidenced comparable CDR-SB scores as well as similar performance on many other neuropsychological measures, including MMSE, memory retention, TMT-A, animal fluency, and the visuoconstruction subscale of the ADAS-cog. Furthermore, the group effects on learning and recall measures remained significant after controlling for estimated VIQ and CDR-SB. Genetic factors, however, may have contributed to the observed effects. APOE e4 has been documented as a genetic risk factor for late-onset AD (Bennett et al. 2003) with some studies suggesting that the APOE e4 genotype is associated with subtle impairments in executive functions such as working memory, inhibition, and attentional switching in healthy adults and prodromal dementia (Greenwood et al. 2000; Small et al. 2004; Jacobson et al. 2005; Wetter et al. 2005; McQueen et al. 2007) . Consistent with this, we found that both MCI groups had a higher frequency of APOE e4 carriers than the HC group and that the LEF group had a higher frequency of APOE e4 carriers than the HEF group. Diagnostic heterogeneity may also have contributed to the relationship between executive function and memory. MCI groups with more widespread gray matter loss at baseline have been shown to progress more rapidly to AD relative to those with focal gray matter loss McEvoy et al. 2009) . Evidence from neuropsychological data shows a parallel indication: Executive dysfunction in addition to memory decline improves prediction of conversion to AD in individuals with MCI (Albert et al. 2001; Chen et al. 2001; Backman et al. 2005; Rapp and Reischies 2005; Belleville et al. 2007; Blacker et al. 2007) . Consistent with this, we found that the 1-year conversion rate to a clinical diagnosis of probable AD was higher in the MCI LEF group than the MCI HEF group. Thus, the 2 MCI groups in the present study may represent a continuum of the MCI-AD course with the MCI LEF group having progressed farther toward AD than the MCI HEF group, or they may represent different underlying etiologies. For example, the MCI LEF group may show more vascular or mixed pathologies than the MCI HEF group. Future analysis of longitudinal change in brain structure and neuropsychological task performance over ADNI's 3-year follow-up period, once sufficient data have been collected and processed, may help elucidate this issue.\nPotential limitations of the present study include the restricted number of executive measures and nonverbal memory tasks available for analyses. Executive function is a broad cognitive domain that includes many subcomponents such as working memory, planning, inhibition, problem solving, and mental set shifting capacities (Stuss and Alexander 2000) . With the limited number of executive function tests available in the ADNI, it is not possible to determine the extent to which each of these components relates to memory performance. Additionally, the present study is unable to provide information about the relation between nonverbal memory and executive function measures. Finally, the relationships observed between cognition and morphometric measures in frontal and temporal lobe areas were low (r 's = 0.12--0.22), suggesting that much of the variance in cognitive scores is not explained by brain morphometry. It is likely that the above-mentioned factors related to interindividual differences, such as premorbid cognitive function, genetic factors, and diagnostic heterogeneity, may contribute more to the variance in executive functioning.\nDespite these limitations, the present study suggests that executive function influences verbal memory ability in amnestic MCI, particularly with regard to learning components of memory. This influence is not related to variation in hippocampal volume but reflects cortical thinning in bilateral prefrontal lobe areas and the PCC. These results demonstrate the importance of evaluating executive function in individuals with amnestic MCI to predict involvement of brain areas beyond the mesial temporal lobe. Future follow-up analyses will provide information on the ability of these measures to predict decline in MCI. "}, {"section_title": "Funding", "text": ""}]
