[{"section_title": "", "text": "The Government Accounting Office found that local planners who have used simulations of this type believe them to be \"indispensable\". to effect-:l;ye :planning, and the National Weather Service, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Corps of Engineers and GAO have all agreed that the SLOSH model is the most useful in providing comprehensive information for state-of-the-art planning. The SLOSH model has to be specifically adapted for each coastal flood basin, a process known as Phase I. In order to provide detailed data from the model for use by planners, Phase II must be completed. In this phase, NWS will run an. aversge of 250 simulations (or hurricane tracks) on the SLOSH model for each basin. This will eventually be completed for at least 2l basins of Coastal U.S. If funding is available, information obtained from the model is summarized and printed as a reference document. During Hurricane Alicia, in Texas, SLOSH model data was available and most officials were familiar with the model, but encountered various difficulties in attempting to use SLOSH data during the storm. A few expressed the opinion that the data was in too complex a form to be helpful during the storm itself, according to a Congressional report. Finding the correct printed data, then calculating and plotting the data, can be a time consuming task, when several locations must be calculated during an\u2022 extremely busy hurricane threat condition. In addition, when the strike point of the storm changes (possibly several times a day), all new calculations and plots must be performed using the printed data. For those areas with large tidal ranges, such as along the South Carolina coast (5-8 feet) -l-additional calculation and plotting must be done to take into account the state of the tide at the time of hurricane strike. A computer calculation and display system has been developed to help insure realtime updating of the latest information from the SLOSH model as conditions change under hurricane threat. After the SLOSH program {Phase I and II) is completed for a coastal basin, the output from the model is made available in computer printout form. These printouts constitute detailed data for scores of coastal points for 250 different combinations of storm track and storm intensity. From this volume of data, a\u2022 set of 12 representative coastal points are selected \u2022\u2022\u2022 and time histories of storm surge and winds are transcribed from the printouts onto forms. From these forms, the data is entered into the minicomputer {described below) as ~SIC language data statements {shown in Appendix A) which describe the storm surge profile for each point. For planning purposes, any combination of storm track and intensity can be selected, along with time of arrival and time of high tide, to arrive at an alrncst infinite\u2022cornbination of possible storm conditions. Worst-case scenarios may then be developed, and timing of evacuation and location of shelters may then be refined. In operational use, when hurricane conditions threaten, the user will obtain information on the expected storm track and intensity from the National Hurricane Center, and utilize local tide tables for tidal input to the program. These parameters will then be entered into the minicomputer and profiles for each of the representative coastal points will be quickly available either on screen or in printout form {hard copy). If the track or timing of the storm changes, the user would enter the new strike location and arrival time, and new surge profiles for each point would be available. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the model is capable of producing very good estimates of storm surge, given an accurate forecast track as input into the program. This means that in operational use, the program will be updated as each major change in forecast track occurs. The accuracy of the program will then approach the maxim.urn accuracy of the SLOSH model when the strike point of the storm is relatively certain {in the last few hours before strike or earlier, if the storm is a very predictable one). Although each National Weather Service Office is equipped with an AFOS (Automation of Field Operations and Services) computer system, in normal use each computer handles a very large amount of information. Under hurricane threat, the system is under even more strain, in order to produce the increased amount of information demanded by the public. The addition of an interactive computer program to this system at such a time could cause, at the least, unacceptable periodic software overloads and interruption of use of AFOS at a critical time. For this reason, a separate relatively inexpensive system was chosen, which would also allow portability of the hardware and usage at other locations for planning purposes. The hardware consists of the following: Note--All necessary cables and plugs for computer and disk, as well as disk operating system, included as standard equipment."}, {"section_title": "B.
