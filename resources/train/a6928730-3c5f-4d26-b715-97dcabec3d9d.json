There are four genera within the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, namely Alphacoronavirus ( \u03b1-CoV), Betacoronavirus ( \u03b2-CoV), Gammacoronavirus ( \u03b3 -CoV) and Deltacoronavirus ( \u03b4-CoV) [1 , 2] . The CoV genome is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA with a size varying between 26 kb and 32 kb, the largest genome of known RNA viruses. Both \u03b1and \u03b2-CoV genera are known to infect mammals, whilst \u03b4and \u03b3 -CoVs infect birds. Two recent outbreaks of viral pneumonia caused by \u03b2-CoVs are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). , an outbreak of SARS was first reported in China and then spread quickly worldwide, resulting in hundreds of deaths with an 11% mortality rate [3 , 4] .

The four structural proteins consist of the spike (S) surface glycoprotein, the membrane (M) protein, the envelope (E) protein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which are essential for SARS-CoV-2 assembly and infection. The spike surface glycoprotein plays a key role in its attachment to host cells and can be further cleaved by host proteases into an N-terminal S1 subunit and a membrane-bound C-terminal S2 region [17] . Binding of the S1 subunit to a host receptor can destabilise the prefusion trimer, leading to shedding of the S1 subunit and transition of the S2 subunit into a highly stable postfusion conformation [18] . In order to engage a host receptor, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit undergoes hinge-like conformational movements, which transiently hide or expose the determinants of receptor binding [19 , 20] . These two states of the S1 subunit can be regarded as the 'down' conformation and the 'up' conformation. The former represents an inaccessible state of the receptor, whereas the latter corresponds to an accessible state [19 , 21] . Therefore, understanding the structure and function of the spike protein can help to develop monoclonal antibody drugs and to guide the design and development of vaccines."}, {"section_title": "Etiology and pathogenesis of COVID-19", "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the family of CoVs that infect humans. Four human CoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) are able to cause a wide range of upper respiratory tract infections (common cold), whereas SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are responsible for atypical pneumonia. The causes of different infection sites are likely related to the presence of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the lower respiratory tract, which are the major human receptors for the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, respectively [22] [23] [24] . The genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is \u226570% similar to that SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 is capable of using the same cell entry receptor (ACE2) as SARS-CoV to infect humans [25 , 26] . However, there are more differences in the key S proteins that the viruses use to interact with host cells. SARS-CoV-2 spike binds to human ACE2 with approximately 10-20-fold higher affinity than the SARS-CoV spike [19] , making it easier to spread from human to human.\nUpon entry into alveolar epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-2 replicates rapidly and triggers a strong immune response, resulting in cytokine storm syndromes and pulmonary tissue damage. Cytokine storm syndromes, also known as hypercytokinaemia, are a group of disorders characterised by the uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and are important causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure [27] [28] [29] . Analysis of the first 99 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed that cytokine storm syndromes occurred in patients with severe COVID-19; 17 patients (17%) had ARDS, among whom 11 (11%) deteriorated within a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure [30] . In addition, the numbers of total T-cells, CD4 + T-cells and CD8 + T-cells are decreased in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the surviving T-cells are functionally exhausted [31] , suggesting a decreased immune function in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. ARDS, decreased immune function and secondary infection further worsens respiratory failure."}, {"section_title": "Progress and current status of the epidemic", "text": "Since December 2019, multiple cases of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were successively reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan. They shared a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan and the disease was been confirmed to be an acute respiratory infection caused by a novel CoV. To date, the number of patients without a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market is significantly increased. In addition, some cases without a history of travel to Wuhan have emerged [32] . These early phenomena suggest the possibility of human-tohuman transmission."}, {"section_title": "ARTICLE IN PRESS", "text": "JID: ANTAGE [m5G; April 7, 2020; 20:54 ] At present, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China has recorded a total of 80 304 confirmed cases of pneumonia with SARS-CoV-2 infection from 34 provinces (districts and cities).

In addition, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA was treated with intravenous remdesivir when the patient's condition deteriorated [41] . Although remdesivir has some benefits for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, randomised controlled trials are still required to determine its efficacy and safety. Taken together, these antiviral drugs may be promising treatment options for the treatment of COVID-19. However, there are also a few points worth noting here: (i) the potential interaction of these antiviral drugs with other therapeutic drugs should be considered; (ii) adverse reactions caused by lopinavir/ritonavir, such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and liver damage, should be also considered; (iii) it is not recommended to use three or more antiviral drugs at the same time, and the use of related drugs should be stopped when there are intolerable side effects; and (iv) further evaluation of the efficacy of current antiviral drugs in clinical applications is needed.\nJID: ANTAGE [m5G; April 7, 2020; 20:54 ] by SARS-CoV-2, effective prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia will be urgently needed. However, the development of drugs for pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 is still a major problem for humans, and there are currently no officially approved drugs to treat COVID-19. In view of the epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to interrupt the spread of the virus through epidemic prevention and control methods, such as isolating infected patients and controlling the source of infection. At the same time, wild animal trafficking must be banned to reduce the spread of CoVs. In addition, it is necessary to make full use of the currently limited evidence for therapeutic drugs to develop strategies of drug application to prevent and control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It has been confirmed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 shares high identity with that of bat and human SARS-CoVs. A number of antiviral drugs and treatment methods for SARS-CoV infection have also been considered for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 pneumonia.\nWe have been warned three times in recent years. CoVs are highly vulnerable to public-health intervention strategies, but the increasing incidence of CoV emergence in livestock animal populations and the identification of novel CoVs in reservoir species do not support this view. Therefore, in addition to developing new drugs and clinical trials of old drugs, the design and development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 is also needed. Lessons from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV suggest that SARS-CoV-2 research should focus on the establishment of animal models that recapitulate the various aspects of human disease and determinants of vaccine safety and efficacy.\nFunding: This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China [nos. 81570408 and 81770461]."}, {"section_title": "Origin of SARS-CoV-2", "text": "The initial source of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown, although the first cases were linked to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan city. Besides seafood, it is reported on social media that some wild animals including birds, snakes, marmots and bats were sold at the Huanan seafood market. It has been reported that environmental samples obtained from the marketplace have come back positive for the novel CoV, but the specific animal has not been identified [33] . More recently, several studies have suggested that bats may be the potential natural host of SARS-CoV-2 [26 , 34 , 35] . The whole genome-wide nucleotide sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is 96% identical to a bat CoV [26] . Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from pangolins and it was found that the isolated pangolin CoV genomes have ~85.5-92.4% similarity to SARS-CoV-2 [36] , suggesting that pangolin may be a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted directly from bats or by an intermediate host requires further confirmation. Learning from the role of camels in MERS and civets in SARS, hunting for the source of SARS-CoV-2 will help determine zoonotic transmission patterns and stem the ongoing outbreak."}, {"section_title": "Transmission route of SARS-CoV-2", "text": "The novel CoV can be transmitted between humans via respiratory droplets.

For example, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through direct or indirect contact with mucous membranes in the eyes, mouth or nose [37] [38] [39] . There is also a possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment with continuous exposure to high concentrations of aerosol. Moreover, it has been reported that COVID-19 patients have some gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting [40 , 41] . A recent study showed that the enteric symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia are associated with invaded ACE2-expressing enterocytes [42] , suggesting that the digestive tract is a potential route of SARS-CoV-2 infection besides the respiratory tract. However, additional studies are required to test this possibility.

Moreover, it has been reported that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients during their incubation periods can effectively transmit SARS-CoV-2 [51 , 52] , which is different from SARS-CoV because most SARS-CoV cases are infected by 'superspreaders' and SARS-CoV cases cannot infect susceptible persons during the incubation period [53] .

Liu et al. reviewed the R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 and found that the estimates ranged from 1.4-6.49, with a mean of 3.28 [54] , which is higher than that of SARS-CoV (R 0 of 2~5)."}, {"section_title": "Clinical presentation", "text": "At the onset of the disease, the main manifestations of COVID-19 are fatigue, fever, dry cough, myalgia and dyspnoea, with less common symptoms being nasal congestion, headache, runny nose, sore throat, vomiting and diarrhoea.

Moreover, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltration was observed in lung tissue. Multinucleated giant cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes characterised by large nuclei, prominent nucleoli and amphophilic granular cytoplasm were observed in the intra-alveolar spaces, suggesting viral cytopathic-like changes [55] .
