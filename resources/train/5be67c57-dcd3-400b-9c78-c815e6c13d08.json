[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by extracellular accumulation of the amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) protein forming senile plaques, and intracellular aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau into neurofibrillary tangles. These pathological events start approximately 20-30 years prior to dementia onset (Jansen et al., 2015) . APOE\u03b54 is the strongest non-Mendelian genetic risk factor for AD, apart from aging, and individuals with one or two \u03b54 alleles typically develop cerebral amyloidosis at an earlier age than those with no e4 allele. As such, individuals with the APOE\u03b54 genotype are more likely to have elevated levels of A\u03b2 on positron emission tomography (PET) and lower levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Jansen et al., 2015; Kok et al., 2009) . Recent work in animal models has shown that APOE\u03b54 is also related to tau pathogenesis and tau-mediated neurodegeneration, independently of A\u03b2 pathology (Shi et al., 2017) .\nThe ApoE protein is a critical regulator of cholesterol and lipid metabolism in the body, and within the central nervous system ApoE is expressed by astrocytes, pericytes and smooth muscle (Bruinsma et al., 2010) but it is strongly up-regulated by microglia in the context of A\u03b2 pathology and can influence the activation state of microglia (Krasemann et al., 2017; Uchihara et al., 1995) and higher systemic inflammation levels in both humans and animals (de la Torre, 1994; Iadecola, 2013; Zlokovic, 2011) . Chronic microglial activation is considered to be a prominent part of AD and can reduce A\u03b2 clearance and increase production of A\u03b2 in animal and in vitro models (Shi and Holtzman, 2018) . It has been suggested that chronic glial activation and the resulting immune response precedes and possibly drives tau pathology (Leyns and Holtzman, 2017; Yoshiyama et al., 2007) . Moreover, an imbalance between innate and adaptive immune systems is associated with AD in the general population (van der Willik et al., 2019) In addition to microglial activation, APOE\u03b54 is associated with increased vascular stiffness and higher vascular A\u03b2 deposition, which may be related to a decreased CSF flow and lower A\u03b2 clearance (Hughes et al., 2014) . A downstream pathological process underlying the association between vascular damage and AD pathology could be blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction (Iadecola, 2015) . This barrier is thought to be affected in most neurodegenerative diseases (Obermeier et al., 2013) , and BBB damage occurs independently from, and might precede both A\u03b2 and tau pathology (Chalbot et al., 2011; Freeze et al., 2017; Montagne et al., 2017; Nation et al., 2019) . Given these findings we tested whether BBB dysfunction and/or the elevated immune response (Hansson and Hermansson, 2011; Shi and Holtzman, 2018) could contribute to the relationship between the APOE genotype and AD pathology. We examined the complex relationships between APOE genotype, inflammation markers that have been associated with AD in literature, BBB dysfunction and AD pathology (Wyss-Coray and Rogers, 2012) using path analyses, in a memory clinic population varying from subjective cognitive complaints to mild AD dementia, providing a broad range in biomarker levels. In the current study, we used the ratio of CSF/plasma albumin: Q-Alb, a metric for BBB-dysfunction, which also encompasses blood-CSF barrier dysfunction.\nAdditionally, CSF biomarkers for AD pathology (p-Tau, A\u03b242) and plasma markers inflammation (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12p70) were used. We focused on plasma (rather than CSF) IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 as they have been associated with chronic neuroinflammation and are increased in Alzheimer's disease (Swardfager et al., 2010) as well as implicated in vascular risk, and IL-12p70\nas an inducer of IFN-\u03b3 (Mastrangelo et al., 2009; Trinchieri, 1995) A better understanding of the processes underlying the link between APOE\u03b54 and AD pathology could facilitate the identification of modifiable risk factors and plan preventative interventions in individuals at high-risk for AD dementia in the pre-symptomatic phase."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "A convenience sample of ninety-seven patients from the memory clinic of the Maastricht University Medical Center (MUMC) including individuals diagnosed with Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD dementia (see Table 1 for demographics). Diagnoses were made by experienced physicians based on the core clinical criteria for MCI (Albert et al., 2011) and AD dementia (McKhann et al., 2011) . Criteria for SCD diagnosis included the self-reported cognitive complaints and the endorsement of the question \"Do you think your memory is becoming worse\" (Geerlings et al., 1999; Jessen et al., 2010) . SCD patients did not have without having objective impairments on cognitive tests (defined as a score below -1.5SD of the age-, sex-, and education-adjusted mean).\nAs APOE\u025b4 carriers have a higher risk for dementia but also exhibit higher A\u03b2 and tau pathology at a younger age (Kok et al., 2009) , and APOE \u03b54 carriers with self-assessed cognitive concerns appear to have worse memory, and possibly accelerated memory decline (Samieri et al., 2014) , we decided not to place an age cut-off on the SCD-group. Exclusion criteria were: major neurological disease, clinical diagnosis of other neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. frontotemporal dementia), recent transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke (<2 years), history of severe psychiatric disorders, and alcohol or drug abuse.

We opted to focus on p-Tau as it is more closely related to AD pathology and highly correlated to t-Tau (r=0.92). In this study, both CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 and p-Tau181p are treated as continuous measures as accumulating evidence indicates that sub-threshold CSF levels can be predictive of future clinical progression and do not exclude incident AD (Tijms et al., 2017) . APOE genotyping was determined on genomic DNA using polymerase chain reaction. We also calculated the p-Tau/A\u03b2 ratio, as this has been shown to track well with cognitive decline (Fagan et al., 2007; Landau et al., 2010) and cumulative AD pathology (Racine et al., 2016) .\nIn addition, analyses of serum for interleukin (IL-1b, IL-6, IL12p70) (BD cytometric bead array, BD-biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) were performed and the CSF/plasma albumin ratio (Q-Alb) was determined using nephelometry.\nBecause our samples were taken from a biobank (aliquoted to avoid freeze thaw cycles) obtained at different times and it is known that prolonged storage, even at -80\u00b0C, can differentially affect the level of cytokines (de Jager et al., 2009) , we statistically corrected for storage times calculated from the day of entry in the biobank to the date of analysis.\nBlood pressure was measured using a standardized automated oscillometric cuff method."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "Statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.4.2 (www.R-project.org). Demographics are reported using the mean, standard deviation, and range. First, we examined the zero-order correlations between all pathologies by using Pearson's correlation analyses for continuous variables and point biserial correlations for dichotomous variables and continuous variables, and Phi correlation for two dichotomous variables.\nSecond, multivariable linear regression models were applied to test the additive and interactive association of BBB-dysfunction and inflammation markers on AD pathology (p-Tau, A\u03b2 and p-Tau/a\u03b2 ratio). Given the non-normality of the distributions and model residuals, the estimates were bootstrapped with 10,000 replicates, generating bias-corrected and accelerated 95% confidence intervals. All regression analyses were corrected for age, sex, sample storage time and diagnosis. No correction for multiple comparisons was used. Blood pressure is reported to have a relation with IL-6 and is a vascular risk factor. Blood pressure derivatives such as systolic pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP = (Systole + 2*Diastole)/3) and peak pressure (Systole-Diastole) are predictors of cardiovascular disease (Sesso et al., 2000) . Therefore, we assessed the inclusion systolic, mean arterial pressure and peak pressure as covariate into our models and chose the most parsimonious model. Third, the inflammation marker(s) that showed statistically robust relations in the above regression analyses was used in our path analyses, in which we added APOE status and tested possible associations between BBB-dysfunction, inflammation, p-tau/A\u03b2 and APOE genotype.\nBased on the literature, we tested three potential models against the null model by comparing model fit parameters.\nModel 0 assumes that there are independent associations of APOE\u03b54 on interleukins and Q-Alb and subsequently on AD pathology (p-Tau/ A\u03b2), this is the simplest model and hence, null model.\nModel 1 also assumes independent associations of APOE\u03b54 status on IL-6 and Q-Alb, but posits that IL-6 levels moderate the relation between Q-Alb and p-Tau/A\u03b2, i.e., that BBB dysfunction is associated with higher levels of AD pathology when systemic inflammation is higher.\nIn Model 2, we assume that IL-6 modulates the relationship between APOE\u03b54 status and Q-Alb and between Q-Alb and p-Tau/A\u03b2. Finally, in Model 3 we reversed the order between Q-Alb and p-Tau/A\u03b2, (AD pathology positively correlates with Q-Alb) but still assume that IL-6 modulates the association of APOE\u03b54 and of p-Tau/A\u03b2. Model fit was acceptable at a \u03c7 2 p-value>0.05, a comparative fit index (CFI) of >0.90, a root-meansquare error-of-approximation (RMSEA) of less than 0.08 and a standardized-root-mean-squareapproximation-residual (SRMR) < 0.08. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is used to quantify the relationship between goodness of fit and model complexity. AIC allows the comparison of nonnested models with identical degrees of freedom (lower AIC is preferred). The standard errors of the estimates in the models were bootstrapped over 10,000 replicates, generating bias-corrected and accelerated (BCA) 95% confidence intervals."}, {"section_title": "Sample size and power", "text": "As commonly used rules of thumb for sample size in SEM are not model specific, they will severely over-or underestimate the required number of participants needed, as the level of communality across the variables, sample size, and degree of factor determinacy all affect the accuracy of the parameter estimates and model fit statistics (MacCallum et al., 1999; Wolf et al., 2013) . Therefore, we used Monte Carlo simulations (10.000 draws, alpha 0.05, two-sided) (Muth\u00e9n and Muth\u00e9n, 2002; Wolf et al., 2013) to take into account these factors and assess the effects of varying sample size and determine power using Simsem (simsem.org) (Jorgensen et al., 2018) .

Our sample had a mean age of 63.0 (SD=9.23) years, 70% of the participants were male and 48% of the individuals carried at least one \u03b54 allele. The three individuals (all SCD) younger than 45 years, all carried at least one \u03b54 allele. The age of the APOE\u03b54 non-carriers was not significantly different from the carriers (t (91.59) =0.36, df=91.59, p=0.71), but the proportion of males was larger in the non-carriers relative to the carriers (\u03c7 2 =4.48, p=0.03).

Being an APOE\u03b54 carrier was associated with male sex, having lower A\u03b242, and IL-6, and having a higher p-Tau/A\u03b2 ratio. Q-Albumin only correlated with sex (male sex). When we examined the inflammation markers, IL-6 correlated positively with age and IL12p70. IL-12p70 levels correlated positively with education, p-Tau, ttau, IL-6, and the p-Tau/A\u03b2 ratio, and IL1b only correlated negatively with the male sex."}, {"section_title": "Additive and interactive associations of BBB-dysfunction and inflammation on the p-Tau/A\u03b2 ratio", "text": "To guide our model building, we first investigated whether BBB dysfunction and inflammation contribute additively or synergistically to AD pathology by performing bootstrapped regression models.

There were no additive or interaction associations between Q-Alb and IL-1b or IL-12p70.

"}, {"section_title": "Figure 2 about here", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In the current study, it was our goal to examine whether APOE genotype impacts AD pathology via inflammation and BBB dysfunction in a memory-clinic population. Our results demonstrate that a combination of modestly elevated levels of IL-6 and BBB dysfunction are associated with greater AD pathology in a population at-risk for vascular problems (\u03b54 carriers). This adds to the large body of work pointing towards both vascular and immune factors contributing to AD pathology. Given the recent disappointments in several clinical trials targeting A\u03b2 in AD, (Egan et al., 2018; Honig et al., 2018; Salloway et al., 2014) these observations provide more support to target multiple etiologies or to conduct preventive trials in at-risk populations focused at maintaining optimal cardiovascular health, potentially in conjunction with monitoring the immune system. In fact, recent large scale studies targeting vascular risk such as the SPRINT trial showed that treatment to a lower blood pressure target not only markedly reduced cardiac risk , it also lowered the risk for MCI and possibly dementia (SPRINT MIND Investigators for the SPRINT Research Group, 2019), while an upregulated innate immune system was associated with increased risk of developing dementia in the Rotterdam study (van der Willik et al., 2019) .\nAlthough a multitude of animal and neuropathology studies established associations between the APOE\u03b54 genotype and BBB integrity (Bell et al., 2012; Halliday et al., 2016; Nishitsuji et al., 2011; Utter et al., 2008) , a direct relationship has been more elusive in human populations (Janelidze et al., 2017) . APOE was known for its role in cardiovascular risk (20, 30) before it was recognized as a major risk factor in early and late onset AD. In addition, APOE affects lipid metabolism and transport, has been shown to modulate the BBB in an isoform-dependent manner in in vitro (Nishitsuji et al., 2011) and post-mortem human studies (Halliday et al., 2016) , and the APOE\u03b54 genotype is associated with an upregulated innate immune system. We\nobserved that of the cytokines tested, only IL-6 modulated the relationship between Q-Alb and p-Tau/A\u03b2 in our study sample. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine linked to not only to innate immunity, vascular health and increased cardiac risk, BBB permeability and activation of microglia, (Held et al., 2017; Kitazawa et al., 2005) but is also associated with cognitive impairment (Weaver et al., 2002) .\nThe involvement of IL-6 in the pathophysiology of AD within the proposed framework is conceivable for several reasons. First, IL-6 is involved in the remodeling of microvasculature, causing thickening of endothelium and decreasing lumen available for blood flow (Ricard et al., 2014) , as well as defective angiogenesis (Gopinathan et al., 2015) . Second, the relationship between IL-6 and AD pathology is consistent with meta-analyses of cytokines showing involvement of IL-6 in AD and an increased risk of all cause dementia (Koyama et al., 2013; Swardfager et al., 2010) . Third, greater levels of IL-6 increase levels of serum amyloid A, which especially for the APOE\u03b54+ genotype negatively affects the transport mechanism involved in the clearance of A\u03b2 (Hagihara et al., 2004; Miida et al., 2006) in addition to affecting atherosclerosis.\nAs we are using plasma it is relevant to know if these peripheral cytokines can cross the BBB.\nEvidence suggests this is the case: circulating IL-6 in the blood can cross the BBB by influencing tight junctions by upregulating the adhesion molecule VCAM-1 allowing T-cells to traverse the endothelial layer along with IL-6. This enables both IL-6 and T-cells to cross the BBB unchecked by transporters, where it can activate astrocytes and microglia cells in the CNS leading to secretion of more IL-6 within the brain (Oh et al., 1998; Rothaug et al., 2016) . While our work as well as recent work by Nation (Nation et al., 2019) did not find a direct relationship between CSF IL-6 and AD pathology or disease staging, our data now suggests that IL-6 is associated with greater AD pathology in the context of higher BBB dysfunction. This was especially the case in APOE\u025b4+ carriers. In the APOE\u025b4+ group we found a lower mean level of IL-6 compared to APOE\u025b4-. Although we found lower levels of IL-6, these levels combined with comparatively low levels of Q-Alb were associated with higher levels of AD pathology in APOE\u025b4+ carriers. Such a relationship was not observed in the APOE\u025b4-group, who could withstand higher levels of IL-6.\nIt has been shown that in APOE\u025b4+ carriers, the IL-6 pathway is altered, in such a way that increased IL-6 receptor levels in APOE\u025b4+ carriers may explain the greater effect of lower IL-6 levels (Haddick et al., 2017) . In the entire sample, the multiplicative effect of IL-6 and Q-Alb ratio on AD pathology is significant starting from low levels of IL-6 (>1.59 ng/l) and at a Q-Alb ratio of 5.6 or greater, well below the upper reference limit of 10.2 for individuals older than 45 years or 6.8 for <45 years (Blennow et al., 1993) . Taken together this suggest that IL-6 (probably as a proxy for an upregulated immune system) can link APOE4, BBB dysfunction and AD pathology together.\nMechanistically, inflammation may drive hyperphosphorylation of tau (Collins-Praino and Corrigan, 2017; Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1986; Hampel et al., 2010; Kitazawa et al., 2005; Quintanilla et al., 2004) . Tau itself is thought to induce blood vessel abnormalities, (Bennett et al., 2018) possibly affecting BBB function and perpetuating the inflammatory response. When we reversed BBB and p-Tau/A\u03b2 relationship in our path analyses (model 3), however, we found no evidence for this model."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and future perspectives", "text": "Q-Albumin may reflect BBB permeability, but also reflects the function of the blood-CSF-barrier at the choroid plexus (Janelidze et al., 2017) and therefore we cannot differentiate between these two systems. The blood-CSF-barrier might be more affected by vascular damage (Wolburg and Paulus, 2010) . Using additional markers linked to pericyte function such as SPDGF-\u00df might be of interest in future research. Second, while IL-6 is relatively indifferent to pre-analytical factors and stable in storage for several years, absolute levels of cytokines can be affected by time in storage, even at -80\u00b0C. Linearly correcting for storage duration did not change our findings.\nCytokines show a circadian rhythm which might affect sampled levels (Scheiermann et al., 2018) .\nFuture studies should take these sources of variation into account.\nUnintentional biases such as survival bias could play a role as APOE-E4 carriers, particularly those with higher levels of IL-6 and elevated p-tau and a\u03b2, may struggle to maintain sufficient health to attend our outpatient clinic. The sample size of this study is adequate for the use of these path analyses, however for future research using more complex models utilizing the diagnostic subgroup and cognition a larger sample size is needed to ensure adequate power.\nThese models are based on cross-sectional data, and do not infer causal relationships.\nLongitudinal studies with larger sample size with more emphasis on immune status are required to better probe these complex relationships as current large-scale studies such as ADNI do not have all required data.\nAccording to the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines both the APOE carriers and non-carriers would be classified as stage-2 hypertension, and this possibly limits the generalizability of our findings.\nHowever, none of the blood pressure metrics significantly contributed to the explained variance when added as a covariate (either as systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure or mean arterial pressure)\nFinally, IL-6 represents a small part of highly complex system. However, its important role in innate, humoral and cell mediated immunity does provide an indication of the state of the immune system that could in turn affect pathways that affect vascular health as well as contribute to AD pathology.\nIn light of the failure of multiple amyloid clearance trails, a rethink might be in order. The direct approach to treating or even delaying AD has so far been disappointing notwithstanding massive efforts. However, given the extensive experience with the long-term treatment of vascular risk factors with acceptable side effects, an extra focus on this major comorbidity in specific subgroups may be important.\nWhile vascular risk factors might not be the primary cause of AD, we provide some evidence that it might contribute to AD pathology possibly in concert with an upregulated immune system. An early intervention approach in individuals with increased risk such as APOE \u03b5 4 carriers could be a valuable asset in, what is bound to be a multisystem approach to the treatment of AD and dementias in general."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Our findings provide evidence that a combination of modestly elevated levels of IL-6 and BBB dysfunction are associated with greater AD pathology in APOE\u025b4 carriers of a memory clinic "}]
