Under the sponsorship of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), with additional support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Languages Affairs (OBEMLA), and other entities and agencies, NELS:88 is being conducted in several waves. The first wave (the 1988 base year) recorded the experiences of a nationally representative sample of 26,432 eighth graders within a nationally representative sample of 1,052 of their schools. The second wave (the 1990 first follow-up, which provides the basis for this report) traced them to the tenth grade. A sample of around 1400 high schools enrolling 1988 eighth graders in 1990 was drawn, and a sample of 20,542 students and dropouts pursued in the second wave of data collection. The third wave (the 1992 second follow-up) followed them to the twelfth grade, while the fourth wave (the 1994 third follow-up) will follow them out of high school. The longitudinal design of NELS:88 permits researchers not only to observe the critical transition of students from middle or junior high school to high school, but also to identify early student, school, and parental experiences that promote student learning. This report delineates the experiences of spring 1990 sophomores, particularly with respect to their learning and achievement in mathematics, as well as science, reading, and social studies; the processes by which they make choices about school classes, postsecondary education, and employment; and their plans for the future, particularly their educational expectations, their plans for taking the standard college entrance exams, and their perception of the expectations their counselors and families hold for them. In order to produce a reasonably concise report in which tenth graders speak largely for themselves, A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 relies primarily on data gathered from students. Nevertheless, readers should be aware that NELS:88 takes into consideration the much larger environment in which the student functions and develops. Thus, in addition to student test and self-report data, NELS:88 incorporates supporting data from students' school principals, parents, and teachers to identify additional factors that affect student achievement. NELS:88 also incorporates archival sources such as high school transcripts that record grades and course-taking patterns. It is our hope that this report will be of interest to policymakers and educational practitioners, as well as to education researchers. Policymakers can use NELS:88 results to turn statistics into practical, workable programs to help solve the problems facing the American educational system and its students. Researchers may be inspired by this report to use NELS:88 data to explore their own interests and concerns, and to thereby further illuminate the condition and prospects of American secondary education."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION PURPOSE OF NELS:88", "text": "The major features of NELS:88 include the planned integration of student, dropout, parent, teacher, and school studies; initial concentration on an eighth-grade cohort with follow-ups at twoyear intervals; inclusion of supplementary components to support analyses of demographically distinct subgroups; and design linkages to previous longitudinal studies and other current studies. Multiple research and policy objectives are addressed through the NELS:88 design. The study is intended to produce a general purpose dataset for the development and evaluation of educational policy at all government levels. Part of its aim is to inform decision makers, education practitioners, and parents about the changes in the operation of the educational system over time and the effects of various elements of the system on the lives of the individuals who pass through it. Specifically, NELS:88 focuses on a number of interrelated policy issues, including: students' academic growth over time, and the family, community, school, and classroom factors that promote or inhibit student learning; the transition of different types of students from eighth grade to secondary school (and later, from secondary school to postsecondary education or the labor force); the influence of ability grouping and differential course-taking opportunities on future educational experiences and outcomes; determinants and consequences of dropping out of (and of returning to) the educational system; changes in educational practices over time; and the role of the school in helping the disadvantaged and the school experiences and academic performance of language-minority students."}, {"section_title": "BASE YEAR DESIGN", "text": "The base year surrey was conducted in the spring term of the 1987-1988 school year. A clustered, stratified national probability sample of 1,052 public and private eighth-grade schools participated. Almost 25,000 students across the United States participated in the base year study. The sample represents the nation's eighth-grade population, totalling over 3 million eighth graders in more than 38,000 schools in spring 1988. Questionnaires and cognitive tests were administered to each selected student. The student questionnaire inquired about school experiences, activities, attitudes, self-concept, plans, selected background characteristics, and language proficiency. The school principal completed a questionnaire about the school; two teachers of each student were asked to answer questions about the student, about themselves, and about their school; and one parent of each student was surveyed about family characteristics and student activities. xii A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 FIRST FOLLOW-UP DESIGN The first follow-up survey was conducted primarily in the spring term of the 1989-1990 school year. As in the base year, students were asked to complete a questionnaire and cognitive test. The cognitive test was designed to measure tenth-grade achievement and cognitive growth between 1988 and A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 school, including the process of educational decision making. Chapter 4 reports on sophomores' plans for the future, including their educational expectations and aspirations. Taken together, these four chapters provide a statistical profile of the American high school sophomore in 1990, which is summarized in Chapter 5. Appendices A and B provide technical notes and tables of standard errors of measurement and sample sizes for all reported population estimates. Appendix C contains farther information about NELS:88 in general and the first follow-up in particular. Appendix D presents additional tabulations on reading and social studies achievement, while Appendix E is a bibliography of OERI-sponsored NELS:88 publications that includes a content abstract for each report. Comparisons cited in this report have been tested for statistical significance using Bonferroni adjustments and are significant at the .05 level. (The overall alpha is adjusted, based on the number of possible comparisons; see Appendix B for a discussion of procedures used.) THE NELS:88 SOPHOMORE COHORT: BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTICS Before examining in detail the learning and achievement, outside-school activities, decision making, and educational expectations of America's 1990 sophomores, it may be useful to review some of their basic background characteristics, as displayed in Table I.1. Just over three-fifths of the 1990 sophomores come from \"traditional\" families in which both the mother and father are present. Some 90 percent of them attend public schools. The cohort is evenly split between males and females. The cohort is 72.5 percent non-Hispanic white, 12.5 percent non-Hispanic black, 10.2 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Asian, and just over 1 percent American Indian. Because some students have dropped out of school and different racial/ethnic groups have different dropout rates, the racial proportions of sophomores are somewhat different from those found by viewing the NELS:88 sample as a whole. Most members of the cohort turned 16 in the course of 1990, although more than one-third turned 17 or 18 in that year. Not all cohort members knew their mother's highest level of education-11 percent did not.' Based on responses from the 89 percent who did know, about 34 percent of the total cohort had mothers who had gone no farther than high school graduation, while 13 percent had mothers who had not completed high school. Some 21.5 percent indicated that their mothers had a college degree or higher (includes college graduate, MA or equivalent, or Ph.D. or equivalent). Several of these characteristicsin particular, race/ethnicity, gender, and the control type (public, Catholic, and so on) of the school attended in 1990--are systematically employed in the tables in this report to define groups and explore differences among their members on key measures of interest. In addition, a composite measure of socioeconomic status that includes parents' educational attainment and occupational status and family income or household items is also systematically employed in this way, as are, from time to time, other variables such as family composition and sophomores' expectations of :ompleting college. NELS:88 collects data from multiple sources and the base year parent questionnaire also inquired into the highest level of maternal and paternal education. Mother's and father's highest level of education completed was missing less than one percent of the time on the parent data file. A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 CHAPTER 1: MATHEMATICS LEARNING AND ACHIEVEMENT OF 1990 SOPHOMORES Mathematics achievement and standards are currently of considerable national interest, an interest spurred in part by a drive to be competitive in a global economy and by evidence of lagging performance of American students on the mathematical components of international assessments.' In the  Second International Matirtmatics Study (SIMS), U.S. students scored below the international average for the 20 participating nations on geometry and measurement, though above average on statistics. Analysts of the SIMS data observed that the time invested in mathematics by American students is \"largely devoted to mastery of the computational skills which would have been needed by a shopkeeper in the year 1940--skills needed by virtually no one today\" (McKnight et al., 1987). In the first International Assessment of Educational Progress in 1988, U.S. 13-year-olds scored among the lowest in mathematics among a group of countries and Canadian provinces (Lapointe, Mead, & Phillips, 1989). In the second International Assessment of Educational Progress in 1991, 13-year-olds from the United States and Spain scored lower in math on average than students from the other populous countries tested (Korea, Taiwan, the Soviet Union, France, and Canada) (Lapointe, Askew, & Mead, 1992). In the same study, American 9-year-olds scored below their peers in 11 of 14 nations. The tested achievement of American students in mathematics may be compared not only to the accomplishments of their contemporaries in other countries, but also to the achievement of earlier cohorts of American students. For example, sophomore mathematics achievement in 1980 (as measured by HS&B) may be compared to sophomore achievement in 1990 (as measured by NELS:88).2 This 10-year comparison shows that there have been measurable changes in mathematics achievement. Overall, 1990 sophomores performed modestly better than did the 1980 cohort. Moreover, the gap between the math performance of traditionally higher achieving Asians and whites, on the one hand, and that of blacks and Hispanics, on the other, had narrowed somewhat by 1990. Specifics follow: Between 1980 and 1990, sophomores gained in mathematics achievement.' White and Asian math achievement continued to be higher, though black and Hispanic students closed some of the gap ny showing proportionately greater gains in math in 1990 than did their white or Asian counterparts. While both male and female sophomores had higher tested math achievement in 1990 than in 1980, the increases were essentially equal for both groups--that is, the amount of gain was the same for males and for females. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) does not assess sophomores as such. However, NAEP supplies rich trend data for 13-and 17-year-olds, the two age groups that effectively bracket the IFor a summary of findings from international mathematics and science assessments in recent years and an examination of the statistical limitations and uses of such findings, see Medrich and Griffith, 1992 (see the bibliography of this report for a full citation). 2HS&B-NELS:88 comparisons are taken from Rasinski, Inge ls, Rock and Pollack, 1993 (America's High School Sophomores: A Ten Year Comparison, 1980. 3Specifically, 1990 sophomcres are performing 26 percent of a standard deviation higher on the math test than their comparable cohorts from 1980 (after standardizing, HS&B mean = 32.81; NELS:88 mean = 35.97). In general, NAEP data show that while there have been improvements in overall mathematics performance, and while some demographic subgroups have shown disproportionate (albeit comparatively modest) gains, mathematics learning remains highly unequal across demographic subpopulations, and improvements in basic skills and knowledge have not been matched by improvements in higher-order thinking skills. Despite some improvements over time, it is highly doubtful whether American high school students have realized their full potential to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate mathematical data. The need and desire for fundamental improvement in mathematical understanding forms the backdrop for the examination of practices and achievement that follows. Efforts at school improvementin particular, such reforms as increasing the number of courses taken in key subjects such as mathematics, making the content of such courses more rigorous, and improving the methods by which such courses are taught--have been a prominent feature of the years in which NELS:88 sample members passed through middle and junior high schools and on into high schoo1.5 It is therefore of particular interest to examine how much American tenth graders have achieved in mathematics, what sociodemographic characteristics mark differences between those who have high achievement levels and those who do not, and the extent to which changes that have or can be made to occur in the learning environment may promote more effective schools and in turn improved mathematics learning. A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 An examination of three facets of the school experience and achievement of 1990 sophomores in mathematics will illustrate the kinds of questions and issues that NELS:88 data address. These three facets, and the principal questions attached to each of them, are sketched below: Mathematics Course Taking Curriculum exposure--What math courses have sophomores taken? Equity--Who takes \"gatekeeper\" courses in mathematics?"}, {"section_title": "Instructional Practices", "text": "Classroom practices--What resources and activities are employed in the tenth-grade mathematics classroom? Equity: Are there group differences in exposure to particular classroom practices? Instructional emphasis--In the sophomore's view what objectives do teachers stress in the classroom? Tested Achievement Background factors--Are there differences in the tested achievement of key demographic subgroups? Instructional factors--How do curriculum exposure and classroom practice relate to test scores? Mathematics Course Taking. First, it will be of interest to examine the math courses that sophomores have taken since eighth grade, as well as the characteristics of the course takers. Although most sophomores are still enrolled in math, there is great variation in the kinds of mathematics courses they have taken. In turn, there are also important differences in the rigor or academic content found '.cross the diversity of mathematics courses that sophomores have been exposed to. Finally, there are important differences in the racial/ethnic, socioeconomic status, and school sector characteristics of those who enroll in the different kinds of math classes, including college preparatory mathematics. Instructional Practices. Second, it will be of interest to examine student reports of the instructional practices or activities employed in their classrooms and the sources available to support those practices, as well as reports of sophomores' perceptions of the objectives their teachers emphasize in class. The 1989 National Council of Teachers of Mathematics professional standards for mathematics instruction provide a model of reformed mathematics teaching. NELS:88 data provide a 1990 benchmark for gauging the pace and direction of instructional change in the future, complemented by 1990 NAEP date on other grade levels. A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 Tested Achievement. Third, it will be of interest to examine mathematics achievement, as measured by the NELS:88 cognitive test battery, in relation to such student background factors as sex and race', family socioeconomic status, and control type of school attended. Likewise, it will be of interest to examine mathematics achievement in relation to alterable curricular and instructional factors, such as amount of advanced math coursework taken and the teacher's instructional techniques and classroom emphases."}, {"section_title": "COURSE TAKING", "text": "In this section, we will first explore the kind and amount of mathematics coursework sophomores completed during ninth and tenth grade. Then we will investigate subgroup differences in the opportunity to learn mathematics. We will accomplish this by examining which students or groups of students have taken a year of geometry and by comparing students who have completed low-level, medium-!evel, and high-level math :ourse sequences."}, {"section_title": "What math courses have sophomores taken?", "text": "Even though course titles can mean different things in different schools and content for courses with the same names may vary considerably from place to place, course enrollment reports do provide an approximate measure of exposure to mathematical contents and concepts. The general tendency of school reform has been to de-emphasize electives and place added emphasis--both in terms of numbers of courses taken and the rigor of the content of those courses--on academic subjects such as mathematics. Since the 1983 publication of A Nation at Risk, 42 of the 50 states have raised their high school graduation requirements, with math one of the subjects most strongly affected by increased requirements, and 47 states have mandated student testing standards (Coley & Goertz, 1990;Medrich, Brown, & Henke, 1992). Over and beyond what may be required as a minimum for graduation in any given state--or in a given district or school (local requirements often exceed those of the state)--the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics recommends that 3 years of mathematics courses be completed by every high school student, regardless of ability level, with a fourth year recommended for the college-bound. In 19908 math course completion statistics for high school graduates just met this recommendation (Legum et al., 1993, Table 14), reflecting an increase in the amount of mathematics coursework completed by secondary school students over the course of the 1980s. The mean number of math credits earned by High School and Beyond seniors in 1982 was 2.45, while the mean for seniors in 1990 was 3.11. Students are more likely to complete a cognitively demanding mathematics course as well. For example, more students now complete a one year :ourse in geometry than did so when the HS&B data were collected (transcript A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 data show that 45.7 percent of HS&B 1982 seniors had completed a year of geometry, as compared to 64.7 percent of 1990 seniors).9 In 1988 the majority of eighth graders (58 percent) were enrolled in regular math, with about a third enrolled in more demanding math courses such as pre-algebra or algebra and 5 percent in remedial math (Hafner, Inge ls, Schneider, & Stevenson 1990). In 1990, the overwhelming majority of tenth graders were still enrolled in math (between 3 and 4 percent of sophomores reported that they were not enrolled in mathematics during the 1989-1990 school year), and reported taking a wide variety of math courses in ninth and tenth grade. Math courses ranged from general and business math, to various levels of algebra and geometry, and even to trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus. The fact of widespread enrollment in math cannot automatically be assumed to reflect a high level of commitment to mathematics learning, as evidenc..Pfd behaviorally by factors such as time spent on homework or out-of-class study. Enrollment in a course does not automatically ensure either that teachers will make exacting demands or that students will exhibit a high level of commitment to mastering its contents. The findings that of sophomores who are enrolled in mathematics, more than 70 percent report that they spend less than 1 hour on math homework in school per week and more than 60 percent report that they spend less than 1 hour on math homework outside school each week underscore this fact with some force.' Nonetheless, past studies have demonstrated that there is a strong positive relationship between the quantity of coursework taken and achievement.\" While there is little variation in whether sophomores are taking mathematics, there is great variation in the kind of math they have taken since leaving eighth grade. If the quantity of mathematics taken is important, so too is the kind of mathematics--for example, how much advanced coursework has been taken. '2 Although the high school math curriculum tends not to be explicitly tracked by course level into the regular, remedial, and advanced courses that are typical at eighth grade, the diverse math courses offered in high school are associated with a hierarchy of levels of cognitive demand. Indeed, mathematics far more than certain other subjects (for example, English) is highly sequential, and mastery of specific skills is associated with progression through the sequence of offerings. Moreover, some high school students take a general mathematics sequence; others, a college-preparatory sequence. Hence some tenth graders have been enrolled in less intellectually demanding mathematics courses such as general math, \"In particular, see Schmidt (1983), who employed NLS-72 data to analyze the relationship between tested achievement and quantity of instruction, and Walberg and Shanahan (1983), whose analyses of HS &B data found semesters of coursework to be the alterable variable most strongly related to academic achievement. 'Evidence for this may be found in other analyses of the NELS:88 first follow-up data. Owings and Lee (1993) found that even after controlling for eighth grade mathematics ptoficiency, higher math gains were associated with course taking patterns that reflected advanced level math courses (that is, geometry, algebra Ii, trigonometry, precalculus, or calculus). A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 while others have taken algebra, geometry, or yet more advanced math courses. As can be seen from the student questionnaire response frequencies below\", around half of tenth graders had not taken geometry by spring term of sophomore year, more than 30 percent had taken no algebra since leaving eighth grade, while around 62 percent had completed at least a year of algebra. (However, some of the students who reported no algebra for ninth and tenth grade may have completed algebra in eighth grade.) Very few have taken advanced math courses such as trigonometry, precalculus, or calculus at this stage in their high school careers. This wide variation in course-taking reflects several factors. One such factor is prior eflucational experience--some students were selected to take (or opted to take) algebra in eighth grade, others were not. Another such factor i the greater amount of student choice in programs and in specific subject-taking in high school. Curriculum placement--whether a student is in an academic, general, or vocational program-may account for much of the quantitatively and qualitatively differential course-taking of high school sophomores. Enrollment or placement in the academic/college preparatory curriculum is associated both with completion of a greater number of course units in mathematics, and with enrollment in cognitively more demanding math courses than is the case for those placed in vocational or general programs. (Moreover, it is often argued [see, for example, Oakes 19851 that a student's program placement influences his or her wider learning environment and its opportunities, as well as the specific instructional practices to which the student will be exposed.) In their analyses of HS&B data, Ekstrom, Goertz and Rock (1988) found curriculum placement to influence course taking (students in the academic curriculum took half a year more math than comparable students in other curricula) and amount of homework completed per week, as well as rate of cognitive growth in mathematics. 1.1.2 Who takes \"gatekeeper\" courses? Given the educational objective of eliminating racial, economic, and gender inequities in high school achievement--and in subsequent entry into and persistence in postsecondary educationit is important to examine students' patterns of curriculum participation. Both the amount and the rigor or quality of coursework taken are important to academic achievement. Later in this chapter we report data that measure the relationship between completion of a course sequence in advanced math and tested achievement. How much and what kind of courses have been completed may influence not just test scores but other educational outcomes as well, such as entry into college. To the extent that course-taking choices are manipulable or alterable, that is, can be influenced or changed, they become especially relevant to policy. Instructional practices, too, will make results more inequitable if there is variation in the populations exposed to the most effective practices. Findings from NELS:88's predecessor study, HS&B, illustrate how specific coursework may affect subsequent educational outcomes. In their invesilgation of factors increasing access to college, Pelavin and Kane (1990) employed HS&B high school transcript data in conjunction with information on college attendance obtained in later rounds. They found that there were certain \"gatekeeper courses\"--in particular, geometry, and foreign language'--that were strongly associated with college attendance (even more so than was type of academic program in which a student was enrolled). Moreover, the gap in college enrollment between white students on the one hand and black and Hispanic students on the other and between poor students and those from more prosperous families was greatly reduced among the students who had taken these courses. Specifically, Pelavin and Kane found: About 40 percent of white students took geometry, but only 19 percent of black students and 17 percent of Hispanic students did so. About 25 percent of lower income students took geometry in comparison with 51 percent of students in the highest income group. More than 80 percent of black students who took geometry attended college within 4 years of high school graduation; the rate was 82 percent for Hispanic students who took geometry, and 83 percent for white students taking this course. The gap between [black and Hispanic] minorities and whites virtually disappears among students who took geometry. About 71 percent of students from the lowest income group who took geometry attended college within 4 years of high school graduation in comparison with 88 percent of students from the highest income group who took the course (Pelavin & Kane, 1990, p. 76). Geometry was found to be related not just to the likelihood of college attendance, but also to persistence--that is, to whether a student completed college. Indeed, Pelavin and Kane reported that only 1 student in 20 who had less than a year of geometry \"attained a bachelor's degree or college senior status 140ther courses to which a gatekeeper role often in attributed include algebra (especially at eighth grade) and laboratory science. On the basis of their analyses of HS&B data (11S&B did not begin until tenth grade), Pelavin and Kane found geometry and foreign lar ge to be the two most powerful course predictors of later postsecondary entry. It should be noted that within hierarchically ,itenced course domains such as mathematics, certain courses act not only as gatekeepers for higher education, but also as gatekeepers for enrollment in other critical courses, and that placements (or choices) prior to high school are associated with advanced course-taking in high school. (Thus, for example, Hoffer and Thomas, analyzing data from the Longitudinal Study of American Youth, report that 88 percent of 1993 seniors taking calculus completed a first course in algebra in eighth grade.) within four years of high school graduation\" while \"only 1 out of every 40 black students who did not take at least one year of high school geometry attained a bachelor's degree or senior status within four years of high school graduation; the comparable figure for Hispanic students is 1 in 60.\" Given such findings from NELS:88's predecessor study, we examine below the student-reported enrollment in geometry and in advanced math, with attention to differences found by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, and school control type. Subsequently, we examine group differences in reported exposure to certain key instructional practices. Sophomores were classified according to whether they had taken an advanced math sequence (a year of coursework, taken from any combination of Algebra II, trigonometry, precalculus or calculus). Sophomores who had not taken such an advanced sequence but had taken a year or more of algebra or geometry were put in a middle group. Finally, those sophomores who had not taken a year or more of algebra 1 or of geometry were categorized as belonging to the low math course-taking group. Tables 1.2 (math course level) and 1.3 (geometry) show similar patterns of results, which are summarized below; Figure 1.1 graphs the variation in the proportion of students who have taken advanced math coursework by school control type and by race/ethnicity."}, {"section_title": "Race/ethnicity, Math Coursework Results", "text": "Asians are significantly more likely than whites to have completed advanced coursework in mathematics (32 percent for Asians versus 25 percent for whites) while whites are more likely than Asians to fall into the low coursework category (15 percent for Asians as opposed to 22 percent for whites). On the other hand, whites are significantly more likely to have taken advanced coursework (25 percent) than are Hispanics (19 percent), blacks (19 percent), or American Indians (13 percent). Asians are more likely to fall into the advanced group and less likely to fall into the low group than any other minority racial/ethnic category (32 percent of Asians are in the advanced math group, contrasted to 25 percent of whites, 19 percent each for blacks and Hispanics, and 13 percent for American Indians; only 15 percent of Asians are in the low coursework level, contrasted to 36 percent of Hispanics, 32 percent of blacks, 22 percent of whites, and 43 percent of American Indians)."}, {"section_title": "School control", "text": "When public schools are contrasted with Catholic schools, there is no significant difference in math course taking at the advanced level, but public school students are more likely to be in the low coursework level (27 percent for public versus 6 percent for Catholic), and Catholic school students are more likely to fall into the middle level (71 percent of Catholic school students as opposed to 51 percent of public). Public school students are more likely to fall into the low math category than those of any of the three other school types (Catholic, NAIS, other private), though at the advanced level, only NAIS students are significantly better represented than public school students."}, {"section_title": "2\" 9", "text": "A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 Most students in this category reported that they nad taken no geometry (48.2% of all sophomoreQ) though some 1990 sophomores (5.1%) had taken a single semester. bSome 45.3 percent of all sophomores reported that they had taken one year only while 1.4 percent reported that they had taken more than a year of geometry (e.g., a year of plane, plus a semester of solid, geometry). Note: Owing to rounding, rows may not sum to 100 percent. Source: National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988: First Follow-Up (1990  The likelihood of falling into the advanced math coursework group is significantly higher for NAIS students than for any other school type (63 percent for NAIS versus 23 percent for both public and Catholic and 32 percent for other private). Socioeconomic status (SES)ts [1][2][3][4] When the lowest and highest quartiles are contrasted, there are significant differences between them across all three categories of coursework. More than four times as many lowest SES quartile tenth graders than their counterparts from the highest SES quartile are found in the lowest math coursework level (43 percent for the lowest SES quartile, 9 percent for the highest). On the other hand, high-SES' sophomores appear in the high math coursework category at more than double the rate of low-SES sophomores (35 percent versus 15 percent). 17"}, {"section_title": "Gender", "text": "More males are in the low level math coursework category, and more females are in the middle level. The difference between males and females in advanced level coursework is not significant.\nGender differences are not significant for geometry course taking. Male sophomores are no more likely than female sophomores to have taken a year or more of geometry.\nMales were more likely than females (25 percent versus 20 percent) to have mastered complex problem-solving skills; otherwise, gender differences in sophomore mathematics achievement were not statistically significant.\nAs in the NELS:88 base year, gender differences in mathematics achievement were comparatively small. Except for the modest male advantage in the highest math quartile, differences by quartile were not statistically significant.' 24Other NELS:88 findings on mathematics achievement in relation to gender should be noted. When male and female mean math test scores are compared, there are no significant gender ..fferences in overall mathematics scores, although when test scores are viewed in terms of proficiency levels, a slightly higher proportion of tenth -grads males than females had mastered complex problem-solving skills (Rock and Pollack, 1993). Longitudinal analysis of 1988 eignth graders 2 years later shows that there were no significant differences among males and females with respect to overall gains from 1988 to 1990 in mathematics, nor were there differences in the proficiency levels at which gains were found (Scott, Rock, Pollack and Ingels, 1994; however, for some qualifications to this generalization see . The close similarity of male an. female results for NELS:88 sophomores is consistent with the results for NELS:88 eighth graders 2 years before, which showed no difference in math performance between boys and girls (Rock, Pollack and Hairier, 1991; for some additional perspectives on the base year mathematics results by gender, see Snow and Ennis, 1994). Given that there is more opportunity for differential course taking in eleventh and twelfth grades, it will be of interest to see whether boys will take more advanced math and whether male-female differences in math achievement will appear by senior yearas HS&B and NAEP data suggest has historically been the case. Math coursework Achievement in mathematics is associated with enrollment in more advanced courses. Over half (55 percent) of those who have taken only low-level math courses score in the lowest test quartile; just under 3 percent of this group scored in the highest math test quartile. On the other hand, over half (56 percent) of the advanced math group scored in the highest math quartile, with only 8 percent of the advanced math group scoring in the lowest math test quartile.\nThere are significant male-female differences across all three levels. In particular, males are more likely to fall into the low foreign language coursework group in ninth and tenth grade (44 percent of males and 34 percent of females fall into this category), while females are more likely to have taken a full 2 years of foreign language over this period (34 percent of males versus 41 percent of females).\nAdvanced Math Sequence. Males and females are equally likely to have completed advanced level math coursework.\nAs in the NELS:88 base year, gender differences in mathematics achievement were comparatively small.

In mathematics, as noted earlier in this report, there have been major recent initiatives by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) (1989,1991) designed to identify and encourage desirable changes in instructional practices for school mathematics. The NCTM standards (1989,1991) emphasize problem solving as well as learning to reason and communicate mathematically. They are designed to encourage teachers to help students actively assimilate mathematical knowledge and experiences and construct their own meanings. A major goal of the recommended mathematics curriculum is to establish vividly for all students the connections between school mathematics and real-world applications of the discipline and to instill the power of mathematical reasoning and communication in all learners. In terms of instructional practices in high school mathematics, the standards imply decreased attention to some kinds of practices and increased attention to others\", as summarized below. To be sure, if these emphases and practices were already widespread, there would be little point to encouraging them as reforms. However, it is of interest to establish a baseline that measures the degree to which these recommended changes in instructional emphasis depart from reality in the contemporary classroom, particularly since it seems likely the standards indeed will be implemented on a wide scale.' And it will be of further interest to measure progress toward these new standards over coming years, as well as their effect on the mathematics achievement of American students. Table 1.4 depicts the reported frequency of selected practices and uses of resources in the mathematics classrooms of America's 1990 sophomores. 20By 1992, 42 states had incorporated the standards into their curriculum guidelines for school districts and schools (CCSSO, 1992). The g?..neral picture reported by sophomores is that current practices are very far from those recommended by NCTM. This generalization holds true whether we look at classroom activities or resources. Activities. While the new mathematics instructional standards emphasize problem solving and reallife contextualization of math problems, only 30 percent of sophomores engage in problem-solving activities \"often\" --though more than 80 percent do so at least sometimes. While the new standards emphasize student discussion and oral explanation, substantial numbers of students report no exposure to such activities in their classrooms (approximately 41 percent report they never participate in student-led discussions in math class, while 39 percent of sophomores report that they never explain their work to the class orally). Resources. NELS:88 data suggest that American high schools have a good way to go before approaching or meeting the standards for access to and use of mathematical resources. While the NCTM standards recommend the use of books other than math text books, seventy percent of American sopho- 16 "}, {"section_title": "36", "text": "A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 mores report that they never use books other than texts.

Nevertheless, just over a third report that they use calculators in class frequently, while another 38 percent use calculators sometimes, with the result that nearly 72 percent of the nation's sophomores reportedly do make at least some use of calculators in their mathematics classrooms. Because the learning experiences (and opportunities) of the nation's sophomores can differ significantly by school or classroom, it is of interest to investigate whether differences are equitably distributed. Equitable distribution of experiences and opportunities is investigated in the next section."}, {"section_title": "Are there group differences in exposure to particular classroom practices?", "text": "In corning years it will be important to monitor the degree to which the new math standards are becoming widespread. But it will be no less important to determine just who is being exposed to the recommended instructional methods and curriculum, in order to ensure that all groups in American society benefit equally. Given that the standards had had little time to have an impact at the time of the NELS:88 first follow-up, 1990 data provide an excellent baseline for future investigation of this question. We have therefore selected four measures reflecting student reports of activities recommended in the NCTM standards--use in the math classroom of books other than math texts, use of hands-on material, frequency of being asked to explain math work to the class orally, and use of calculators--to compare the experience of different racial, gender, and SES groups, as well as to compare the experience of sophomores in public and various kinds of private schools. Student reports suggest that the first two of these activities using a text other than a math text in the math classroom, and using hands-on material in math --were not widespread in 1990 high schools. The latter two activities, however --explaining one's work orally to the math class, and use of calculators in math class --appear to have been applied more widely. Use Books Other than Math Text (Table 1. 5). There are few notable differences among groups on this item (See Table 1.5.) Overall, only 11 percent of sophomores often use books other than a math text for their math course. Whites are significantly less likely to use a nonmath book often than are blacks or Hispanics (10 percent for whites, 15 percent both for blacks and Hispanics), and public school students are more likely to often use another book than are Catholic school students (11 percent versus 7 percent). Students in the lowest SES quartile are twice as likely as students in the highest SES quartile to often use books other than a math text (16 percent versus 8 percent). Use Hands-On Material (Table 1.6). Use of hands-on material is not widespread (69 percent report never using hands-on material and only 6 percent often do) nor are there striking differences 21The NELS:88 1990 student questionnaire did not distinguish between conventional calculators (which perform arithmetic functions), and graphing calculators; the latter perform many of the same functions as the microcomputer in that they produce graphical displays of mathematical relationships. The graphing calculator may therefore also pfrform some of the same pedagogic functions in math as the computer. Insofar as this is true, a strong contrast need not necessarily be drawn between calculators and computers, though it becomes increasingly important to inquire into what kind of calculators are being used in math classrooms. For more information on the technology and pedagogy of the graphical representation of quantitative relationships, see Romberg, Fennema and Carpenter, eds., 1993. 3 17 between groups. Whites (71 percent) are more likely to report never using hands-on material than are Hispanics (66 percent) and blacks (62 percent). None of the differences between school control types are statistically significant, nor are gender differences significant. However, sophomores in the lowest SES quartile are a bit more likely to use hands-on material often than are students in the highest SES quartile (7.5 percent versus 4.4 percent).

In terms of race/ethnicity, whites are significantly less likely to be asked often to explain work orally in class than blacks (23 percent of whites report being often asked to explain their math work orally, as compared to 34 percett of blacks. Asians also are significantly less likely than blacks to often be asked to explain their math work in class. When viewed by school control, there are several significant differences in the \"never\" category. Public school sophomores are more likely than independent school sophomores to never be asked to explain their work orally (40 percent versus 19 percent. Tenth graders in other private schools are also more likely than independent school tenth graders to never be asked to explain their math work orally (39 percent versus 19 percent. While the differences among SES groups in the \"often\" category are not significant, lowest SES quartile students are significantly more likely to never be asked to explain work orally than are highest SES quartile students (43 percent versus 34 percent, or to be asked only sometimes (for highest quartile, 42 percent are sometimes asked, for the lowest quartile, 33 percent). A slightly greater proportion of females than males falls into the \"often\" category for this item (25 percent of females are often asked to explain math work to the class orally, versus 23 percent of males.

Use Calculators in Math Class gable 1.8). Some notable group differences are apparent for use of calculators; these differences raise equity issues. Although differences between whites and Asians are not significant, whites are more likely than Hispanic, black, or American Indian sophomores to use calculators in math class often (38 percent for whites, 30 percent for Hispanics, 23 percent for blacks, and 21 percent for American Indians). Asians are also significantly more likely than blacks to use calculators often in their tenth-grade math classrooms--35 percent of Asians use calculators often in math, as contrasted to 23 percent of blacks. NAIS sophomores are more likely than public school sophomores to use calculators in math class often (58 percent for NAIS, 35 percent for public). There are also SES differences in calculator use. Over 40 percent of highest SES quartile students use calculators in math class often, compared to 30 percent of those in the lowest SES quartile. Some 23 percent of highest SES quartile tenth graders never use calculators in math class, while 33 percent of lowest quartile students never do. While more males than females \"sometimes\" use calculators in class, gender differences for the \"never\" and \"often\" categories are not statistically significant. Of the four recommended classroom practices examined here, only \"explain your work orally\" and \"use calculators\" receive rankings of \"sometimes\" or \"often\" by half or more of 1990 sophomores. For both the practices that are widespread, high-SES students enjoy some advantage over low-SES students. High-SES tenth graders also are somewhat less likely than low-SES tenth graders to fall into the \"never asked\" category in terms of oral explanation in math class. Differences favoring high-SES sophomores are not apparent for the two practices that are less widespread--use of hands-on material and non-math texts in the mathematics cla. sroom.

While memorizing math facts and procedures is important, the standards suggest that at present memorization may be overemphasized relative to such other important goals as problem solving.

Interestingly, students seemingly perceive both memorization of facts and procedures and problem solving as comparatively strongly emphasized aspects of their instructional programs. Over half of sophomores agreed that these two objectives received major emphases; only around 17 percent felt that these two objectives received no or minor emphasis. Students' perceptions that mathematical problem 22Teacher reports on what is emphasized in the classroom may differ from student reports because teachers have a more sophisticated understanding of their classroom goals, because of social desirability biases on what teachers feel they should be teaching, or for any of a number of other reasons. In the NELS:88 teacher questionnaire, mathematics teachers were asked how they use various teaching methods and how much emphasis they give various objectives.

In the section that follows--which examines mathematics achievement--we will return to some of the factors discussed in this section, as emphasis on factual and procedural memorization, emphasis on problem solving, reviewing the work from the previous day--to see whether differences in mathematics achievement are associated with these practices and emphases."}, {"section_title": "TESTED ACHWVEMENT", "text": "The third area of interest that we identified for investigation was the relationship between tested mathematics achievement and selected student background, curricular an instructional factors. These relationships are depicted in the two tables (Tables 1.10 and 1.11) below. Curricular and instructional factors, as we have noted, are alterable, and change in curriculum and instruction has been an imperative of the recent school reform movement. The reader is cautioned that an association between some such factor and achievement does not establish a cause-and-effect relationship, though it may suggest topics for further investigation, using more sophisticated analytic techniques that take account of the many interacting factors that may influence test results. Background characteristics are important to examine too, both for a better understanding of group differences in achievement and because equity considerations argue for efforts to overcome achievement gaps between groups. While the trend is toward some narrowing of group differences, historically, black and Hispanic students have been less well served by the education system in terms of mathematics learning than have white and Asian students. Important disparities between males and females in mathematics achievement have been observed late in high school and thereafter. The first table-- Table 1.10--presents tested mathematics achievement in terms of mastery or proficiency levels. The second table (Table 1.11) presents mathematics achievement in terms of the mathematics test quartile, which arrays scores from highest to lowest in four equal gradations. NELS:88 test scores can be reported in various forms, each of which may be useful for a different purpose. Because proficiency scores are available only for mathematics and reading, most tables in this report present test quartiles. Nevertheless, because proficiency scores give additional information-they represent a specifiable level of mastery of mathematics materials--we briefly summarize results (in Table 1.10 below) by proficiency level, before examining (in Table 1.11) in more detail mathematics achievement on a quartile basis. Proficiency score reports assume that skills in mathematics follow a building-block pattern. That is, the skills required to master the basic level are assumed to be necessary to achieve proficiency at the next higher level, and so on until the highest level is reached. The four mastery levels of mathematics proficiency may be defined as follows. \"See, for example, Mullis, Owen, and Phillips, 1990.

Although instructional emphasis on facts and rules and instructional emphasis on problem solving are sometimes viewed as alternative rather than complementary strategies, mathematics test results show similar patterns for both emphases. That basic pattern is that for either factual or problem solving emphases, students were more likely to score in the highest quartile if they perceived the objective as a major emphasis of the teacher. Tabular analyses cannot by themselves explain such a pattern; nor did the NELS:88 questionnaire require students to rank one instructional emphasis relative to another. Perhaps this pattern of relationship reflects the simple fact that students who are sensitively attuned to what the teacher is stressing--regardless of what the teacher's emphasis might be--are more likely to be good learners than those who are less aware of what is being emphasized in the classroom. Or, possibly, high-achieving students are more likely to recognize the importance of learning both facts/procedures, and problem-solving strategies. A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 Learning Practices: Review Sophomores who often reviewed their work from the previous day were least likely to fall into the lowest quartile and most likely to fall into the highest quartile in mathematics achievement. Students who never reviewed their work were most likely to fall into the lowest quartile and least likely to score in the highest quartile in mathematics achievement. More specifically, as shown in Table 1.11, 31 percent of the sophomores who often reviewed their math work from the previous day scored in the highest math achievement quartile, with just 16 percent falling into the lowest. In contrast 18 percent of sophomores who never review their work from the previous day scored in the highest quartile, while fully a third (33.3 percent) scored in the lowest quartile. Readers are reminded that this report is a descriptive summary, intended to report national estimates of 1990 sophomores, categorized by their background characteristics, in relation to their educational experience and achievement. Although the NELS:88 dataset provides a basis for rich, interpretive multivariate analyses, such analyses are beyond the scope of this report. It is also useful to remember that most of the descriptive contrasts that we have drawn have examined an educational outcome or process in terms of only one other variable at a time. For example, we examined tested mathematics achievement in relation to the type of school that a sophomore attended. Since many variables are related to achievement, a somewhat different picture emerges as more variables are simultaneously taken into account. This can be illustrated by returning to our findings on the relationship between math quartile and school control type of 1990 sophomores, and introducing an additional factor, socioeconomic status. For simplicity's sake, we shall confine our attention to sophomores from the highest SES quartile who score in the highest math test quartile by the kind of school they attended in 1990. Overall, around a quarter of public school students score in the top math quartile while 71 percent of NAIS students do so. In Table 1 However, when we consider the performance only of students in the highest SES quartile, the contrast by school is as follows: u Before controlling for SES, a comparison of public school students in the higl.rst math quartile to Catholic and NAIS school students in the highest math quartile revealed significant differences among the groups, whereas the percentages of public school students scoring in the highest math quartile were found to not differ significantly from the percentages of \"other private\" school students scoring in the highest test quartile."}, {"section_title": "34", "text": ";i 1 There is no significant difference, when high-SES students are compared, in the likelihood of scoring in the top math test quarti;e, between public school sophomores, and sophomores either in Catholic schools or other private schools.' (To many it may seem that the yet more interesting issuewhich we do not attempt to address here--is whether low-SES [or minority] students do better in Catholic [or non-Catholic private] than in public schools)\" However, the large performance difference between public school sophomores and the 1 percent of sophomores in independent (NAIS) schools, though reduced, does indeed persist, and remains statistically significant. This result is unsurprising in that while NAIS students disproportionately fall into 26Readers of the base year descriptive summary of eighth graders ) may recall an additional illustration of this point. In examining mathematics and reading proficiency scores by race, controlling for SES deflated majority versus minority (black, Hispanic, American Indian) differences by 25 to 30 percent (p.31). While this may suggest that achievement viewed by racial/edmic categories alone may present a misleadingly stark contrast, it is perhaps the more disturbing to see how racial differences in tested achievement persist, even after socioeconomic status has been taken into account. A further illustration from the NELS:88 data of the effect of controlling for SES while examining race/ethnicity differences comes from eighth to tenth grade dropout rates. The overall cohort dropout rate for whites is (4.9 percent) compared to the 1988-1990 dropout rate for blacks (10.0 percent) and Hispanics (9.3 percent). Nonetheless, within the lowest SES quartile, the cohort dropout rate for whites is 16.8 percent (compared to 11.5 percent for blacks and 14.4 percent for Hispanics). Differences between the three groups proved statistically nonsignificant within the lowest SES quartile, where the dropout population is clustered (see Owings and Peng, 1992;. HS&B data show blackwhite dropout rate differences reversing themselves and whits-Hispanic differences greatly reduced when family background is taken into account (Barro and Kolstad, 1987). Likewise, low-ability whites, HS&B data suggest, are more likely to drop out than low-ability blacks and Hispanics: whites have higher dropout rates than blacks and Hispanics within the lowest HS&B test quartile (Griffith, Prase and Ralph, 1989). 27A conclusion drawn by some analysts of the HS&B data was that privateand in particular, Catholicschools, though disproportionately white and high-SES in student composition, ',ere conducive to higher average achievement for minority and disadvantaged students (Coleman, Hoffer, and Kilgore, 1982;Loleman and Hoffer, 1987). This more equitable distribution of achievement is sometimes attributed to a \"common school effect\"; Sebring and Camburt (1991) report evidence of this effect in the math and reading performance of low -SES and miority (that is, black and Hispanic) Catholic school eighth graders in their NELS:88 base year analyses. Similar findings of a diminished achievement gap (contrasting Catholic schools to public) were found in NAEP math and science results analyzed by Lee and Stewart (1989). Even when sophisticated controls for student background characteristics are introduced, however, it remains difficult to establish conclusively, within a non-experimental design, that such differences represent school effects, as contra/nixd to self-selection effects--examination of this extremely interesting question is beyond the scope and analytic apparatus of this report. A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 the highest socioeconomic quartile, NELS:88 base year and first follow-up analyses suggest that the curriculum of this particular category of private school is unusually rigorous.' Mathematics is but Ile of four subjects on the NELS:88 test battery. We will therefore proceed to examine the topic of learning and achievement in relation to science. Thereafter, we will similarly explore sophomore achievement in social studies and reading. However, before approaching these three additional NELS:88 test subjects, we shall briefly examine reported course taking in foreign languages. 2'For example, in the base year, eighth graders in NAIS schools reported doing twice as much homework as did students in public schools (5.4 hours of homework per week for public school eighth graders, compare d to 10.7 hours for NAIS eighth graders [Hafner, Inge ls, Schneider and Stevenson, 1990, Fig. 3.2, p.511). This report suggests that 1990 sophomores in NAIS schools were far more likely to have completed an advanced maul sequence than sophomores in any other school type (63 percent for NAIS sophomores, versus 23 percent for both public and Catholic school sophomores, and 32 percent for sophomores in other private schools.) This chapter examines four subject areas--course-taking in foreign language; course-taking and instruction in science; and course-taking in social studies and in english. If educational achievement is to be regarded as the chief of the many possible goals of education, two questions assume critical importance. One is how to maximize achievement, and the other is how to achieve equity in its distribution. Policies that attempt to maximize achievement for all depend on educational factors that are manipulable, that is, that can be altered. A number of instructional and subject-matter variables (including opportunity to learn, that is, exposure to new knowledge; quality of instruction; and hours of homework) are alterable factors that may mediate the effects of background. Two potentially alterable factors that influence achievement will be examined in this chapter. These two factors are patterns of high school course enrollment, and instruction. Instructional techniques can in principle be manipulated to improve educational results. Likewise course enrollment is, within important limits, an alterable factor. Indeed, there is ample evidence that enrollment patterns (and program placement) have changed over recent decades, with declines in rigorous academic coursework in the 1970s followed by more recent gains. For example, HS&B and NELS:88 transcript data (Condition of Education, 1994, pp. 76-79) show that 48.4 percent of 1982 seniors had taken geometry, compared to 70.4 percent of 1992 seniors. Some 31.6 percent of 1982 graduates had taken chemistry, compared to 55.5 percent of 1992 graduates. In addition, the percentage of collegebound high school graduates taking at least 2 years of a foreign language in high school increased 18 percentage points between 1982 and 1992, from 55 to 73 percent. Learning depends on having the opportunity to be exposed to new knowledge as well as on aptitude and the willingness to expend effort. Enrollment in particular courses or course sequences provides the basic opportunity to learn specific content and skills. Course enrollment is influenced both by policy (for example, graduation or program completion requirements) and by student choice. High school students have a role in selecting their courses. Their course choices may be influenced by their perceptions of their ability, by their aspirations, and by the perceived benefit of completing a given course. Hence course-taking is alterable in the sense that more students can be encouraged to take key courses such as foreign language, students can be given more information about the consequences of their course selections, or required (by state, district, or school regulations) to take more years of English, or more rigorous course sequences in science, and so on. Students whose social milieu and family background include disproportionately few college graduates may, in particular, have less access to the information about postsecondary academic requirements that would enable them to perform an accurate cost-benefit analysis of their curricular options (see, for example, Kilgore & Pendleton, 1993, p. 72). While curricular choices are important, and can be influenced by better guidance or revised program or graduation requirements, it must be recognized that such choices are also constrained. Opportunities to learn depend on a complex ensemble of factors that both influence curricular choice and affect its meaning. In particular, the cumulative effect of past inequalities of opportunity to learn may, by sophomore year, be considerable. This is because prior achievement or prerequisite knowledge severely limits curricular choices available to high school students. Students have unequal opportunities to learn -the amount, and even more, the kind and quality of instruction received by students -is highly variable. Research has demonstrated that course offerings A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 vary across schools, that differences exist in the amount of material covered in courses in different \"tracks\", and that differences exist in the amount of instruction provided to students within the same classroom but in different ability groups (Dreeben & Gamoran, 19E6;Dreeben & Barr, 1988). In various ways, track or program assignment may influence the courses students select. Expectations, too, reflect past experience and influence present curricular choices. Grades and earlier performance affect not only the expectations of the student and the student's family but also the expectations of peers and teachers. Course-taking may be influenced as well by sociodemographic composition and organizational characteristics of the school.' Even granting these qualifications, course-taking remains a principal potentially factor in learning. Course-taking can be influenced by policy. Policies may require more stringent course sequences. If many students with high postsecondary aspirations do not take optimal preparatory course sequences, policies that encourage dissemination of information to students and their families about the importance of certain courses to later outcomes may prove efficacious. Educational policies may also attempt to address school-level differences in the quantity and quality of course offerings and in students' prior preparation."}, {"section_title": ".1 FOREIGN LANGUAGE", "text": "Earlier, we cited work based on High School and Beyond (HS&B) data that indicated foreign language may act as a \"gatekeeper\" course, associated with a significantly greater likelihood of college attendance. Pelavin and Kane (1990) report that 86 percent of 1982 high school graduates with two years of foreign language attended college. Further, they found that foreign language-taking was related to a reduced gap in likelihood of college entry for black and poor students when compared to white students or students from more prosperous families, though foreign language enrollment did not significantly reduce the college attendance gap between Hispanic and white students. The NELS:88 cognitive ten battery supplies no information about achievement levels in foreign languages. Nonetheless, NELS:88 provides student reports of foreign language coursework completed in eighth, ninth and tenth grades. Data from the NELS:88 base year indicate that less than a quarter of the nation's spring 1988 eighth graders reported that they were enrolled in a foreign language, with over half of students in the northeast enrolled but less than a fifth in the other three regions of the nation, and with over twice as many highest SES quartile eighth graders (36 percent) enrolled in foreign language as lowest SES quartile (16 percent)  ). High school typically offers more opportunity for foreign language enrollment than does eighth grade, and high school foreign language course enrollments increased over the course of the 1980s.2 Apparently, 70.4 percent of 1990 graduates had completed at least one year of foreign language in high 'Kilgore and Pendleton (1993) describe the ways that the organizational context of schooling affects opportunity to learn. In addition, they use HS&B data to examine how high school organizational context influences enrollment in academic (algebra, geometry, and more advanced) mathematics. See also Garet and De Laney (1988). The mean number of credits in foreign language (or Carnegie Units, that is, completion of a course that meets one period a day for one academic year) for HS&B graduating seniors in 1982 was 1.05, whereas the mean number of credits for NAEP 1990 graduates was 1.62 (see Legum et al., 1993); the standard error for the estimate of 1.62 in 1990 is 0.04, and the standard error for the estimate of 1.05 in 1982 is 0.03. school, compared to 48. 8 percent of 19828 percent of graduates (Legum et al., 1993.3 Table 2.1 below indicates that around 60 percent of 1990 sophomores completed at least a year of foreign language study in ninth or tenth grade. It is important to know not only how much foreign language is being taken but also who is taking foreign language courses, since the answer to this question has possible implications for instructional equity in high school as well as postsecondary educational access. For this reason, the background characteristics of sophomores in relation to their foreign language course enrollment are also depicted below. More specifically, Table 2.1 below shows amount of coursework taken for different racial/ethnic, school control, socioeconomic status, and gender groups, as well as for students with different levels of postsecondary expectations.   Table 2.1 shows that there are many striking differences in the pattern of foreign language coursework when background characteristics are compared."}, {"section_title": "Race/ethnicity", "text": "If we focus in particular on those sophomores who have taken the most foreign language (that is, have been continuously enrolled through ninth and tenth grade), there are significant differences between whites and all other racial/ethnic groups.

Lowest quartile SES sophomores are almost three times more likely to fall into the group having either no or no more than one semester of foreign language in ninth or tenth grade than highest quartile SES sophomores. (The highest SES group is almost three times as likely to have taken a full 2 years of foreign language in ninth and tenth grade as is the lowest SES group (58 percent versus 17 percent).\n"}, {"section_title": "61", "text": "Finally, postsecondary expectations are related to foreign language course-taking. Sophomores who expect to complete a college education were over four times as likely to have completed two years of foreign language than were sophomores with no college expectations (50 percent versus 11 percent). Fully two thirds of sophomores who do not expect to go on to college have taken no foreign language or only a semester; about half of those who expect to graduate from college have taken two or more years of foreign language, and over a quarter of those who expect to attend but not graduate from college have taken two years of foreign language durint, ninth and tenth grade. If enrollment in foreign language courses continues, in the 1990s, to be as important a predictor of who goes to college as was the case in the 1980s, the fact that half of those who expect to graduate from college had not completed a two-year foreign language sequence as sophomores may be reason for concern. Examination of NELS :88 1992 data for seniors will reveal how much additional foreign language coursework was completed in the remaining two years of high school, and the characteristics of those who chose further language study. Figure 2.1 depicts the percentage of sophomores who expect to graduate from college or obtain advanced degrees, viewed by whether they have or have not completed two years of foreign language since leaving eighth grade. It extends this comparison to those who have completed an advanced math sequence or a year of geometry as well, matters that were discussed in the previous chapter. "}, {"section_title": "SCIENCE", "text": "Along with mathematics, science learning is seen as essential to technological progress and global competitiveness, and as in the case of mathematics, American students have fared poorly in a number of comparisons with students elsewhere (Lapointe, Mead & Phillips, 1989). Ironically, although American students are thought to lag behind those of many other countries in their science achievement, the NELS:88 base year to first follow-up results show that a good deal of science learning takes place between eighth and tenth grade; indeed, not only was the size of gains in science substantial, but of the four tested content areas in NELS:88, the area in which students gained most was in science (Scott, Rock, Pollack, & Inge ls, 1994). Moreover, males made greater gains than females between eighth grade and tenth, students in the highest SES quartile gained significantly more than did students from the lowest SES quartile, with greater gains associated also with doing more than two hours of science homework per week and with course-taking sequences that involved biology or biology plus physics and chemistry (Scott, Rock, Pollack & Inge ls, 1994). Data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) indicate that for ages 13 and 17the ages just above and just below the modalage of 1990's sophomores --national performance in science declined in the 1970s but improved in the 1980s. Nevertheless, for 17 year olds, science achievement was lower in 1990 than in 1969 (Mullis, Dossey, Foertsch, Jones & Gentile, 1991). Just as mathematics education has been the object of many recent reform efforts, so too has science education. While nothing equivalent to the NCTM's mathematics standards has been created for high school science, prototype science standards for curriculum, teaching, and assessment are being developed by the National Academy of Science at this time. Such standards would in many ways parallel, and be coordinated with, the mathematics standards developed by the NCTM. The standards are expected to emphasize an inquiry-based approach to science and opportunities to practice science skills outside the formal school classroom. The new science standards will be animated by four broad learning goals: (1) to convey understanding of a limited number of basic concepts, laws, principles, and theories of science; (2) to teach students how to employ the chief modes of scientific reasoning and inquiry; (3) to inculcate an understanding of the scientific enterprise; and (4) to convey a sense of the history of scientific development and its relationship to technology, culture, and the historical and social context (National Academy of Science; 1992). Educational reform has also had the effect of stiffening graduation requirements in science. Transcripts data show that graduating seniors in 1990 had taken significantly more science than the HS&B seniors who graduated in 1982. The mean number of credits for 1990 graduates translates into 2.8 years of science, compared to 2.2 years for HS&B's 1982 seniors.' In addition to increased overall enrollment, enrollment in more rigorous science courses has increased also. For example, when the percentage of graduates with at least a year of credit each in biology and chemistry is compared, 48.2 percent of 1990 graduates had earned credit of a year each in biology and chemistry, compared to 28.0 percent for 1982 graduates.' 'These data are taken from Legum et al., 1993;  We will examine the school experience and science achievement of sophomores in the 1989-90 school year by exploring two facets of this topic: the science courses that sophomores have taken since eighth grade; as reported by students, the instructional practices, objectives and emphases of the science classroom; A tabular summary of tested achievement in science in relation to st dent background factors and curricular and instructional factors is provided in Appendix D."}, {"section_title": "Science Course-taking", "text": "NELS:88 results for eighth graders in the spring of 1988 showed that overwhelmingly eighth graders were enrolled in science (96 percent reported being enrolled in a science course) though, at eighth-grade level, science tends not to be differentiated into an array of biological and physical science courses. While 4 percent were not enrolled in science, 21.5 were enrolled in a laboratory science course, and 74.2 percent in a science course without laboratory (Hafner, Inge ls, Schneider & Stevenson, 1990, Table 2.5). There was a marked disparity in likelihood of being enrolled in a laboratory science by family background: 28 percent of those in the highest SES quartile were enrolled in laboratory science compared to 17 percent of those in the lowest quartile , Table 1.1). Within public schools, high-SES students were more than twice as likely as low-SES students to report conducting daily science experiments (19 percent versus 9 percent); over half (50.5 percent) of lowest SES quartile public school eighth graders were in classes where science experiments were conducted about once a month or less, with 27.8 percent of highest SES quartile eighth graders in classes conducting experiments in the once a month or less range. Overall, 41 percent of public school students were minimally (that is, no more than once a month) exposed to scientific experimentation  in their eighth grade science classes. NELS:88 results for sophomores in the spring of 1990 show that most tenth graders are enrolled in science, (see Table 2.2) and that the science curriculum has become more diverse for high school students. Biology, chemistry and physics are the science courses most typically taken by the collegebound. Nevertheless, at this early juncture in high school--sophomore year--it is far more common for sophomores to have taken either biological sciences, or such less cognitively demanding courses (which in many cases do not include laboratory work) as general science, physical science, earth science, or principles of technology, than advanced physical sciences such as chemistry or physics among NELS:88 sophomores. Just 3 percent of sophomores have taken a year of physics; less than 15 percent of sophomores have taken chemistry. On the other hand, 77 percent have completed a year of biology, and substantial numbers of students have completed lower-level science courses such as general science or earth science (20 and 23 percent respective y have completed a year or more of these courses). A good deal of advanced coursework in science--particularly in courses such as physics and chemistry--will, of course, take place in the junior and senior years of high school. Reforms recommended for science education are broadly similar to those recommended in mathematics. Empasis on science as a process of discovery, with concepts to be mastered through inquiry rather than memorization, including discussion with teacher and peers, has been a hallmark of reform recommendations.' Improvement of textbooks; decreased reliance on textual materials and lecture; and greater emphasis on laboratory experimentation and oral and written reporting of experiments, reallife situations, group and project work, hands-on manipulation of science materials, and use of tools such as computers and calculators, all are important subthemes in the call for improved science education. To what degree do contemporary high school science classrooms reflect these emphases already? Sophomores report the frequencies shown in Table 2.3 for key instructional activities and use of instructional resources:' 6See, for example, the National Research Council's Fulfilling the Promise: Biology Education in the Nation's Schools (1990). 7Teachers of the 1990 sophomore cohort were also asked to report on their science teaching practices, including frequency of use of various teaching methods, emphasis given to various objectives, and frequency of activities such as use of computers for instruction, discussing career opportunities in science, and so on. While first follow-up teacher data have not been included in this report, base year teacher data on science instruction are analyzed and reported in  46 School Sophomore in 1990 These responses show a clear pattern of prevalence of conventional over recommended instructional methods, and for most students, of lack of intense involvement with key resources for science learning such as computers. For example, the relatively passive learning techniques of copying teacher notes from the blackboard are cited by 62 percent of students as every day or almost every day occurrences in their science classes. Although the desirability of lessened dependence on the lecture and recitation method of teaching has been stressed by science education reformers, three quarters of students indicated that every day or almost every day they listen to the teacher lecture. In terms of active, selfdirected, inquiry-based approaches to science learning, three quarters of 1990 sophomores indicate that they very rarely (a \"never\" response category was not offered; very rarely effectively means from never to less than once a month) make up their own problems and work out their own methods to investigate them. Likewise, 77 percent indicate that they very rarely design and conduct experiments or projects on their own, and 74 percent responded that they very rarely make up their own choice of science topic or problem to study. While lectures and blackboard notes are commonly utilized, more contemporary learning resources such as computers appear to be little utilized. Some 88 percent of 1990 sophomores indicate that very rarely do they use computers to write up experiments or reports; 91 percent indicate that they very rarely use computers for collecting and/or analyzing science data; 89 percent indicate that they very rarely use computers to do calculations, and 91 percent indicate that they very rarely use computers for modeling or simulation. In addition to looking at classroom practices and resources, however, another window into what is happening in science classes is provided by NELS :88 questionnaire items that ask sophomores to report their judgments on how much emphasis teachers place on various science objectives, such as increasing their interest in the subject, leart.Ing and memorization of science facts and procedures, thinking about problems and their solutions, and so on. The table below portrays student responses to this series of questionnaire items. A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 It is instructive to examine responses to these items in terms of the major emphases that are affirmed. In decreasing order of frequency of responding, around 35 percent of 1990 sophomores declared learning and memorizing science facts, rules, and steps to be a major emphasis in their science classes. At very similar levels, showing the importance of science in daily life (27 percent), preparing the student for further science study (26 percent), and thinking about the meaning of a problem and methods for solving it (26 percent) were seen as major emphases. Lagging behind was \"increasing your interest in science\" with 18 percent of sophomores reporting this as a major emphasis. From the point of view of curriculum reform in science education, these results show that the major planks of a reform orientationincreased attention to problem solving, demonstration of connections of science to everyday problems, increasing the student's interest in science--are seen as major emphases in their classrooms by only 18 to 27 percent of sophomores. However, typically 60 percent or more of sophomores say that these objectives receive moderate or heavy emphasis in their classrooms."}, {"section_title": "Tested Achievement", "text": "While test results are not discussed in this chapter, they are provided for interested readers in Appendix D of this report, which contains tables that show the tested science achievement of the nation's sophomores in the spring of 1990 in relation to a number of student characteristics and instructional factors.

The first follow-up student questionnaire gathered information about course taking in a variety of social studies subjects and inquired into students' perceptions of their social studies teachers' classroom practices as well. While all but 4 percent of eighth graders were enrolled in history or social studies in 1988 , Table 2.1) just over a quarter of 1990 sophomores report that they are not currently enrolled in a social studies course. Although diverse social studies courses are available, by sophomore year, only world history has been taken by half or more of American students. (See Table 2.5.) For students who remain in school, additional social studies courses will typically be taken in the last 2 years of high school. Since leaving eighth grade, however, just under a third had taken a year or more of U.S. history, while 71 percent had taken no high school geography, 74 percent had not taken civics or government, and 85 percent had not been enrolled in economics.

By sophomore year, the selection of certain high school classes can greatly influence postsecondary plans and future employment options. Yet it remains unclear how much initiative and responsibility tenth graders take in deciding what classes they enroll in, how they spend their time out of school, or whether they get a job. Citing major changes in the structure of the American family, some researchers have argued that many adolescents are making these critical decisions with limited guidance from parents or schools. This chapter examines how tenth graders and their families make choices about school classes, postsecondary education, and employment. Specific attention is given to parental regulation, that is, the limits families place on student time with friends, watching television or playing video games, and doing homework. Also of interest is the amount of time sophomores spend working at a job and the type of work they engage in."}, {"section_title": "FAMILY INTERACTION: DECISION MAKING ABOUT SCHOOLING AND WORK", "text": "Section 3.1 examines the scope, of student and family decision making on three topics: high school classes, college attendance, and after-school employment. Results suggest that many teenagers perceive that they make these decisions primarily by themselves rather than in consultation with their parents. Many others report joint decision making with their parents; few report that such decisions are made for them by their parents. However, the extent of teenage autonomy in decision making varies depending on family socioeconomic status."}, {"section_title": "Decisions on school classes:", "text": "NELS:88 sophomores were asked \"In your family, who makes most of the decisions on each of the following topics?\" The topics included \"What classes I take in school\" as well as \"Whether I should go to college.\" Students were given five response options: 1. My parent(s) decide themselves; 2. My parent(s) decide after discussing with me; 3. We decide together after discussing; 4. I decide after discussing it with my parent(s); and 5. I decide by myself. NELS:88 sophomores are more likely to decide on their own, than in consultation with their parent, the classes they will take in high school. (See Table 3.1.) While 43 percent of the sophomores report making this decision by themselves, 28 percent report making course decisions after consulting with their parents and 21 percent report making the decision jointly with their parents.   In another 6 percent of cases parents decide after consulting with their child; in only 2.5 percent of cases are parents reported to make this decision for their child without their offspring's consultation. The process of decision making regarding classes varies significantly by course and grade levels. Sophomores with lower grades and in lower level courses are more likely to report that they make class selections by themselves. For example, when math grades are considered, over 56 percent of tenth-grade students receiving mostly D's in mathematics report making decisions by themselves. This percentage is substantially higher than the 39 percent receiving mostly A's and the 42 percent receiving mostly B's who report making decisions on courses by themselves. A 'milar trend can be found for science grades: 37 percent of 1990 sophomores receiving mostly A's and ._ percent of sophomores receiving B's report making course decisions on their own, whereas 54 percent of sophomores receiving mostly D's report individual decision making on classes. it Similarly, sophomores in advanced math or science classes' are less likely than those in lower level courses to report making course decisions on their own. Fifty-two percent of the tenth graders in low-level math classes compared to 37 percent of the advanced math students report making the decision by themselves. This pattern also applies to different levels of science classes, with 52 percent of sophomores in lower-level classes reporting that they make decisions by themselves compared to 31 percent of the students in advanced classes. Family composition or structure appears to be related to the level of family involvement with sophomore course selections. (See Table 3.1.) Tenth graders in families with both natural parents are less likely to report making individual decisions on high school courses by themselves than students in less traditional families, with the exception of father-and-other-female and father-only families. Table 3.1 also shows that individual student decisions on classes vary by socioeconomic status. Sophomores at the lowest socioeconomic level are more likely than those in other groups to report making class decisions by themselves. Specifically, 56.2 percent of lowest SES quartile sophomores report making course-taking decisions entirely by themselves, as contrasted to 28.2 percent in the highest SES quartile. The opposite trend occurs in the consulting categories; 36 percent of the students in highest SES quartile families report making course selections after discussion with parents, while 18 percent of the students in the lowest SES group report the same decision process. Stated a little differently, the majority (56.2 percent) of lowest SES quartile sophomores report making course selection decisions entirely on their own, while the majority of highest SES quartile sophomores (63.3 percent) report making such decisionr, either together with their parents (27.4 percent) or after consultation with their parents (35.9 percent). With respect to race and ethnicity, family decision patterns in white families differ from those in Hispanic and black families. White tenth graders report lower levels of individual decision making on classes (41 percent) than Hispanics (50 percent) and blacks (50 percent). Differences among these percentages can be accounted for in the \"student decides after discussion with parents\" category, where 22 percent of the Hispanics and 21 percent of black tenth graders report this form of decision making occurs, as compared to 30 percent of white students."}, {"section_title": "Decisions on whether to go to college", "text": "Findings dealing with the decision of whether or not to go to college display a similar pattern to class selection decisions. Given the substantial costs and potential economic benefits that can accrue to the individual who pursues a postsecondary education, it is somewhat surprising that more tenth-grade students do not report making this decision with their parents. The consultative categories look very much the same as for course selections, with 28 percent of 1990 tenth graders reporting that they and their parents make this decision together; 20 percent report making the decision after consultation with parents. The advanced math group comprises all sophomores who reported having taken at least one year of coursework in any (or any combination) of the following: algebra II, trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus. The middle group comprises those sophomores who did not qualify for the advanced group but reported taking one year or more of algebra I or geometry. The low-level math group consists of all remaining students. (These students had taken no math, or math courses such as general math, business math, and prealgebra, or 1. ss than a year of algebra or geometry). Advanced science was created by including individuals with a year or more of chemistry and physics. The middle science group comprises sophomores who did cot qualify for the advanced group but reported taking one year or more from the following classes: biology, physical science, general science, earth science, or other science. The low science group is a residual category containing All other sophomores (including those who were enrolled in principles of technology). Again, the largest category is \"making the decision by myself,\" with 39 percent of sophomores reporting that they will make this decision by themselves (student decides vs. student discusses. (See Table 3.2,.). Student reports of decision making vary by math and science grades. Sophomores with low grades in math and science are more likely than sophomores with higher grades to report making decisions by themselves about whether to attend college. In particular, 37 percent of the mostly A's math students and 37 percent of the mostly B's math students report individual student decisions on college attendance while 49 percent of the mostly D's math students do so. This same relationship can be seen for science grades. Only 35 percent of the mostly 1..'s science students and 37 percent of the mostly B's students report individual student decisions on college attendance, while 49 percent of the mostly D's students report the same. Results according to family background characteristics show less autonomous sophomore decision making regarding college-going with better educated or higher SES parents. With respect to parent education, 45 percent of sophomores whose parents did not receive a high school diploma report making the decision to attend college by themselves, while only 30 percent of those with one or more parents educated to the doctoral level do so. Some 44 percent of lowest SES quartile sophomores report that they decide by themselves whether to attend college, contrasted to 32 percent of highest SES quartile sophomores who make this claim. The decision-making process also varies by parent education expectations. Tenth graders who perceive their parents as having high expectations that they will finish higher levels of school report more interaction with parents on decisions concerning college attendance. For instance, the difference in percentages of students making decision alone is greatest between tenth graders in families where the expectation is to not graduate from high school (62 percent) and to receive some college (33 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Preparing for college: Discussion of college examinations", "text": "One important component of postsecondary attendance is fulfilling the necessary prerequisites to apply to the school of choice. Sophomores were asked how often they discuss with their parents taking college entrance examinations, that is, the American College Test (ACT) and Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). As shown in Table 3.3, a small percentage of tenth graders report discussing the ACT or SAT tests with their parents. Nine percent of 1990 sophomores report discussing these tests \"often\" with their parents, whereas 53 percent of sophomores report \"never\" having discussed these tests. 14) 9.) 55   Discussion of the ACT and SAT varies by racial and ethnic group. Blacks are more likely than other groups to discuss these tests with their parents. Significantly lower percentages of black 1990 sophomores (43 percent) report they never discuss the ACT or SAT with their parents than do Hispanic (57 percent) or white (55 percent) students. Family composition or structure also is related to discussions of the SAT and ACT. Sophomores in families headed by a father and other female guardian report the highest percentage (67 percent) of never talking about these tests. Significantly fewer tenth graders from traditional families, than other family compositions, report that they never discuss these tests with their parents. Table 3.3 shows that 1990 sophomores in families with lower socioeconomic status report lower levels of discussion about these tests, with 63 percent reporting they never discussed them. This percentage is much higher than for high-SES sophomores, of whom only 40 percent report never discussing the ACT or SAT. Parent educational attainment is strongly associated with discussion of the ACT and SAT. Tenth graders with parents not graduating from high school report never discussing the tests at a rate of 64 percent, which is higher than for students with parents who received a Ph.D. (30 percent). As expected, parent educational expectations are associated with the frequency of test discussions. The further in school the parent expects the tenth grader to go, the greater the number of times the family discusses these tests. Whereas only 37 percent of sophomores with parents expecting them to attain a master's degree or a doctorate reps rt never discussing the ACT/SAT tests, 77 percent of sophomores A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 whose parents expect them only to graduate from high school never discuss the tests. The differences between percentages of discussion vary greatly between those who plan to graduate from high school and those who expect to complete some college or graduate from college. As Table 3.3 shows, the percentages of tenth-grade students reporting they never discuss the ACT/SAT tests declines dramatically as parental expectation increases from high school graduate (77 percent), to some college (62 percent), to college graduate (49 percent). Finally, both math and science grades are positively associated with discussion of the ACT and SAT tests. Higher math and science grades are associated with more frequent parent test discussion. Sixty-seven pe cent of the mostly D's math students and 72 percent of the mostly D's science students report they never discuss preparation for these tests, compared to 46 percent of the mostly A's math students and 44 percent of the mostly A's science students."}, {"section_title": "Decisions on student employment", "text": "Sophomore decision making on employment is similar to college attendance and classes the largest proportion of students is in the \"I make the decision by myself\" category. (See Figure 3.1.) Concerning who makes the decisions on whether or not a tenth grader will have a job, 38 percent of the students indicate that they make the decision by themselves, 24 percent make the decision after discussion with parents, and 25 percent make the decision together with parents. Adolescent decision making on employment varies by socioeconomic status similarly to the decision-making experiences found for class selections. As shown in Table 3.4, as socioeconomic status increases, individual student decision-making decreases. Of the 1990 sophomores in the low-SES category, 44 percent report individual decision making on whether or not to seek employment, while 32 percent of high-SES sophomores do so. The least frequently reported jobs held by tenth graders who decided alone to hold a job are lawn workers and camp counselors. Thirty-one percent of tenth graders who decided alone to hold a job work as lawn workers and thirty percent work as camp counselors. The most frequently reported jobs held by tenth graders who decided alone to hold a job are fast food waiter/waitress or worker and hospital/health workers. Approximately 44 percent of tenth graders who decided on their own to hold a job are employed as fast food or hospital/health workers. Overall, it appears that many adolescents in families with the fewest amounts of social resources are making important decisions with limited input from their parents. Socioeconomic status is consistently linked with lower levels of joint student-parent decision-making. Higher levels of socioeconomic status are related to more collaborative decision-making experiences for adolescents, at least, concerning selection of curricular offerings, choice of whether to pursue postsecondary education, and after-school work for pay. Students' decision making on classes and college attendance also appears related to grades.   "}, {"section_title": "PARRNTAL REGULATION:", "text": "Section 3.1 examined who tenth graders perceive as making decisions about school, postsecondary experiences, and work. The following investigates the kinds of supports and constraints encountered by adolescents through parental-imposed regulation. The extent of parent regulation can be viewed as an indicator of adolescents' perceptions of their degree of autonomy. We examine parent regulation in three areas: limits on time with friends, checking of homework, and limits on television viewing."}, {"section_title": "Limiting time with friends", "text": "The most extensive amount of parental regulation can be seen in time spent with friends. Table 3.5 shows the percentage of 1990 sophomores responding that they \"often\" are regulated in this manner, 33 percent; this is the same as in the \"sometimes\" category, but roughly twice as much as the remaining low-regulation categories of \"rarely\" and \"never.\" Interesting gender relationships are seen for limitation of time with friends. A higher percentage of females report being regulated \"often\" (37 percent female to 30 percent male), with this difference being accounted for by higher reported percentages for males in the \"rarely\" and \"never\" columns. Family composition, however, does not appear to be related to parental regulation of time spent with friends. No significant pattern is apparent in the percentages reported in Table 3.5. But the data do suggest that an adolescent's socioeconomic status is related to limits on the amount of time he or she can spend with friends. The reported percentages of parents \"never\" limiting time with friends is seen to rise as socioeconomic status decreases, with low SES students differing significantly from high SES students. Conversely, in the \"sometimes\" column, the percentages rise with increasing socioeconomic status, again, with low SES students differing significantly from high SES students. A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 Interestingly, the data suggest that parental regulation of a sophomore's time with friends is unrelated to the student's math or science grades. Neither of these subject grades shows a statistically significant relationship to parental regulation of time spent with friends. This is noteworthy in comparison to the significant (31ationship between grades and family decision-making patterns."}, {"section_title": "Checking homework", "text": "This type of regulation checking homework--occurs less frequently than parental limitation of adolescents' time with friends. Table 3.6 shows that the proportion of sophomores reporting that their homework is checked \"often\" and \"sometimes\" is more than ten percentage points lower than the corresponding frequencies for parental limitation of time with friends (67 percent to 57 percent). Higher socioeconomic status is associated with higher frequencie,c of homework checking. As socioeconomic status changes from low to high, the percentages of sophomores reporting their homework was never checked by parents decreases from 23 percent to 13 percent. This is the same pattern found for parental regulation of tenth graders' time with friends. Also, the reported percentages of 1990 sophomores having their homework checked often increases as socioeconomic status changes from low to high. In the low-SES category, 22 percent of the students report their homework is checked often while 30 percent of tenth-grade students in the high-SES category respond similarly."}, {"section_title": "Limiting television viewing:", "text": "Of the three types of parental regulation examined in this chapter, the limitations by parents on sophomores' television watching or video game playing are the smallest. Table 3.7 shows that only 10 percent of students report being limited often. The percentage of respondents reporting they had never been limited in these activities is high, at 43 percent. Also interesting is the relationship between gender and this type of regulation. While only 39 percent of the males surveyed report they are never regulated in this manner, 46 percent of the females respond that they are never limited in their television and video game activities. Racial-ethnic differences are also of note. Asian sophomores are limited muc more frequently compared to tenth graders of other ethnic groups, the percentage never receiving limitations is only 29 percent. This percentage is much lower than the percentages for all other ethnic groups--in particular for blacks, with almost half (47%) of black sophomores reporting their television or video game time is never limited. In terms of family structure, the percentage of students in families with both natural parents who report 'never' being limited in television watching or video game playing is much lower, 39 percent, than the percentages for students from most other family types, in particular \"other adult or relative\" families (53%), \"mother and other male\" families (49%), and \"mother-only\" families (49%).   Socioeconomic status is related to limitation of television and video games, with low SES being related to less regulation. The percentage of tenth-grade students with parents holding less than a high school diploma reporting they are never limited in their television or video game usage (52%) is more than double the percentage for the students with parents with Ph.D.'s (25%). Consistent with the other types of parental regulation examined in this section, \"family resources\" are seen to be related to the levels of parental regulation of television and vireo game usage. Once again, higher levels of family resources appear to be associated with higher levels of parental regulation."}, {"section_title": "b IJ", "text": "Overall, with the exception of television and video games, the amount of regulation on tenth graders is at relatively high levels. The other two types of regulation (limitation of time spent with friends and homework checking) had a majority of the responses in the \"often\" and \"sometimes\" columns. SES and family structure appear to be important variables in parent-child interactions.

A further question is how sophomores actually spend their time outside of the classroom.   A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 Figure 3.3 also shows a negative relationship between activities not centered around the school, such as watching television or working a job, and science grades. Sophomores in the lowest grade category, on average, watch 3.7 more hours of television per week than students in the highest category. Additionally, tenth graders in the lowest grade category, on average, work 2.5 more hours per week on outside jobs. Together, these activities constitute a shift toward non-school-related activities, perhaps at the expense of a student's involvement in other school-related activities. Outside reading does not vary greatly across different grade levels, averaging 2.3 hours per week.'"}, {"section_title": "Employment experiences", "text": "After television viewing, employment seems to be one of the most prominent activities in an adolescent's life. Overall, the data on employment activities show that a large number of sophomores are involved in jobs outside of scnool, with 58 percent of students reporting they are employed. (See Table   3.8.) This is consistent with the other findings in this chapter that reveal a great deal of adolescent autonomy. Of employed respondents, 44 percent report they have identifiable occupations (14 percent of the students report their employment under the job category \"other\"). The number of respondents reporting that they are not working is 42 percent. Of those sophomores with identifiable jobs, about one-quarter of the students hold fast food/waiter jobs (14 percent of the total student sample); they worked predominantly between 11 and 30 hours per week, and earned wages generally in the $3.35 to $4.99 range. Other frequently held jobs are store clerk (7 percent of total sample), baby sitter (6 percent of total sample), and factory/manual labor/construction jobs (5 percent of total sample). The hours and earnings for store clerks are roughly the same as for fast food/waiter jobs. However, the hours for baby sitter are usually less than 10 hours per week and the wages less than $3.35 per hour. Baby-sitting jobs account for a disproportionate share of the jobs in the low-paying category. Students in factory/manual labor/construction jobs work much longer hours than most students (many working over 30 hours a week) and earn more than most students (mostly over $4.99 per hour). Some gender differences may be discerned. Lawn work/odd jobs, factory/manual labor/construction jobs, and farming jobs are mostly occupied by males, while baby sitting is mainly a female-held job (10 percent of females compared to 1 percent of males). As noted above, the job of baby sitting is very low paying. Also, the percentage of females not working is 48 percent, while the percentage for males is 12 percentage points lower, at 36 percent. Even the job of fast food waiter/waitress or worker, which accounts for the largest portion of sophomore employment, is associated with gender; though, unlike factory and construction jobs which are predominately held by males, more females than males hold fast food service jobs. Fifteen percent of females compared to 12.0 percent of males hold fast-food jobs. In terms of race/ethnicity, Asian, Hispanic, and black students are more likely than white students to never have been employed. Hispanic tenth graders have the highest nonemployment rate (52%), followed closely by Asian (51%) and black (49%) tenth graders. Employment status does not appear to be associated with family composition. 3Nor did the amount of outside reading appear to increase over the course of the reforrn-mindc-4-1 1980s. While both NAEP and NELS:88 test data show higher achievement levels for those who do more outside reading, trend data from NAEP covering the period 1984 to 1990 indicate that there has been little change across time at any age level in the percentage of students who read for fun on their own time\" (Mullis, Dossey, Poertsch, Jones and Gentile, 1991; p. 138). Comparison of HS&B 1980 sophomore data with NELS:88 1990 sophomore data confirm the NAEP finding of little if any change in reading habitsjust 41 percent of 1980 sophomores indicated that they read fur pleasure st lesst once or twice per week, And the same low figure (41 percent) was reported by sophomores in 1990 (Resinski,   Eighth grade and twelfth grade mark critical transition points for students. While the sophomore year offers no such dramatic point of decision and change, tenth grade is nonetheless a significant time for students as they adapt to high school and make plans for their futures. Most sophomores are attending the schools that will see them through their high-school years. The majority of sophomores are within the first or second year of adjusting to the secondary school curriculum, to a new school, and--since there are about twice as many schools with eighth grades as with tenth grades--to a blend of other students from different prior school contexts. All sophomores face large choices about their futures. The majority of tenth graders plan to pursue some sort of postsecondary education; for them, certain steps toward these goals assume great importance. Other students are quite sure that they will not pursue a postsecondary education and are looking toward other experiences, such as entering the labor force after high school, or are disenchanted with school and are contemplating dropping out. NELS:88 provides evidence of the great variation in students' past school experiences, family backgrounds, and relations with adults and peers. Clearly, no two tenth graders are exactly alike in these experiences and characteristics, any or all of which may influence students' tenth grade performance as well as their plans for the future. This chapter presents findings about how confident tenth-grade students are of graduating from high school and how far beyond high school they expect to go. To examine whether the nation's sophomores are aware of the steps necessary for attaining their expectations, we examine students' plans for taking the standard college entrance exams. In addition, in order to gain some understanding of the influences on high school sophomores as they think about their futures, we examine student reports of what their school counselors think is most important for them after high school and, within the family, the expectations their mothers have for them. In both areas of investigation, differences among various subgroups are highlighted."}, {"section_title": "EDUCATIONAL EXPECTATIONS", "text": "Expectations of completing high school. Before discussing postsecondary expectations, we must ask how confident students are of completing high school. Table 4.1 displays the percentage of tenth graders giving various responses to the question, \"How sure are you that you will graduate from high school?\" Overall, 86 percent say they are very sure of graduating. An additional 12 percent say they will probably graduate while 1.6 percent say either that they probably will not graduate or they are very sure that they will not graduate. No significant differences are seen in these responses by gender. By race and ethnicity, however, Hispanic students are less likely (74%) to report than Asian (83%), black (86%), and white (89%) students that they are very sure of graduating from high school. At the opposite extreme of educational expectations, black students are more likely than white students to report that they probably will not graduate or are very sure of this. Among blacks, 2.7 percent give one of these two responses while only 1.2 percent of white students give responses in these categories. No other significant differences were observed among the racial/ethnic subgroups.   The association between parents' education and their children's educational expectations is apparent, as only 74 percent of those tenth-grade students whose parents did not finish high school and 83 percent of those students whose parents were high school graduates but went no further say they are very sure of graduating while 94 percent of those whose parents have grPluate degrees give this response. Conversely, 3.1 percent of the students whose parents did not finish high school say they probably will not graduate or are very sure of this, while only 0.4 percent of the students whose parents are college graduates and 0.5 percent of those whose p' ents have graduate degrees give either of these responses. Similar trends are seen in the r ;lationship between student educational expectations and socioeconomic status, which comprises .:asures of parents' education, occupation, and family income. A strong pattern is apparent in Table 4.1 as those in the lowest SES quartile are least likely to say they are very sure of graduating and are most likely to give any of the three less hopeful responses. With each successive quartile, a greater percentage of students offers the first response while a decreasing percentage gives any of the other three responses. For the highest quartile, 93 percent say they are very sure of graduating while only 0.4 percent say they are very sure they will not graduate. Having either siblings or close friends who have dropped out of high school is clearly associated with a student feeling uncertain of graduating. Of those tenth-grade students for whom no close friends have dropped out, 90 percent say they are very sure of graduating while only 1.0 percent say they A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 probably will not graduate or are very sure that they will not. In contrast, of students who have had most of their close friends drop out, only 69 percent say they are very sure of graduating while 8.4 percent give one of the two least hopeful responses. Finally, significant differences are found in standardized test quartiles, high school program type, and school type, with those in the highest test quartile, academic high school programs', and Catholic or private-independent (NAIS) schools (relative to public schools) being most confident of graduating. In contrast, those in the lowest test quartile and those in public schools relative to Catholic and privateindependent (NAIS) schools indicate that they are least sure of graduating. Expectations for Completing College. Table 4.2 provides another look at students' expectations and aspirations. This table shows the percentage of tenth graders giving various responses to the question, \"How far in school do you think you will get?\" On average, 1990 sophomores have high expectations. Thirty-two percent expect th,:ir highest attainment to be college graduation while another 27 percent expect to receive graduate degrees. Eighteen percent plan to attend some college, but not to receive a 4year degree while another 13 percent expect to attend vocational, trade, or business school. Finally, 1.0 percent expect to stop at high school graduation while 0.6 percent do not expect to finish high school. Interestingly, postsecondary educational expectations of 1990 sophomores show a marked increase over those of 1980 sophomores. Some 41 percent of HS&B tenth graders expected to complete college, compared to over 59 percent of NELS:88 tenth graders (Rasinski, Inge ls, Rock & Pollack, 1993).2 It is encouraging to find such high expectations. Nevertheless, these student responses contrast sharply with what one might reasonably expect this cohort to realize, in light of college graduation rates. 'Students who do not know their high school program type have been chosen as an analytic category. Because a considerable portion of students fall into this category (weighted percentage for all students [that is, including non-sophomores] in the 1990 sample=7.3 percent) and the category proves repeatedly to stand apart from others. There are at least two important reasons for retaining the classification: (1) at least some high schools do not explicitly differentiate their etudents by program type, so that this is the most accurate response for some students to give; (2) the fact of students reporting that they do not know their program types supports the argument that some students lack adequate guidance or do not have a clear conception of the educational path they are following. 2Some 23 percent of tenth graders in HS&B reported that their highest educational expectation was college completion; some 18 percent indicated that they expected to earn a postgraduate degree. In contrast, 32 percent of NELS:88 sophomores gave college completion as their highest educational expectation, and 27 percent listed a postgraduate degree as their highest expectation. A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990  As recently as 1988, only 23 percent of people between the ages of 25 and 29 had completed 4 or more years or college (U.S Bureau of the Census, 1990). The comparable figure for the NELS:88 cohort may prove to be somewhat higher, but it is almost certain that not all of the 59.4 percent who say they will complete 4 or more years of college will do so. As the next waves of NELS:88 data become available, it will be interesting to see if and when expectations change and what effect this may have on students' general attitudes and outlooks. There is also perhaps some discrepancy between sophomores' high college-going expectations and the programs in which sophomores report themselves to be enrolled. While around 78 percent of sophomores expect to at least attend college, and nearly 60 percent of 1990 sophomores expect to graduate from college, only 41 percent consider themselves to be enrolled in the academic/college preparatory curriculum (as contrasted to a general or vocational curriculum).8 This same lack of articulation between expectations for college-going and preparation for college was observed in the eighth grade cohort in 1988. Although two thirds of 1988 eighth graders felt sure they would graduate from college, only 29 percent planned to enroll in the college preparatory curriculum and fully 25 percent reported that they did not know what type of high school program they would enroll in (Hafner, Ingels, Schneider, & Stevenson, 1990, Figure 4.2, p.65). Gender differences in postsecondary expectations. From the figures given in Table 4.2 for various subgroups, it can be seen that roughly the same proportions of males and females report that college graduation will be their highest educational attainment. However, the proportion of tenth-grade females planning to receive a graduate degree (31 percent) is significantly higher than the proportion of tenth-grade males with such plans (23 percent). Racial /ethnic differences in postsecondary expectations. The table suggests some notable differences among racial and ethnic groups. Summing the last two columns reveals that Hispanics and American Indians are the groups least likely to report plans for college graduation or graduate school (47 percent and 38 percent, respectively). In both cases, these percentages are significantly lower than the figures for Asians (69 percent), whites (61 percent), and blacks (59 percent). Parents' EducationlSocioeconomic Status. Focusing on the opposite extreme of education:Li expectations, we can sum the first two columns of the table to see the percentage of 1990 sophomores who expect to leave high school before graduation or who expect to have high school graduation as their highest level of attainment. Here the influences of parents' educational level and socioeconomic status are clearly in evidence. Of students whose parents did not complete high school, 28 percent are concentrated in the first two columns of Table 4.2. In contrast, only 2 percent of the students whose parents attended graduate school are located in the first two columns of the table. More generally, the proportion of students expecting to end their education with high school graduation or less drops significantly with each successive category of parents' education (except that there is no significant difference between sophomores whose parents' highest level was college graduation and students whose parents attended graduate school). Similar results are found according to socioeconomic status. That is, of those tenth-grade students in the lowest SES quartile, 22 percent are concentrated in the first two columns of the table while, of those in the highest SES quartile, only 2 percent are located in the first two columns. Also, once again, the proportion located in these two columns drops significantly with each successive quartile. A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 As expected in light of the results reported above, the proportion of sophomores planning to finish college or to attend graduate school increases significantly with each successive category of parents' education and socioeconomic status (except that, once again, there is no significant difference between students in the last two rows of parents' educatioa level). Occupational and educational expectations. Table 4.2 also shows sophomores' educational expectations according to the type of job each expects to have at age 30. It is difficult to group the job categories in a way that makes detailed analyses possible, but there appears to be a general trend by which tenth graders aspiring to jobs which require high degrees of education or specialized training plan to continue with their schooling accordingly. For example, the job category which includes manager, administrator, various professional-level occupations, school teacher, and technical specialist is probably the category requiring the most education. Consistent with this fact, fle students expecting to work in these fields are the ones most likely to aspire to college graduation or graduate school (76 percent). Furthermore, 1990 sophomores expecting to work as laborers/operatives and sales/service/clerical persons are more likely than sophomores expecting to work in other occupations, with the exception of sophomores planning to enter the military or planning to be homemakers, to anticipate their educational careers extending beyond high school to vocational, trade, or business school. This, too, seems to show generally congruent educational and occupational goals. Other factors. Finally, the table reveals significant differences in student expectations on the basis of test quartile, high school program type, and school type. Consistent with the figures from Table   4.1, sophomores in the highest test quartile, academic high school program, and private schools regardless of type most often report plans for college graduation or graduate school. In contrast, the tenth graders most often reporting plans to complete high school or less as their highest attainment are those in the lowest test quartile, those who do not know their high school program type, and those from public schools."}, {"section_title": "10.3", "text": "81.  Tables 4.1 and 4.2 report the levels of schooling tenth graders expect to attain. The data of NELS:88 allows us to probe further and to examine the thoughts and efforts sophomores and their families have put toward actually achieving their goals. Base year questions asked parents if they had begun to save money for their children's post-high-school education. For students who are planning to go to college, NELS:88 first follow-up questions ask about the importance of college expenses, course offerings, and social life in choosing a college. These questions reveal something about the amount of thought that has been given to college and about student perceptions of what is important in college life. Tho first follow-up questionnaire also asks sophomores whether they have taken or are planning to take some of the standard colL:ge entrance exams. This information, again, is telling of the amount of thought that has been given to college and of an awareness of some basic requisite steps. Table 4.3 shows the percentage of 1990 tenth graders giving various responses to questions about the PSAT, SAT, and ACT. Regarding the PSAT, 56 percent say they have taken the test or plan to take it; 8 percent say they do not plan to take it; and 36 percent say they have not thought about it. For the SAT, the percentages are 61 percent, 7 percent, and 32 percent, respectively. For the ACT, the percentages are 40 percent, 10 percent, and 50 percent. In considering differences among various subgroups in Table 4.3, discussion here will be limited to responses about the SI 7. However, virtually all trends reported for the SAT hold true for responses about the PSAT and the ACT, with variation only in magnitude.' Not surprisingly, the table shows that there is a strong positive association between having plans to take the SAT and (a) educational aspirations, (b) types of courses taken in high school, and (c) confidence in graduating from high school. The trends associated with educational aspirations are similar to the trends associated with the likelihood of graduating. Of those who expect to end their schooling with high school graduation, 16 percent plan to take the SAT (one may wonder why they have these plans), 26 percent do not plan to take it, and 58 percent have not thought about it. In contrast, of those who plan to receive graduate degrees, 84 percent plan to take the test, 2 percent do not plan to take it, and 14 percent have not thought about it. Regarding the association between certainty of graduating from high school and plans for the SAT, students who are very certain they will graduate from high school are three times more likely (65.5%) to have plans to take the SAT than students who report they probably will not graduate from high school (21.9%). Not surprisingly, 1990 sophomores who have taken advanced math and advanced science in ninth and tenth grade are much more likely than others to have plans to take the test and are much less likely to say they have not thought about it. Note that many of the students not in advanced placement courses or advanced math and science do report plans to attend college; thus, the large proportion who are seemingly unaware of the importance of entrance exams is troubling. nt should be noted that the SAT and ACT serve similar functions in the college entrance process. Many students take one examination or the other. In light of t some analysts may choose to include the SAT and ACT in a single category and examine student plans to take at least oh,. of the tests. Finally, there are significant differences according to standardized test quartile, high school program type, and school type. The students most likely to have plans to take the SAT are those in the highest test quartile, academic high school programs, and private sector schools. These same students are the ones least likely to say they do not plan to take the test or to say they have not thought about it. In contrast, the students least likely to have plans to take the test and most likely to say they do not plan to take it or they have not thought about it are those in the lowest test quartile, those who say they do not know their high school program type, and those in public schools."}, {"section_title": "GUIDANCE AND INFLUENCE: THE IMPACT OF COUNSELORS AND MOTHERS", "text": "Analyses of the base year data for 1988 eighth graders suggested th-t at the point of transition into high school, contact with guidance counselors was quite limited, a there was considerable uncertainty or mismatch for many students between their expectations and their educational plans. The following findings ) illustrate these points: Some 64 percent of eighth graders reported that they never discussed high school programs with their counselors; 30 percent said they had done so once or twice; 6 percent had done so three or more times; Eighth graders were far more likely to have discussed their high school plans frequently (that is, three or more times) with their mothers (52 percent) or fathers (31 percent) than with such school personnel as their teachers (8 percent) or their counselors (6 percent); Although two thirds of 1988 eighth graders indicated that they plan to finish college or go on to graduate or professional school, only about a third indicated that they plaaned to enroll in a college preparatory program in high school; A quarter of spring-term 1988 eighth graders indicated that they did not know what high school program they would enter. In light of such findings for 1988's eighth graders it is very much of interest to examine the sitvtion of 1990's sophomore class, to see if, once in high school, the process of guidance and influence differs, and the match between expectations and preparation becomes closer. We have seen that there is considerable variation in what tenth graders plan to do after high school. There also seem to be gaps in information flow and guidance for some students. Both of these facts are likely to be related to the interactions sophomores have with adults at school and at home. Table   4.4, Figure 4.1, and Figure 4.2 look at various aspects of the guidance and influence tenth graders receive from their school counselors and their mothers. Counselor Recommendations. Table 4.4 shows percentages of tenth graders giving various responses to the question, \"What does your school counselor think is the most important thing for you to do right after high school?\" The majority of sophomores (60 percent) say their counselors would have them go to college. The second most frequent response (26 percent) is that the students do not know what their counselors would have them do. These two responses are followed by \"Th' counselor thinks I should do what I want\" (7.5 percent), \"They don't care\" (3.2 percent), \"Enter a trade school or apprenticeship program\" (2.0 percent), \"Get a full-time job\" (0.9 percent), and \"Enter military service\" (0.7 percent). It must be realized that these responses may in some instances reflect tenth graders' desires A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 or expectations more than they reflect their counselors' advice, but some important inferences can be made, nonetheless. Few significant differences appear in the table by race/ethnicity or gender. By socioeconomic quartile, however, a strong association is evident between SES level and the likelihood of reporting that one's counselor would advise college attendance. Among those in the lowest SES quartile, 52 percent say their counselors think college is the most important step for them after high school. In contrast, 72 i-xcent of those in the highest SES quartile give this response. The difference of 20 percent between the low and high SES groups cited above is not accounted for by any single category in Table 4.4. A significant portion of the difference, however, is found in the last column of the table. That is, the proportion of sophomores from the lowest SES quartile reporting that they do not know what their counselors would have them do (30 percent) is 11 percentage points higher than the proportion of sophomores from the highest quartile who give this response (19 percent). -',..f./.!.'', ,1,,-.0.r14041*-4,. ,. i'44'''`'`''''''''''c''''' . 4. 4....4444.4..., 4.,....,. ,..4.444,4,---,.., :4..... . .4 1.., 11-1,1+, -...\"--, -,--,7,...\",, ...,,,,,-!.: . . .. , ..    However, it is striking that even for those placed in non-college preparatory programs, over half report that their counselors want them to continue on to college. Nevertheless, the proportions of sophomores who report that they do not know what their counselors would recommend they do is disturbingly high. Table 4.4 highlights certain groups of sophomores--specifically, those in the lowest SES quartile and those it the lowest test quartile (as well as those in non-academic high school programs)--whose reports suggest that they may be passing through their high school years with less sense of direction from school guidance counselors than may be imparted to high-SES and high-achievement sophomores. Mother's Aspirations. Figures 4.1 and 4.2 are based on sophomore reports of how far their mothers would want them to go in school.\" Specifically, Figure 4.1a shows the percentage of tenth graders who say their mothers would want them to complete college or attend graduate school as their highest education level, by socioeconomic quartile. There is a clear association between SES and reports of mothers' wishes. Among students in the lowest SES quartile, 33 percent said their mothers would have them finish college while an additional 14 percent said their mothers would want them to attend graduate school. In contrast, 53 percent of the students in the highest quartile said their mothers would have them finish college and an additional 31 percent said their mothers would want them to pursue graduate studies. Percentages for the two middle quartiles fall )etween those of the low and high quartiles revealing a unidirectional trend in the association between SES and student reports of mothers' wishes, as can be seen in the figure. Figure 4.1b illustrates the opposite extreme of tenth-grader reports of mothers' wishes. The figure shows the percentage of students who say their mothers would want them to complete less than high school or graduate from high school as their highest education level, again by socioeconomic quartile. While all of the proportions are quite small, one can see that students in the lowest SES quartile are most likely to give these responses; with each successive quartile, the percentage giving these responses decreases. test quartile referred to here is based on the tenth grade composite (math and reading score) on the cognitive test battery. \"For an analysis drawn from NELS:88 base year data of the relationship between race, gender, and cioeconomic status, on the one handand, on the other, student postsecondary expectations, student perceptions of their mot-ier's postsecondary aspirations for them, and parents' postsecondary expectations for their eighth graderssee Solorzano (1992). When reports of tenth-grade students' own expectations and student reports of mothers' wishes are each crosstabulated by various demographic and background variables, students' expectations and mothers' wishes generally prove to be very similar.\" This is the case, for example, when each item is crosstabulated by SES quartile (see Table 4.2 and Figure 4.1). However, when sophomores' expectations and mothers' wishes are each crosstabulated by race and ethnicity, one sees that the two resulting distributions differ from one another in important ways. Table 4.2 showed that Hispanic students expected to graduate from college or attend graduate school significantly less often than did Asians, blacks, or whites (Hispanics vs. Asians, whites, blacks, respectively). Figure 4.2a, however, shows Hispanic students reporting that their mothers have these high hopes or aspirations at rates not significantly different from those of blacks or whites. Hispanics are significantly less likely than Asians to report that their mothers have these high hopes, but the size of the gap is smaller here than it was in Table 4.2. These facts raise interesting questions about the social contexts that lead some tenth graders to have personal expectations very much in line with the expectations their mothers have for them while other students have personal expectations which are below those their mothers hold for them. Given that mothers' expectations align quite closely across groups, such variation among student expectations is an intriguing phenomenon. It is possible to invoke some measure of historical perspective on the postsecondary expectations of 1990 high school sophomores, by comparing the advice about college-going received by sophomores in 1990 with the expectations, and advice receivexl, by high school sophomores in 1980. In a report comparing HS&B and NELS:88 results, Rasinski, Inge ls, Rock and Pollack (1993) draw the following comparisons between the two cohorts: 1990 sophomores are significantly more likely than 1980 sophomores to say they will go on to complete a bachelor's or advanced degree. Among 1990 sophomores, 59 percent say that they will complete a bachelor's degree or higher; among 1980 sophomores, 41 percent had this expectation. These heightened expectations hold across all SES groups and for Hispanics, blacks, and whites; Members of the 1990 sophomore cohort are more likely to say they will attend a postsecondary institution right after high school, with no delays; 60 percent of 1990 sophomores plan immediate entry, as contrasted to 49 percent of their counterparts from a decade before; 1990 sophomores reported receiving significantly more adult advice urging them to attend college after high school than did 1980 sophomores. Fathers, mothers, guidance counselors and teachers in 1990 were all consistently more likely to recommend college attendance. Specifically: \"The two significant contrasts for college and graduate school are Asian and Hispanic and Asian and American Indian. l'The difference between expectations and aspirations should of course be kept in mind. Students were asked \"how far in school do you think you will get\" and they were asked how far in school they thought their mother wanted them to go. will lccomplish. There is considerable variation in the responses of different types of tenth graders. Accompanying this variation, and likely explaining much of it, is variation in the guidance and advice students have received in their schools and in their homes. In addition to providing educational outcome data that will permit measurement of the degree to which these expectations and aspirations in fact are realized, future waves of NELS:88 data will illuminate the manner in which student expectations change over time, the long-term implications of differences in school and family environments, and changes in outlooks and attitudes as students come to realize they may achieve either more or less than they might have imagined as eighth and tenth graders. Each of these five themes will be addressed in turn."}, {"section_title": "The NeTv Mathematics Reforms: Instructional Practices.", "text": "What students should know has been a focal question of recent school reforms. Inextricably bound up with the question of desirable knowledge is the further question of how best to convey it. Written national subject-matter standards for content (and, to a greater or lesser extent, instruction) are being developed in a number of disciplines, including science, English, foreign languages, social studies, history, geography, civics, and the arts. Most of these standards documents are slated for publication in 1994. However, for mathematics, national curriculum and evaluation standards for a technology-sensitive, problem-solving approach to the subject were published in 1989, supplemented by the publication of mathematics teaching standards in 1991. Instruction is a major \"alterable\" variable in education. Instructional methods can be changed, and improved instructional techniques can bring about higher achievement. In the light of development by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) of these new standards for mathematics curriculum and instruction, we asked about classroom practices specifically, to what degree are the NCTM-recommended resources and activities employed in the tenth-grade m7thematics classroom? Fur ther, we asked about equity --namely, are there group differences in exposure to recommended classroom practices? Two generalizations may, with slight qualifications, be drawn from the data analyzed in this report. First, and unsurprisingly, the new mathematics reforms were not yet dominant in the classrooms of American sophomores in 1990. Second, to the extent that the recommended curricular practices and resource utilizations were present, some differential exposure favoring higher SES sophomores was observed in two of four examined practices (calculator use and teacher demand for student oral explanation in the math classroom). Both generalizations can be supported with specific data. Extent of recommended practices. The new standards stress problem solving activities, yet only 30 percent of sophomores engage in problem-solving activities often--though more than 80 percent do so at least sometimes. The new standards emphasize student discussion and oral explanation. Some 41 percent of sophomores report they never participate in student-led discussions in math class, and 39 percent of sophomores report that they never explain their work to the class orally. Additionally, the new standards make a number of recommendations concerning resources. Specifically, use of books other than math texts and hands-on material, computers and calculators are prescribed in the new math guidelines. However, seventy percent of American sophomores report that they never use books in math class other than math texts. Fully 69 percent report never using handson material, and only 6 percent do so often. Some 84 percent of 1990 sophomores report never using computers. Just over a third report that they use calculators in class frequently, and another 38 percent indicate that they sometimes use calculators. Equitable distribution of recommended practices. One question the NELS:88 data are particularly suited for addressing is whether the likelihood of exposure to instructional and/or classroom practices and resources varies by student subgroups, such as racial, gender, or socioeconomic group. While the overall picture is mixed, we saw some evidence that for the more widespread or common practice --student oral explanation in math class and use of calculators high-SES sophomores are somewhat more likely to be exposed. For example, 40 percent of sophomores in the highest SES quartile report frequent calculator use, compared to 30 percent in the lowest quartile. However, in terms of the other two recommended (and currently less widespread) practices examined in this report, high-SES sophomores are not more likely (and in some cases are less likely) to be exposed to books other than a math text or hands-on material in math class. It will be important to continue to monitor issues of equity in distribution and access as the new mathematics standards are more widely implemented."}, {"section_title": "Gender Differences in Tested Sophomore Achievement in Mathematics", "text": "There are multiple reasons for being concerned with gender differences in achievement. Ultimately, most of these reasons reflect concerns with individual equity and national economic efficiency. Though different patterns appear at different ages, in general, NAEP results have shown a female advantage in reading and a male advantage (especially at age 17) in mathematics, science, and social studies (Mullis, Owen & Phillips, 1990). While all of these differences are cause for concern, gender differences in science and math course-taking and achievement, and in the choice of science and engineering careers, have been a special concern. Women and minority groups are considerably underrepresented among scientists, science teachers, and engineers, and are being lost from the \"science pipeline\" at a time when the nation forecasts a shortfall of scientists and engineers in coming years (National Research Council, 1990).' In turn, many recent reform efforts have been aimed at encouraging the participation and performance of females in the science and math curriculum. Quite apart from considerations of national economic efficiency (that is, supplying needed numbers of future scientists, mathematicians and engineers), the advantages of advanced numeracy, literacy and of civic education are goods that one may reasonably wish to see shared equally by all, regardless of gender. The NELS:88 dataset provides many opportunities for studying the differences in classroom experience of males and females across the four subject matters in which sample members were tested, and the influence of family factors, prior values and aspirations, and other factors on gender differences in course taking and achievement. The objective of this report, however, is the more modest one of cataloguing and pointing to such differences to the degree that they were present for American sophomores in 1990. ISchmieder and Michael-Dyer estimate that, given current demographic trends, 85 percent of the shortage of scientists must be filled by women and underrepresented minorities. Different patterns of results may be discerned across the different subject matters. Here, however, we discuss mathematics achievement only. For mathematics, we noted that at eighth grade, there were no significant gender differences in achievement in 1988. This report on 1990 sophomores shows a small male advantage in the highest test quartile; all other differences by quartile were nonsignificant. When looked at in terms of mathematics proficiency scores, this report shows that males were more likely than females to have mastered complex problem-solving skills; otherwise gender differences in sophomore mathematics achievement were not statistically significant. In terms of mathematics coursework, males and females were equally as likely to have taken geometry or an advanced math sequence by the spring of the sophomore year. Longitudinal analyses of NELS:88 data show that there were no significant differences among males and females with respect to overall gains from 1988 to 1990 in mathematics, nor were there differences in the proficiency levels at which gains were found (Scott, Rock, Pollack & Inge ls, 1993). Comparison of 1980 sophomores with 1990 sophomores shows higher mathematics achievement for 1990 males and females, and that the amount of gain was the same for both males and females (Rasinski, Inge ls, Rock & Pollack, 1993). It will be enormously of interest to examine the 1992 NELS:88 twelfth-grade results to determine whether large gender differences have by then asserted themselves (as historically has been the case), or whether reform efforts (or other, non-school factors) have resulted in diminished differences or parity between the sexes in this area.'"}, {"section_title": "Socioeconomic Status Differences in Math Achievement, Expectations, and Decision-Making", "text": "A pervasive theme in the educational literature is the strong influence of family background on achievement and other educational outcomes. It is important to monitor the extent of this influence for each new cohort, to determine whether social programs are succeeding in narrowing the gap between those with more and less favored family background. NELS:88 1990 data show that the disadvantage --or inequality of opportunity --suffered by low-SES sophomores when compared to their high-SES peers is indeed pronounced. This report documents the extent of the disparity between low-and high-SES students in math achievement, expectations, guidance and decision-making. In terms of achievement, over four times more low-SES tenth graders than high-SES tenth graders are in the bottom math achievement quartile while four times more high-SES sophomores than low-SES sophomores are in the highest test quartile. In terms of such hypothesized alterable precursors of achievement as course taking, high-SES sophomores are over twice as likely as low-SES sophomores to have completed a year of geometry (27 percent for low-SES, versus 68 percent for high-SES), and almost three times more likely to have taken a full 2 years of foreign language in ninth and tenth grade (58 percent for high SES, 17 percent for low). In terms of decision making and guidance, there is some evidence that low-SES students receive less guidance from parents as well as less from school counselors than do high-SES students. For example, low-SES sophomores are significantly more likely than high-SES sophomores to make decisions about what classes they will take entirely on their own, that is, without parental input. Low-SES sophomores are also significantly more likely than high-SES sophomores to report that they do not know what their counselors would advise them to do with their futures. Educational expectations are substantially lower for low-SES sophomores, in terms of their mothers' expectations for them and in terms of their expectations for themselves. Some 47 percent of 2Meta-analysis of recent studies on sex differences in mathematical performance suggests that male-female differences have been decreasing over the years (Friedman, 1989). 98 121 sophomores in the lowest SES quartile report that their mother wants them to complete college or graduate school. In contrast, 84 percent of sophomores in the highest SES quartile report that their mother wants them to complete college or graduate school. If we categorize those sophomores (some 59.4 percent of the total) who expect to complete at least a four year college degree by SES quartile, we see just over a third (35.5 percent) of those in the lowest SES quartile hold this expectation, compared to over 85 percent of those in the highest SES quartile.3"}, {"section_title": "Race Differences in Postsecondary Educational Expectations, Course Taking, and Math", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Achievement", "text": "The subject of this report is American high school sophomores. Tenth graders have two more years of high school, and those who have not, for example, taken geometry, or have not given serious thought to college entrance examinations, may nevertheless do so before their high school careers are over. Data from NELS:88 seniors in 1992 will complete the picture of the high school careers of this cohort. Disparities between groups in 1990 may have widened, or narrowed, by 1992. In the meantime it is -Titical to note contrasts between the postsecondary expectations, course taking experience, and tested math achievement of various groups of sophomores. We saw that educational expectations of 1990 sophomores vary significantly and systematically by socioeconomic status. If we examine educational expectations by race/ethnicity, however, the difference is not nearly so large, at least for non-Hispanic whites and blacks. For these two groups at tenth grade, future postsecondary educational expectations do not appear to be greatly dissimilar. Some 61 percent of whites and 59 percent of blacks expect to complete at least a four year college degree. More whites than blacks expect to complete just a four-year college course and not go on to professional or postgraduate work (33.8 percent of whites, 28.2 percent of blacks); black-white differences in expectation to complete a postgraduate or professional degree (30.5 percent of blacks and 27.4 percent of whites) are not statistically significant. Viewed historically, the college expectations of both whites and blacks increased significantly between 1980 and 1990.4 Some 41 percent of both black and white HS&B sophomores expected to complete at least a four year college degree, compared to 61 percent for whites and 59 percent for blacks a decade later. (The postsecondary expectations of Hispanics also rose, from 33 percent expecting to complete at least a four year college degree in 1980, to 54 percent of 1990 Hispanic sophomores.) Although both the high school completion rates and the postsecondary expectations of black students increased over the decade, the proportion of black students going directly on to college did not.' While the gap between black-white educational expectations is small, there is a large gap in course-taking in the \"college gatekeeper\" courses and there is an even larger gap in tested achievement. First, let us return to the two \"college gatekeeper courses\" identified by Pelavin and Kane in their analysis of the HS&B data. Pelavin and Kane report, employing data from the HS&B 1980 sophomore cohort, that the best course-taking predictors of college attendance are geometry and foreign language. Apparently, 1982 high school graduates with a year or more of geometry were twice as likely to attend college as those who lacked this background. Pelavin and Kane indicate that though blacks and Hispanics are less likely than whites to have completed a year of geometry (40 percent of whites, 19 percent of blacks, and 17 percent of Hispanics had done so), \"there is no discernible difference between the college attendance rates of minorities [blacks and Hispanics] and whites among the students who take geometry courses\" and that \"taking geometry is associated with a reduced gap between the college attendance rates of blacks and whites, and Hispanics and whites\" (p.48). They also report that geometry-taking is associated with a similar reduction in the college attendance gap between high and low income groups (p.48). For foreign language-taking, about twice as many whites as blacks in the graduating class of 1982 had completed at least two years of foreign language (29 percent versus 15 percent). However, students with this academic background were twice as likely to attend college within four years of graduation (86 percent versus 44 percent), While this sequence was associated with a higher likelihood of college attendance for all races, Pelavin and Kane (1990, p.53) report the following racial differences: of students with two or more years of foreign language, 77 percent of blacks, 74 percent of Hispanics and 88 percent of whites attended college within four years of high school graduation. The lowest income group also showed improved odds of attending college, when its members had completed two or more years of foreign language. To return to results for the NELS:88 cohort in 1990 with these HS&B results in mind, about half of white sophomores (49.8 percent) have completed a year or more of geometry, as compared to a third of Hispanic sophomores and just over a third of black sophomores (37.7 percent). Around 40 percent of white sophomores report that they completed two years of foreign language in ninth and tenth grade, while just over a quarter of black sophomores in 1990 report having done so. An even larger gap may be seen in tested achievement, however, if we examine the percentage of students scoring in the highest proficiency level in the key subjects of mathematics and reading. The comparison for mathematics is depicted in Figure 5.1. The advanced proficiency level (Math Level 4) represents mastery of conceptual understanding and complex problem solving. Whites are almost five times more likely to fall into the advanced proficiency group in math than are blacks. Percentages of sophomores from different racial/ethnic groups who displayed mastery of conceptual understanding and complex problem solving in mathematics are reported below: As shown in Figure 5.2, a higher proportion of Asians than whites expect to complete or go beyond college. Asians are more likely than whites to have completed a year of geometry and two years of foreign language. While Asians appear to out-perform whites at the highest level of mathematics proficiency, it should be noted that this difference is not statistically significant.' When the educational expectations of Hispanic tenth graders are considered, perhaps the most striking fact is that Hispanic sophomores expect to graduate from college or attend graduate school less often (46 percent of the time) than Asians (69 percent), blacks (59 percent), or whites (61 percent).' However, Hispanic high school sophomores report that their mothers hold high postsecondary aspirations for them at rates similar to those reported by blacks or whites, though somewhat lower (and the difference is statistically significant) than the maternal aspirations for their postsecondary careers reported by Asian sophomores. While Hispanic sophomores, too, show a pattern of relatively high postsecondary expectations but comparatively low tested achievement in math, the gulf between expectations and achievement is far wider for blacks. And when blacks are compared to whites, the gap between black and white educational expectations is quite small, the gap in enrollment in \"gatekeeper\" courses is larger, and the gap in tested achievement is larger still. Such disparities are unsettling, but these are differences that have diminished somewhat over time' and that may in many key respects be addressed by educational policy. Course taking behavior is alterable: students who aspire to and expect to complete a university education can be given greater opportunities and encouragement to enroll in courses that are most important to college entry and persistence, and that directly influence intermediate results such as high school subject matter achievement levels. Preparation could also be improved in earlier years of schooling, so that more students have the background (and confidence) to enroll in such courses in high school. Additionally, reforms of the mid-1980s that increased state and local graduation standards will increase the number of students who have taken these key courses. &The nonsignific.,ice of this difference (31 percent for Asians, 26 percent for whites) may reflect the small sample sizes within the advanced proficiency level, particularly the small number of Asians and the correspondingly high standard error (3.52). However, the difference between the proportion of Asians in the highest mathematics test quartile (39 percent), and the proportion of whites (32 percent), is indeed statistically significant. 7Howcver, when this issue is framed in terms of expectations of going to college, and made to include those who expect to attend but not graduate, the following proportions of sophomores from various racial/ethnic groups expect to go on to college: 82 percent for Asians, 78 percent for whites, 77 percent for blacks, and 72 percent for Hispanics. Comparison of HS&B and NELS:88 tenth grade mathematics results shows that both black and Hispanic students gained more than white (or Asian) students when 1980 achievement levels are compared to those of 1990 . NAEP data show the gap between white and black 13 and 17 year olds decreasing significantly in reading when 1990 results are compared to results from 1980 and the 1970s, and that at age 17 black students showed a higher average proficiency in mathematics in 1990 than in 1973 (Mullis, Dossey, Foertsch, Jones and Gentile, 1991). Despite these gains, blacks and Hispanics. lagged significantly behind whites in NAEP and NELS:88 1990 test results in both reading and math. HS&B (1980)-NELS:88 (1990 comparisons also show that black-white disparities in (self-reported) academic program placement had shrunk to insignificance by 1990, with 41 percent of black sophomores and 42 percent of white sophomores reporting that they were in an academic /college preparatory program in 1990 ( Rasinski, Ingcls, Rock and Pollack, 1993). However, despite this increase, the proportion of sophomores who report that they are in an academic/college preparatory program falls considerably below the proportion who expect to complete a four year college degree or more.  Although low-SES sophomores report a lower frequency of being urged by counselors to attend college than do their high-SES peers and report a lower level of maternal expectations for their education, sophomores in general appear to be receiving consistently positive advice about college attendance. Overall, sophomores report that both mothers and their school counselors overwhelmingly recommend going on to college (as do fathers and teachers). Counselors appear to be giving the same advice to males and females, and to blacks, whites, Hispanics and Asians (see Table 4.4). For example, 64 percent of Asians, 61 percent of Hispanics, 63 percent of blacks, and 60 percent of whites students reported that they were advised by their counselor to go to college, as were 59 percent of males and 61 percent of females. Certainly one path that high school students should contemplate is enrollment in college, and at the pr sent time, this is the path most often taken, with about sixty percent of graduating seniors going immediately into a two-or four-year postsecondary institution.' However, forty percent do not do so, and many who enter college do not persist. Sophomore perceptions of what their counselors think most important for them to do after graduation seemingly do not stress work, military service, or entering a trade school or apprenticeship program. Over sixty percent of sophomores indicate that their counselors say they should go to college, and another 36 percent say they don't know what counselors think, or that the counselor doesn't care, or that the counselor thinks they should do whatever they want. Only 3.6 percent say that counselors think they should get a full-time job or join the military, or enter trade school or an apprenticeship program. Even for sophomores scoring in the lowest composite (mathematics and reading) test quartile, over half (51.2 percent) report that the advice they hear is that they should go to college, and only four percent report that their counselor recommends they enter a trade school or apprenticeship program. At the same time, over 40 percent of those in the lowest test quartile--who surely are among those most in need of guidance--report that they are getting essentially no message from their counselor at all (4.1 percent say their counselor doesn't care, 9.3 percent say their counselor says they should do what they want, and 26.7 percent say they don't know what their counselor thinks they should do). While it is reassuring that males and females, blacks, whites, Hispanics and Asians are all receiving essentially the same advice from their counselors--namely, to go to college--the NELS:88 sophomore data at least raise the question of whether those least prepared to go to college are being effectively counseled. There is also a question of whether the minority of students who choose high school vocational programs are being helped to master academic subject matter. The 1990 Amendments to the Carl Perkins Act require programs receiving federal vocational education funds to \"integrate academic and vocational education in such programs through coherent sequences of courses so that students achieve both academic and occupational competencies.\" A compelling reason for this approach is that technologically advanced jobs require high levels of both academic and vocational skills. This report shows that over a fifth of 1990 sophomores who identified themselves as being in the vocational track failed to display mastery of the lowest proficiency level on the NELS:88 mathematics test--that is, they were not proficient at performing simple arithmetical operations on whole numbers. Only 6 percent of vocational track sophomores exhibited conceptual understanding and complex problem solving proficiency on the mathematics test; however, 38 percent of sophomores in the academic track did so. The findings reported in this volume should be viewed in the context both of past achievement and past group disparities, on the one hand, and on the other, the drive for improvements in education that will permit all students to reach their full potential. An increasing proportion of the students schools are educating come from poor or language minority backgrounds, and may be presumed to face language barriers or to have lesser family resources (for example, levels of parental education, or family income) than students from an English-language or higher socioeconomic status background. Nevertheless, comparison of NELS:88 sophomore math results with those of HS&B sophomores a decade before, and NAEP results over a variety of subjects for the same time period, point to modest improvements in performance,' and some narrowing (in most areas) of the gap between Asian and white test performance, on the one hand, and black and Hispanic, on the other. Schools have increased their holding power as well: dropout rates have declined.\" Data from the 1990 High School Transcripts Study demonstrate that 1990's seniors completed more academic coursework than did 1982 HS&B seniors. Between 1980 and 1990, the percentage of high school graduates enrolling in college in October following graduation increased from 49 percent to 60 percent. Declines or improvements in test scores, graduation rates, and other educational outcomes may reflect school factors or demographic, social, cultural and economic factors. This report, which is descriptive in nature and deals with but one point in time, offers no basis for assessing the source of such changes or their interactions. Nevertheless, it is clear that whatever improvements may have been won, and whatever their source, much better performance on the part of American students is necessary, both to maximize national economic efficiency and the capacity of all students--regardless of gender, race, or socioeconomic background--to realize their full potential. This report, in describing the achievement of the nation's sophomores, their course taking patterns, expectations, and exposure to curricular practices, points to the need for further explorations of the NELS:88 data, that will provide in-depth analyses of the educational phenomena here described. 10A twenty-year perspective suggests that achievement declines of the 1970s were largely reversed in the course of the 1980s and that current achievement levels are very similar toneither much better nor worse.than those of two decades before.

Sample surveys such as NELS:88, and universe surveys as well, are subject to nonsampling errors. Nonsampling error may arise from a number of sources, such as the inability to obtain cooperation from a sample member, or the unwillingness or inability of a respondent to answer a given item asked in a survey. In addition, the exclusion of persons who should be included in the universe, variability in providing estimates, differences in interpreting the meaning or intent of questions, and errors in data capture, editing, or coding may also result in nonsampling error. Nonsampling errors in NELS :88 are discussed in the base year and first follow-up user's manuals and technical reports. The overall quality of the base year student questionnaire data is assessed in 1. Assessments of first follow-up data quality issues appear in the user's manuals and the first follow-up final technical report. Estimates of sampling variability --expressed as the standard error of measurement--appear in Appendix A, along with sample sizes (unweighted Ns) for weighted estimates presented in this report.' (Although statistics reported in the tables of this report are weighted--that is, are population estimatessample sizes are critical to determining statistical significance and are therefore reported with the standard errors). Sampling errors occur because the data are collected from a sample of the population rather than the entire population. The standard error is a measure of the variability due to sampling when measuring a parameter. It indicates how much variance there is in the population of possible estimates of a parameter for a given sample size. Standard errors can be used as a measure of the precision expected from a particular sample. The sample estimate and an estimate of its standard error permit us to construct interval estimates with prescribed confidence that the interval includes the average result of all possible samples. An interval from two standard deviations below an estimate to two standard deviations above an estimate constitutes a 95 percent confidence interval. NELS:88 estimates the tenth-grade public school population at a total that falls somewhat below the number recorded by the NCES Common Core of Data. Among other reasons, this discrepancy is partly a function of the exclusion of certain schools from. the NELS:88 base year sampling frame, the exclusion of 5.34 percent of the students in the schools that were included in the sampling frame, and the difference between autumn and spring enrollment figures (fall enrollments tend to be higher--spring enrollment figures reflect attrition within the grade, particularly the impact on enrollment of dropping out).

The statistical comparisons in this report were based on the t statistic. Generally, whether the statistical test is considered significant or not is determined by calculating a t value for the difference between a pair of means or proportions and comparing this value to published tables of values at certain critical levels, called \"alpha levels.\" The alpha level is an a priori statement of the probability that a difference exists in fact rather than by chance. To guard against errors of inference based upon multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni procedure' to adjust significance tests for multiple contrasts was used. This method corrects the significance (or alpha) level for the total number of contrasts made with a particular classification variable. For each classification variable, there are (KIK-ID/2 possible contrasts (or nonredundant pairwise comparisons), where K is the number of categories. For example, if a classification variable has four categories, K=4 and there are (4*3)/2 =6 possible comparisons between the categories, the Bonferroni procedure divides the alpha-level for a single t-test (for example, 0.05) by the number of possible pairwise comparisons to derive a new alpha corrected for the fact that multiple contrasts are being made. Interested readers can compute the t statistic between estimates from various subgroups presented in the tables using the following formula: xl x2 1./SE+SE: where X, and X2 are the estimates to be compared and SE, and SE, are their corresponding standard errors. For example, to test for significant differences in the proportion of whites, blacks, and Asians who had completed a year of geometry by the spring of sophomore year, the following procedures would be implemented: 3Some 314 base year ineligibles were classified as eligible for the first follow-up and completed a first follow-up questionnaire.

Individuals from this group who were 1990 sophomores should in principle have been included in the analyses in this report, as well as in the trend comparison to HS&B (Rasinski, Inge ls, Rock and Pollack, 1993). They were not included because weights had not yet been generated for them at the time of the first follow-up data release; their omission should have but a modest impact on the estimates reported here and in other first follow-up reports. 'For detailed discussion, see, for example, Hays, W.L. (1988 2. Divide the desired alpha level, 0.05, by the number of comparisons (for example, three) to derive the new alpha (0.05/3 = 0.0166). 3.

The basic first follow-up nonresponse-adjusted weight--FlQWT--sums to all sophomores (including students added in sample freshening), and all retained members of the eighth-grade cohort regardless of grade or enrollment status. In other words, the data file population is the sum of groups 2 and 3 above, minus the overlap between these populations. While these populations overlap to a high degree, they are also distinct. Cross-sectional analyses reported in A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 therefore were restricted to students' (sample N 17,544) enrolled in tenth grade in the spring term of the 1990 school year; students out of grade sequence and dropouts (including dropouts from the freshening sample) were excluded. Longitudinal analyses, on the other hand, employed the special panel flag and panel weight, for the 17,424 members of the eighth-grade cohort who completed a questionnaire both in 1988 and 1990.

(These students had taken no math, or math courses such as general math, business math, and prealgebra, or less than a year of algebra or geometry). This scheme fits well--but nevertheless imperfectly--with the most common ways of sequencing courses in the mathematics curriculum, since in some schools sophomores may take algebra II before geometry. A science coursework variable was also created. Science Coursework Level. Using F1S23 from the student questionnaire, sophomores with one year or more in chemistry or physics were classified as being in the advanced science group. The middle group comprised individuals who did not qualify for the high group but reported taking one year or more of the following classes: biology, general science, physical science, earth science, or other science. Finally, the low coursework group consisted of all remaining sophomores (including those enrolled in principles of technology). Another variable created for analysis purposes was 1990 Family Composition. This variable represents a collapsed presentation of student questionnaire item 92 (F1S92). 6For details on deleted, abridged or recoiled variables in the public release files see the first follow-up student component data user's manual (ingels, Scott, Lindmark, Frankel & Myers, 1992)."}, {"section_title": "B-4", "text": "IL lo 0 -r r For Chapter 3, a sophomore Time Budget composite was created to describe time spent in five outof-school activities: television viewing, employment, outside reading, homework completed outside school, and extracurricular activities. \"Hours per week in television-viewing\" was constructed from F1S45A and B. \"Don't watch TV\" was given a value of 0; \"LT 1 hour/day\" a value of .5 hours; \"1 -2 hours\" a value of 1.5 hours; 2 -3 hours a value of 2.5; 3 4 hours a value of 3.5; 4 -5 hours a value of 4.5; over 5 hours was given a value of 5.5. Weekday values were multiplied by 5 and weekend values were multiplied by 2 and weekend and weekday then summed for a weekly estimate.. To compute time spent working on an outside job, item F1SS5 was utilized. Arraying the five possible response values of this variable from lowest to highest, values were assigned as 5, 15.5, 25.5, 35.5, and 40 hours respectively. Nonresponse was treated as 0. Outside reading was derived from F1S43. The eight possible response values for this variable were arrayed from lowest to highest and assigned 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.5, 6.5, 8.5, and 10 hours respectively. Homework was computed on the basis of F1S36B only, that is, time spent on homework outside of school. There were eight response categories; arrayed from lowest to highest, they were assigned values of 0, 1,2.5,5,8,11,14,and 15 hours respectively. Finally,\"weekly hours spent in extracurricular activities\" was computed from F1S42. The six response categories were assigned, from lowest to highest, the following hour values: 0, . 5, 2.5, 7, 14.5, and 20. Classification variables taken directly from the student data files include enrollment status, socioeconomic (SES) status quartile, race/ethnicity, school control, urbanicity (metropolitan status), parent education, test quartile, and test proficiency or mastery level. Further detail about the derivation of these variables is presented in the First Follow-Up Student Component Data File User 's Manual angels et al., 1992) Socioeconomic Status. F1SES was constructed using base year parent questionnaire data, when available. The following parent data were used: father's education level, mother's education level, father's occupation, mother's occupation, and family income (data coming from BYP30, BYP31, FYP34B, BYP37B and BYP80). Education-level data were recoded according to the definition of BYPARED described below. Occupation data were recoded using the Duncan SEI scale as used in HS&B and NLS-72. Parent data were used to construct F1SES if at least one component was not missing. If all parent data components were missing, the following base year student questionnaire items were used to calculate F1SES for base year respondents: father's education level (BYS34A), mother's educational level (BYS34B), father's occupation (BYS7B), mother's occupation (BYS4B), and presence of household items (BYS35A-P). For base year nonrespondents and first follow-up freshened students, the equivalent New Student Supplement items were used (F1N20A, F1N20B, F1N7B, F1N5B, and F1N21A-P, respectively). The first four components from the base year student/NSS data are the same as the components from the base year parent data (i.e., education-level data, BYS34A/F1N20A and BYS34B/F1N20B, similarly recoded; occupation data, BYS4B/F1N7B and BYS7B/F1N5B of student data, also recoded). The fifth component of F1SES from the student data was derived by summing the non-missing household items listed in BYS35A-P or in F1N21A-P (after recoding \"Not Have Item\" from \"2\" to \"0\"), calculating a simple mean of these items, and then standardizing this mean. If eight or more items in BYS35A-P or F1N21A-P were nomnissing, this component was computed; otherwise it was set to missing. Each nonmissing component (after any necessary recoding) was standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Norunissing standardized components were averaged yielding the F1SES composite. F1SESQ is the quartile into which F1SES falls. It was constructed by recoding F1SES into quartiles based on the weighted, F1QWT, marginal distribution, for all 1990 completed cases: sophomores, dropouts, and students who were not in modal sequence, that is, 1988 eighth graders who were in grades other than grade 10 in spring 1990.7 The values for F1SESQ are: 1 = Quartile 1 Low 2 = Quartile 2 3 = Quartile 3 4 = Quartile 4 High 8 = Missing Race/Ethnicity. Race is a composite variable; that is, it was constructed from multiple sources of information. The preferred source was the student self-report (from the base year questionnaire or first follow-up new student supplement). If the student information was missing, data from the parent questionnaire were used, or from sampling rosters if parent data were unavailable as well. The race categories are Asian (including Pacific Islanders); Hispanic, regardless of race; Black, not of Hispanic origin; White, not of Hispanic origin; and American Indian or Alaskan Native. School Control. Two different school classification schemes are used in the NELS:88 data. The scheme used in this paper classified schools by their control into public, Catholic, independent (defined as members of the National Association of Independent Schools), and all other private schools. FlPARED characterizes the highest level of education attained by either of the parents of the student. It was constructed using the parent questionnaire data (BYP30 and BYP31). Base year student data (BYS34A & BYS34B) were used for base year respondents whenever parent data were either missing or not available. For base year nonrespondents with missing or unavailable parent data and first follow-up freshened students, the New Student Supplement questions F1N20A and F1N2OB were used. That is, the first follow-up composite starts with the BYPARED variable. If BYPARED is missing or the case is a freshened student, first follow-up New Student Supplement data were used. General Description of the NELS:88 Cognitive Test Scores. There are two broad types of scores available on the NELS:88 data files. One type is a normative score and the second type is a criterionreferenced proficiency (or \"mastery\") score. The normative scores can be divided into two subclasses, longitudinal, and cross-sectional. There are also two types of criterion-referenced scores--dichotomous proficiency scores, and probability of proficiency scores. Normative Scores. There are two types of normative scores on the NELS:88 data set. One type is longitudinally-equated--the IRT-estimated number right score. The second type of score--the achievement quartile--is standardized within a survey wave, that is, cross-sectionally. The longitudinally-equated score that is available for both time points and all four achievement areas is the IRT-estimated number right score. The IRT-estimated number right for any individual at either of the two time periods reflects an estimate of the number of items that a person would have answered correctly if he or she had taken all of the items that appeared in any form of the test. The IRT model allows one to put all the scores in, say mathematics, on the same vertical scale so that the scores, 7To obtain more precision for certain cross-sectional analyses of sophomores that employ SES quartiles, the quartiles may be redrawn, based on the sophomore cohort sample, which F1SESQ, used in this report, only approximates."}, {"section_title": "B-6", "text": "C7, J"}, {"section_title": "4.", "text": "A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 regardless of grade, can be interpreted in the same way. All the normal statistical operations that apply to any cognitive test score can be legitimately applied to the IRT-estimated number right. Quartile scores are cross-sectional in that they are standardized within each of the weighted NELS:88 sample waves. Since the achievement quartiles are standardized within each wave, they are not vertically equated as are the IRT-estimated number right scores. These cross-sectional scores are primarily used in descriptive tables that compa 3 data within a particular grade. Criterion-Referenced Proficiency Scores. The two kinds of criterion-referenced mastery scores are based on clusters of items having similar content and difficulty. The first kind is a dichotomous score of \"0\" or \"1\" where a \"1\" indicates mastery of the material at this objective level and a \"0\" implies nonmastery. The second kind is a continuous score indicating the probability that a student has mastered the type of items that describe a particular criterion-referenced level. The 0-1 dichotomous proficiency scores were available only in mathematics and reading at the time that this report was prepared, although proficiency scores are being generated for science as well and will be included in the second follow-up release. The proficiency levels are hierarchically ordered in the sense that mastery of the highest level among three levels implies that one would have also mastered the lower two levels. The second kind of proficiency score is the probability of being proficient at each of the levels. This is a continuous analogue to the dichotomous proficiency scores. The advantage of the probability score over the dichotomous proficiency score is that the probability score is continuous and thus statistically more powerful, and poses less of a missing data problem in that probabilities of being proficient at each level are available for any individual who had a test score in grade ten. The proficiency probabilities are particularly appropriate for relating specific processes to changes that occur at different points along the score scale. Of course, NELS:88 data may support other approaches (than those embodied in the proficiency level scheme) to identifying the different components of achievement and providing multidimensional scores that can be related to various student, teacher and school variables. (See, for example, Kupermintz et al. on NELS:88 mathematics data,and Hamilton et al. on NELS:88 science data.) Standardized Test Scores, Quartile Test Scores, and Proficiency Scores areas: The NELS:88 first follow-up cognitive test battery consisted of multiple choice tests in four subject Reading Comprehension (21 questions, 21 minutes)--This subtest contained five short reading passages, with three to six questions about the content of each. Questions encompassed understanding the meaning of words in context, identifying figures of speech, interpreting the author's perspective, and evaluating the passage as a whole. Mathematics (40 questions, 30 minutes)--Test items included word problems, graphs, equations, quantitative comparisons, and geometric figures. Some questions could be answered by simple application of skills or knowledge; others required the student to demonstrate a more advanced level of comprehension or problem solving."}, {"section_title": "B-7", "text": "A Profile of the American Htgh School Sophomore in 1990 Science (25 questions, 20 minutes)-The science test contained questions drawn from the fields of life science, earth science, and physical science/chemistry. Emphasis was placed on understanding of underlying concepts rather than retention of isolated facts. History/Citizenship/Geography (30 questions, 14 minutes)--American history questions addressed important issues and events in political and economic history from colonial times through the recent past. Citizenship items included questions on the workings of the federal government and the rights and obligations of citizens. The geography questions touched on patterns of settlement and food production shared by other societies as well as our own. Score means and standard deviations, reliabilities (coefficient alpha), and standard errors of measurement for each NELS:88 first follow-up subtest are shown in Table B "}, {"section_title": "2.3", "text": "The four NELS:88 achievement tests were designed to reflect the high school curriculum. Central emphasis was placed on general concepts and the development of problem-solving abilities, rather than on highly specific curriculum content-given the heterogeneity of the high school curriculum, the two year interval between testing, and the problem, for gain measurement, of \"forgetting\" if tests emphasize curriculum-related knowledge that is highly specific. To make them more adaptive and increase the precision of measurement, two of the tests-reading and mathematics-had multiple forms or levels; assignment to a high or low form of the 1990 test was based on performance on the 1988 test. Table B.2 gives curriculum content and mastery or process specifications for the cognitive test battery across all three waves. Further information about test construction, and the psychometric properties of the tests, can be found in the NELS:88 Base Year Psychometric Report (Rock and Pollack, NCES 1991); in chapter 6 of the NELS:88 First Follow-Up Final Technical Report (Inge ls, Scott, Rock, Pollack, and Rasinski;NCES, 1994); and in the (forthcoming, NCES) NELS:88 Base Year Through Second Follow-Up Psychometric Report  10th Grade Low    Achievement Quartile Scores. Quartile scores are based on the weighted frequency distribution of scores, with 1 being the lowest quartile and 4 the highest. The Standardized Test Composite is the equally weighted mean of the standardized reading and mathematics scores, restandardized to mean 50, standard deviation 10. Note that the quartile scores that appear on the data files and that were used in this analysis are based on the entire NELS:88 first follow-up population, and not on a population solely of spring 1990 sophomores. Although this was not done in this report, some further increase in the precision of sophomore estimates could be obtained by redrawing the test quartiles to reflect tenth graders only. Differences between groups obtained from comparison of quartiles cannot automatically be assumed to form significant contrasts within different test result reporting formats, such as comparisons of overall mean scores or proficiency scores. (Nor are all differences that are statistically significant necessarily practically significant; consequently, effect sizes may also need to be taken into account.) Specific quartile scores employed in this report were as follows: Math test quartileFITXMQ"}, {"section_title": "Science test quartile--F1TXSQ Reading test quartile--F1TXRQ", "text": "Social studies test quartileF1n:11Q Composite (reading-math) test quartile--F1TXCOMP Proficiency Scores. The NELS:88 combined base year-first follow-up data release provided proficiency scores in two areas, mathematics and reading. Subsequently, proficiency scores at eighth and tenth grade levels have been produced for science, and will be included in the NELS:88 second follow-up release; science proficiency scores were not available in time for use in the analyses in this I Tort. The proficiency scores provide a means of distinguishing total score gain, as measured by o. Estimated Number Right scores and Standardized scores, from gain in specific skills. At several points along the score scale of the reading and mathematics tests, four-item clusters of test questions having similar content and difficulty were identified. A student was assumed to have mastered a particular level of proficiency if at least three of the four items in the cluster were answered correctly and to ha\"e failed at this level if two or more items were wrong. Clusters of items provide a more reliable test of proficiency than do single items because of the possibility of guessing in a multiple choice test: it is very unlikely that a student who has not mastered a particular skill would be able to guess enough answers correctly in a four-item cluster. (For some of the students who had omitted critical items, a complex IRTbased procedure, which is described elsewhere, was undertaken to resolve proficiency score assignments.) The proficiency levels were assumed to follow a Guttman model; that is, a student passing a particular skill level was expected to have mastered all lower levels; a failure should have indicated nonmastery at higher levels. A small perceltage of students had response patterns that did not follow the Guttman model, with a failing score at a lower level followed by a pass on a more difficult item cluster. Students with these \"reversal\" pattern\", were not assigned proficiency scores. Two levels of proficirmcy were marked in the reading test, and four in the mathematics test, defined as follows. MT Re-Scaling of NELS:88 Base Year and First Follow-Up Test Scores in the Second Follow-Up. IRT models the probability of answering an item correctly as a mathematical function of proficiency or skill, thus permitting use of a common scale on which performance can be compared across groups (including those wt;o took easier or harder versions of the NELS:88 tests) and time (NELS:88 results must be put on the same vertical [that is, eighth to tenth to twelfth grade] scale). A third data point (1992) for the NELS:88 test battery permits refinement of the IRT-derived item parameters and ability estimates of first follow-up (and base year) test results. That is to say, because NELS:88 is a longitudinal study in which many items are common across all three administrations, additional vertical scaling data become available with each successive round, permitting pooled re-estimation of item parameters and ability distributions, with the result that earlier parameter estimates can be improved. The use of all data points over time is the method best suited to providing stable estimates of both the item traces and latent trait scores throughout the entire ability distribution. Second follow-up IRT scores were computed using a Bayesian scaling program (PARSCALE) that took prior-round ability estimates into account.' First follow-up test results were resealed and will be re-released in the second follow-up. Although rescored first follow-up test data to be released later in 1994 differ little from data used in this report, such resealing helps to \"shrink\" any ceiling (or floor) effects so that cognitive growth in the four tested subjects can more accurately be measured for the highest-performing (or lowestperforming) students. The resulting changes in test scores, however, are quite small. The following Pearson correlation coefficients for originally released and second follow-up resealed 1990 test results for IRT-estimated number right scores are as follows: mathematics, .992; science, .997; reading, .992; and social studies, .991. Of the two kinds of cross-sectional achievement scores employed in this report, one--the dichotomous proficiency scoreswill not change, whi:,; the others --achievement quartiles, probability proficiencieswill be subject to some extremely small change. While differences in the resealed scores should not affect the conchm ions of analyses reported here, it should be noted that to exactly replicate the 1990 quartile score results presented in this report, one must use the test scores from the initial (1992) release rather than the second follow-up re-release (1994). gPooling all three time points, which amounts pooling all items as well as people and recomputing all the item parameters using Bayesian priors reflecting the ability distributions associated with each particular test form, provides for an empirically based shrinkage to more reasonable item parameters and ability scores. The fact that the total item pool is used in conjunction with Bayesian priors leads to a shrinking back of the extreme item parameters as well as the perfect scores to a more reasonable quantity, which in turn allows for the potential of some gains even in the uppermost tail of the distribution. This approachusing adaptive testing procedures combined with Bayesian procedures that allow for priors on both ability distributions and on the item parametersis an effective means for minimizing ceiling and floor effects in longitudinal assessments."}, {"section_title": "5 B-13", "text": "A Profile of the Amencan High School Sophomore in 1990 Gains in Math Proficiency. Analyses in this report are cross-sectional in nature, and the various measures of changes in achievement developed for the NELS:88 first follow-up were not employed in this report. However, in setting a wider context for these cross-sectional findings, we have reported key results from other NELS:88 (and NAEP) reports. It is perhaps worth noting that on one point two of these cited analyses differ somewhat in their conclusions regarding gender differences in 1988-1990 gains in math proficiency.  report a small practical but statistically significant male advantage in growth of mathematics mastery (in general, Rock, Owings and Lee report, males made more gains than did females, though for students in the normal mathematics progression, greater male gains can be found only for those individuals who were classified as being proficient at simple problemsolving in eighth. grade.) The somewhat different findings reported in Scott, Rock, Pollack and Ingels (1994)namely, that there were no differences between the two gender groups in terms of either raw gain (measured in mean scores) or patterns of gain across the proficiency levels--is best explained by the fact of differences in the proficiency variables and corresponding cases employed. Achievement gains can be examined using either dichotomous proficiency scores (as in Rock, Owings, and Lee), or the continuous change in probability of proficiency scores (as in Scott, Rock, Pollack, and Ingels). Rock, Owings and Lee examine percentage changes in the proportion of students classified as being at a given mathematics proficiency level between 1988 and 1990; the sample N for whom the relevant variables (BYTXMPRO and FITXMPRO) were available was 12,532. The analysis in Scott, Rock, Pollack and Inge ls employed a different proficiency gain variable --change in proficiency probability, a non-linear function of the total scale score--as well as IRT number right scores. The sr.nple N available for these measures was 15,315.

In addition to the constructed variables envmerated above, some row and column variables that appear in the tables in this report were taken directly, without alteration, from the student data file. These variables are presented below as a content stem accompanied by their variable label from the first follow-up data files. For example, the first follow-up question on the teacher's emphasis on learning and memorizing mathematics facts, rules, and steps, is subpart B of question 31. It bears the variable name \"F1S31B\"--F1 standing for the first follow-up, S for the student questionnaire, and 31B for the specific data element--part B of question 31 on the student questionnaire. Variables are listed below, sequenced according to the order of their appearance on the data files, which reflects their sequence in the student questionnaire as well. How Sure of Graduating from HS--F1S18A High School ProgramFIS20. High school program is based on student self-report of placement in general, vocational, or academic track. Transcripts (NELS:88 transcript data were not yet available when analyses were conducted for this report) offer a more objective and reliable indicator of program placement than do self-report data. (However, analysis of course-taking does not readily explicate program categories such as \"general\", but rather, supports a scheme of more and less rigorous academic track, vocational, and combinations of academic and vocational.) Sophomores are fairly early in their secondary school careers so that their program status may still be ambiguous; over 7 percent of sophomores reported that tl did not know their program type. Nevertheless, for those who can identify their program, self-reports of program placement have been found to correspond reasonably well to courses taken (see Gamoran 1987;Vanfossen, Jones and Spade 1967;Fennessey, Alexander, Riordan and Salganik 1981).

Consistent with its commitment--and in response to the need for policyrelevant, time-series data on nationally representative samples of elementary and secondary students-NCES instituted the National Education Longitudinal Studies (NELS) program, a continuing long-term project. The general aim of the NELS program is to study the educational, vocational, and personal development of students at various grade levels, and the personal, familial, social, institutional, and cultural factors that may affect that development. The NELS program currently consists of three major studies: the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72); High School and Beyond (HS&B); and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). Taken together, these studies represent the educational experience of youth from three decades --the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The research design for these three studies is depicted in Figure C.1, below. ILLS -72. The first of the NELS projects, the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72), began ire the spring of 1972 with a survey of a national probability sample of 19,001 seniors from 1,061 public, secular private, and church-affiliated high schools. The sample was designed to be representative of the approximately three million high school seniors enrolled in more than 17,000 schools in the spring of 1972. Each sample member was asked to complete a student questionnaire and a 69-minute test battery. School administrators were also asked to supply survey data on each student, as well as information about the schools' programs, resources, and grading systems. Five follow-ups, conducted in 1973, 1974, 1976, 1979, and 1986, have been completed. At the time of the first follow-up, an additional 4,450 students from the class of 1972 were added to the sample. Through intensive locating and tracking efforts, 13,912 of the 1972 base-year respondents and 4,016 participants in the expanded first follow-up sample responded to the fourth follow-up in 1979. The fifth follow-up included 12,841 participants from a subsample of 14,489 respondents who participated in the base year or one of the subsequent follow-ups. In addition to background information, the NLS-72 base year and follow-up surveys collected data on respondents' educational activities, such as schools attended, grades received, and degree of satisfaction with their educational institutions. Participants were also asked about work experiences, periods of unemployment, job satisfaction, military service, marital status, and children. Attitudinal information on self-concept, goals, participation in political activities, and ratings of their high schools are other topics for which respondents have supplied information. HS&B. High School and Beyond (HS&B) was designed to build on the NLS-72 in three ways. First, the introduction of a sophomore cohort provided data on the many critical educational and vocational choices made between the sophomore and senior years in high school, permitting a fuller understanding of the secondary school experience and its impact on students, as well as providing a basis for comparing dropouts and school persisters. Second, the base year survey of HS&B included a 1980 cohort of high school seniors that was directly comparable with the 1972 cohort.  The HS&B Base Year Survey. The se year survey was conducted in the spring term of 1980. The study design provided for a highly stratified national probability sample of 1,015 secondary schools as the first stage units of selection. In the second stage, 36 seniors and 36 sophomores were selected in each school (in schools with fewer than 36 students in either of these groups, all eligible students were included). Certain types of schools were oversampled to increase the usefulness of HS&B data for policy analysis. These included public schools with high percentages of Hispanic students, Catholic schools with high percentages of minority students, alternative public high schools, and private schools with highachieving students. The HS&B base year student questionnaires focused on individual and family background, high school experiences, work experiences, and plans for the future. The cognitive tests measured verbal and quantitative abilities, and included achievement measures in science, writing, and civics. School questionnaires provided information about enrollment, staff, educational programs, facilities and services, and special programs. A teacher comment checklist provided teacher observations on students, while the parent questionnaire (administered to a subsample of parents) elicited information about how family attitudes and financial planning affected postsecondary educational goals. The HS&B Follow-Ups. A subsample of the 1980 HS&B senior cohort was followed out of school, and resurveyed in 1982, 1984, and 1986. The sophomore cohort was resurveyed in 1982, when most sample members were high schuol seniors, although a substantial proportion of the cohort was surveyed out of school, either as dropouts (14%)i or early graduates (5%). The sophomore cohort was again resurveyed in 1984, 1986, atid in 1992. Postsecondary transcripts information was collected for both cohorts, with the most recent update of sophomore cohort postsecondary transcripts data taking place in the fall of 1992. High School transcripts, however, have been collected only for the sophomore cohort.' In addition to the various follow-ups of the HS&B student sample, there have been two follow-ups of the HS&B school sample. The Administrator and Teacher Survey (ATS) was conducted in 1984 in a probability subsample of 479 participating HS&B schools. In order to describe the impact of the school environment on the educational process more precisely, ATS gathered information on school climate, process, and functioning from principals; heads of guidance; vocational and community service program coordinators; and up to thirty teachers in each school. The National Longitudinal Study of Schools (NESS) is an OERI-sponsored follow-up of the HS&B school sample, which was designed to gather information that will describe how American high schools have changed since HS&B (1980-82) and since 1984 (ATS). (The sample was freshened to make it representative of American high schools in 1992). In 1992 data were collected from high school principals about the organization of their school; 'While 13.6 percent of the sophomore cohort was surveyed as dropouts in 1982, some sample members surveyed as students dropped out after survey day or otherwise left school before graduating. Some \"missed\" dropouts, moreover, were identified through their high school transcripts or in follow-up rounds. An HS&B 1980-82 dropout rate of 17.3 percent can be derived based on third follow-up responses to the question whether the respondent graduated from high school with his or her class or earlier. (By the time of the }'S &B third follow-up in 1986, almost half [46.5%1 of the HS&B dropouts had completed high school or received a GED. This statistic is slightly misleading however in that GED recipients [and enrollees] were classified as dropouts by HS &B in 1982if those who had obtained or were preparing for the GED are excluded from the HS&B dropout rate, it falls from 13.6 to 10.9 percent. The 11S&B third follow-up revised cohort dropout rate of 17.6 percent may also be somewhat misleading, in that it assimilates late graduationnot graduating with one's classto dropping out, while the 1982 definition did not.).

The 1988 eighthgrade cohort is being followed at 2-year intervals in order to obtain policy-relevant data about educational processes and outcomes--particularly those pertaining to student learning, early and late predictors of dropping out, and school effects on students' access to programs and equal opportunity to learn. The first follow-up, which took place in 1990, provides the first opportunity for longitudinal measurement of the 1988 baseline sample. It also provides a comparison point to high school sophomores 10 years before, as studied in HS&B. The study captures the population of early dropouts (those who leave school prior to the end of tenth grade), while monitoring the transition of the student population into secondary schooling. The second follow-up took place in 1992, when most sample members were second-term seniors. The second follow-up provides a culminating measurement of learning in the course of secondary school and collects information that will facilitate investigation of the transition into the labor force and postsecondary education after high school. Because the NELS:88 longitudinal sample was freshened to represent the twelfth-grade class of 1992, trend comparisons can be made to the senior cohorts of 1972 and 1980 that were studied in NLS-72 and HS&B. The NELS:88 second follow-up resurveyed students who were identified as dropouts in 1990 and identified and surveyed those additional students who had left school since the prior wave. The NELS:88 third follow-up will take place in 1994, when most sample members will have left high school. The primary goals of the 1994 round will be to provide for trend comparisons with NLS-72 and HS&B and to address issues of employment and postsecondary access and choice. Additionally, the third follow-up will provide a basis for assessing how many dropouts have returned to school and by what route and for measuring the access of dropouts to vocational training programs and to other educational opportunities. A fourth follow-up is scheduled for 1998, the year in which most members of the 1988 eighth grade cohort will turn 24. Study Components. The longitudinal data gathered from students is augmented through parent, teacher, school administrator and archival' accounts of students' progression and development. The simultaneous gathering of student and contextual data will lead to a better understanding of various facets of students' lives--their problems and concerns; their relationships with parents, peers, teachers; and the 3Academic transcripts are recognized to be an objective and reliable measure of students' educational experience, superior in level of detail, accuracy and completeness to student self-reports of course-taking and grades. As in High School and Beyond (HS&B), transcripts have been collected for students' entire high school careers. In addition to course, credit and grade information, other school records data such as days absent, participation in special programs, class rank, GPA, and test scores (PSAT, SAT, ACT, AP) are included on the transcripts file. NELS:88 transcripts data will be released on a privileged use basis in 1994. characteristics of their schools -and permit investigation of the effect of these factors on social, behavioral, and educational development. (The basic study components, by round, are sketched in Figure  C.2 below.) Intercohort Comparisons: NELS:88, HS&B, NIS-72. While the primary objective of NELS:88 is to support longitudinal analyses, the study is also designed to support the generation of single estimates in time and time-series (repeated cross-sectional) intercohort comparisons. For purposes of cross-sectional analyses, nationally representative samples of 1990 sophomores and 1992 seniors are made possible by means of a procedure for sample freshening. In both the first and second follow-ups, tenth and twelfth grade students, respectively, who did not have an opportunity for selection into the study in the base year were added to ensure nationally representative cross-sectional cohorts. With the creation of a nationally representative tenth grade cross-sectional cohort, trend comparisons between High School and Beyond (1-IS&B) 1980 sophomores and 1990 NELS:88 first follow-up sophomores may be drawn. Similarly, cross-cohort comparisons between the NELS:88 senior class of 1992, HS&B seniors of 1980 (and, with some qualification, 1982) and the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72) senior cohort may be conducted after the completion of the second follow-up. NELS:88 Base Year. The base year survey was conducted in the spring term of the 1987-1988 school year. A clustered, stratified national probability sample of 1,052 public and private eighth grade schools participated. Almost 25,000 students across the United States participated in the base year study. The sample represents the Nation's eighth grade population, totalling over 3 million eighth graders in more than 38,000 schools in spring 1988. Questionnaires and cognitive tests were administered to each student in the NELS:88. The student questionnaire covered school experiences, activities, attitudes, plans, selected background characteristics, and language proficiency. The school principal completed a questionnaire about the school; two teachers of each student were asked to answer questions about the student, about themselves, and about their school; and one parent of each student was surveyed regarding family characteristics and student activities. First Follow-up Design and Data Collection Results The NELS:88 first follow-up questionnaires and cognitive tests were designed to meet four general requirements for information about American education. These can be characterized as looking backward within the cohort to understand the impact of prior experiences, particularly at eighth grade, on current circumstances, looking ahead to provide a basis for understanding cohort members' future experiences, looking within the cohort at a single point in time to compare the outcomes and experiences of different social groups, and looking across cohorts by comparing the experiences of the NELS:88 sophomore cohort to those of sophomores studied in 1980 in HS&B. Three study components were carried over from the base year of NELS:88, and constitute the main first follow-up design: surveys and tests of students, and surveys of school administrators and teachers. In addition, three new components -the dropout survey, Base Year Ineligible Study, and School Effectiveness Study--where initiated in the first follow-up, and a freshened student sample was added to the student component. As in the base year, students were asked to complete a questionnaire and cognitive test. The cognitive test was designed to measure tenth grade achievement and cognitive growth between 1988 and 1990 in the subject areas of mathematics, science, social studies (history/citizenship/geography), and reading. The student questionnaire collected basic background information, and asked students about such topics as their school and home environments, participation in classes and extra-curricular activities, current jobs, their goals and aspirations, and opinions about themselves. Also, as in the base year, two teachers of each student were asked to complete a teacher questionnaire. The teacher questionnaire sought evaluations of the sampled student, class-specific information, school level information about institutional climate and policies, and information about the teacher's background and activities. With its ratings of individual students and class-level information about students' exposure to curriculum content and instructional practices, the teacher questionnaire provides a powerful measure of the specific learning environment of each NELS:88 student. In addition, a school administrator questionnaire was completed by principals. If a student was a first-time participant in NELS:88, he or she also completed a new student supplement, containing questions on basic demographic information which were asked in the base year but not repeated in the first follow-up. In addition to surveying students who were enrolled in school, the first follow-up also surveyed and tested youths who had dropped out of school at some point between the spring term of the 1987-88 school year and that of the 1989-90 school year. The dropout questionnaire collected information on a wide range of subjects, including reasons for leaving school, school experiences, absenteeism, plans for the future, employment, attitudes and self-concept, and home environment. The selection of students was implemented in two stages. The first stage of sampling involved the selection of 21,474 students who were in the eighth grade NELS:88 sample in 1988. These students were termed \"core\" students. The core student sample was then augmented through a process called \"freshening\", the aim of which was to provide a representative sample of students enrolled in the tenth grade in the 1989-90 school year. This \"two-stage\" sampling design differs substantially from the twostage design employed in the base year. Unlike the sampling design of the first follow-up, in the base year, eighth grade schools formed the primary sampling units, and a random sample of students within schools formed the second stage units. Consequently the base year provided representative samples of both eighth-grade students and schools, allowing for the use of both data files as stand-alone datasets. In the first follow-up, only the student dataset constitutes a representative probability sample. Freshening"}, {"section_title": "C-7", "text": "A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 added 1,043 eligible tenth graders who were not contained in the base year sampling frame, either because they were not in the country, or were not in the eighth grade in the spring term of 1988.4 The initial data co'lection period for the first follow-up was from late January to July, 1990. At the end of this period, the pool of nonrespondents (for example, students who had not attended the survey session or had not been located), which was believed to possibly contain \"hidden\" dropouts, was subsampled and further pursued in a second data collection effort. Figure C-2 outlines the sample and subsamples of the in-school rounds; data collection results are presented in Table 1. Percentages of cases for which a student/dropout questionnaire was obtained for which a cognitive test was also obtained. Indicates a coverage rate (student participants who hive a completed school questionnaire) for the entire student sample, including transfer students who were not eligible for the school administrator component. Design Enhancements. Two supplemental studies were undertaken in the first follow-up essentially to compensate for limitations in the NELS:88 design. At selected schools in the 30 largest MSAs, initial first follow-up student clusters were augmented-to obtain a representative in-school sample of sufficient size (approximately 30 students) to sustain analyses of school effects and use of multilevel statistical techniques (for example, hierarchical linear modeling). The data collected for the School Effectiveness Study is not included on the combined base year-first follow-up release but will be made available after the completion of the second follow-up as a 1990-1992 combined data release. The second supplemental component was the Base Year Ineligible Survey. Owing to a physical or mental disability or insufficient knowledge of the English language such that completion of a selfadministered survey form would be unduly difficult or impossible, 5.4 percent of the population of students enrolled in eighth grade in 1988 were excluded from the base year survey. Exclusion of such individuals from the sampling frame results in significant undercoverage of those subpopulations who are most likely to experience difficulty in school, and to drop out of school. Also, because change over time in eligibility status is possible (for example, a student not proficient in English may become so), excluded students, if their status is not reassessed as an adjunct to the freshening process, undermine the tenth and twelfth gra-ie representativeness of the 1990 and 1992 samples. A followback study of base year ineligibles was therefore undertaken in the first follow-up, to reassess eligibility and ascertain 1990 enrollment status. Individuals who were found to be capable of completing first follow-up survey forms under normal conditions were \"brought back into the study\" and surveyed. Individuals who were found to be still incapable of participation were assessed with respect to their enrollment and this information for both newly eligible and ineligible individuals was used to derive an expanded sample national dropout rate for the eighth grade cohort of 19885."}, {"section_title": "NELS:88 First Follow-Up Sample and Analysis Populations", "text": "Two objectives guided the first follow-up sampling plan. First, the sample was to include approximately 21,500 students who were in the eighth-grade sample in 1988 (both participants and nonparticipants). Second, the sample was to constitute a valid probability sample of all students currently enrolled in the tenth grade in the 1989-1990 school year. This entailed freshening the sample with students who were tenth graders in 1990 but not in the eighth grade during the 1987-1988 school year. (Figure 3 illustrates the longitudinal sample design of the baseline and follow-up surveys.) The two sampling objectives of the first follow-up produced two primary analytic populations--the NELS:88 eighth grade cohort two years later (1990), and the NELS:88 sophomore cohort of 1990.

Table 2 presents descriptive statistics on the freshened student cohort. Although freshened students comprise only 4.7 percent of the tenth grade cross-sectional cohort, they differ strikingly from both 1990 eighth grade longitudinal cohort members and 1990 sophomores. Unlike other first follow-up cohort members, the majority (51%) of freshened students are minority (compared to 29% of the eighth grade longitudinal cohort and 28% of 1990 sophomores), male (56 percent versus 50 percent both for the eighth grade longitudinal cohort and tenth grade cross-sectional cohort); and live in a non-traditional family arrangement (only 46% of freshened students live with their mother and father; approximately 60% of other cohorts members live with their mother and father). In many ways freshened students resemble the demographic profile of early NELS:88 dropouts, the majority of whom have also repeated a grade,' and live in a non-traditional family arrangement (only 26% live with their mother and father). Freshened cohort members are students who were not in eighth grade in the United States two years ago but were enrolled in the tenth grade as of the spring of 1990. The most frequently reported reason for not attending eighth grade in 1988 was being retained a grade (65 %)', followed by \"in another country\" (19%), unknown (12%), and accelerated (2%). Being retained a grade is also characteristic of Limited English Proficient (LEP) students; and, LEP students represent 17 p' rcent of the first follow-up freshened cohort.

For example, in some cases, continuous variables have been recast as categorical variables, or fine-grained categorical variables have been more grossly categorized.

This brief report presents findings regarding two types of transitions experienced by students as they move between the eighth and 10th grades: continuing or dropping out of school and transferring between sectors. While 98% of public school students remained in public schools, over one-third of Catholic school eighth graders and over 25% of National Association of Independent Schools students transferred to public or other private schools. About 6% of all eighth graders were classified as aropouts by spring of their scheduled 10th-grade year. For most students, the move between eighth and 10th grades involves a change of schools and exposure to new educational settings. These transitions may have an impact on student learning and personal development. Consequently, differences in transition patterns and possible outcomes are of major interest. Data were obtained from the base year and first follow-up surveys of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), which began in 1988 with a sample of 1,052 schools and 24,599 eighth graders.

This report profiles the family characteristics and the level of involvement reported by the parents of 1988 eighth graders, using the base year survey and dropout data from the first follow-up. About 93 percent of the parents of the first year sample were interviewed to provide information about home life and family experiences. This study examined child-directed involvement, including activities such as parent-child discussions and school-directed involvement such as parent-teacher association membership and volunteering in the school. There was some indication that parent involvement was related to whether or not students scored below the basic level in reading or mathematics proficiency, but there was a strong relationship between parent involvement and whether or not a student dropped out of school between the 8th and 10th grades. There are 26 tables and 18 figures presenting study findings. (121 p.). 12. Green, P.J.

In light of the many changes of the past 20 years, it may be expected that plans of high school seniors for further education may have also changed, along with the kinds of jobs they expect to have and the things they regard as important. These questions are examined through data from the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 (NLS-72) and the National Education Longitudinal Study in 1988 (NELS:88), the 1992 Second Follow-Up. The proportion of seniors in academic or college preparatory programs was approximately the same in both years, although enrollment in the general track increased and enrollment in vocational education decreased. In 1992, there was little difference between the sexes in high school program placement. In 1992, only 5.3 of students reported that they would not attend some kind of school after high school, but in 1972, 18.9% had reported that they would not continue. Eighty-four percent in 1992 planned to go to college, compared with the 63% who planned to attend in 1972. Differences for females were dramatic, with female seniors in 1992 four times more likely to plan on graduate or professional school as in 1972. Nearly 60% in 1992 planned a professional career, compared with approximately 45% in 1972. Changes in values were most marked among women, who in 1992 espoused values closer to those traditionally held by men. One figure and three tables present data about the two populations. (6 p.) 13.

In recent years, concern over students dropping out of school has increased. A primary focus is the size of the dropout population, a question that has been addressed in two National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) longitudinal studies. Both studies provide the data needed to consider the dropout experiences between the sophomore and senior years of two groups of students a decade apart in time. Over the 10 years between the 1980-82 High School and Beyond survey (HS&B) and the 1990-92 data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS :88) (follow-ups), there was a 43 percent reduction in the percent of sophomores who dropped out of school. The NELS:88 rate for the sophomore cohort of 1990 is 6.2 percent. Relative rankings for racial and ethnic groups did not change over the decade, and in both cohorts the dropout rates for Hispanics were higher than those for Whites and Asians. Rates for Blacks This publication illustrates use of the NELS:88 dichotomous proficiency scores for conducting achievement gain analysis (see Scott,Rock,Pollacic and Ingels [entry 21] for an illustration of an alternative gain analysis strategy, the use of mathematics probability of proficiency scores). The findings presented in this report suggest that course-taking patterns in mathematics between eighth grade and the sophomore year of high school represent an important factor in explaining growth in math proficiency. For example, even after controlling for eighth-grade math proficiency, higher math gains were associated with course-taking patterns that reflected advanced level math courses. The report also suggests that eighth-grade students who have higher aspirations for postsecondary education are also more likely to show positive math gains. (20 p.) 0411-,,,,,--1P'1,4, 16. Finn, J.D. School Engagement and Students At Risk. 1993;NCES 93-47, 0. To examine the proposition that students who do not remain active participants in class or school may be at risk for school failure, regardless of status characteristics such as ethnicity or family income, two studies of engagement and achievement were conducted. The studies used a nationwide sample of eighth-grade students from the U.S. Department of Education's National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) survey. The first study examined the association of participation in school and classroom activities with academic achievement in 15,737 eighth-graders attending public schools. The study found that participation and academic achievement were positively related, even after controlling for gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The second study examined behaviors that distinguish students who are at risk, but who are successful in school subjects, from their less successful peers. A sample of 5,945 eighth-graders identified as at risk by virtue of race, home language or socioeconomic status were classified as unsuccessful, passing, or successful, based on reading and mathematics achievement tests. It was found that achievement groups were distinct in terms of variety of classroom participation behaviors, out-of-class participation, and interactions with their parents regarding school. Three major conclusions were drawn from the investigation: (1) behavioral risk factors are indeed related to significant outcomes of schooling; (2) risk behaviors have their roots in the early school years or before; and (3) more attention should be given by educators and researchers to encouraging the potential of \"marginal\" students. Further research is needed to identify manipulable aspects of classroom and school processes that encourage student engagement.

The Effect of High School Vocational Education on Academic Achievement Gain", "text": "and High School Persistence: Evidence from NELS:88, 1994; Report to the Office of Research, OERI, U.S. Department of Education. This analysis of the effects of vocational education on academic achievement and high school persistence was prepared for the National Assessment of Vocational Education. Data from the NELS:88 high school transcript study were analyzed to assess the influence of vocational programs and vocational courses on gains in tested achievement in mathematics, science and reading. The analysis also addresses the issue of whether, regardless of their effect on achievement gain, vocational programs serve to keep students from dropping out of high school. 18.

This cross-sectional report supplies descriptive analyses of the educational situation of a representative sample of the nation's 1990 sophomores (comprising 1988 eighth-grade cohort members who were in tenth grade in the spring term of 1990 and \"freshened\" sophomores, students new to the sample who were not in the base year sampling frame, either because they were not 1987-88 eighth graders or not in the United States). Chapter 1 provides an in-depth view of tenth-grade learning and achievement in mathematics. Chapter 2 supplies a summary of tenth-grade course-taking patterns and instructional practices in science, reading, social studies, and foreign language. Chapter 3 explores the tenth grader's life outside of school, including the 301 E-9 A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 1990 process of educational decision making. Chapter 4 reports on sophomores' plans for the future, including their educational expectations and aspirations.

Myers,D.,and Heiser,N. Students' School Transition Patterns between Eighth and Tenth Grades Based on NELS:88, forthcoming 1994; NCES 94-137. Analysis of NELS:88 data makes it possible to explore the relationships between student and family characteristics and the likelihood of shifting among public and private schools as students progress from eighth to tenth grade. This study examines the characteristics of students who switch between sectors (public to private, or private to public) as they move from eighth to tenth grade. Five sets of variables were examined to estimate the association between variations in the students' transition patterns and student and family characteristics: (1) basic student and family background characteristics; (2) the amount of parental involvement in the student's education; 3the student's academic achievement and educational expectations; (4) the characteristics of the student's school; and (5) parental satisfaction with the student's school. Examination of these characteristics permits four research questions to be addressed: (1) How many students shift between the public and private school sectors? How many students shift from one private school to another?; (2) Who shifts between sectors? Are family background factors, parental involvement, or students' academic achievement or educational expectations associated with variations in transition patterns?; (3) Are school characteristics associated with students' propensity to move between school sectors?; (4) Do parents who are dissatisfied with their children's school shift their children to another type of school? 20.

This report examines the background of 1992 high school seniors, the school environment which shaped their senior year experiences, the curriculum in which they were enrolled, their academic achievement, their plans and expectations for the future, and their non-academic experiences during this important period of development. Chapter 1 provides a demographic profile of hiLli school seniors. Chapter 2 depicts their school and peer environment by recording seniors' perceptions of school, of the safety of their school, and of the values of their peers. Chapter 3 describes their course and program enrollments. Chapter 4 examines the tested achievement of 1992 seniors. Chapter 5 describes their short-term plans--their postsecondary plans, steps they have taken to gain entrance to college, and factors they considered in choosing a postsecondary institution. Chapter 6 reports on seniors' plans and expectations for the future. Finally, chapter 7 describes the senior cohort's experiences outside of school--use of illicit drugs and alcohol, television viewing, jobs, participation in school government, and community volunteer work. Taken together, these seven chapters provide a statistical profile of the American high school senior in 1992. Appendices provide unweighted (sample) Ns and standard errors.

Two Years Later: Cognitive Gains and School Transitions of NELS:88 Eighth Graders, 1994, NCES 94-436. This report describes the growth in cognitive Skills and achievement, and the continuities and discontinuities experienced in school and at home by the NELS:88 eighth-grade cohort during the two years between the study's base year (1988) and first follow-up (' 990) surveys. Four distinct topics are addressed, involving both school dropouts and persisters. (1) By 1990(1) By , some 1988 eighth graders were dropouts; this report describes their characteristics and the reasons they gave for dropping out of school. 2This report presents findings on patterns of school transition changing from a public eighth-grade school to a private high school or vice versa--and the changes in perception of safety and overall learning environment cohort members experienced after moving from a typically more homogeneous middle school environment to a more heterogeneous high school environment. 3Additionally, this report summarizes major changes in home life and family, such as the divorce or remarriage of a parent, that also occurred during cohort members' transition to and/or early years of high school. (4) Finally, this report examines the 1988-90 achievement gain of the eighth-grade cohort, thus addressing several basic questions: How much did students gain in achievement in the two years following eighth grade?; Who gained, in what subjects, and (for mathematics) in what way (that is, at what skill or proficiency level)? The analysis of growth in achievement illustrates use of the NELS:88 continuous measure of probability of mathematics proficiency (see Rock, Owings and Lee [1994, entry 15] for an illustration of mathematics achievement gain analysis using NELS:88 dichotomous proficiency scores). 22.
