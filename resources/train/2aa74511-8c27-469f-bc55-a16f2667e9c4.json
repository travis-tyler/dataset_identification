Understanding differences across schools may provide insights into improvements that educational reforms could bring. Where most of this literature focuses on differences in average achievement levels, we explore heterogeneity in the rates with which different schools produce highachieving math students. We note that there are large differences related to student demographics and estimate the distribution of unobserved school effects after controlling for some of these. We find substantial heterogeneity among schools with similar demographics.\nThis includes a thick upper tail of schools that produce many more high-achievers than would be expected given their demographics.\nRoughly one can think of the \"high achieving\" math students we study as students who would score 800 on the math portion of the SAT reasoning test. 1 Several motivations can be given for studying the rate at which schools produce such students. First, high-achieving students make important contributions to scientific and technical fields, to human-capital intensive industries, etc. 2 Second, contrary to the impression one might get from the popular press, the poor performance of U.S. math education is not limited to leaving some students behind: international comparisons find that the U.S. trails most OECD nations in the production of high-achieving math students (but not high-achieving students in reading). 3 Third, policies may have very different effects on high-achieving and average students. 4 The primary data source for our study is the Mathematical Association of America's AMC 12 contest. The \"contest\" consists of a 25-question multiple choice test on precalculus topics which is given annually to over 100,000 U.S. students at about 3,000 high schools. 1 800 is the highest possible score on the math SAT and is achieved by approximately 1 percent of SAT-takers.\n2 See Hoxby (2002) for a quick discussion of educational productivity as a source of U.S. comparative advantage. Krueger and Lindahl (2001) and Hanuschek and Woessmann (2008) provide surveys of the empirical literature on education and growth. Some notable examples of high-achieving high school students with a large economic impact are Microsoft's Bill Gates, who coauthored a computer science paper as a Harvard freshman, Google's Sergey Brin, who finished in the top 55 on the 1992 Putnam Exam, and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, who finished 13th on the Algebra test at the 2001 Harvard-MIT Math Tournament.\n3 Hanushek, Peterson and Woessmann (2011) note that \"most of the world's industrialized nations\" have a higher percentage of students reaching advanced levels on the 2006 PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) test than does the U.S. On the 2009 PISA math test just 1.9% of U.S. students achieved \"Level 6\" scores, whereas the OECD average was 3.1% and Singapore had 15.6% of its students at this level. PISA's reading tests indicate that the U.S. is good at producing students with very high verbal achievement: the U.S.'s perentage of \"Level 6\" reading students is well above the OECD average (1.5% vs. 0.8%).\n4 See Neal and Schanzenbach (2010) and Dee and Jacob (2009) for recent empirical studies of such differences."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "The test is explicitly designed to distinguish among students at very high achievement levels. 5 Our primary measures of high achievement will be the number of students in each school achieving AMC 12 scores above various cutoffs. We match AMC schools to schools surveyed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and to census data to obtain other covariates and conduct most of our analyses on the set of public, coed, nonmagnet, non-charter U.S. high schools that administer the AMC 12 and could be matched to NCES data. Section 2 discusses the data in more detail.\nThe most basic question we address is whether there are substantial differences across schools in the production of high-achieving math students (after one controls for demographic differences). Going back to Coleman (1966) , many papers have emphasized that differences in school-mean test scores are relatively \"small\" and much of the differences that do exist can be explained by demographic differences in the student populations. 6 In contrast, the literature on teacher value added tends to emphasize that there is substantial heterogeneity across teachers within a school. 7\nOur most basic finding is that there is a great deal of variation in the number of high-achieving math students produced by schools with similar demographics. We present several pieces of related evidence in Section 3. We begin with a simple informal comparison of high-achieving and matched comparison ZIP codes. Most of the section is then devoted to negative binomial regressions examining how the number of students with high AMC 12 scores is related to demographics and school characteristics. Demographics are found to be very strong predictors of high math achievement. But substantial heterogeneity remains after controlling for several variables. One noteworthy demographic finding is the incomeachievement relationship: income is positively correlated with high achievement in the full national sample, but once we restrict to the relatively high quality schools which offer the AMC tests, there are fewer high-achieving math students in more affluent areas.\nJust as the literature on heterogeneity in teacher quality has produced interesting graphs of the distribution of teacher value added, another objective of our paper is to provide estimates of the underlying distribution of unobserved heterogeneity across schools. 8 . For example, we estimate how many schools produce high-achieving students at less than one-half of the expected rate, how many produce such students at more than twice the expected rate, and so on. Counts of high-achieving students are inherently small, so there will unavoidably be a great deal of randomness in the assessment of any individual school using a single year's data. Section 4 describes the methodology that we use to take out this random variation and thereby back out estimates of the underlying heterogeneity. The method involves a series expansion similar to that of Gurmu, Rilstone, and Stern (1999) , but relying on a different characterization of the likelihoods. Appendix I contains more detail on the estimation along with Monte Carlo estimates illustrating the performance of the estimator.\nSection 5 presents estimates of the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity across schools. Our main qualitative findings are that many schools produce high-achieving students at much less than the average rate and that there is a strikingly thick tail of extremely successful schools. For example, we estimate that about 38% of schools produce high-scoring students at less than one-half of the average rate for schools with similar characteristics, and that 2% of schools produce high-scoring students at more than five times the average rate.\nWe also provide estimates of the heterogeneity of school effects relevant to subpopulations, including the likelihood of producing high-achieving female students. Here, the estimates suggest that many schools are extremely unlikely to produce high-achieving girls.\nPart of the outcome heterogeneity described in Section 5 is due to the self-selection of high-ability students into certain public schools. Section 6 examines another data source that may provide some insight on this effect: it examines differences in the rates at which different schools produce students with extremely high SAT scores. We find that the estimated distribution of unobserved heterogeneity derived from this measure of high achievement does not have the thick tail we see in the estimates derived from AMC data. If self-selection of high-ability students is equally or more important in the production of students with very high SAT scores, this would suggest that self-selection is not responsible for the thick upper tail in the AMC data.\nOur work is related to a number of literatures. One is the literature on quality differences across schools affecting average achievement. This includes papers examining how inputs affect achievement (Coleman (1966) , Hanushek (1986) , Card and Krueger (1992) , etc.) and papers that focus on differences in productivity related to competition (Hoxby (2000) ), vouchers (Hoxby (2000 (Hoxby ( , 2002 ) and charter schools (Angrist et al. (2002) , Fryer (2009), Hoxby et al. (2009) ). Many of these papers control for selection effects and estimate causal effects relevant to school reform debates."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "There are also a number of papers that discuss high-achieving students. Hanushek, Peterson, and Woessmann (2011) note that PISA data indicate that the U.S. trails most OECD countries in the fraction of students reaching high levels of math achievement.\nUsing a concordance between PISA and NAEP scores, they note that while there are large differences across U.S. states, even the best performing U.S. states (and high-performing demographic groups) have a lower percentage of high achievers than do many countries. A number of papers have noted that proficiency-based reforms create an incentive for schools to focus on students near the cutoff and that resource diversion could harm high-achieving (and very low-achieving) students and examine such effects empirically. 9 Bui, Craig, and Imberman (2011), Abdulkadiroglu, Angrist, and Pathak (2011) , and Dobbie and Fryer (2011) examine the effects of gifted programs and magnet schools on (marginal) high ability students using regression discontinuity designs. Andreescu et al. (2008) , focuses on a much higher percentile (roughly the 99.9999th), and has a message related to ours in noting that the highest achieving students are a highly nonrepresentative sample of the U.S. population ethnically and in the schools they attend.\nThe methodological part of our paper contributes to the econometric literature on count data models. This literature contains many alternatives to the Poisson model that can better fit datasets in which conditional means and variances are not equal. For example, the classic negative binomial model does this by allowing for gamma-distributed unobserved heterogeneity. 10 Two approaches to semiparametric estimation have been developed for applications where (as in our case) the distribution of underlying heterogeneity is an object of interest. 11 Br\u00e4nn\u00e4s and Rosenqvist (1994) develop an estimator along the lines of Simar (1976) and Heckman and Singer (1984) which involves modeling the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity as a finite number of mass points. Gurmu, Rilstone and Stern (1999) develop a series estimator which involves representing the unobserved heterogeneity as the product of a gamma-distributed density and function which is flexibly represented via an orthogonal polynomial expansion. Our primary motivation for not simply adopting one of these estimators is that previous Monte Carlo studies have suggested that they may not 9 See Krieg (2008) , Neal and Schanzenbach (2010) , Dee and Jacob (2009) . These papers assess performance using state proficiency tests and/or the NAEP and focus on students at the 90th percentile as their high-achieving population.\n10 Several other models allow for unobserved heterogeneity of other forms, and there are also approaches that focus directly on flexibly estimating discrete distributions without an underlying Poisson model. See Cameron and Trivedi (1998) , Guo and Trivedi (2002) , and Winkelmann (2008) for overviews.\n11 There are also semiparametric estimators in other branches of the count-data literature, e.g. Cameron and Johansson (1997) .\nwork well in our application. 12 Our approach is similar to that of Gurmu et al. (1999) in that we also specify the distribution of underlying heterogeneity as a product of a gammalike density and a flexible orthogonal polynomial term using Laguerre polynomials. The main difference is that we exploit other properties of the Laguerre polynomials to derive a different expression for the probability of each outcome. 13 Our expression does not involve the moment generating function and Monte Carlo estimates indicate that it can work reasonably well even with a fat-tailed distribution."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The primary subject of our analysis is a database of scores on the Mathematical Association of America's AMC 12 contest from 2007. 14 The AMC 12 is a 25-question, multiple choice test that is explicitly designed to identify and distinguish among students at very high performance levels. It is taken by a self-selected sample of mostly high-achieving students, but the average score among U.S. students is just 66.3 of 150. 15 We will focus primarily on very high-achieving students who scored above 100 on the exam. As discussed in Ellison and Swanson (2009) , scoring 100 on the AMC 12 can be thought of as comparably difficult to scoring 800 on the math SAT. The primary advantage of the AMC 12 is that it is more reliable in this range and can also draw consistent distinctions at higher percentiles. Approximately 5% of U.S. participants scored in excess of 100 on the AMC 12 (which places them approximately in the 99th percentile of the SAT-taking population) and approximately 0.5% scored in excess of 120.\nOur raw data are at the individual level, but only minimal information about each student is available -age, grade, gender, home ZIP -so we will mostly aggregate the 12 Heckman and Singer (1984) report that their method is better at estimating structural parameters than at estimating distributions of heterogeneity; and Gurmu et al. (1999) find that they do not estimate the distribution of heterogeneity well when the underlying distribution is log-normal (which may be relevant to our application because our data suggest fat tails). Their estimator does appear to provide reliable estimates of the systematic relationships for a broad range of distributions. Their Monte Carlo result on the difficulty in recovering a log-normal density using their estimator is not unexpected: their estimator can be seen as flexibly estimating the moment generating function of the distribution of heterogeneity. The log-normal distribution is sufficiently fat-tailed so that the moment generating function does not exist.\n13 Our approach also has several weaknesses relative to that of Gurmu et al. (1999) . Most notably, their approach can be applied to any conditional mean function whereas ours works only for conditional mean functions of the form E(y|X) = e X\u03b2 . Their expansion is also guaranteed to produce a valid estimated density whereas our estimated densities can take on negative values.\n14 The AMC 12 is open to all students in grades 12 and below. Approximately 88% of the participants are in 11th or 12th grade.\n15 Students receive 6 points for each correct answer and 1.5 points for each answer left blank so scores range from 0 to 150. data to the level of the high school (or home ZIP code) and treat schools as the unit of observation. 16 The primary school level variables we analyze are counts of the number of students in the school scoring at least 100 or 120.\nWe combine the AMC data with demographic information on participants' schools and areas of residence. ZIP code level demographics were taken from the U.S. Census. School level variables are constructed by matching to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) database for [2005] [2006] . The NCES collected private school data from schools that responded to the Private School Universe Survey (PSS). Data on public schools are from the NCES Common Core of Data, which is collected annually from state education agencies. School name, city, and state data were linked to the AMC data using the CEEB code search program provided on the College Board's website. CEEB codes for schools participating in the AMC 12 were then matched to NCES data by school name, city, and state. Of the 3,730 schools with numerical CEEB codes in the AMC data, 3,105 were matched to schools in the NCES data. 17 Among the variables we will use in our analyis are the number of students enrolled in each school, the percent of students belonging to various racial and ethnic groups, the percent of students qualifying for free lunch and the school's Title I status. We also use information from the NCES to restrict the sample to public, co-ed, non-magnet, non-charter U.S. high schools in most analyses.\nOur source of data on students with high SAT scores are the announced lists of students who were named \"candidates\" for the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program (PSP). Being named as a PSP candidate can be roughly thought of as indicating that a student was among the twenty highest scoring male high school seniors or the twenty highest-scoring female high school seniors in their home state on the SAT Math + Critical Reading combined score. 30 Each top twenty is extended in the case of ties. In California, many more than 40 students score a perfect 1600 on the SAT, so being a PSP candidate is an indicator for having a perfect SAT score. Scores at or near 1600 are required in several other large states, but the cutoff is much lower in small and low-performing states. We obtained the full list of 2,752 PSP candidates for 2007 from the U.S. Department of Education website.\nPSP schools were linked to NCES data based on school name and student location. 31 To make results comparable we will carry out our school-level analyses on the subset of schools that participated in the 2007 AMC contests. This subsample includes 1,593 of the PSP candidates. 32"}, {"section_title": "Differences Across Schools: Magnitudes and Sources of Heterogeneity", "text": "We begin this section by noting a basic fact: there is tremendous variation in the number of high-achieving students who are coming out of different schools and home ZIP codes.\nWe then examine the relationship between the number of high-scoring students in a school and observable demographic characteristics, noting both that there are a number of strong patterns and that there is a great deal of residual heterogeneity among seemingly similar schools.\n16 The AMC 12 contest is offered twice each year. The exams are different and students are allowed to take both, which about 2% of the participating students do. We matched such records as well as we could and included only scores from the later test date for dual takers.\n17 311 of the remaining 625 schools do not appear in the NCES data because they are not in the U.S., and a further 158 could not be matched because they did not have official CEEB identifiers and were thus not linked to school data of any kind. It was not possible to match the remaining 156 schools by the identifiers reported by the College Board or NCES. Some of the remaining schools with valid CEEB codes may not appear in the NCES survey data because private schools are not required to fill out the PSS. 6 3.1 A first look at differences across ZIP codes A simple way to illustrate the heterogeneity in student outcomes in the AMC data is to look at counts of the number of students residing in each ZIP code who scored least 100 on the AMC 12. There are about 32,000 residential ZIP codes in the U.S. and about 5,000 U.S. students scored over 100 on the 2007 AMC 12. If all students were equally likely to score 100 on the AMC 12, then (taking into account that some ZIP codes are more populous than others) we'd expect about 12 percent of ZIP codes to have at least one AMC high scorer: about 10% would have one high scorer, another 2 percent would have two high scorers and less than one percent of ZIP codes would have more. Extreme concentrations would be very rare: there is less than a 0.0001 chance that even a single ZIP code would have ten or more high scorers. Reality looks very different from this. Only 6% have any high scorers.\nAnd 58 ZIP codes have ten or more.\nThe raw differences noted in the previous paragraph reflect various factors: socioeconomic differences in the student populations; differences in school quality; and differences in whether interested students take the AMC 12. 18 Table 1 presents some additional data on the most successful ZIP codes. One of our main findings will be that there's a thick upper tail of extremely successful schools. The first ten rows of Table 1 illustrate this by listing the ten ZIP codes in which the highest number of AMC 12 high scorers reside. Each of these ZIP codes had at least twenty students scoring at least 100 on the AMC 12, which means they are more than 20 standard deviations above average. Although they are more populous than average, they are still all at least 4 standard deviations above average in the number of high scorers per capita.\nThe table also reports a few demographics. In addition to being more populous than the average ZIP code, the highest-achieving ZIP codes tend to have above-average incomes, many highly educated adults, and large Asian-American populations. The second-most successful ZIP code (Exeter, NH) is the location of an elite boarding school, but most others are just parts of some major metropolitan area in which most students attend a highlyregarded public school. Our regression analyses will focus on standard public schools.\nThe bottom half of Table 1 illustrates both that demographics have predictive power and another finding: a great deal of variation remains even when we compare areas/schools with similar demographics. In these rows we present some data on a comparison set of ZIP codes which are similar to those in the top half of the table. For each ZIP code in the top half we chose the ZIP code sharing the same first two digits which had the smallest weighted sum-of-absolute differences in the listed characteristics other than population. 19 The substantial number of high AMC scorers in the comparison ZIP codes suggests that there are strong demographic predictors of high AMC scores: the comparison ZIP codes average of 3.3 high scorers whereas the average across all ZIPs nationwide is just 0.2. But the comparison ZIP codes are still quite far behind the ZIP codes in the top half of the table: an illustration of our observation that there is a lot of unexplained heterogeneity in the upper tail."}, {"section_title": "Demographic patterns in high math achievement", "text": "In this section we aggregate our data to the level of the school or ZIP code and look at the relationship between the number of high-achieving students and school/ZIP code demographics.\nThe first column of Table 2 presents coefficient estimates (with t-statistics in parentheses) from a simple negative binomial regression with the number of students in the school scoring at least 100 on the AMC 12 as the dependent variable. A number of the strong effects match one's intuition. Parental education is very important: a one percentage point increase in the fraction of adults in the ZIP code with bachelors' and graduate degrees increases the expected number of AMC high-scorers by 3.1 and 5.9 percent, respectively. The school's ethnic makeup also matters in that a one percentage point increase in the Asian-American population of a school increases the expected number of AMC high scorers by over two percent. (Percent white is omitted from the regression.) There are also fewer high scorers in schools with more students qualifying for the free lunch program.\nAn effect that may not match intuition is the income effect: after controlling for the ethnic makeup of the school and parental education we find that there are fewer high scorers in higher-income areas. It should be kept in mind that the negative income effect is occurring after we restrict to schools offering the AMC and include the fraction of students qualifying for free lunch as a covariate. One thought on why this might occur, other than from a selection effect, is that social norms or the college application process may lead students in wealthier schools to spend more time on other activities, such as athletic and arts programs, debate teams, model UN, etc., rather than developing their math skills to a very high level.\nThe second column of the table looks at students reaching an even higher achievement 19 The weights are taken from a regression model predicting the number of high scorers. Notes and sources: Results of negative binomial regression and semi-parametric model estimation. Outcomes are counts of high achievers (students scoring more than 100 on the AMC 12, students scoring more than 120 on the AMC 12, and students achieving PSP candidate status on the SAT) in each school or ZIP code. School demographics are from the NCES Common Core of Data for 2005-6; ZIP code demographics are from the 2000 U.S. census. Award ratio is the ratio of the number of PSP candidates to the number of public and private high school graduates in each state. percentile among college-bound students). 20 Given that most students who would score 120 on the AMC are probably taking the test, the results here should be less affected by differences in how widely administered the AMC is at each school. The effects noted in the previous paragraph remain present and generally increase in magnitude, suggesting that the earlier results were not due to this type of selection.\nOur school-level estimates reflect a highly nonrepresentative sample of the U.S. population: we only include schools offering the AMC and these are disproportionately highachieving schools located in relatively wealthy areas. To give a sense of where AMC high scorers are coming from relative to the whole U.S. population, the third column of Table   2 goes back to the ZIP code as the unit of observation and presents estimates from a negative binomial regression with the number of resident students scoring at least 100 on the AMC 12 as the dependent variable. 21 Coefficients here should be thought of as reflecting both differences in math achievement and differences in access to the AMC. The effects of greater education in the adult population become larger in these results, as we might expect given that the availability of the AMC may be correlated with parental education.\nThe coefficient on income becomes positive and highly significant. A couple of factors may be responsible for the change. One is that access to the AMC may be increasing in income.\nAnother is that there may be a nonmonotonic relationship between income and investments in reaching high levels of math achievement: it may increase through much of the income distribution (all of which is relevant for this regression) and then turn down at the very top (which is more relevant once we restrict to AMC-offering schools)."}, {"section_title": "Magnitudes of unobserved heterogeneity", "text": "The negative binomial regression model also provides a simple estimator of the degree of unobserved heterogeneity that remains across schools after controlling for a given set of variables. We present some such estimates here.\nRecall that the negative binomial regression model assumes that Y i is a Poisson random variable with mean e X i \u03b2 u i , where u i is an independent mean one gamma-distributed random variable reflecting underlying heterogeneity not captured by the observed X i . The negative binomial model estimates both the coefficients \u03b2 on the X's and an extra parameter \u03b1 which is the variance of the u i . Estimates of this parameter from each of the negative 20 Given our restriction to public, non-magnet, non-charter, coeducational schools, there are 315 students in our sample at this threshold.\n21 Here, the ethnic composition variables are for the student's home ZIP code rather than the school."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "binomial models discussed in the previous section are presented in Table 2 .\nTo provide more of a feel for the magnitude of the unobserved heterogeneity relative to the heterogeneity captured by our demographic controls Table 3 reports the estimated standard deviation of u (the square root of\u03b1) from negative binomial regressions of the number of high-scoring AMC students in a school/ZIP code on different sets of controls.\nThe first row presents results with almost no controls: the number of high scorers in a ZIP code is the dependent variable and the only control is the ZIP code's population. The standard deviation of u is 2.59 for the count of students scoring over 100, and 3.92 for the count of students scoring over 120, indicating substantial unobserved heterogeneity in the number of high scorers beyond what can be explained by population variation alone. The estimated SD(u) is much greater for the higher score threshold, indicating that unobserved factors are more important at higher performance levels. The second row illustrates the effect of introducing the same demographic controls used in the ZIP code regressions displayed in Table 2 . Introducing controls reduces the unobserved heterogeneity by more than half for each score threshold. The unobserved heterogeneity remains large in a practical sense and remains highly statistically significant. 22 One might imagine that the unobserved heterogeneity is entirely due to differences between areas that offer the AMC and areas that do not. To examine this hypothesis, the third row restricts the sample to ZIP codes that had at least one student take the AMC 12; this restriction reduces the estimated SD(u) only slightly. The final two rows use schools as the unit of observation and restrict attention to public, non-magnet, non-charter, coeducational U.S. high schools in which the AMC 12 was offered. These estimates are in the same range as those observed for the ZIP-level analyses and exhibit similar patterns in that the measure of dispersion is higher for the higher thresholds and lower once we introduce controls. Even the numbers in the bottom row, however, are again very large in a practical sense. For example, the standard deviation of the unobserved heterogeneity would be 1 if 50% of all schools gave students no chance of achieving a high score on the AMC 12 and the other half gave twice the average chance, and it would be two if 80% of schools gave students zero chance of reaching high-achievement levels and 20% gave students five times the average chance. For the true values to be 1.01 or 1.66 there must be many schools which give students very little chance of reaching high achievement levels and other schools that give a much better than average chance.\nAn overall impression from these data is that there are several factors that are very strong predictors of whether a school/ZIP code will have many high-achieving math stu-22 \u03c7 2 tests of the null that SD(u) = 0 are rejected at the 0.001 level in each case.\n12 dents, but that there are also substantial differences across seemingly similar schools.

Assume that the u i are i.i.d. random variables independent of the z i with continuous density f on (0, \u221e) and E(u i ) = 1. We wish to estimate both the coefficients \u03b2 on the observable characteristics and the distribution f of the unobserved effects.\nOur approach is similar to that of Gurmu et al. (1999) in that we use a series expansion and exploit known properties of the orthogonal polynomials involved to facilitate maximum likelihood estimation.

Then,\nThe derivation of the formula exploits several properties of the Laguerre polynomials. Details are given in the Appendix.\nGiven the formula above it is natural to estimate the model by maximum likelihood: we simply treat \u03b2, \u03b1, and the g j as parameters to be estimated as in a series estimation. 24 For the estimated f (u) to be a valid density, the estimated parameters \u03b1, g 0 , g 1 , . . . , g N must be such that\nj (u) du = 1; and\nThe first of these conditions holds if and only if g 0 = 1/\u0393(\u03b1 + 1). We impose this restriction in all of our estimations. The second constraint is not as easy to express as a parameter restriction. We will not impose it as a constraint, but do add a penalty function (described in the Appendix) to the likelihood when the density is not everywhere positive, which in practice has the effect of making the estimated densities at most slightly negative. 25\nThe function f (x) can in theory be estimated consistently by allowing the number of terms N to grow at an appropriate rate or by choosing it in other other ways like crossvalidation. In practice, the number of Laguerre coefficients that can be estimated may be 23 The coefficients gj are given by\nOur specification of the model also includes the scaling assumption that E(ui|z) = 1. This is necessary for identification when the set of explanatory variables z contains a constant and the distribution of u is to be estimated semiparametrically. This condition can also be easily imposed as a parameter restriction: it is satisfied if and only if g1 = \u03b1/\u0393(\u03b1 + 2). When only a finite number N of terms are included in the series expansion, however, imposing this constraint is not necessary for identification, and the restriction is not imposed in the estimates reported in this paper. Instead, we estimate the model without the restriction and just renormalize the estimated distributions of u to have mean 1 by dividing by their expectations when graphing them.\nquite limited unless the dataset is very large. It is for this reason that we wrote the density\nj (x). When N = 0 the \u03b1 parameter gives the model the ability to fit a range of plausible densities with just a single estimated parameter: the renormalized distribution with parameter \u03b1 has mean 1 and variance 1/(\u03b1 + 1). This allows the model produce an exponential distribution (\u03b1 = 0), unimodal distributions concentrated around one (the distribution is unimodal with mode \u03b1 \u03b1+1 if \u03b1 > 0), and distributions with more weight on extreme u's than the exponential (\u03b1 \u2208 (\u22121, 0) ). 26"}, {"section_title": "Simulation results", "text": "Our primary motivation for estimating the model as described above instead of directly following previous approaches is that simulations have suggested that previous approaches may not work well in practice when the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity is fat tailed. 27 To assess how our method might work in practice and how many terms N one might want to include in the series expansion we also conducted simulation experiments described in the Appendix using exponential, log-normal, and uniform distributions for the unobserved heterogeneity. A very rough summary is that our approach seems to work reasonably well in the exponential and log-normal cases. Estimating the upper tail is easier than estimating the density at low values of u: it is inherently very difficult to distinguish whether a school is producing 0.1 or 0.01 high-achieving students per year. The simulations also suggest that including N = 4 terms in the series expansion may a good choice for balancing flexibility vs. overfitting given the number of observations in our dataset and the magnitudes of the counts. In our empirical analyses, we will generally present estimates that use N = 4 terms in the series expansion."}, {"section_title": "Distributions of Unobserved Heterogeneity Across Schools", "text": "We noted in section 3 that there are substantial performance differences across schools with similar demographics.

Specifically, we estimate the model using the number of students in each school scoring at least 100 on the 2007 AMC 12 as the dependent variable and use the same demographics as in Table 2 as control variables. Again, the sample is the set of coed public, non-magnet, non-charter schools offering the AMC 12 that we were able to match to the NCES data.\nOur primary interest in this section will be on the distribution of unobserved school effects. The top panel of Figure 1 graphs the probability density function from which the unobserved school effects u i are estimated to be drawn. The x-axis corresponds to different possible values of the unobserved effect, e.g. a value of u = 1 corresponds to a school that produces AMC 12 high scorers at exactly the mean rate, a value of u = 0.5 corresponds to a school that produces high-scorers at half of this rate, etc. The curve is like a histogram giving the relative frequency of the values of u in the population of schools. The substantial differences between schools with similar demographics are clearly visible in the figure: it looks nothing like a distribution that is highly concentrated around u = 1. Instead, it is a spread-out distribution that is skewed to the right. There are a large number of schools that produce AMC 12 high scorers at well below the average rate. For example, about 38% of schools are estimated to produce high scorers at less than one-half of the average rate. At the other extreme, there is a tail of highly successful schools. For example, about 9% of schools are estimated to produce high scorers at more than double the average rate.\nThe dashed lines in the figure are 95% confidence bands for the estimated density. 28 They indicate that the estimates are quite precise throughout most of the range, and then become much less precise in the lower tail.\nWhile the density function looks roughly like an exponential in the range that is graphed, there is a notable departure in the right tail -the upper tail of the estimated distribution is much thicker than that of an exponential distribution (or normal distribution). The bottom panel of Figure 1 illustrates this by graphing in bold the CDF of the estimated distribution for u's ranging from 3 to 10. The estimates indicate that there are a substantial number of schools which produce high-achieving math students at five to ten times the average rate for a school with their demographics. The dashed lines again give a 95% confidence 28 The confidence bands in this figure were generated using the parametric bootstrap procedure described in the Appendix. We also generated confidence bands using the nonparametric bootstrap procedure described there. They are quite similar (though slightly wider). Our semiparametric estimation procedure also yields estimated coefficients on the demographic variables, which are presented in the fourth column of Table 2 . The estimates are very similar to the estimates from the negative binomial regression as shown in the first column of the same table. The main implication to take away is that our earlier negative binomial regression results appear to be robust to modeling the unobserved heterogeneity more flexibly."}, {"section_title": "Female students", "text": "Given the underrepresentation of female students among high math achievers it seems natural to explore differences in how often schools produce high-achieving female students.\nIn this section, we present estimates similar to those in the previous section, but focusing on how often schools produce high-achieving girls. Our main observation is that unobserved school quality appears to be even more important for girls than it is for boys: there is an upper tail of schools that produce high-scoring girls at more than ten times the average rate.\nOne way to quantify the increased importance of unobserved school effects for girls is to estimate a negative binomial regression similar to those used in Section 3 using the number of high-scoring female students per school as the dependent variable. The estimate\u03b1 from such a regression (available on request) is 1.88 (s.e. 0.26) whereas it was 1.02 (s.e. 0.07) when we examined high-scoring students of either gender. The estimated distribution is qualitatively similar to what we reported in our earlier analysis of how often schools produced high-scoring male or female students in a couple respects. First, there are a large number of schools where girls are relatively unlikely to reach high levels of math achievement. For example, about 28% of schools are estimated to produce high-scoring girls at less than one-fourth of the average rate. Second, there is a small but very thick upper tail of schools where girls are many times more likely to succeed than are girls in an average school with comparable demographics.\nIn Ellison and Swanson (2010) we noted that there is a large gender gap among highachieving students in the AMC data: there is roughly a 4:1 male-female ratio among student scoring at least 100 on the AMC 12; and the average number of girls per school reaching this level is just 0.26. Hence, the estimate that there are a substantial number of schools that produce high-scoring girls at less than one-fourth of the average rate is very discouraging:\nit implies that these schools produce high-scoring girls at a rate of well less than one per decade. But the presence of the right tail is encouraging. The 99 th percentile school is estimated to produce high-scoring girls at more than ten times the rate of the average school with comparable demographics. This result implies that there are a number of schools that produce high-scoring girls at a rate that surpasses the rate at which the average school produces high-scoring boys.\nThe estimated distributions suggest that there are more schools in the lower and extreme upper tails for girls. But the imprecision of the estimates makes it difficult to make statistically significant statements about where exactly in the distribution the extra variance is coming from. A number of potential explanations could be given for why there might be more schools in the lower tail when we examine high-achieving girls. For example, the dispersion of school effects would be larger for girls if there is variation in how encouraging/discouraging schools are toward girls independent of a general school-quality effect. Another plausible story might be that girls are relatively disadvantaged when a school's \"honors\" math classes are not taught at a very high level (perhaps because girls are less liable to complain or take supplementary online classes)."}, {"section_title": "School effects at higher achievement levels", "text": "The AMC data also make it possible to study the distribution of students at even higher math achievement levels. Here, we present an estimated PDF of school effects estimated using the number of students scoring at least 120 on the AMC 12. We have two motivations.\nFirst, it seems natural to take advantage of a relatively rare opportunity to examine where 99.9+ th percentile students are coming from. Second, looking at such a high percentile will help to purge the results of one selection effect. It is unlikely that much of the differences across schools could be due to differences in the degree to which schools encourage their high-achieving students to take the AMC 12 because it is unlikely that students would reach such a high level of mastery if they were not planning to participate in contests like the AMC. Recall that the negative binomial regressions presented in Table 2 The top panel of Figure 3 presents the estimated PDF for u's between 0 and 3, and the bottom panel shows the upper tail of the CDF. Again the estimates are in bold with 95% pointwise confidence bands around them. The estimated distribution of school effects once again has a very thick upper tail. This supports the hypothesis that the upper tail heterogeneity is not just an artifact of selection into taking the AMC test. Comparing the estimated density to that estimated earlier from data on students scoring at least 100, we find two main differences: more schools are now estimated to be very far below average; and more schools are now estimated to produce high-scoring students at three to five times the average rate. Again, however, it is difficult to make statistically significant pointwise comparisons. Certainly, however, the combination of the low mean number of students scoring 120 and the large mass in the lower tail means that there are a large number of schools in which it is extremely unlikely that students will reach the very high levels of math achievement considered here."}, {"section_title": "Heterogeneity in the full U.S.: ZIP code breakdowns", "text": "In this section we reestimate our model using ZIP codes rather than schools as the unit of observation. In this way, we are able to provide estimates of the unexplained heterogeneity in high math achievement throughout the country (whereas previous estimates compare schools to other schools offering the AMC 12 test).\nThe estimated heterogeneities in this section will reflect both differences in the number of high-achieving students in a ZIP code and differences in AMC participation rates among such students. The participation rate differences should be smaller for students at very high percentiles of achievement. Accordingly, we focus in this section on students scoring at least 120 on the AMC 12. The ZIP code characteristics are those in Table 2 : log of population, percent of population with a bachelor's degree, percent of population with a graduate degree, percent urban, percent of population which is Asian, black, Hispanic, and female, and log of median income. The model is estimated on the full sample of 31,889 residential ZIP codes for which characteristics data were available in the Census. average chance of scoring 120 on the AMC 12 (38% of ZIP codes are estimated to produce such students at less than one-quarter of the average rate.) There is also a very thick upper tail of ZIP codes where many more students reach this threshold.\nWe conclude that these features of our earlier estimates seem to be robust to moving to a full national sample. Of course, part of the reason for this is due to the nature of the data and estimation. Many ZIP codes that feed into schools that do not offer the AMC contests would be expected to have few high scorers given their demographics. This limits the information they provide to the estimation. In this section we examine how likely different schools are to produce students with very high SAT scores. The primary motivation for this is that differences in the rate at which different schools produce students with high AMC scores will reflect both differences in educational programs and the self-selection of high-ability students into particular schools.\nSuch selection effects should have similar effects on SAT performance. But one would expect that SAT performance will be less affected by differences in schools' educational programs:\nwe presume that most schools that offer the AMC tests offer math and English courses that provide good coverage of SAT material. Hence, comparing estimates obtained from AMC and SAT data may provide insights on selection versus educational effects."}, {"section_title": "Demographic patterns", "text": "The regression in the fifth column of Table 2 is another school-level regression run on our sample of nonmagnet, noncharter, coeducational public schools that offer the AMC ex-30 Students can also qualify via a high ACT score. 31 We were able to match the schools attended by 2,520 of the 2,752 PSP candidates to the NCES data. 32 The fact that at least 58% of PSP candidates attend schools that offer the AMC contests provides another datapoint suggesting that the majority of the high-achieving math students in the country probably attend schools offering the AMC."}, {"section_title": "24", "text": "ams using the number of 2007 PSP candidates at the school as the dependent variable. 33\nThe most important observation for our purposes is that the estimated \u03b1 parameter from the negative binomial regression (0.48) is substantially smaller than the corresponding parameter (1.02) from the AMC 12 analysis. This indicates that there is less unobserved heterogeneity in the rates at which schools produce PSP candidates.\nThe demographic findings are in many ways similar to those concerning high AMC scorers: parental education matters a lot; median income remains negatively related to high achievement; and there are fewer high-achieving students in schools with more students qualifying for the free lunch program. The ethnic-group effects differ somewhat between the AMC-and PSP-based regressions. The strength of the Asian American effect is smaller in the PSP regression; and we now find fewer high-achieving students in schools with a larger Hispanic population. These differences may reflect that we have switched to a measure that also includes English test scores and requires less knowledge of math. The most noteworthy finding is that the thick upper tail we found in the AMC data is not present in the PSP data. The estimated CDF reaches 0.995 at a point where the CDF estimated from the AMC data is just 0.97. Unless the selection into schools of students with high math ability differs from selection of students who score well on the SAT, this suggests that the thick upper tail in the AMC data is probably not due primarily to unobserved differences in student ability. Instead, our leading conjecture for what causes the thick upper tail is that there are very few schools, even among the very high quality schools that produce PSP candidates, that teach math at the level will result in many students doing well on the AMC 12."}, {"section_title": "Distributions of unobserved heterogeneity across schools", "text": "The estimated density in the top panel also shows fewer schools with very low values of u -a feature that is very different from the point estimates from regressions examining 33 Our PSP regressions use an additional control variable: AwardRatio is the ratio of the number of PSP candidates from the state to the number of public and private high school graduates in each state. This is intended to control for dramatic differences in how hard it is to be a PSP candidate in different states. For example, Wyoming, which has a population of 550,000, had 43 PSP candidates in 2010, whereas Michigan, with a population of about 10 million, had just 47.\n34 Coefficient estimates for the demographic variables are presented in the last column of the Table 2. 25 students scoring 120+ on the AMC 12.

Our most basic observation is that they are very far from being evenly distributed across the U.S."}, {"section_title": "26", "text": "There are very strong demographic predictors of high achievement as one might expect:\nareas where there are many highly educated parents and schools with many Asian-American students are much more likely to produce high-achieving students. Other patterns, however,\nare not necessarily what one would have expected. In the full sample of ZIP codes there are more high-scorers in high income areas. But once we restrict to the sample of schools offering the AMC, the median income in a community is negatively correlated with the likelihood that students will reach high levels of math achievement (and similarly negatively correlated with the number of students with very high SAT scores).\nIn multiple branches of the education literature there are results that have been roughly interpreted as implying that there is only limited variation across schools in value-added apart (perhaps) from variation that is systematically related to socioeconomic factors. Our results suggest that things look very different when one examines how likely schools are to produce very high-achieving students rather than on how schools' effects on average test scores. Our results suggest that there is a lot of variation among seemingly similar schools. The most notable feature of this variation is a thick uppper tail of schools in which students are many times more likely to reach high achievement levels than are students in the typical school with similar demographics. This thick upper tail is present in all of our analyses of students with high AMC scores, but is not present when we look at where students with high SAT scores are coming from. This contrast suggests that that the thick tail is not because of the self-selection of high-ability students into a particular subset of schools. We suggest that a potential explanation is that almost all schools see it as their responsibility to provide English and math courses that cover material necessary to do well on the SATs, whereas there is much less uniformity in whether schools encourage gifted students to develop more advanced problem solving skills and reach the higher level of mastery of high school mathematics needed to do well on the AMC.\nRelative to the literature on the gender gap in mathematics, our comparison of school effects relevant to girls suggests that schools are perhaps even more important for girls: we estimate that the 99th percentile high school in our sample is producting high-scoring girls at more than ten times the rate of an average school with comparable demographics. We also note that there are many low-performing schools that will only very rarely have girls reach the AMC performance levels we have studied.\nAs we noted in the introduction, there are many ways in which one would like to do more than we can do with our data. It would be valuable to provide more evidence to separate out how much of the concentration of high-achieving students that we observe is due to 27 differences in school value added vs. differences in the selection of high-ability students into different public schools, to correlate differences in school policies with differences in outcomes, and to identify causal effects.\nOur results suggest that the high-achieving math students we see today in U.S. high schools may be just a small fraction of the number of students who have the potential to reach such levels. This should probably not be surprising -the U.S. is far behind many other countries in the fraction of students who achieve very high scores on internationally administered tests. Our finding that there appears to be a lot of variation across schools with similar demographics could be seen as hopeful: the number of high-achieving students would increase substantially if low-achieving schools could be brought up to average; and upper-tail schools might have programs that could be emulated to produce even larger improvements."}, {"section_title": "Appendix", "text": "In this appendix we provide additional details on the estimation and simulation results assessing the performance of the estimator."}, {"section_title": "A.1 Estimation Methodology", "text": "For any fixed N our model of unobserved heterogeneity implies\nThe estimated density will integrate to one if and only if g 0 = 1/\u0393(1 + \u03b1).

The orthogonal polynomial term in the density estimation will take on negative and positive values for some parameter values (and in practice the integral defining the likelihood will sometimes be larger if the \"density\" is made negative in some places to allow it to be larger in others). In our estimation we have therefore chosen to add a penalty function of log \u221e 0 max(f (x), 0)dx to the likelihood function for parameter values that do not generate valid densities. 35 The objective function is not globally concave, so we ran our estimation routines from a large number of starting values for the g i .\nWe now give a derivation of the formula in Proposition 1. Let the density f (x) be represented as\nj (x). 36 .

The likelihood minus the penalty function is a lower bound to the likelihood that would be obtained from the nonnegative densityf (x).

Each simulated variable included 2, 500 observations. The distributions of the simulated covariates and the values for \u03b2 were chosen so that the mean and variance of the simulated e z i \u03b2 would roughly match the mean and variance of the fitted values in a Poisson or negative binomial regression of the count of AMC 12 high-scorers on school-and school ZIP-level covariates. The u i were chosen from one of three distributions depending on the simulation: an exponential distribution with mean and standard deviation 1; a lognormal distribution with mean 1 and variance 1 3 ; and a uniform distribution on [0, 2] . The motivation for these choices was to demonstrate the performance of our procedure for a diverse set of underlying distributions: the exponential distribution is within the class of models being estimated even if N = 0; the lognormal distribution cannot be fit perfectly with a finite N and has a thicker upper tail; and the uniform distribution is a more challenging distribution to reproduce with a series expansion.\nThe estimated coefficients\u03b2 on the observed characteristics are fairly precise and show almost no bias. Table 5 provides some statistics on how well the model was able to estimate the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity. The rows correspond to the distribution from which the u's were drawn. The columns correspond to the number N of Laguerre polynomials used in the estimations.

The fit worsens gradually as N increases, but never becomes terrible; at N = 8, the worst fit, the median ISE is 0.024.

Larger N make it theoretically possible to fit the distribution much better (the best fit distributions have ISE 0.00756, 0.00210, 0.00014, and 0.00002 for N = 2, 4, 6, and 8), but again there is the offsetting effect that there is more scope for overfitting. The tradeoff between the two effects results in fairly similar fits across the range of N . The median ISE is smallest for the N = 2 model.\nThe fits to the uniform distribution are much worse. Here, there is no parameter combination that produces a very good fit when N is small, and overfitting becomes a concern when N is large. 38 The best fit is obtained for N = 6, where the median ISE is 45% lower than the median ISE for the worst fit of N = 2. Figure 6 provides a graphical illustration of the performance of our method. In each of the three panels we present the true distribution in bold and three estimated distributions corresponding to the simulations (using N = 4) that were at the 25 th percentile, the 50 th percentile, and the 75 th percentile in the MISE measure of goodness of fit. In the exponential and log-normal cases the estimated distributions seem to fit reasonably well for values of around the mean (u = 1) and to fit quite well for higher values of u. The estimated distributions are farther from the truth at low values of u. This should be expected -once we are considering a population of schools in which all schools will in practice have zero or one high-scoring student per year, a single year's data will not allow one to say whether all schools are identical or whether there is heterogeneity.\nAlso as expected, our method performs somewhat poorly for the uniform distribution with its bounded support. However, we are encouraged to note that, even for this difficult case, the method captures some important features of the distribution. The steep slope of the estimates at 0 and 2, and the double-peaked shape of the distributions in the range [0, 2] , allow the estimated functions to bound much of the estimated density in the correct "}, {"section_title": "A.3 Bootstrap Procedure", "text": "We obtained standard errors for our semiparametric estimates and confidence bands for the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity using both parametric and nonparametric bootstrapping procedures.

As in the semiparametric estimation on our full sample, the results of each bootstrap estimation may depend on the starting values chosen; in our results, we present those estimates for which the likelihood is highest after trying numerous starting values. 39 We begin each bootstrap by running a trial bootstrap of 20 simulations for several candidate starting values: those resulting in the highest likelihood in the full sample estimation and the center of each range of starting values for which the resulting likelihood is close to that of the best starting values. We then use the values that provide the highest average log-likelihood in the trial bootstrap as the starting values in the full bootstrap. If our model is specified correctly, then the parametric bootstrap is more efficient; if the model is misspecified, then the nonparametric bootstrap will be more appropriate. See Efron and Tibshirani (1993) for a discussion. In our application, neither procedure provides smaller or larger standard errors or confidence bands across all parameters or outcomes, but parametric standard errors are often slightly smaller and parametric bands are often slightly narrower and smoother.
