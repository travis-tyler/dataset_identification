[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Personalized relevance parameterization methods (PReP-AD) based on artificial intelligence computation techniques are introduced to investigate the impact of gene expressions on Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression.

Cognitive impairments of elderly people, such as loss of memory, language and judgmental deficits, are main symptoms of AD [2] . The intermediate stage that AD patients experience while passing through a gradual transition from normal cognition to AD is termed Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) [3] . An increasing need for computational methods emerges to evaluate cognitive impairment and diagnose dementia in preclinical or early clinical stages of AD, including MCI stage [4] .\nThe cognitive decline in aging and AD can be linked to hippocampal volume atrophy with the assessment of repeated 3D MRI scans [5] . For example, Jack et al. [3] reported a significant difference in annualized percentage change of hippocampal volume among AD patient groups based on their MRI examinations. Another measure of cognitive impairment in AD type dementia is the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), which is a 30-point questionnaire [1] . With MMSE, the cognitive and behavioral status of patients, such as attention, concentration and short term recall, are assessed, where a lower score implies greater impairment [6] . Typically MMSE scores of AD patients decrease with the progression of the disease [7] .\nLaske et al. have noted the relevance of recent neuropathological, biochemical and neuroimaging findings with early diagnosis of AD indicating the importance of biomarkers for AD progression [8] . The 42 aminoacid form of \u03b2 -amyloid (A\u03b2 1\u221242 ) and tau proteins, which are indicative of tangle formations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), are identified as AD protein biomarkers in numerous studies reported in [9] . In [10] , quantitative and qualitative alterations of gene expressions are analyzed to identify the biomarkers reflecting underlying biological pathways for AD. In this paper, we utilize expressions of genes that are reported to be related to AD based on analysis of gene expression profiles and blood samples [8, 10, 11, 12] . In addition, hippocampal volume measurements and MMSE scores for the patients with MCI status from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database [13] are included to compute disease progression. In ADNI, volume measurements are collected at three distinct time points a year, whereas MMSE scores are obtained for a 72-month period. Our personalized relevance parametrization (PReP-AD) methods are built for AD progression using artificial intelligence based computation techniques from our earlier reserach [14, 15, 16] . Here, we introduce two methods, namely PReP-AD-MMSE and PReP-AD-HVL, to compute disease progression with MMSE scores and hippocampal volume mesaurements, respectively. To identify the unbiased impact of gene expressions on the time course of disease, MCI patients who were not exposed to any AD drug therapy (e.g., donepezil and memantine) are selected as subjects for both methods.\nTo evaluate the performance of PReP-AD methods, we implement a validation algorithm using leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) technique. A relatively small average error rate obtained for both PReP-AD methods indicate that computational methods based on gene expressions and hippocampal measurements may be useful to build decision support tools for AD progression.\nThe rest of this article is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, a brief introduction is provided for related work reported in literature. MMSE and hippocampal volume measurements for AD are explained in Sec. 3. Sec. 4 describes PReP-AD algorithms. Analytical results and their interpretation are presented in Sec. 5."}, {"section_title": "RELATED WORK", "text": "Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the development of amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, as well as a decrease in hippocampal volume and onset of cognitive impairment and dementia [17] . Extensive work has been reported for AD in the fields of genetic, biomarker, imaging, and trajectory research. Blennow et al. [9] reported that an elevated level of total-tau (t-tau) in CSF is an indicator of neuronal degeneration and that phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) may relate to the development of neurofibrillary tangles. In [11] , MRI images demonstrate the acceleration of hippocampal volume atrophy with the presence of apolipoprotein E (ApoE ) allele \u03b54 gene and decreased \u03b2 -amyloid (A\u03b2 1\u221242 ) concentrations. Laske et al. [8] identify 24 blood-based biomarkers as an alternative to measuring levels of A\u03b2 1\u221242 , t-tau and p-tau, which requires an invasive and painful extraction of CSF via a lumbar puncture.\nAttempts have been made to develop a robust clinical rating scale to track AD progression. A comprehensive review, reported in [1] , identified 68 scales that measure domains such as cognition, behavior, and quality of life, however none were found to adequately gauge multiple domains simultaneously and sensitive enough at different stages of the disease. One of the most common rating systems is MMSE [18, 19, 20] , a 30-point test which requires approximately 5-10 minutes to administer for a patient. Based on the patient's correct answers to the test, an MMSE score is assigned to gauge short term recall, orientation to time and space, ability to follow commands, and other cognitive functions.\nIn [21] , the effect of ApoE allele \u03b54 gene on cognitive and functional abilities is examined using a linear declining pattern based on several metrics including MMSE scores. In [20] , AD progression is predicted by quadratic and logarithmic curve fitting functions based on the relationship between declining rate and average value of MMSE scores over time. Other researchers describe AD progression by a trilinear model [22] and nonlinear functions [7] , where the most rapid decline in MMSE scores occurs in midrange of the disease and less rapid decline during early and late stages. Stern et al. [7] estimate that the total period of decline in MMSE scores is about 15 years, where a rapid decline occurs after year 6.\nIn our ongoing research, we study the effects of biomarkers on progression for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In [23] , we compute tumor growth for breast cancer patients using their gene expressions and MRI images. In [24, 25] , we examine the delay effect of anti-cancer agents on tumor growth and the amount of shrinkage in tumor mass with the administration of chemotherapy for a number of breast cancer cell lines implanted in xenograft mice models. We also applied spatial pattern analysis methods for kidney cancer xenograft pathology slides to compute patient-specific features based on artificial intelligence techniques [16, 26] . Computing morphological features of in-vitro cell based assays which are incubated with human colon carcinoma cell lines, we examine spatial heterogeneity as a biomarker for drug efficacy measurements in [27, 28] . In this paper, we aim to compute disease progression for MCI transition stage of AD, which is from normal cognition to severe disease, based on gene expressions. Our computation methods are built on MMSE scores and hippocampal volume atrophy collected from AD patients in MCI stage."}, {"section_title": "ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE", "text": "Alzheimer's disease, contributing to 60% of dementia cases, affects approximately 35 million people worldwide with the total number of AD cases projected to more than triple by 2050 [4, 29] . It is also estimated that more than 4 million people suffer from dementia in the United States alone [30] . Due to the fact that brain changes begin 20 or more years before AD symptoms appear, characterization of AD progression gains more importance [31] .\nADNI is an longitudinal study for diagnosis of AD and analysis of treatment effects in AD type dementia [30] . In ADNI database, neuroimaging, CSF and blood-based biomarkers are collected from a large number of patients representing all stages of AD. This information is made available to aid in the discovery of biomarkers that can be used to most effectively diagnose and monitor the effects of treatment for AD. To evaluate cognitive decline, clinical measurements such as hippocampal volume measurements and neuropsychological tests such as MMSE were periodically administered to patients as part of the ADNI study [30] . Gene expressions, MMSE scores and hippocampal volume measurements used in this paper are obtained from ADNI database for the AD patients with MCI stage."}, {"section_title": "MMSE Scores", "text": "MMSE is a clinical tool designed as a questionnaire to assess cognitive state of patients [1] .

Consisting of 11 questions in 7 different categories, the MMSE has a maximum score of 30 points to classify patients into three disease levels, namely, normal cognition, mild and severe cognitive impairment [18, 32] . To focus on the cognitive aspects of mental functions for AD patients, abnormal mental experience and mood concerned questions are not included in the MMSE questionnaire [18] . In this paper, we use the change in MMSE scores for MCI patients over time as a metric for AD progression."}, {"section_title": "Hippocampus Volume Measurements", "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from AD patients are analyzed in longitudinal research studies to track the changes in brain structure over time [17] . The rate of hippocampal volume loss calculated from sequential MRI scans of the same individual is higher in AD patients than in control groups [33, 34] . Hippocampal atrophy could be assessed with MRI scans to decide whether the disease level declines or remains stable over a period of time [3] .\nBrain and specifically hippocampal volume measurements of AD patients are reported in ADNI database for early and late MCI, and control patients. For each individual, a baseline scan and two additional follow-up scans are included as high resolution MRI images using 3-Tesla MRI scanners. In Fig. 1 , we present a sample MRI image of a 85-year old male MCI patient's brain, whose subject ID is reported as 005-S-0448 in the database. The brain images shown in Fig. 1 are captured from the axial (left pane), the coronal (middle pane) and the sagittal (right pane) plane corresponding to the an example point of interest, which is marked with horizontal and vertical axis lines on each image. To provide a better view, the interest point is selected in the hippocampus region, which is highlighted in blue with the skull digitally removed. The left-and right-most positions of the skull are 54 and 195 voxels for axial view, 55 and 214 voxels for coronal view and 21 and 137 voxels for sagittal view. In this paper, in addition to the change in MMSE scores for MCI patients, we also use the rate of change in hippocampal volume in MRI scans over time as a metric for AD progression.

The expression values of these AD-related genes are obtained from ADNI database [13] for the patients with MCI status, excluding the patients who were administered any AD drugs.

Genetic accordance matrix A AD is constructed for both PReP-AD methods as illustrated with Algorithm 1. Progression parameters from MMSE scores and hippocampus volume measurements (i.e., the rates of change in disease level) are inputs for PReP-AD-MMSE and PReP-AD-HVL methods, respectively. The population size, number of generations and DE-based constants are also inputs for Algorithm 1. First, we construct genetic data vector \u0398 \u03b2 u for all patients as shown at line 1. For each progression parameter p \u03bd of AD, we then instantiate an initial population of candidate vectors #\u00bb a 1 as shown at line 3 of Algorithm 1.

The fittest candidate vector array #\u00bb a \u03bd,best and the best fitness array F( #\u00bb a \u03bd,best ) are initialized at line 5. For each generation, cross-over population is calculated from the best candidate vector array (line 7) based on DE algorithm constants. Here, scaling factor and cross over constant are utilized to search the solution space based on exploitation and exploration features of DE-based computation. The exploitation feature of DE performs a thorough search over a local region, while exploration feature searches randomly over the global solution space [38] .\nUsing the coefficients of candidate vector, progression parameters are computed (lines 9-11).

In Fig. 2a , an average error rate of 3.47% with a standard deviation of 2.82% is obtained for 115 MCI patients whose computed disease progression is stable or declining. The distribution of error rates for month 48 is shown in Fig. 2b for 69 patients, where the average error is 5.49% with a standard deviation of 4.55%. Fig. 3 illustrates the distribution of error rates of PReP-AD-MMSE for multiple time points with a boxplot graph. In Fig. 3 , the box generated for each time point represents the range of error rates from the first quartile to the third. The maximum and minimum values are marked with the horizontal black lines, and the median with a horizontal red line. The outliers, which are the points beyond 1.5 times of interquartile range (IQR) from the first and the third quartiles, are shown as plus signs in red.\nIn Table 2 , the percentage LOOCV error rate statistics, including the median, IQR and the number of outliers, are listed corresponding to the boxplot graph in Fig. 3 . From boxplot graph of PReP-AD-MMSE and from error rate statistics given in Table 2 , we observe that the error rate increases as time progresses, where the amount of increase from month 36 to 48 is the largest. In Fig. 4 , we plot disease progression results computed by PReP-AD-MMSE for three representative patients, chosen based on their different error rates. The MMSE scores reported in ADNI database are shown in pink, and the results computed by our PReP-AD-MMSE are marked in blue. In Fig. 4a , an average error rate of 1.9% is observed for patient 014-S-0169 whose disease progression is considered stable. In Fig. 4b , we obtain a slightly larger average error rate of 5.4% for patient 005-S-0572, who shows a declining cognitive ability in time. The largest error rate among the three chosen patients is patient 032-S-0978 with an average error rate of 12.2% as shown in Fig. 4c . For patient 032-S-0978, the decrease rate in MMSE scores is larger than the rate computed by PReP-AD-MMSE."}, {"section_title": "PReP-AD-HVL Results", "text": "For PReP-AD-HVL method, disease progression is computed for 175 MCI patients. Although gene expressions were available for all patients in ADNI database, only 26 MCI patients have hippocampal volume measurements. With Algorithm 2, we estimated disease progression for the patients without the volume measurements using genetic similarity between patients. With the exception of three patients, PReP-AD-HVL computes disease progression as either stable or decreasing for 172 patients. We consider the disease progression for a patient to be stable when the total hippocampal volume change is less than 30 mm 3 for a 12-month period. PReP-AD-HVL computed stable progression for 29 patients. Disease progression is considered to be relatively significant when the total hippocampal volume loss is larger than 80 mm 3 for 12 months, which was the case for 45 patients. For the remaining 98 patients, a moderate rate of decrease was computed by PReP-AD-HVL. In Fig. 5 , the histogram of percentage LOOCV error rates is illustrated for month 12, where an average error rate of 1.63% is observed with a standard deviation of 1.81% for 175 patients. The distribution of error rates of PReP-AD-HVL for months 6 and 12 are shown with the boxplot graph in Fig. 6 . Error rate statistics obtained from boxplot graph are listed in Table 2 . The IQR, which is presented as a box in Fig. 6 , is 0.74 and 1.48 for months 6 and 12, respectively. For PReP-AD-HVL method, examples of disease progression results are shown in Fig. 7 , where the hippocampal volume measurements from the database (average volume of left and right lobes) are in pink and the computed results are in blue. We calculate an error rate of 1.24% for patient 126-S-1187 as shown in Fig. 7a . In  Fig. 7b , LOOCV error rate is obtained as 3.37 % for patient 137-S-0668. A larger error rate of 7.14 % is shown with Fig. 7c for patient 128-S-0225."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "One can visualize the distribution of LOOCV error rates for PREP-AD methods using histograms (in Figs. 2 and 5 ) and boxplot graphs (in Figs. 3 and 6) . From histograms, we analyze the frequency of error rates and the characteristics of error distributions, such as skewness, which is a measure of asymmetry. For PReP-AD-MMSE method, the error rate distribution is shown in Fig. 2a for month 12 and in Fig. 2b for month 48. The uniformity of the distribution of error rates for month 48 compared to month 12 implies that the amount of increase in the error rates obtained from PReP-AD-MMSE vary as time progresses. In other words, for some patients (approximately half of them), the small error rates obtained at month 12 remain the same at month 48, whereas it increases in the range of 2% for remaining patients. In Fig. 5 , regarding to the small mean value and the positive skewness in the distribution of error rates, we can conclude that for most of the MCI patients we obtain smaller error rates with PReP-AD-HVL method. The shorter time period during which hippocampal volume measurements are collected may be one of the reasons for this smaller error rate.\nIn a boxplot graph [41] , a smaller IQR (i.e., a measure of spread) implies that the middle 50% of the dataset is closer to each other [42] . In Fig. 3 , the distributions of LOOCV error rates computed for MMSE scores from MCI patients are presented with boxplots for distinct months. Even though an increasing trend is observed from month 12 to 72 in the value of IQR, a larger value is observed for month 24 with respect to the next time point (i.e., month 36). It can be concluded from Fig. 3 that for a larger percentage of patients PReP-AD-MMSE computes higher error rates at month 24. In Fig. 6 , we generate boxplots for the distribution of error rates computed by PReP-AD-HVL. Even though the error distribution spread in a larger range at month 12, the number of patients with extreme error rates does not change in time, which implies that the results computed by PReP-AD-MMSE are consistent over time."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUDING REMARKS", "text": "In this paper we present PReP-AD methods which are built based on artificial intelligence computation techniques to investigate the impact of gene expressions on AD progression. In addition to expressions of the genes that affect AD-related protein biomarkers, PReP-AD methods make use of the change in MMSE scores and the rate of hippocampal volume loss over time as metrics for cognitive changes in MCI patients. Disease progression computed by PReP-AD-MMSE and PReP-AD-HVL methods based on MMSE scores and hippocampal volume loss are evaluated using our LOOCV based validation algorithm. We obtain an average error rate of 4.8% for PReP-AD-MMSE over a period of 72 months and 1.63% for PReP-AD-HVL over 12 months.\nThe consistency of the results is encouraging to employ artificial intelligence based methods to build decision support tools for the computation of AD progression. We are planning to extend our study to include the AD patients who are administered AD-related drugs to evaluate drug efficacy on disease progression."}]
