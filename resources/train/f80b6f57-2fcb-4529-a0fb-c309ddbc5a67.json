The result is wide variation in the costs of wheat production across growing areas, inherent in the diversity of inputs and production practices. These costs can affect the competitiveness of wheat with other crops in each region and the profitability of planting wheat.

Regional climatic differences across the United States accounted for much of the variation in the class of wheat grown, each with its own production practices and associated costs. Northern wheat producers, for example, chose spring wheat varieties that were harvested in the fall because winter wheat-planted in the fall for summer harvest-would be killed by the cold during its winter dormancy. Growers in areas with abundant rainfall were able to boost their yield potential by applying high rates of fertilizer. At the other extreme, some regions had areas so dry that costly irrigation was needed to produce a wheat crop."}, {"section_title": "Wheat Yields and Production Costs: Expected Versus Actual", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "National Overview", "text": "In 2009, the expected national average of combined operating and ownership costs was $4.00 per bushel of wheat versus an actual average of $4.75. The expected average U.S. yield was 47.7 bushels per acre, while the actual average yield was 40.2 bushels. The 2009 season average price (SAP, estimated annually by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service) was $4.87 per bushel. An analysis using expected yields (based on survey responses) and the 2009 SAP finds that 97 percent of U.S. farms would have covered their operating costs if they had met their expected yields and received the SAP of $4.87 per bushel, 77 percent would have covered both operating and ownership costs, and 34 percent would have covered their total costs. Fewer U.S. farmers covered their operating costs when the analysis considers actual or realized yields. If farmers, on average, had received the $4.87 SAP for the bushels they harvested in 2009, 79 percent of them would have covered their operating costs, 53 percent would have covered their ERS is a primary source of economic research and analysis from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, providing timely information on economic and policy issues related to agriculture, food, the environment,and rural America.

Actual yields and costs are typically lower than expected ones, but this may have been especially evident in 2009 because of adverse weather. In particular, an April freeze and severe drought in the Southern Plains region led to the abandonment of many wheat fields and sharply reduced output, resulting in high production costs per bushel for the region. Local statistics such as these are reflected, in turn, in national average yields and costs."}, {"section_title": "Regional Comparisons", "text": "In all five regions analyzed, the average yield of bushels per acre was fewer than expected and average production costs were higher. The discrepancies and the factors underlying them varied by region. North Central -Although the region's actual yield of 59.8 bushels per acre was well above the national average and the highest among the regions, it fell short of the expected 69.2 bushels. North Central had the lowest overall production costs among regions but the highest operating costs, driven by large input expenditures. Farmers in the region applied the most fertilizer, which acted in combination with the region's generous rainfall to promote high yields. Overall production costs were low because the high yields spread ownership costs over many harvested bushels of wheat. Southern Plains -The region had the largest discrepancies between expected and actual production costs ($3.80 versus $8.76) and yields per acre (37.5 bushels expected versus 16.3 realized). As noted, the Southern Plains were hit by a double weather disaster in 2009, an April freeze and severe drought, which sharply reduced the wheat harvest. Central Plains -The actual yield of the Central Plains-43.2 bushels per acre-was close to the expected yield of 47.6 bushels and to the national average, although actual production costs of $4.39 per bushel exceeded the $3.98 expectation. In 2009, the region's yield was almost three times higher than in the neighboring Southern Plains because of the freeze and drought in the south. Central Plains wheat yields are higher than Southern Plains yields even in a year of more normal weather because temperatures are not as high on the Central Plains and the risk of drought is less. Northern Plains -The Northern Plains had the highest expected production cost per bushel among the regions. Three-fourths of producers grew lower yielding spring wheat varieties. The region had relatively high expenses for fertilizer, as well as for herbicides and fungicides. The harvested yield (43.7 bushels) came close to the projected yield (45.5 bushels). Northwest -Although the Northwest region's actual yield of 59.5 bushels per acre fell short of its 67.0-bushel expectation, it was nearly tied with North Central for the highest yield, despite having lower rainfall. The Northwest's expected yields are high, in part, because it has the most irrigation, covering more than 20 percent of wheat acreage. With its relatively high yields, its actual production costs of $4.42 per bushel were below the national average despite the irrigation expense. About half the crop is soft wheat, which is given only low applications of nitrogen fertilizer to ensure the low protein levels for which it is grown."}, {"section_title": "How Was the Study Conducted?", "text": "The farm-level data for this paper were derived from USDA's annual Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) for 2009. The ARMS, based on a representative sampling of all U.S. farms, provides information on a broad range of issues about agricultural resource use, production practices, farm costs, and financial conditions and economic well-being of America's farm households. The ARMS collects data every 4-8 years for each commodity. The authors based their annual production cost estimates on data from the 2009 survey of the U.S. wheat sector. They arranged these estimates from the lowest production costs to the highest to form cumulative distributions. Two sets of cumulative farm distributions were calculated, one using expected yields and the other using actual yields. To provide some explanation for the discrepancies between expected and realized output and prices, the authors supplemented their regional data analyses with expert knowledge of regional conditions and wheat production practices."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This analysis of costs and returns for U.S. wheat producers is based on data collected in the winter of 2009-10 in USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) of wheat farms, which included production costs for the wheat crop harvested in 2009. The analysis of survey data uses both expected, or normal, yields and realized, or actual, yields. Expected yields reflect long-term trends based on normal conditions and are the yields that farmers use in planning input use, such as the quantity of fertilizer to apply. Realized yields are the crops that were actually harvested. This yield distinction is important because in 2009 an April freeze and a severe drought affected wheat production in the Southern Plains, especially in Texas. Yields were sharply reduced and in many cases were so low that fields were not harvested. These losses, due to both lower yields and abandoned acres, resulted in very high per bushel costs for the wheat harvested in the Southern Plains.

In the United States, wheat ranks third among field crops in both planted acreage and value of production, behind corn and soybeans. U.S. wheat area has varied widely during the past half-century, peaking in the early 1980s. Several factors have influenced the downward trend in wheat planting."}, {"section_title": "Policy Changes", "text": "Wheat area dropped off in the mid-1980s, primarily due to large Acreage Reduction Program (ARP) levels implemented when Government-owned stocks were very large ( fig. 1). 1 Wheat planting recovered in the late 1980s through mid-1990s as stocks declined and prices rose. The 1996 Farm Act eliminated ARP and introduced full planting flexibility, enabling farmers to switch to alternative crops without penalties. Planting flexibility increased competition for area among corn, oilseeds, and wheat, putting downward pressure on wheat planting, which was less profitable than planting other crops. Enrollment in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which encourages farmers to convert highly erodible cropland to environmentally beneficial uses, is concentrated in regions where wheat production predominates.  "}, {"section_title": "Changes in Production Practices and Technology", "text": "Wheat land has been switched to other uses as a result of changing technologies. For example, in western Kansas, the historical wheat/fallow rotation has commonly been replaced by a rotation of wheat/grain sorghum/fallow in which wheat is planted 1 year out of 3 instead of every other year. The increased use of water-conserving reduced-till and no-till farming has facilitated the planting of crops such as corn and soybeans, resulting in higher yields and profitability of these crops. Wheat acreage on the Plains has been further lost to corn and soybeans because of genetic modifications in those crops. New varieties of corn and soybeans can be planted farther west and north in areas with drier conditions or shorter growing seasons. Further, weed control is far easier with herbicide-resistant varieties of corn and soybeans. The pace of genetic modification has been slower for wheat, resulting in little growth in wheat yields, which can make wheat a less attractive cropping option for farmers ( fig. 2). The trend of planting corn and soybeans on acreage traditionally planted to wheat can be illustrated by data for Kansas and North Dakota, two of the country's largest wheat-producing States. In the early 1980s, wheat accounted for 80-90 percent of the total area of wheat, corn, and soybeans planted in Kansas and North Dakota. In recent years, wheat's share has dropped to 50-52 percent of the total ( fig. 3)."}, {"section_title": "Wheat Disease", "text": "Concerns about wheat disease in the Northern Plains, particularly scab (head blight) in North Dakota and Minnesota, have influenced planting decisions since the 1990s.

Wintertime temperature lows are a key determinant of whether winter or spring wheat is grown in a particular location. Winter wheat varieties are sown in the fall and usually become established before going into dormancy when winter cold arrives. The following spring, winter wheat plants resume growth until summertime harvest ( fig.  4). Winter wheat represents 70-80 percent of total U.S. wheat production.

Rainfall has a considerable impact on potential yields and production practices. In the eastern half of the country, rainfall is typically more than adequate to produce a wheat crop. With this relatively high rainfall comes a higher yield potential than in the Plains, provided adequate fertilizer is applied. In some arid areas in the West, rainfall is inadequate to produce a crop, necessitating irrigation if wheat is to be grown. Though costly, irrigation, along with adequate fertilizer application, sharply increases yields. Table 1 presents the highest yields achieved over the past 5 years for selected States. These data provide an indication of the yield potential under favorable weather conditions. Yields are higher in the more humid Midwest than in the semiarid West. In States where both winter and spring wheat are grown, winter wheat has the higher yield. Higher yields generally mean that machinery expenses can be spread over more bushels, reducing machinery costs per bushel. Machinery expenses are a key variable in regional differences in per bushel production costs. Fertilizer expenses are another key variable: farmers in the eastern half of the country use more fertilizer than Plains farmers and realize higher yields. Conversely, yield potential is less in the Plains, so fertilizer requirements are lower."}, {"section_title": "Nitrogen Fertilizer Requirements Vary by Class of Wheat", "text": "Five principal classes of wheat are grown in the United States (see box, \"U.S. Wheat Classes\"). The key difference among them for this discussion is protein content. Hard red winter (HRW), hard red spring (HRS), and durum wheat are used to make products that require high-protein flour. Soft red winter and soft white wheat are used to make products that require low-protein flour. These flour-protein requirements have implications for wheat producers, as protein production in wheat requires nitrogen. Producers of HRW, HRS, and durum wheat must make sure to apply enough nitrogen fertilizer to produce grain with adequate protein content for the products made from these wheat classes. Soft-wheat producers have the opposite concern; they need to limit nitrogen fertilizer applications to ensure a low-protein crop. This is particularly true for soft white wheat produced for export to Asia. In the Pacific Northwest, where both soft white spring and HRS wheat are produced, the nitrogen fertilizer application will be about 40 percent higher for the HRS crop to attain the same yield (Mahler and Guy, 2007). In addition, in areas of the Pacific Northwest where both HRW and HRS wheat are grown, nitrogen fertilizer application rates are more than 20 percent higher for HRS to get the same yield as HRW because of the shorter growing season for HRS (Stark, Mahler, and Tindall, 2004). During the growing season, microorganisms convert organic sources of nitrogen to inorganic nitrogen that can be utilized by the wheat plant. With spring wheat's shorter growing season, there is less total organic matter conversion to inorganic nitrogen. To compensate for the reduced conversion, a higher nitrogen fertilizer application rate must be used for spring wheat."}, {"section_title": "The Risk of Adverse Weather in Any One Year", "text": "Detrimental weather conditions, such as low rainfall or a late-spring freeze, can reduce wheat yields and raise realized per bushel production costs above expected levels.

Production of wheat classes tends to be region-specific (see National Association of Wheat Growers, 2012). The terms \"hard\" and \"soft\" refer to the texture of the starchy endosperm of the wheat kernel that is ground to produce wheat flour. Each class has a somewhat different end use. The five major classes of U.S. wheat are: \u2022 Hard red winter (HRW) wheat accounts for about 40 percent of total production and is grown primarily in the Great Plains (Texas north through Montana). HRW is a high-protein wheat that is principally used to make bread flour. \u2022 Hard red spring (HRS) wheat accounts for about 25 percent of production and grown primarily in the Northern Plains (North Dakota, Montana, Minnesota, and South Dakota). HRS wheat is valued for high protein levels that make it suitable for specialty breads, pasta, and blending with lower protein HRW wheat for loaf bread. \u2022 Soft red winter (SRW) wheat accounts for 15 to 20 percent of total production, is grown primarily in States along the Mississippi River and in the eastern States. SRW flour is used for cakes, cookies, crackers, and other wheat products made from low-protein flour. \u2022 Soft white wheat, which accounts for 10 to 15 percent of total production, is grown in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Michigan, and New York. Its flour is used for cakes, cookies, crackers, and other wheat products made from low-protein flour. \u2022 Durum wheat, accounting for 3 to 5 percent of total production, is grown primarily in North Dakota and Montana and is used to produce pasta. These different classes of wheat are used to make different products, based in part on their protein content. The protein in wheat flour turns into gluten when the flour is made into dough, and the proteins absorb water and are pulled and stretched in the kneading process. As the proteins are worked, they become long, flexible strands. The yeast added to the dough produces gases, mostly carbon dioxide, which is trapped by these strands, causing the dough to expand or rise. Leavened bread products require more flour than products like cookies and crackers. Figures 7 and 8 show that wheat yields and harvest-to-planted ratios in the Southern Plains States of Texas and Oklahoma are lower and more variable than in the rest of the country. The rate of abandonment is typically higher in these States than elsewhere in the country because part of the crop is used as pasture when grazing is more profitable than harvesting the grain. The use as pasture increases as adverse weather reduces wheat yields. The graphs also show the impact of adverse weather on yields and rates of acreage abandonment in Texas and Oklahoma in 2009, the year of the ARMS used in this study. Wheat producers in these two Southern Plains States were severely impacted in 2009 by a spring freeze and drought.

Ownership costs include repairs, the annualized cost of maintaining the capital investment (depreciation and interest) in farm machinery, equipment, and facilities, and property taxes and insurance. Ownership costs do not need to be covered in one crop cycle but will have to be covered in the medium-term for the farm to remain profitable. Opportunity costs reflect the loss of potential gains from alternative opportunities when one alternative is chosen. They can include unpaid labor for the time spent by a farmer in the production of a commodity, the rental rate of the land (should the farmer have chosen to rent the land to another producer), and the enterprise share of general farm overhead. General farm overhead includes the expenses for items such as farm supplies, marketing containers, hand tools, power equipment, maintenance and repair of farm buildings, farm utilities, and general business expenses that cannot be directly attributed to a single farm enterprise. Costs of general farm overhead items are allocated to each commodity produced on the farm based on its relative contribution to total farm operating margin (i.e., value of production less operating costs).

The cumulative distributions are evaluated using the national SAP for wheat of $4.87 per bushel for the 2009/10 marketing year. The national SAP is used for the comparison with costs because actual prices received are not collected by the survey, which is completed before all the grain has been marketed. Only part of the wheat is marketed at harvest. Much is stored in anticipation of a price rise after a harvest-time low. Some grain is never marketed but is used as feed by the farmer.

Most farmers budget their input expenditures, for example, the quantity of fertilizer to apply, based on their expected yield for the growing season. Expected yields avoid the complications of unusually favorable or unfavorable weather events. Table 3 shows the wide variation in regional yields, both expected and actual, in 2009. There is greater regional variation in actual yields than in expected yields. At the national level, the total of operating and ownership costs was $4.00 per bushel, using expected or normal yields. Of this total, operating costs were 60 percent and ownership costs were 40 percent. Fertilizer expenditures and capital recovery for machinery were the two largest cost items. The following regional analyses elaborate on the data in table 3. North Central Region. This region represents 9 percent of wheat-planted area in the United States. Wheat production practices there are geared to achieving the benefits of crop rotation and to producing straw for livestock bedding in addition to grain output. The North Central region reports the lowest per bushel total operating and ownership costs, $3.47, despite having the highest regional operating cost. The operating cost-$2.56 per bushel versus an average of $2.41 per bushel for all farms in the ARMS-is driven by per acre fertilizer and seed expenditures that are more than double the all-farm average. Fertilizer costs are much higher here than elsewhere because abundant moisture allows for a high-yield potential. To take full advantage of this potential, farmers apply more fertilizer than in other regions. Seed costs are high compared with other regions because North Central farmers purchase wheat seed from a dealer every year instead of using wheat saved from the previous year. Most of the region's farmers are small wheat producers whose individual wheat seedings are too small to justify the storage and cleaning facilities needed for \"farmer-saved\" seed wheat. The larger wheat producers elsewhere in the country have enough acreage to make saving wheat seed economically worthwhile. The North Central's higher operating costs are offset by very low ownership costs per bushel of expected yield, $0.91. Because the high yields spread the ownership costs over many more bushels of harvested wheat, these costs are the lowest among all the regions. Northern Plains. The largest wheat growing region in the United States, the Northern Plains accounts for 41 percent of all land planted to wheat. The Northern Plains has high production costs per bushel, with the highest ownership costs and the second highest operating costs. These high costs are due in part to low yields. The average expected yield from the survey for this region is the next to lowest among the regions, with only the Southern Plains yield lower. About 75 percent of Northern Plains wheat is of lower yielding, spring wheat varieties. Compared with the North Central region, moisture supplies are lower, reducing yield potential. Fertilizer and chemical inputs account for the largest share of operating cost expenditures in this region. Fertilizer expenditures by Northern Plains producers are about equal to the national average but higher than the Central and Southern Plains, which grow only winter wheat. As noted, the shorter growing season of spring wheat requires a higher nitrogen fertilizer application rate.  The higher chemical expenditures for the Northern Plains region are associated in part with the more humid spring-wheat producing areas, where there is greater use of fungicides because of a higher incidence of disease. Spring wheat producers also have higher herbicide expenses because of multiple applications to control weeds; 20 to 40 percent of the spring wheat acreage is sprayed with an herbicide before planting. In general, both the Northern Plains and Northwest spring wheat producers have more severe weed problems than producers in other regions. Southern Plains. Like the North Central region, the Southern Plains represents about 9 percent of wheat-planted area in the United States. The Southern Plains region's total expected operating and ownership costs per bushel are lower than the national average but still significantly above the North Central region's costs. The Southern Plains has the lowest expected yield among all the regions because of limited moisture supplies in its semiarid parts. In addition, high temperatures during the growing season accelerate the maturity of the crop, which limits yield potential. With low expected yields, fertilizer expenditures per bushel are the second lowest among the regions, only about half of the North Central's expenditures. However, the region has the highest expenditures per bushel for custom operations and fuel, lube, and electricity, and total operating costs per bushel for Southern Plains producers are equal to the national average. Ownership costs per bushel in the Southern Plains are the second lowest among the regions, after North Central. However, because of the low yields, the Southern Plains ownership costs are still 50 percent above North Central costs. Central Plains. The Central Plains is the second largest wheat-growing region in the United States, representing 28 percent of all land planted to wheat. Its total per bushel operating and ownership costs are nearly equal to the national average. The ownership costs are slightly above the national average and the operating costs slightly below. The expected Central Plains yield is nearly equal to the national average. It is significantly higher than the Southern Plains, despite parts of the region being semiarid. Temperatures during the growing season are typically not as high as on the Southern Plains, and the risk of drought is less. Operating cost expenditures by input categories are each only slightly more or less than the national average. Northwest. The Northwest region accounts for 13 percent of all wheat-planted land in the United States. Total per bushel operating and ownership costs there are lower than the national average because of higher yields, while operating costs are nearly the same as the national average. The Northwest region's expected yield is the second highest, nearly as high as the North Central's, despite low rainfall. In part, this is because more than 20 percent of the region is irrigated, much more than in any other region. Wheat yields in the region are also boosted by relatively cooler temperatures during the growing season than in the Southern Plains, for example. Despite much higher yields in the Northwest than in the Northern Plains, fertilizer expenses are only slightly higher. About half of the Northwest's wheat crop is soft wheat. To keep protein levels low, less nitrogen fertilizer is applied than with a hard wheat crop. The Northern Plains does not grow soft wheat. Because the Northwest produces spring wheat, chemical costs are higher, especially for herbicides. Both the Northwest and the Northern Plains regions have higher chemical costs per bushel than the Central, Southern Plains, and North Central regions where winter wheat is grown. Seed costs are second only to the North Central's high because of the Northwest's higher use of certified seed. Fuel, lube, and electricity expenditures in the Northwest are above the national average, partly because this region leads the others in irrigation, for which these inputs are required."}, {"section_title": "Impacts of Adverse Weather in the Southern Plains, 2009", "text": "The realized yields achieved in 2009 reflect the impact of regional weather conditions, especially of the spring freeze and the drought that occurred in the Southern Plains. On average, producers in the Southern Plains expect wheat yields of 37.5 bushels per planted acre; the actual yield on the Southern Plains averaged only 16.3 bushels. Because of these low yields, 36 percent of the planted acres in the region were not harvested. Had more acres been harvested, actual yield in comparison with expected yield would have been even lower. We have classified each region's producers into one of two cost categories relative to the national level. Cost is defined here as cost per bushel, with yield (expected or realized) based on planted area. The cost categories are: \u2022 Low cost: producers whose operating and ownership costs per bushel are in the lowest 25 percent of all producers. \u2022 High cost: producers whose operating and ownership costs per bushel are in the highest 25 percent of all producers. Figure 13 shows each region's share of low-cost producers with expected yields and realized yields. "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "An analysis of the 2009 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data shows that most wheat producers would have covered all operating costs if yields were normal and they had received the 2009/10 season average price (SAP) of $4.87 per bushel. The $4.87 SAP covers about three-fourths of the sum of both operating and ownership costs and about a third of total costs. The comparison of these costs with the 2009 SAP is an aggregate analysis of U.S. wheat production costs. The price that individual wheat producers received in the 2009/10 marketing year depended upon many factors, including class of wheat grown, distance from principal markets, timing of sales during the marketing year, and any quality premiums or discounts received. Regional climatic differences help explain the variation in costs across the country. The two largest cost items were fertilizer expenditures and capital recovery for machinery. These two cost items played important roles in making the wheat producers in the North Central region the lowest cost producers and the Northern Plains producers the highest cost producers. The relatively high yields in the humid North Central region allowed producers to spread their fixed machinery costs over many more bushels, so per bushel machinery costs were the lowest in the country. The spring wheat producers in the semiarid Northern Plains had relatively low yields, both because of moisture shortages and of the cold winters that force them to grow spring wheat varieties, which have high per bushel nitrogen fertilizer requirements. The low yields in the Northern Plains result in high machinery costs per bushel, which, added to the high nitrogen fertilizer requirement, makes Northern Plains wheat the most expensive to produce. The 2009 ARMS also captured the devastating cost consequences of the spring freeze and drought in the Southern Plains. The low yields and abandoned fields sharply raised per bushel costs in that region. Despite the loss of production in the Southern Plains in 2009, the United States still produced 2.5 billion bushels of wheat, slightly above the average of 2.2 billion bushels for the most recent 5 years. Because wheat is grown in most regions of the country, it is unlikely that wheat producers everywhere in the country will be adversely affected by a single weather event."}]
