It is a semi-enclosed basin connected to the Indian Ocean through the Bab-al-Mandeb Strait at the south and to the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal at the north. The bathymetry is highly irregular along the basin, with a relatively shallow mean depth (524 m; (Patzert, 1974) , but with maximum recorded depths of almost 3.000 m. At its northern end, it bifurcates into two gulfs, the Gulf of 45 Suez on the West with an average depth of 40 m and the Gulf of Aqaba on the East with depths exceeding 1.800 m (Neumann and McGill, 1961) .\nThe transport through the Suez Canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Gulf of Suez and the Red Sea, is relatively small, and therefore, the only significant connection between the Red Sea and the global ocean is the Strait of Bab-al-Mandeb (Sofianos et al., 2015) . Due to its arid setting, the Red Sea 50 experiences one of the largest evaporation rates in the world, which in combination with its semi-enclosed nature leads to high salinities across the whole basin (Sofianos et al., 2015) . The hydrodynamic characteristics are strongly influenced by the wind forcing with different seasonality. The seasonal winds blow south-eastwards in the northern part of the basin through the whole year, but in the southern region, the winds reverse form north-westerly in summer to south-easterly in winter under the influence of the 55 two distinct phases of the Arabian monsoon, (Patzert, 1974; Sofianos, 2015) .\nThe Red Sea holds one of the most diverse marine ecosystems in the world, although fragile and vulnerable to ocean warming (Thorne et al., 2010) . Water temperature plays a key role in ecosystems evolution, which are usually adapted to the environmental thermal range. Marine species respond to ocean warming by shifting their distribution poleward and advancing their phenology (Poloczanska et al., 60 2016) . While parts of the ocean may be warming gradually, others may experience rapid fluctuations, inducing more significant impacts on biodiversity. Impacts of warming are likely to be greatest in semienclosed seas, which tend to support warming rates higher than the global ones (Lima and Wethey, 2012) , as documented for the Red Sea (Chaidez et al., 2017) .\nSeveral recent studies have analysed the spatiotemporal evolution of the temperature in the Red Sea using 65 satellite data from AVHRR (Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer), thus focusing only on the surface layer and covering from early 1980's onwards. Those studies have identified a warming trend with values ranging from 0.17 \u00baC decade-1 to 0.45 \u00baC decade-1 across the basin for the period 1982-2015 (Chaidez et al., 2017) . Also, sea surface temperature exhibits a strong interannual variability (Eladawy et al., 2017) which is mainly driven by the air temperature (Raitsos et al., 2011) . However, these studies are 70 limited to ~30 years due to the observational period of remote data. Also, although the evolution of surface conditions is very relevant, the temperature variability in the whole water column has effects on marine biota (Bongaerts et al., 2010) , so products based on depth-resolving in situ observations better reflect the thermal regime across the ecosystem than sea surface trends alone.\nGlobal hydrographic products like EN4 (Good et al., 2013) or ISHII (Ishii and Kimoto, 2009 ) that 75 interpolate in-situ observations to create a monthly 3D product for the last decades are available.\nHowever, those products have low spatial resolution (~1\u00ba) and the quality controls applied are not region specific, which cast doubts on their accuracy in the narrow Red Sea.

The product covers the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden with a spatial resolution of 0.25\u00b0x 0.25\u00b0. This product is based on the assimilation and 85 reanalysis of a large number of in situ observations collected in the region. After a specific quality control, a mapping algorithm has been applied to homogenize the data. Also, an estimate of the accuracy of the product has been generated to accurately define the uncertainties of the product.

However, the objective quality control process was originally tuned for the 140 global ocean, therefore requiring an additional review of the profiles inside the region of interest by a visual quality control.\nFirst, we have reviewed all the profiles to remove spikes, out layers and density inversions. In a second step, we have checked the consistency between the CORA profiles and the profiles collected by KAUST, which are considered to be more reliable as they have been thoroughly analysed by the KAUST data 145 centre with specific criteria adapted to the region. That assessment has been performed separating the Red Sea profiles (North and South regions in Figure 1 ) from the profiles obtained south of the Bab-al-Mandeb strait, (Outer region, see Figure 1 ).\nAll the profiles in both regions are shown in (Figure 2) , along with the 1st and 99th quantiles of the KAUST profiles (only inside the Red Sea, black lines). It can be seen that two different regimes appear 150 inside the Red Sea and are clearly identifiable by the temperatures below 500 m. Those profiles with temperatures colder than 20\u00baC below 500 m show a behaviour which is typical of the outside region, while such pronounced cooling with depth is absent from the KAUST profiles. Thus, those profiles are probably misplaced inside the Red Sea, which coldest temperatures at depth exceeds 20 \u00baC, were rejected.\nFor the rest of the profiles, those lying outside a range defined by three times the standard deviation (blue 155 lines in Figure 2 ) are also rejected. Considering the number of observations per month (Figure 3) , we can see that it remained almost constant 170 through the year in the Southern zone. In contrast, the Northern region is more density sampled in summer, reaching up to more than 1000 observations in July, with roughly 500 observations on average per month during the rest of the year.

Thus, before the OI algorithm is applied, a data thinning is performed using a K-means algorithm. This clustering technique 225 divides the whole set observations into a predefined number of clusters (Camus et al., 2011) .

Therefore, it is useful to have a first-order estimate of the accuracy of the formal error estimates. To do so we perform a 255 test using synthetic data from GLORYS outputs. That is, we extract pseudo-observations from GLORYS temperature fields, apply the mapping algorithm as defined above and compare the outputs with the original model fields to obtain the \"true\" errors. Figure 7a shows the time evolution of the RMS difference between the GLORYS outputs and the background (\u221a\u03c3 2 ) averaged per vertical levels, where the std of the errors in the background field was used as an estimate of the error in the temperature field. 260\nThis is an important quantity as it defines the baseline error that our product has in places/times when no observations are available. Error estimates are largest at 125 m depth, with a clear seasonality in the upper layers. Below 300 m the background errors decrease well below 1\u00baC, except in some periods at 1000 m in which GLORYS data show strong deep anomalies.

At 125 m the averaged background error is 1.12 \u00baC, with minimum values in the central Red Sea (0.5\u00baC) and maximum values in the Gulf of Aden (~1.5\u00baC), where interannual variability is more important and the climatological background is less representative of the temperature field. Figure 7b shows the time evolution of the RMS error of the analysed temperature field is presented. Although the main features seen in the background errors are present, it is clear to that 270 using OI improves the estimate of the temperature field compared with the use of climatology, with a reduction rate ranging from 1.3 to 1.6 (i.e. errors reduced between 30% and 60%). The RMS error maps at 7 m show the averaged value to be reduced to 0.44 \u00baC, and in most areas the reduction rate is larger than 1.5.

As usual in gridded products, the accuracy of TEMPERSEA is directly linked to the density of in situ profiles, which 455 is rather heterogeneous in space and time. Therefore, us of the TEMPERSEA product should take into account the uncertainty estimates. Our comparison of the formal error estimates and direct estimates based on synthetic experiments suggest that the uncertainty estimates, both at grid point level and for the basin averages, are accurate and are a good indicator of the reliability of the product at a given time/location. 460 This is especially relevant when long term trends are to be computed. The mapping procedure is a combination of the information provided by the background and by the observations. In cases when/where no observations are available the analysis tends to the background information, which is a monthly climatology that does not change from year to year. This fact artificially damps the estimates of long-term trends (e.g. Llasses, Jord\u00e0, & Gomis, 2015) , so a careful treatment is needed. Our approach has 465 been to compute trends using only those months that have enough observations (i.e. identified as those with formal error below a certain threshold). Alternatively, (Good et al., 2013) , use the analysis of the precedent month as the background field. This allows the propagation of long-term changes and may produce a better estimate of the long-term trends. However, it also may induce spurious trends if sustained periods without observations exist (i.e. several years), so this approach should be careful 470 explored in future analyses of TEMPERSEA.\nAnother interesting feature of the uncertainty estimate is that it allows identification of sampling strategies that have led in the past to high accuracies, and thus that could be used to guide future monitoring efforts of Red Sea temperatures. The formal error decreases with the number of observations, but the spatial distribution of the observations also plays an important role. In TEMPERSEA more than 475 https://doi.org/10.5194/os-2019-66 Preprint. Discussion started: 11 July 2019 c Author(s) 2019. CC BY 4.0 License. 70 months in which the error is as low as 0.1\u00baC with less than 10 observations have been identified (Figure 21 ). Conversely, in some months with intensive campaigns more than 500 profiles have been collected, but the formal error did not decrease further. The reason for this is that observations separated less than the typical correlation length scale (i.e. the spatial scale of the process dominating the temperature variability) provide redundant information. On the other hand, we have identified months in 480 which, surprisingly, no observations were gathered in the Red Sea. As mentioned before this represents a serious limitation to accurately quantify long term changes. Therefore, if the goal is to characterize the climatic evolution of the Red Sea temperature an optimized sampling should be designed to minimize the number of required profiles, with approximately less than 10 profiles needed per month. However, this should be repeated monthly, or at least seasonally, to ensure the continuity of the record and to reduce the 485 noise in the long-term change estimates. TEMPERSEA has allowed to characterize the 3D variability of the temperature field in the Red Sea and 490 the adjacent Arabian Sea, which show a different behavior. In the Red Sea most variability is induced by surface processes with little variability at intermediate or deep layers. Conversely, in the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea the influence of lateral advection seems to play an important role in inducing a shift in the seasonal cycle and large interannual variations in subsurface layers. In order to get a deeper insight in the role of the atmosphere in the sea temperature variations, we analysed air temperatures at 1000 495 mbars (representative of air in contact with sea surface) and 850 mbars (representative of air masses not directly affected by air-sea interactions). In particular we used the output from the JRA55 atmospheric reanalysis for the period 1958 -2014 (HARADA et al., 2015 , and extend it with the output from the NCEP reanalysis (Kanamitsu et al., 2002) for the period 2014-2017. Before merging both datasets we ensured homogeneity in terms of mean and variance during the common period. The air temperatures 500 have been averaged over the Red Sea and the outer region and compared with the sea temperatures at different layers. In order to isolate the interannual variations we have removed the multidecadal variations using a 10-year moving average high-pass filter.\nIn the Red Sea the results show a very good correlation between air temperature at 1000 mbar and temperatures at the sea surface and in the 0-100 m layer (correlations of 0.78 and 0.81, respectively; see 505 Figure 22 and Table 2 ). When air temperature at 850 mbar is used, the correlations decrease but are still high (0.68 and 0.69, respectively). This means that most interannual variations in the upper layer of the Red Sea can be explained by large scale changes in air temperature. A non-negligible part (~15% of the variance) can be attributed to air-sea interactions. The effects of atmosphere variability are also detected in the intermediate layer, where the correlation is 0.45. no statistically significant correlations were found 510 in the deeper layers. Concerning the Gulf of Aden, the correlation between air and sea temperatures is lower and restricted to the upper layer (see Table 2 ). This reinforces the hypothesis that lateral advection plays an important role in driving the interannual variations of temperature in the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. Finally, multidecadal changes have been assessed with the TEMPERSEA product showing a nonnegligible contribution to temperature variability. This is an important result for the interpretation of long term trends. Linear trends are often computed as an indicator of potential influence of global warming. 525\nHowever, the trends can be masked by low frequency variations when their period is comparable to the length of the record (Jord\u00e0, 2014) . This is clear for the temperature records in the Red Sea derived from the TEMPERSEA product. For instance, our results suggest that sea temperature in the upper layer, in the 1960's was similar to the present values, so a very small positive trend is obtained when the period 1958-2017 is used, consistent with recent evidence of long-term thermal oscillations in the Red Sea (Krokos et 530 al., 2019) . therefore easily misinterpreted as linked to global warming. Hence, the conclusions, based on satellite records, that the Red Sea is warming at rates faster than the global ocean (Chaidez et al., 2017; Raitsos et 535 al., 2011) , based on the satellite record, need be reconsidered, as warming rates retrieved for 1958-2017 with the TEMPERSEA product are 10 fold lower than those retrieved from satellite records covering the past 30 years."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "An observational based high resolution and homogeneous 3D temperature product has been developed for 540 the Red Sea for the period 1958-2017 (TEMPERSEA product). For that, two databases of in-situ observations (CORA and KAUST) were merged and quality-controlled, resulting in a dataset of 41713 profiles (11191 in the Red Sea and 30522 in the Gulf of Aden). A mapping procedure based on optimal interpolation has been applied to those profiles to compute two gridded products: a 12-month climatology and a 60-year monthly product. In order to calibrate the algorithm, synthetic data from a realistic 545 numerical model have been used. Furthermore, the formal error from optimal interpolation have been computed and has proven to be a good approximation to actual uncertainty. The TEMPERSEA product is available from the open data repository Pangea (Agulles et al. 20191).\nThe product has been compared to satellite observations for the period 1981-2017 showing reasonable agreement in terms of spatial and temporal variability at monthly, seasonal and interannual scales. Also, 550 very good agreement has been found between air temperatures from the atmospheric reanalyses and reconstructed sea temperatures for the whole period 1958-2017, enhancing the confidence on the quality of the product.\nThe TEMPERSEA product allowed us to characterize the climatology of the temperature in the region. In the Red Sea, the maximum temperatures are found south of 20\u00b0N, while the minimum is found in the 555 northern part. Regarding to the seasonal cycle, it peaks in August and is minimum in February. The seasonal cycle is larger in the northern part while in the southern part is smaller in terms of the thermal range in surface waters. In the Gulf of Aden, the phase and shape of the seasonal cycle is different with maximum values in May and minimum values in August. Related to the vertical structure of the temperature field, our results show a large difference between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, 560 specially below the depth of the Bab-El-Mandeb Strait. The Strait isolates the Red Sea allowing it to have temperatures above 20\u00baC in the whole water column, while the Gulf of Aden, influenced by the open ocean variability show a vertical structure typical of the Indian Ocean, with temperatures reaching 5\u00baC at 1000 m depth. Furthermore, the length of the product has allowed to characterize multidecadal variability at different layers. Our results show that multidecadal variations have been important in the past and can 565 bias high the trends computed from 30-40 years of data.\nTEMPERSEA provides a reference product to describe the temporal evolution of the 3D temperature field in the Red Sea and to calibrate/validate numerical models. This will allow to improve forecasting models and formulate more reliable predictions and climate projections. It has also been shown that the quality of the product is critically linked to the existence of in situ observations. Periods with few 570\nobservations degrade the quality of the product, so it is important to keep a regular monitoring of the region in order to identify new changes and to remove uncertainties in the climate studies. TEMPERSEA provides a basis to design an optimal sampling program to track the thermal dynamics of the Red Sea. Our results suggest that an effective monitoring can be achieved with few, strategically located, observations. 575"}]
