[{"section_title": "", "text": "accountability in a variety of ways; to the extent that the student achievement tests are aligned to the content standards, accountability should add to the influence of the content standards on teachers' instructional practices and ultimately, student achievement.\nAn aligned education system has been extended to include aligned professional development and instructional materials. No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation, now up for reauthorization, puts standards-based reform into law, requiring among other things that each state publish challenging, grade-specific academic content standards in English/language arts and mathematics in Grades 3 through 8 and at least one grade in high school and content standards in science in at least one grade level for elementary, middle, and high school. NCLB also requires that states have aligned student achievement testing at the same grade levels and subjects and that they use the results to hold their schools accountable. Although NCLB has increased requirements for standards-based reform, the basic tenets were well articulated in the prior reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Act of 1994 and Goals 2000.\nThe United States is a country of states' rig hts in education, so NCLB is clear that the federal government is not to be involved in the setting of content standards or the creation of NCLB assessments. Each state sets its own content standards and uses its own student achievement tests, except for those states in special cooperatives such as the New England Common Assessment Program. During the Clinton administration and Goals 2000, there was an attempt to create voluntary national standards and assessments that would imply a national intended curriculum, but this attempt fell short. The state-bystate system was upheld. In spite of the methods by which content standards are set, which ensure that there is no de jure national curriculum, some have suggested that content standards are so similar across states as to define a de facto national curriculum (e.g., Hogan, 1992) . Nevertheless, there is little recent empirical evidence to either support or contradict this claim.\nThe purpose here is to investigate similarities and differences among states' content standards to examine the extent to which there exists a de facto national intended curriculum in the United States as represented by the standards. The extent to which teachers teach the content in a state's standards is an important policy question as well (e.g., Freeman et al., 1983 ), but it is not addressed here. The analysis described here includes state content standards in English/language arts and reading (ELAR) and state and national professional content standards in mathematics and science. The focus is on grades K through 8. The investigation could have considered the alignment among state tests of student achievement or the alignment among textbooks. Investigations of that type have been undertaken in the past (Freeman et al., 1983; Freeman & Porter, 1989) . Nevertheless, given the purpose of content standards in standards-based reform and recognizing that content standards are published statements of what teachers are to teach and students are to learn, content standards seems a good place to start in investigating the possibility of a de facto national curriculum. Furthermore, if student achievement tests are truly aligned to state content standards as they are required to be, then what is found for the standards would apply to the achievement tests.\nOf course, regardless of standards, teachers may all essentially teach the same thing no matter what their state's content standards specify. The possibility of a de facto national curriculum as evidenced by teachers' instructional practices is an important question but beyond the scope of the work reported here. There has been one investigation of the similarities and differences across states of teachers' instructional practices in mathematics, and the alignment among states in instructional practices was substantial (Porter, 2002) . That investigation did not consider the alignment of content standards across states, as is considered here. Furthermore, all analyses in that investigation used data from prior to 2002, whereas all of those analyzed here are since 2003. Thus, this article represents the first ana lysis using the Surveys of Enacted Curriculum alignment measure of the extent to which standards in mathematics, science, and English/language arts and reading are similar or different across states."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Relatively few investigations of the alignment among state content standards have been undertaken. Reys and colleagues (2007) considered mathematics grade-level expectations (GLEs) in 10 states at the fourth-grade level. They found that most of the 108 total GLEs across the documents were concentrated in just a few states-26% of GLEs were found in 1 state only, and less than a third of the GLEs were found in 6 or more states. In a larger analysis of mathematics standards in 42 states at Grades 3 through 7, Reys (2006) found that the documents varied substantially on grain size (specific vs. general), expected cognitive demand, and grade placement/sequencing. Reys suggested that the degree of alignment among state GLEs had important implications for the development of textbooks, teacher preparation, and comparisons of student achievement.\nIn an earlier examination of the standardsetting process for mathematics and science content standards, Blank et al. (1997) found that \"expectations differ [ed] markedly by state\" (p. v). Stan dards documents differed most notably in terms of specificity, with some standards narrowly focused and others more general. The report also noted that many states had aligned at least their broad categories in mathematics with Nat ional Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) standards and that broad categories were more similar in mathematics than in science. Still, the authors suggested that content standards had the potential to focus the curriculum and that standards documents generally were indicative of a push for higher level thinking and decreased differentiation across ability levels.\nA group of international comparative experts (Schmidt et al., 2001) intensively studied the mathematics and science curriculum documents in dozens of Trends in International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) countries and in multiple states in the United States. The authors found that, especially in mathematics but also in science, America's content standards were incoherent-not focused on big ideas but rather laundry lists of smaller topics-both among sta tes and within states over grades (Schmidt, Wang, & McKnight, 2005) . Furthermore, the content standards were classified as unfocused, repetitive, and unchallenging relative to the other nations in the study. To what extent these claims were true across individual states was not a focus of the analysis. Nevertheless, the most resounding statement offered in the research was the now-familiar claim that the U.S. curriculum was like the Missouri River-a mile wide and an inch deep.\nOther organizations have also examined state content standards for \"quality,\" generally finding large differences. The Fordham Foundation has rated states' content standards in multiple subjects; their most recent summary of these reports graded states in five subjects, with grades ranging from A to F . That five states earned an A in English and four an F suggests that state standards documents differ, at least on the dimensions prized by Fordham (ratings varied just as widely in mathematics and science). The report also suggested that the reason for its finding that the quality of state mathematics standards was not related to state National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) gains was that most state math standards were aligned to the NCTM standards, as was the NAEP framework. The American Federation of Teachers (2001) also reviewed state content standards, finding that more states had difficulty setting clear and specific content standards in English than in mathematics and science. The Council for Basic Education found that the rigor of states' mathematics and English/language arts standards varied considerably across states (Joftus & Berman, 1998) . In short, no matter the criterion, it appears that findings from extant research suggest that state content standards differ.\nTo some, the finding of variation across states in content standards prompts a clear solutionthere should be at least voluntary national content standards (and by extension, national assessments of student achievement; e.g., Ravitch, 1996) . The calls for national standards have been around at least since George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton pushed for voluntary national standards during the 1990s (Jennings, 1998; Ravitch, 1995) . Such calls are also being heard today as NCLB nears reauthorization. There are arguments both in favor of and in opposition to the idea of national standards in education. This article does not make claims as to whether a national curriculum, de facto or de jure, would be a net positive or a net negative for the United States. Still, it is useful to have an empirical consideration of the extent to which content standards are currently alike so that an informed discussion about the merits of the 50-state, 50-standard system can be had.\nThis study contributes to the literature in several key ways. First, few studies have examined English/language arts, mathematics, and science in an analysis of state-to-state alignment. The techniques used in this study allow for direct comparison among the content areas in a way that has not been done before. Furthermore, none of the aforementioned studies used one of the commonly used content analysis tools such as the Webb alignment procedure (Webb, 2002) or the Surveys of Enacted Curriculum (Porter, 2002) this study will be the first to do so. The data used in the study allow for comparisons of state standards with national professional standards, an important issue that has been hinted at in the literature but not fully investigated. The data also allow for comparisons across grades within states as a way to measure the redundancy of content standards."}, {"section_title": "Framework", "text": "A framework for thinking about standardsbased reform and how it might best be designed hypothesizes that standards-based reform will be more influential on teachers' instructional practices and ultimately student learning to the extent that the policies making up standardsbased reform are (a) specific as to their message to teachers about what they are to teach, (b) con sistent (aligned) among themselves so that teachers receive a coherent message, and (c) having authority and (d) power. Policies can have auth ority to the extent they are developed and promoted by experts, officially adopted by the state, consistent with standard practice, and promoted by charismatic individuals. Policies have power to the extent that compliance with the policy is rewarded while failure to comply is sanctioned. Finally, (e) policies are more influential to the extent that they are kept in place over time (stability; Porter, Floden, Freeman, Schmidt, & Schwille, 1988) . To a considerable extent NCLB is consistent with this framework by calling for ambitious state content standards that are grade-level specific, having student achievement tests aligned to the content standards, and holding schools accountable for student performance on the achievement test. NCLB has now been in place for 5 years, though its requirements have been phased in over time, with some of them not yet fully implemented, so its stability will increase over time.\nThe research questions to be addressed arise out of the framework and the literature described previously. From the importance of consistency in standards-based reform comes the question: (1) The Content Determinants Group developed a three-dimensional language for describing what teachers might teach in elementary school mathematics. One dimension was specific mathematical topics; another was distinguished by computational procedures, memorization, or app lication; and a third specified mode of presentation (e.g., text vs. pictures and graphs). Over time, the content language was modified and generalized. In a National Science Foundationfunded project, \"Reform Up Close,\" the language was generalized to science, the third dimension was dropped, and the first two dimensions modified. The Council of Chief State School Officers, State Collaboratives on Assessment and Student Standards (CCSSO/SCASS) has used these content languages and extended them by developing a language for English/language arts and reading. To date, more than 30 states have participated in the CCSSO/SCASS work using the languages to investigate their content standards, student achievement tests, and instructional practices.\nThe content language for each subject is divided into general areas. In mathematics there are 16 general areas (e.g., operations, measurement, basic algebra), and each general area is divided into between 4 and 19 specific topics, for a total of 217 specific topics. Crossed with topics, the language has five levels of cognitive demand: memorize, perform procedures, demonstrate understanding, conjecture/generalize/prove, and solve novel problems/make connections. (See appendix for definitions of cognitive demand.) In ELAR there are 14 general areas (e.g., phonemic awareness, comprehension) with between 5 and 16 specific topics each, for a total of 163 specific topics. The levels of cognitive demand are: memorize, perform procedures, generate, analyze, and evaluate. In science, there are 27 general areas with 4 to 12 specific topics each, for a total of 211 specific topics. The levels of cognitive demand are: memorize, perform procedures, communicate understanding, analyze information, and apply concepts/make connections. The content languages can be used to do analyses of content standards, assessments, curriculum materials, and instructional practices.\nThe task for a content analyst is to review a state's content standards in a particular subject at a particular grade level at the most specific level of statement found in the content standard document (often called objectives). For each objective, the analyst decides what intersection of specific topics by cognitive demand (cells) is represented. Because some objectives are inclusive as to content, the convention is to allow up to six cells to represent a single objective. Before content analysis begins, analysts are instructed in the language with which they will be working. A sample set of content standards is analyzed individually by each analyst. The content standards and their content codes are then discussed by the analysts to establish an understanding of the content language and the task of content analysis. Each content analyst then works independently coding the content standards. Analysts are asked to flag any problems or confusions; before the coding is completed the analysts convene to discuss flagged items. Following discussion, the content analysts may or may not decide to change their initial coding. At the end of the procedure, each content analyst is asked to put down his or her best professional judgment on how to code each specific entry in the standards document.\nEach content standard is analyzed by three to five content analysts; content analysts are common across some but not all content standards analyzed (i.e., a coder always analyzes the full set of mathematics standards for a state but may or may not analyze the standards for another state in the data set). The data for each analyst are put in the form of proportions summing to one across the rows and columns of the topicsby-cognitive demand taxonomy. Each specific statement about content in a content standard is weighted equally; for instance, if an objective is Is There a de Facto National Intended Curriculum? placed in six cells, each cell receives one sixth of a point. In contrast, if the objective is placed in a single cell, that cell receives one point. The proportions are calculated by dividing the total number of objectives in a content standard document into the frequency number in each cell. Once a topic-by-cognitive demand matrix of proportions has been determined for each analyst, a cell-by-cell average is taken across content analysts to provide the content analysis. The content analysis techniques are identical for national professional standards or any other grade-band documents, with the proportions in each cell merely representing the proportion of the total objectives, for instance, in the K-2 grade band in mathematics. The only difference is that since NCLB, all states must have gradespecific standards in ELAR and mathematics. The repository for data is the Wisconsin Center for Educational Research (WCER) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The data analyzed here are taken from that repository."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "A total of 31 states have data in the WCER repository. For this study, states were selected if their content standards had been content analyzed in ELAR, mathematics, or science in Grades 4 and 8. In science, some states had content standards only at the 5th-grade level and they were included. For ELAR and mathematics, there were 14 states; and for science, there were 13 states. Additional analyses were done for states in which there were content analysis results for each Grade 1-8 or K-8. For states having results for every Grade K-8 or 1-8, there were 7 in ELAR, 10 in mathematics, and 4 in science. All of the content analyses were completed since 2003. In mathematics and science, content analyses were available for national professional standards and these results are included.\nPorter, Polikoff, Zeidner, and Smithson (2008) investigated the reliability of the content analysis procedures. Using generalizability coefficients (raters by cells) to estimate reliability, they investigated ELAR and mathematics content standards in each of two states. For ELAR using three analysts, reliabilities averaged .74 across grades and states. For mathematics, reliabilities averaged .78 across grades and states. The more analysts on which an average was taken, the higher the generalizability coefficient was. For the data used here, there were always at least three content analysts and sometimes as many as five. Porter (2002) reported generalizability coefficients for mathematics using the CCSSO/ SCASS content analysis procedures of approximately the same magnitude.\nOnce the basic data of cell proportions are in hand, an alignment index can be calculated to determine the extent to which one content standard has the same content message to teachers as another content standard (Porter, 2002) . The index is a function of the extent to which the proportions in the two two-dimensional matrices of topics by cognitive demand are, cell by cell, equal to each other. The index is defined as\nwhere x i denotes the cell proportions in one matrix and y i denotes cell proportions in the other matrix. The index can take on values from 0 to 1.0, with 1.0 indicating perfect alignment. Values in between 0 and 1 indicate the proportion of each document's content-by-cognitive demand that is common, such that a value of .5 indicates that the two documents share 50% of content-by-cognitive demand. Alignment indices can be displayed in state-by-state matrices, as is shown in the tables of this article. The offdiagonal elements depict the alignment between one state's content standards and another state's content standards.\nWhile the alignment index indicates the degree of alignment, content maps can be used to illustrate the nature of alignment. Here again the basic data are the topics-by-cognitive demand proportions. The content maps are generated using Excel software and can be thought of much like topographical maps where specific topics (the rows of the content matrix) can be thought of as north to south and cognitive demand (the columns of the content matrix) can be thought of as east to west. The software assumes that the topics and cognitive demand represent continuous variables, but in fact each is a nominal scale variable. Thus the content maps, while accurate at the intersection of the specific topic and cognitive demand, are not correct in the interpolations between the data points. Still, the content maps provide powerful images of what content is and is not emphasized within a state's content standards. By comparing the content map for one state's content standards to the map of another state, one can readily see how the standards are alike and different. The content maps provide the \"story\" behind the alignment index."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Is There a de Facto National Intended Curriculum as Defined by Content Standards?", "text": "The first set of analyses shows the alignment between one state's content standards in a particular subject and grade level and another state's content standards in the same subject at the fourthand eighth-grade levels. Table 1 provides the results for ELAR, Table 2 for science, and Table  3 for mathematics. As can be seen, there is considerable variance in the degree of alignment across pairs of states both at fourth and eighth grades and in all three subjects. The average state-to-state alignments in ELAR are .24 for fourth grade and .25 for eighth grade. The minimums are .09 for fourth grade and .07 for eighth grade, and the maximums are .48 for both fourth and eighth grades. For science, the average state-to-state alignments are .21 for both fourth and eighth grades, the maximums are .41 for fourth grade and .40 for eighth grade, and the minimums are .04 for fourth grade and .05 for eighth grade. For mathematics, the average state-to-state alignments are .27 for fourth grade and .20 for eighth grade, the maximums are .44 for fourth grade and .33 for eighth grade, and the minimums are .12 for fourth grade and .06 for eighth grade. Thus, consistent with the findings of Reys et al. (2007) , at least within a grade level, between-state alignments are generally low, representing approximately one fifth to one third of perfect alignment, and variable.\nFigures 1 and 2 are content maps that illustrate these findings. Figure 1 contains coarsegrained content maps for Minnesota and Oregon, the two most aligned states (alignment = .48) in eighth-grade ELAR. Both place considerable emphasis on generating writing components and analyzing author's craft. Minnesota's standards place more emphasis on explaining and generating language study and analyzing author's craft, while Oregon's standards place more emphasis on explaining and analyzing comprehension. Figure 2 shows a fine-grained content map of the same comparison in the content area of writing components. The map illustrates that both states' standards in this content area are mostly focused on generating, especially generating main ideas, organization, and style/voice/ technique/use of figurative language. Minnesota's standards also focus on evaluating purpose/style/ context, while Oregon's focus is on generating writing conventions and transitional devices. As these examples illustrate, even between the two most aligned standards documents, there are important content differences at both the coarseand the fine-grained levels. With average alignments in the .20s, the pictures for most standards documents would look considerably less similar.\nMaybe the relatively modest alignment of state content standards is a function of requiring gradespecific alignment. Perhaps the bulk of the differences in content standards among states come from their calling for the same content but at different grade levels. To explore this possibility, we identified all of the states in which content standards had been analyzed at each grade level K-8 for English/language arts and reading and 1-8 for mathematics and science. The proportions for each grade level were added and an average was taken to create across-grade level aggregate content standards. To aggregate standards across grades and interpret the aggregations as representing the true proportion of 1-8 or K-8 content emphasis, we must assume that the same \"amount\" of content is covered in each grade, so that 1% of the Grade 2 content is the same as 1% of the Grade 7 content. Unfortunately, the data do not allow a test of this assumption. We analyzed the alignment of these aggregate standards (see Tables 4-6). As one might hypothesize, average between-state alignments of aggregated standards are substantially greater than for the grade-specific standards: for ELAR, .53; for math, .47; and for science, .33. Again, there was substantial between-state variance in the degree of alignment for the aggregate standards. For ELAR the maximum was .62 and the minimum .49, for science the maximum was .44 and the minimum .20, and for mathematics the max imum was .62 and the minimum .36. Although these alignments for aggregates across grade Grade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8 Grade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8 Grade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nGrade 8\nCalifornia Standards levels show greater across-state agreement, they remain moderate. Figure 3 shows a pair of fine-grained content maps in earth systems for the least aligned aggregated standards documents in science. Across Grades 1-8, California's standards focus almost exclusively on memorizing Earth's shape/dimension/composition, Earth's origin/ history, mineral and rock formations/types, erosion/weathering, and plate tectonics. In contrast, Indiana's standards documents focus very little on memorizing and more on communicating Earth's shape/dimension/composition and mineral and rock formations/types. In this content map, we see that even aggregated across all grades, some states have very little content in common. Notably, California's aggregated science standards are aligned less than .30 with each of the other aggregated state standards in the study. Though alignments were higher on average and in other subjects, it is important to emphasize that aggregated alignments were still moderate to low across subjects."}, {"section_title": "To What Extent Are State Content Standards Aligned With National Professional Standards?", "text": "National professional standards, such as the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (2000) standards and the National Science Education (NSE) standards (National Research Council, 1996) created by the National Academies, represent one way that state content standards could move toward increased alignment. If states chose to align their content standards to the national professional standards, as the Fordham Foundation and others have alleged, content standards would tend to become more aligned in those content areas. Many states, such as New Jersey, Illinois, and"}, {"section_title": "FIGURE 1. Coarse-grained content maps for the two most aligned states, English/language arts and reading (ELAR) Grade 8 (alignment = .48).", "text": "Note. MN = Minnesota, OR = Oregon. The content maps are not accurate except at the intersection of a particular topic and cognitive demand (cell) . The values in the legend indicate the proportion of total content found in each particular cell. Thus, a very dark brown color at the intersection of a particular topic and cognitive demand indicates that between 7.2% and 8.2% of the total content for the document is found in that cell. The values are different for coarse-grained maps in Figures 1 and 5 than for fine-grained maps in the other figures.\nOklahoma, explicitly mention their consideration of NCTM standards during standards dev elopment on their Web sites or in their standards documents. It is important to note that NCTM standards and NSE standards are for grade bands, not individual grades, so gradespecific comparisons are not defined. In 2006, NCTM published its Focal Points, which indicates three main points that should be covered at each grade level from prekindergarten through eighth grade in the mathematics curriculum. Unfortunately, Focal Points is a document that is too recent to have been content analyzed and available in the database from which we worked. Focal Points is also too recent to have been taken into account by states in developing the content standards we content analyzed.\nAs with the state-to-state comparisons, stateto-national professional comparisons for standards aggregated across grades are possible. The techniques for these analyses were analogous to the techniques for the aggregated state-to-state comparisons. In the state-by-state analyses, we added the proportions for each state across the eight grades and divided by eight to obtain the aggregateessentially the mean of the content covered in each grade. For national professional standards, we added the content across grade bands (K-2, 3-5, and 6-8), and then divided by three, again calculating an average of the content covered in each grade. The results of the analyses are displayed in the bottom rows of Tables 5 and 6 . The mean state-to-NSE alignment was .37, with a maximum of .50 and a mini mum of .22. The mean state-to-NCTM alignment was .42, with a maximum of .54 and a minimum of .35. Compared with the state-to-state alignments, the state-to-NSE alignment was somewhat higher and the stateto-NCTM alignment was somewhat lower. Alignments were moderate to low and considerably variable across states. Figure 4 illustrates these comparisons, showing fine-grained comparisons in basic algebra for the least aligned state to NCTM standards. New "}, {"section_title": ".

Figures of other finegrained content areas show similar differences, with other states more aligned than New Hampshire to NCTM, but far from perfectly so."}, {"section_title": "To What Extent Is There Core Content Across States?", "text": "Although the state-to-state alignments are moderate to low across subjects and for both aggregated and individual grades, it may still be the case that there exists a small \"core\" de facto intended national curriculum. If this were the case, all or most states would put a large amount of emphasis on a few cells, with the low overall alignments resulting from differences in the rest of the content. To examine the possibility of a core intended curriculum across states, the first step was constructing a state-by-cell matrix of proportions of content emphasis for Grades 1-8 for science and mathematics and K-8 for ELAR. The mean and standard deviation of these proportions across states were calculated for each cell, and means greater than .01 were considered. These cells represent the content that accounts for greater than 1% of the content standards in Grades K-8 or 1-8 across states on average. A different threshold for core content could certainly be chosen, with different results. Still, 1% seems a low standard for emphasized content. Numbers \u00d7 Procedures (M = .012, SD = .007), Other \u00d7 Solve Nonroutine Problems (M = .011, SD = .016), Summarize Data in a Table/Graph \u00d7 Conjecture/Generalize (M = .011, SD = .011), and Add/Subtract Whole Numbers \u00d7 Demonstrate (M = .010, SD = .009). The \"Other\" cells represent where there is no appropriate content code in the content list. Except for the \"Other\" cells, 9 of the 10 states included all of these cells in their standards; 1 state excluded Number Comparisons \u00d7 Demonstrate. The 13 cells represented between 14.0% and 30.2% of each state's total curriculum, with a mean value of 18.6%. The cells were also well represented in the NCTM standards, accounting for 21.4% of the NCTM's content. Of the 13 topics, 7 were procedures and 4 demonstrate, indicating that lower levels of cognitive demand were more often among the shared content. Summarize data in a table/graph had cognitive demands of procedure, demonstrate, and conjecture/generalize.\nIn science there were eight cells with means across states greater than .01. These cells were Nature of Scientific Inquiry Is There a de Facto National Intended Curriculum? SD = .012), and Scientific Habits of Mind/Logic/ Reasoning \u00d7 Demonstrate Understanding (M = .011, SD = .014). No content from the traditional content areas (i.e., biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics) was included in these eight cells. Three of the four states included all of these cells; one state excluded Science Tools \u00d7 Procedures. The eight cells represented between 15.3% and 35.9% of the content of each state's total curriculum, with a mean value of 21.7%. The cells represented 14.9% of the content in the NSE standards. The first four cells alone represented between 9.9% and 23.3% of the curriculum across the four states.\nThese analyses suggest the presence of a small core curriculum across state content standards, despite their relatively low alignment. In each content area, there were a handful of cells that contained a large proportion of content across grades. Remarkably, in mathematics and science, the narrow core content accounted for a large proportion of the total intended content to be covered in Grades 1-8 or K-8 in some states. As these are aggregated standards, and assuming an equal amount of content covered in each grade (i.e., 12.5% of the total in each of eight grades), the value of 35.9% suggests that the 8 core content cells in science account for nearly 3 full years' worth of the Grades 1-8 academic content intended to be covered in one state, and the 13 cells in mathematics account for 30.2%, or more than 2 years of the content intended to be covered, in Grades 1-8 in one state. Of course, this core does not necessarily represent the content that is actually taught-however, previous analysis of the content of teachers' instruction has found that teachers across states teach largely similar content, with alignments for aggregated instruction data near .80 across states (Porter, 2002) . Furthermore, it is certainly possible that the core intended curriculum covers the \"wrong\" content, in the sense of being trivial or not viewed as important by mathematicians, scientists, or ELAR educators.\nThus far, analyses have addressed questions of the extent to which there exists a de facto national curriculum as represented in state content standards for English/language arts and reading, mathematics, and science. The answer to this question is no, at least not in the extent to which states all have content standards at the same grade level with the same content message. Nor are state content standards highly aligned to national professional standards. Clearly, when one aggregates across grade levels (K-8 or 1-8), the degree of alignment is higher than for a specific grade level. Still, the alignment is nowhere near perfect and there continues to be variability among pairs of states in the degree to which their content standards are aligned. There is evidence of a core curriculum in each content area, and this core curriculum occupies a substantial portion of the curriculum in a few states."}, {"section_title": "To What Extent Are State Content Standards Focused on a Few Big Ideas?", "text": "Emerging from this finding of a core curriculum is a question about the degree of focus of state content standards. Some have argued that the United States K-8 curriculum is not sufficiently focused on a few big ideas (e.g., Schmidt et al., 2001 ). The hypothesis is that the greater content focus of some other countries explains their advantage in international assessments of student achievement. This hypothesis has rec eived considerable play in the United States. Here we ask if the state content standards focus on a few important big ideas.\nThe data that allowed us to investigate the degree of alignment among states and their content standards also allow us to address the question of content focus. An index of the smallest percentage of cells required to represent at least 80% of a state's intended curriculum was created. Based on this index, the states vary dramatically in their extent of focus, especially for English/language arts and reading. At the fourthgrade level in ELAR, Maine captures 80% of the intended curriculum with only 17 of the 815 possible cells, or 2.1% of the cells, while Minnesota requires 115 cells, or 14.1% of the total possible, to capture 80% of their curriculum. At the eighth-grade level, the results are similar, with Maine the most focused at 2.1% and Ohio the least focused at 17.2%. The results for math and science show a different pattern with all of the states more focused than the least focused in ELAR. In math, the most focused state at fourth grade is Oklahoma, requiring 2.9% of the possible cells. In eighth grade, North Carolina is the most focused, requiring just 22 of the 1,085 cells, or 2% of the total possible. In contrast, the least focused state is Delaware at fourth grade, requiring 7.3% of the cells, and Kansas at eighth grade, requiring 92 of the cells, or 8.5% of total possible. For science, the most focused state is California, requiring 1.6% of the cells, and the least focused is New Jersey, requiring 6.9% of the cells. At eighth grade, California is again the most focused, requiring 1.9% of the cells, and Delaware the least focused, requiring 7.4% of the cells.\nFigures 5 and 6 show a coarse-grained and a fine-grained comparison of the most and least focused states in eighth-grade ELAR. At the coarse-grained level, Maine is highly focused on explaining, generating, and analyzing comprehension and explaining and generating author's craft, such that almost no content outside these five areas is included in Maine's standards. In contrast, Ohio's standards are spread across all five levels of cognitive demand and across many more content areas, with its only major peaks at generating writing components and generating writing processes. In Figure 6 , we see that Maine hardly covers any content in writing components, with a small amount of focus on analyzing support and ela boration. In contrast, Ohio covers content across multiple cells within writing components at all levels of cognitive demand. The comparison of high and low focus in ELAR is stark. Of the content areas studied, ELAR was the most variable in terms of level of focus. In mathematics and science however, the variability in level of focus remained considerable, such that the least focused state had between two and five times more content cells covered than the most focused state. In all three subjects then, variability among states is the rule, not the exception. Certainly, there could be advantages and disadvantages to having a focused curriculum-a curriculum focused exclusively on low-cognitive demand learning might not be productive. But the considerable variability among states in focus is worth noting, representing yet another piece of evidence against there being a de facto national intended curriculum."}, {"section_title": "To What Extent Is Content Demarcated Across Grades?", "text": "Whereas the previous section addressed the level of focus within a state at an individual grade level, it is also useful to consider the extent to which states' standards are focused on the same topics across grade levels. Previous research in elementary school mathematics has revealed that content taught is often highly redundant across grades (Porter, 1989) . Is redundancy across grades in content standards also true? Some amount of redundancy or reinforcement is to be expected across grades, but a high level of red undancy, such that students are intended to be exposed to more or less the same content over and over again as they pass through school, is probably not desired. Although we cannot establish a threshold of adequate redundancy through our analysis, we can report on the redundancy that currently exists in state content standards.\nTo examine the question of content demarcation across grades, we considered the alignment index between each state's fourth-grade standards and its eighth-grade standards. In ELAR, the mean alignment was .35, the maximum was .56, and the minimum was .15. In science, the mean alignment was .31, the maximum was .52, and the minimum was .12. And in mathematics, the mean alignment was .22, the maximum was .39, and the minimum was .04. Comparing these values to the betweenstate alignments, we see that in both ELAR and science, state standards are more aligned within state, across grade than they are within grade, across state by approximately .10. Although it is difficult to interpret absolute differences, these .1 differences are relatively consequential given that the average within-grade, across-state alignment in these two subjects is generally between .2 and .3.Mathematics is a different story, with alignment within states no better than alignment between states. Figure 7 shows content maps at the fine-grained level of basic algebra for the most within-state, across-grade aligned state, Delaware, with an alignment index of .39. The standards at both grades emphasize demonstrating evaluation of formulas, demonstrating linear/nonlinear relations, and demonstrating rate of change/slope/line. In the fourth grade, there is also focus on demonstrating use of variables, whereas the eighth-grade standards have an emphasis on procedures and demonstrating square roots and radicals. Still, the content across grades is moderately aligned, almost as aligned as the most aligned states in fourth-grade mathematics, suggesting moderate redundancy over the four-grade span. The data include 14 states for ELAR and mathematics and 13 for science. When analyses looked at the aggregate across-grade levels, the numbers of states dropped to 10 in mathematics, 7 in English/language arts and reading, and only 4 in science."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "On the question of whether state content standards represent a de facto national intended curriculum, the answer is no. Using an alignment index that ranges from 0 (no alignment) to 1.0 (perfect alignment), for each subject at fourth and eighth grades, alignments were in the .20s. When content standards were aggregated across grade levels, between-state alignment was stronger (averaging .53 for ELAR and .47 for mathematics but just .33 for science). There was however considerable variability in degree of alignment across pairs of states, with alignment between states at the specific grade level ranging from as high as .56 to as low as .04. For aggregate standards, the maximum alignment was .62 and the minimum .20. Clearly, the alignment among state content standards is no better than moderate for standards aggregated across grade levels and low when looking at a specific grade level.\nNeither are states' content standards particularly well aligned to the NCTM standards or NSE standards as some have claimed. Many states say in the description of their standards that they have drawn heavily from the national professional content standards. These national professional standards in mathematics and science have been developed with input from a broad array of experts and are generally held to be of a high quality. They can be taken as authoritative statements of what students in the United States are to know and be able to do in each of those two subjects. In that sense, the extent to which state content standards are aligned with the national professional content standards can be taken as evidence of the quality of the state content standards. In science, alignment to the aggregated NSE standards was somewhat higher than alignment among states.\nIn mathematics, alignment to the aggregated NCTM standards was neither higher nor lower than the alignment between states. The state-tonational professional alignments were still moderate to low. These results are both surprising and discouraging.\nThere is some evidence of a small core intended curriculum for each subject. On average, in ELAR 11 cells of 815 possible had an average content emphasis in state content standards equal to or greater than 1%. For science, 8 cells of the 1,055 possible had an average emphasis equal to or greater than 1%. For mathematics, 13 cells of the 1,085 had an average emphasis across states of 1% or greater. The 11 types of content for ELAR captured at least 10% of each state's intended curriculum and as high as 18%. For mathematics, the 13 cells captured from 14% to 30% of each state's total intended curriculum, and for science, the 8 types of content captured from 15% to 36% of each state's intended curriculum. In mathematics and science, the cells that were common across states were also common in the national professional standards. In mathematics, most of the cells that we found as part of the \"core\" are also found in NCTM's (2006) Focal Points. Of the 11 core curriculum cells in mathematics excluding those with the content category \"other,\" 10 appear somewhere in the Focal Points document. Estimation app ears in Grades 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8; add/subtract whole numbers, Grades 1 and 2; number comparisons, Grades K through 4; summarize data in a table/graph, Grade 8; simple probability, Grade 7; and whole numbers, throughout the document. Some of these topics appear in the \"connections to the focal points\" rather than the focal points themselves, but all of the topics we identified in our core content cells appear in the Focal Points document, with the exception of time/ temperature. Overall, Focal Points seems to capture much of the content that is already commonly included in content standards across the states. Whether the content common across standards and the Focal Points is actually taught in math classes is outside the scope of this article, but it is at least clear that there is some agreement among state standards documents and the NCTM about some content that should be taught in U.S. math classes.\noverlap at the specific cognitive demand level to represent alignment. Although we acknowledge these assumptions, we do not believe they affect the overall substantive nature of our findings.\nAs policy makers consider curricular policies such as the reauthorization of No Child Left Behind, this article provides evidence about the backbone of the standards-based reform system, content standards. States' content standards are, on the whole, different one from another. These differences are a fact of the states' rights education system in which we live. And although these differences ensure that states are able to teach to their students the content that they want, decisions about content standards have important ramifications for teacher training and textbook publishing. Nevertheless, there does exist a small common core of content across states in each of the subjects studied. In future discussions of state content standards, policy makers can use this core content as a building block for considering the content that should be common across states and the appropriate level of focus for content standards."}, {"section_title": "Appendix", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cognitive Demand Definitions Mathematics", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Memorize", "text": "\u2022 Recite basic mathematics facts; recall mathematics terms and definitions; recall formulas and computational processes."}, {"section_title": "Perform procedures", "text": "\u2022 Use numbers to count, order, or denote; do computational procedures or algorithms; follow procedures/instructions; make measurements, do computations; solve equations/formulas, routine word problems; organize or display data; read or produce graphs and tables; execute geometric constructions."}, {"section_title": "Demonstrate understanding", "text": "\u2022 Communicate new mathematical ideas; use representations to model mathematical ideas; explain findings and results from data analysis; develop/explain relationships between concepts; explain relationship between models, diagrams, and other representations."}, {"section_title": "Conjecture, generalize, prove", "text": "\u2022 Determine the truth of a mathematical pattern or proposition; Write formal or informal proofs; analyze data; find a mathematical rule to generate a pattern or number sequence; reason inductively or deductively; use spatial reasoning."}, {"section_title": "Solve nonroutine problems, make connections", "text": "\u2022 Apply and adapt a variety of appropriate strategies to solve problems; apply mathematics in contexts outside of mathematics; recognize, generate, or create patterns; synthesize content and ideas from several sources.\n(continued)"}]
