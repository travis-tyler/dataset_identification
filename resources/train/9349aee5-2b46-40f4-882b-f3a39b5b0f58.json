[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The Pacific Coast band-tailed pigeon (Patagioenas fasciata monilis) is a migratory game bird of North America that is at risk for population decline. Epidemics of avian trichomonosis caused by upper digestive tract infection with Trichomonas spp. protozoa in these and other doves and pigeons of the United States are sporadic, but can involve tens of thousands of birds in a single event. Herein, we analyze the role of trichomonosis in band-tailed pigeon mortality and relate spatial, temporal and demographic patterns of parasite transmission to the genetic background of the infecting organism. Infections were most common in adult birds and prevalence was high in band-tailed pigeons sampled at mortality events (96%) and rehabilitation centers (36%) compared to those that were hunter-killed (11%) or live-caught (4%). During non-epidemic periods, animals were primarily infected with T. gallinae Fe-hydrogenase subtype A2, and were less often infected with either T. gallinae subtype A1 (the British finch epidemic strain), T. stableri n. sp. (a T. vaginalis-like species), or Tritrichomonas blagburni n. sp.-like organisms. Birds sampled during multiple epidemics in California were only infected with T. gallinae subtype A2 and T. stableri. The non-clonal etiology of avian trichomonosis outbreaks in band-tailed pigeons and the risk of spill-over to raptor and passerine species highlights the need for additional studies that clarify the host range and evolutionary relationships between strains of Trichomonas spp. in regions of trichomonosis endemicity."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Trichomonas gallinae, the primary etiologic agent of avian trichomonosis, is a globally-distributed, flagellated protozoal parasite that can infect a wide range of bird species (Forrester and Foster, 2008) . Severe disease is characterized by the development of proliferative caseous lesions of the upper digestive tract that can block the animal's esophagus or trachea, ultimately leading to starvation or suffocation and death (Cole, 1999; Stabler, 1954; Stabler and Braun, 1975) . Some species of columbids (e.g. rock pigeons, Columba livia) are generally asymptomatic carriers of the parasite, while other species including mourning doves (Zeneida macroura), wood pigeons (Columba palumbus) and Pacific Coast band-tailed pigeons (Patagioenas fasciata monilis) suffer from sporadic mortality events involving hundreds or even tens of thousands of animals (Cole, 1999; Haugen and Keeler, 1952; H\u00f6fle et al., 2004; Stabler, 1947; Stabler and Herman, 1951; Stromberg et al., 2008; USGS, 2013; Villan\u00f9a et al., 2006) . Trichomonosis also is an emerging infectious disease of passerine birds that most likely become exposed to T. gallinae at artificial food and water sources shared by doves and pigeons (Forz\u00e1n et al., 2010; Neimanis et al., 2010; Zadravec et al., 2012) . Finch trichomonosis emerged in Great Britain in 2005, causing significant decline in breeding populations of greenfinches (Carduelis chloris) and chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs) (Lawson et al., 2012; Robinson et al., 2010) . In 2008, the epidemic strain of T. gallinae from Great Britain spread into southern Fennoscandia, causing multiple trichomonosis mortality events in greenfinches and chaffinches over a two year period (Lawson et al., 2011a; Neimanis et al., 2010) . In 2007 and 2008, the Maritime Provinces of Canada identified multiple trichomonosis outbreaks involving purple finches (Carpodacus purpureus) and American goldfinches (Carduelis tristis) (Forz\u00e1n et al., 2010) . Raptor species that prey on infected birds are also susceptible to trichomonosis, and significant mortality due to T. gallinae infections in Cooper's hawk (Accipiter cooperii) and Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata) nestlings have been reported (Boal et al., 1998; Real et al., 2000) . Decline of the sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) population in Great Britain may be linked to trichomonosis acquired from passerine species, which make up a large proportion of their diet (Chi et al., 2013) .\nWhile our ability to detect trichomonad infections in birds has been simplified and, perhaps, improved in the last 20 years with the use of the InPouch\u2122 TF culture device (BioMed Diagnostics, White City, OR) (Cover et al., 1994) , our understanding of the demographic, environmental, genetic, and behavioral factors that shape pathogen transmission and bird susceptibility remains incomplete, especially across the vast range of avian species at risk worldwide. Risk factors under investigation include the use of artificial water and food sources, crop feeding and billing behavior, climate, bird density during congregation, bird migration, consumption of infected prey, and parasite species or genotype (Bunbury et al., 2007; Cole, 1999; Girard et al., 2014; H\u00f6fle et al., 2004; Lawson et al., 2011a,b; Robinson et al., 2010; Stabler, 1947 Stabler, , 1948 Stabler and Herman, 1951) . The relative roles of these risk factors are expected to vary temporally, spatially, and between host species.\nGenetic analysis of isolates infecting finches during outbreaks in Great Britain and Fennoscandia indicates that a single clonal strain of T. gallinae was responsible for widespread mortality in both regions (Lawson et al., 2011b) . Epidemics in North American doves and pigeons are similarly hypothesized to be caused by particularly virulent strains of T. gallinae (Cole, 1999; Stabler, 1948; Stabler and Herman, 1951) and laboratory experiments in homing pigeons (Columba livia) and band-tailed pigeons support the notion that differences exist in the virulence of parasite strains (Stabler, 1948; Stabler and Braun, 1975) . However, a rigorous analysis of parasite genetic background during epidemic and non-epidemic transmission cycles in wild columbids of North America that are at risk of disease has yet to be described. Preliminary analysis of a small number of trichomonad isolates from mourning doves and band-tailed pigeons of the western U.S. indicate that outbreaks in these species may actually involve more than one genetically distinct trichomonad species (Gerhold et al., 2008; Girard et al., 2014) .\nThe Pacific Coast band-tailed pigeon (henceforth, ''band-tailed pigeon'') is a migratory upland game species distributed in coastal and inland coniferous forests between southeast Alaska and Baja California (USA) (Sanders, 2012) . The North American Breeding Bird Survey, Mineral Site Survey, and other sources indicate that this population has been in decline for the past 40 years (Keppie and Braun, 2000; Sanders, 2012) . In California, this decline is reflected in recent reductions in hunter take and restricted hunting opportunities (California Department of Fish and Wildlife, 2013) . Epidemics of trichomonosis in band-tailed pigeons have been recorded since 1945, with morbidity and mortality involving thousands of individuals often in the wintertime or during spring migration (Cole, 1999; Stabler and Braun, 1979; Stromberg et al., 2008; USGS, 2013) . In the present study, we sampled band-tailed pigeons and sympatric species in California for trichomonad infections using active, opportunistic, and syndromic surveillance techniques. We genetically characterized protozoa isolated in diseased and asymptomatic birds and analyzed spatial, temporal, and demographic patterns during epidemic and non-epidemic transmission periods."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study population", "text": "Surveillance of free-ranging band-tailed pigeons was conducted from February 1, 2011 to August 31, 2012 coinciding with two seasons of winter and spring band-tailed pigeon migration (December-April) and two seasons of band-tailed pigeon nesting and breeding (May-September).

Captured birds were removed from the trap and placed in a plastic game bird crate or cloth bag prior to sampling and processing. Each bird was examined physically for obvious signs of disease and clinical features of trichomonosis, and age and sex were recorded. Hunter-killed birds were sampled at check stations near Whiskeytown National Recreation Area, Shasta County and Chew's Ridge and Bottcher's Gap in Los Padres National Forest, Monterey County during the split northern (September) and southern (December) California band-tailed pigeon hunting seasons (supplementary data Fig. S1 ).

Carcasses were kept at 4\u00b0C until shipped and oral swabs were collected when carcasses were in fresh condition. Necropsy and histologic examination of tissues were conducted on all birds in fresh condition and cause of death and co-morbid conditions were determined by a veterinary pathologist. Identification of caseonecrotic lesions in the upper digestive tract was suggestive of trichomonosis, and wet-mount and/or immunohistochemistry (see Girard et al., 2014) confirmed the post-mortem diagnosis of trichomonosis.

Three additional birds had clinical disease but were either test-negative or not laboratory-tested. Infection was common among birds sampled at mortality events (55/57, O.R. 205.96) and admitted to rehabilitation centers (30/77, O.R. 2.70), whereas live-caught (11/268, O.R. 0.05) and hunter-killed (6/54, O.R. 0.40) birds were rarely infected. Infections were significantly associated with disease (P < 0.001). Among the 448 laboratory-tested band-tailed pigeons from all surveillance activities, adults were more likely to be infected than juveniles (86/314 adults vs. 15/134 juveniles, P = 0.0002).

Ten adult band-tailed pigeons (6 males, 4 females) and one juvenile (gender undetermined) were infected with trichomonad protozoa (11/268, 4.1%). Three of these infected birds had mild to severe caseous lesions in the oral cavity. Test-positive band-tailed pigeons were identified at collection sites in Lassen (2/84, 2.3%), El Dorado (2/25, 8.0%), Contra Costa (3/39, 7.7%), Santa Barbara (1/16, 6.3%) and San Diego (3/34, 8.8%) counties (Table 1) .\nSequence analysis revealed that 10 out of 11 trichomonad isolates cultured from live-caught band-tailed pigeons were identical at the ITS1/5.8S/ITS2 locus to T. gallinae Sequence Group A (GenBank EU215369) previously isolated in a variety of bird species in the U.S. and in finches in the United Kingdom (Anderson et al., 2009; Gerhold et al., 2008; Lawson et al., 2011a) (Table 1 , Fig. 1 ). At the Fe-hydrogenase locus, all but two of these isolates were identical to T. gallinae isolated in a Madagascar turtle dove (Streptopelia picturata) sampled in the Republic of Seychelles (Lawson et al., 2011a ) (e.g. CA012226, Table 1 , Fig. 2) . Recently, this genotype was named Fe-hydrogenase (FeH) subtype A2 (Chi et al., 2013) . All T. gallinae FeH subtype A2 sequences detected in bandtailed pigeons that were live-trapped or sampled from other sources were identical. A second T. gallinae FeH sequence type was identified in two live-caught birds sampled in Lassen County and was identical to FeH subtype A1 (e.g. CA012245, Table 1 , Fig. 2 ) which was previously amplified in British greenfinches during epidemic trichomonosis transmission (Fig. 2) (Lawson et al., 2011a) . As for FeH subtype A2, all T. gallinae FeH subtype A1 sequences detected in live-caught band-tailed pigeons, as well as those sampled elsewhere, were identical. In a 927 bp alignment of the two sequence types, FeH subtype A1 differs from FeH subtype A2 by six nucleotides (position numbers refer to GenBank KC244200): C ? T at position 582, T ? C at position 708, A ? G at position 756, T ? C at position 783, and C ? T at position 873. All six substitutions were third position synonymous changes.\nTrichomonad isolate CA015840 was obtained from a livecaught, lesion-free band-tailed pigeon in El Dorado County and was an example of the newly-described species T. stableri n. sp.

The isolate had 98.8% pairwise similarity to T. vaginalis strain Tv30:GZ and 93.4% pairwise similarity to T. gallinae Sequence Group A at the ITS1/5.8S/ITS2 locus. At the Fe-hydrogenase locus, T. stableri isolate CA015840 had 94.4% pairwise similarity to T. vaginalis HDGL1, and only 81% pairwise similarity to T. gallinae FeH subtype A2. Isolate CA012229 sampled from a live, lesion-free mourning dove in San Diego County was identical to isolate MODO-22 originating from a hunter-killed mourning dove in Texas (Gerhold et al., 2008) at both the ITS1/ 5.8S/ITS2 and Fe-hydrogenase loci (Figs. 1 and 2 ). Fe-hydrogenase sequences from these mourning dove isolates formed a polytomy with T. vaginalis and T. stableri (Fig. 2) , and had a pairwise similarity of 93.3% to T. vaginalis HDGL1, and 83.1% to T. gallinae FeH subtype A2. Meanwhile, their ITS1/5.8S/ITS2 sequences held a basal position to the clade containing T. vaginalis, T. stableri and uncharacterized trichomonad isolates from other mourning doves and white winged doves (Fig. 1).

Clinical trichomonosis was confirmed or highly suspected in 26.7% (24/90) of band-tailed pigeons.

Caseonecrotic lesions were accompanied by intralesional protozoa and bacteria. Lesions were occasionally observed obstructing the opening of the larynx or the proximal trachea, or extending into the choanal slit. Lesions frequently extended through the mucosa, or into the deep mucosa through the submucosa and muscularis. In more than one case, necrotic lesions in the distal esophagus/proventriculus region extended through the esophagus into the trachea and adjacent lung. Evidence of aspiration of protozoa along with necrotic debris from the oropharygeal region was not uncommon in the trachea and lungs, especially in mortality event birds. The presence of protozoa in the lungs was previously confirmed by immunohistochemistry (Girard et al., 2014) . Necrotizing and pleocellular pneumonia and bronchopneumonia were likely related to the aspiration of necrotic material and bacteria. Birds examined from the Madera County mortality event had either mild or moderate portal pleocellular hepatitis, interstitial nephritis, pancreatitis, tracheitis, bursal or splenic lymphoid depletion and focal necrotizing coelomitis. As previously noted, no obvious differences between the pathogenesis of infections with T. gallinae vs. T. stableri were observed (Girard et al., 2014) .\nSystemic trichomonosis was observed during necropsy of a juvenile female band-tailed pigeon (CA015192) admitted to the SPCA for Monterey County on March 25, 2012 due to injuries. Based on the physical and temporal proximity of this bird to the Carmel Valley, Monterey County mortality event, we hypothesize that it was infected during epidemic transmission in the region. Despite the bird having no lesions in the alimentary tract, T. gallinae FeH subtype A2 was cultivated from the bird's oral cavity. Associated caseonecrotic lesions were observed in the liver (Fig. 4b) , air sacs and skeletal muscle.

Among T. gallinae infections, there was no association between FeH subtype and disease; however, FeH subtype A2 infected a far greater number of birds (n = 73) compared to FeH subtype A1 (n = 10) (P < 0.001) ( Table 4) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this report, we describe the prevalence, genetic diversity and pathogenesis of trichomonad infections in Pacific Coast band-tailed pigeons during a temporally and spatially extensive sampling effort that led to the examination of over 500 birds throughout the species range in California. Infections and associated disease were detected year-round, although the prevalence varied by season, geographic location, and sampling source. Trichomonas gallinae FeH subtype A2 was the dominant pathogenic genotype infecting band-tailed pigeons throughout the year including during epidemics. The only previous reports of this genotype were in a live-caught disease-free Madagascar turtle dove sampled in Mah\u00e9, Seychelles and in a captive Budgarigar in Scotland that had trichomonosis lesions (Chi et al., 2013; Lawson et al., 2011a) . The less common T. gallinae Fe-hydrogenase genotype in band-tailed pigeons, FeH subtype A1, is the etiologic agent of epidemic finch trichomonosis in Britain, where infections have lead to significant declines in greenfinch and chaffinch populations (Lawson et al., 2011a (Lawson et al., , 2012 Robinson et al., 2010) . The same genotype has also been found in non-passerine bird species in the U.K. including birds of prey and columbids (Chi et al., 2013) . While regional studies have established that these T. gallinae genotypes are detrimental to more local bird populations, these and other T. gallinae strains have yet to be characterized with regard to their global geographic distribution, host range, genetic background, and evolutionary history.\nTrichomonas gallinae infected all three bird species sampled in this study, while T. vaginalis-like strains in band-tailed pigeons, mourning doves and rock pigeons were generally restricted to those species. Gerhold and colleagues (2008) reported T. gallinae Sequence Group A infection in a wide range of raptors, finches, and dove and pigeon species sampled across the U.S., while T. vaginalis-like isolates (ITS1/5.8S/ITS2 Sequence Groups H-L) had some host specificity. The generalist behavior of T. gallinae is highly optimal for parasite persistence and transmission success, while the restricted host range of avian T. vaginalis-like spp. suggests that these organisms may have evolved more recently in birds. But whether this narrow host range has a genetic and/or functional basis, or is simply due to ecological circumstances that have limited host shift opportunity requires further analysis. We will gain a better understanding of cross-species parasite transmission and host associations of genetically diverse avian trichomonosis pathogens through studies that combine disease surveillance with analysis of bird movement (e.g. using radio telemetry) and targeted sampling at artificial food and water sources that tend to attract a variety of bird species.\nThe relationship between the Tritrichomonas sp. isolated in band-tailed pigeons and tritrichomonads infecting cattle and cats requires further analysis, particularly given recent findings that distinguish the feline agent of large-bowel diarrhea, T. blagburni, from the bovine agent of abortion in cattle, T. foetus (Walden et al., 2013) . Our preliminary analysis of the ITS1/5.8S/ITS2 region indicates a feline origin of tritrichomonads isolated in band-tailed pigeons. However, based on the fact that only T. gallinae DNA could be amplified from lesion tissue of the diseased bird, and the second bird showed no signs of trichomonosis, we hypothesize that the Tritrichomonas sp. organisms were simply colonizing the oral cavity and were not invasive or pathogenic to band-tailed pigeons. Oral exposure of birds to cat fecal material, for example, could have easily occurred in the urban setting of Pasadena, California where birds and cats share habitats including back yards with bird feeders.\nThe sporadic nature of trichomonosis epidemics in band-tailed pigeons and mourning doves is well-documented (Cole, 1999; Stromberg et al., 2008; USGS, 2013) , however, previous to this study, little was known about the genetic background of the etiologic agent, or the host and environmental drivers of these intermittent outbreaks. Although diverse protozoa were detected in columbids sampled throughout the study including three T. gallinae genotypes, a Tritrichomonas sp., and three T. vaginalislike strains, only T. gallinae FeH subtype A2 and T. stableri were isolated at outbreaks. Both T. gallinae subtype A2 and T. stableri were isolated previously from band-tailed pigeon carcasses sampled during a large trichomonosis outbreak in Monterey County during the winter of 2006-2007 in which over 43,000 birds are estimated to have died (Gerhold et al., 2008; Girard et al., 2014; Stromberg et al., 2008) . Considering their high pathogenicity and involvement in multiple, recent band-tailed pigeon epidemics in California, continued monitoring of the prevalence and spatial distribution of both T. stableri and T. gallinae subtype A2 is important for Pacific Coast band-tailed pigeon population health. Surveillance activities should also continue to examine the distribution of the British finch epidemic strain, FeH subtype A1, a potential pathogen for North American passerine species.\nUnlike in Britain, where epidemic mortality events due to trichomonosis in breeding populations of finches occur in the late summer (Lawson et al., 2012; Robinson et al., 2010) , transmission in California band-tailed pigeons followed a pattern similar to that of wood pigeons in Spain where T. gallinae infection prevalence is higher in adults (72.7%) than juveniles (20% or 34.6%, depending on location) (Villan\u00f9a et al., 2006) and outbreaks occur in winter and spring (H\u00f6fle et al., 2004) . The high prevalence of infection in adults and the timing of mortality events in California band-tailed pigeons have strong implications for adult survival and recruitment potential. The largest numbers of Pacific Coast band-tailed pigeons are present in California during winter and spring migration, suggesting the majority of the population is at risk of infection and subsequent mortality due to trichomonosis. These factors indicate that disease may be contributing to the population decline observed in this species. Given the strong seasonal trends in band-tailed pigeon infection prevalence and the age structure of the population during peak mortality, increased transmission and pathogenesis in adults appears to be driven by environmental, physiological and behavioral changes that accompany shifts in the birds' annual cycle. As observed in other avian-pathogen systems, the energetic burden and stress of migration, or even pre-migration activity, is linked to impaired host immunity, and increased susceptibility to infections (Altizer et al., 2011; Lloyd, 1995) . In the case of band-tailed pigeons, disease transmission in the migration season may be additionally heightened during congregation of exceptionally large flocks (Stromberg et al., 2008) particularly in years of low precipitation (Bunbury et al., 2007) or limited food availability (Lloyd, 1995) . Research activities exploring the relationship between climate, precipitation, habitat quality, food availability and the role of human development on disease transmission dynamics in the band-tailed pigeon population are needed, and may reveal ways to reduce individual-and population-level impacts of trichomonosis in band-tailed pigeons and other susceptible avian species."}]
