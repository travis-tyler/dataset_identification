Both amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b2 42 measurement are established biomarkers of A\u03b2 deposition that highly correlate with post-mortem [3, 4] and brain biopsy findings [5] and serving as in vivo proxies of AD pathological findings that can be assessed in vivo. They are included as part of the biological definition of AD in the recent NIA-AA 2018 research framework [6] for the definition of preclinical stages of AD [7] and as well as inclusion criteria in clinical trials [8] . CSF A\u03b2 42 and amyloid PET show a high degree of agreement [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , even though they probably measure two different pools of amyloid. While the signal detected by amyloid PET may reflect fibrillary amyloid [20] , the decrease of CSF A\u03b2 42 levels more likely reflects both fibrillar and non-fibrillar A\u03b2 deposits. Another difference is that CSF A\u03b2 42 may become abnormal before amyloid PET [21, 22] , while amyloid PET has been suggested to be superior for grading early symptomatic AD stages [19] .\nFor diagnostic purposes, three 18 F-labelled PET radiotracers have been granted marketing authorizations and are being used: [ 18 F]flutemetamol (Vizamyl; GE Healthcare), [ 18 F]florbetaben (Neuraceq; Life Molecular Imaging), and [ 18 F]florbetapir (Amyvid, Eli Lilly). In the clinical setting, PET scans are visually read by trained specialists and are categorized as either positive or negative [23] . For quantitative purposes, the three different tracers show considerable variability when measured using the typical standardized update value ratios (SUVRs). To improve the comparability of the retention measurements across tracers, the Centiloid method has been proposed [24] . This method linearly scales the measurement of a particular tracer from 0 to 100 scale, where '0' represents the average uptake in young controls and '100' corresponds to the average uptake in typical AD patients at the dementia stage. To apply the Centiloid conversion, reference datasets, quantification pipelines, and regions of interest and reference are available publically from http://www.gaain.org/ centiloid-project. When expressed in Centiloids (CL), optimal thresholds for positivity against visual reads typically fall within the range between 25 and 35 CL [25] [26] [27] .\nThe applicability of CSF A\u03b2 42 determinations with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) has been limited by several preanalytical and analytical factors, resulting in lot-to-lot and between-laboratory variability. These issues are expected to be improved by the availability of certified reference materials [28] , and the problem with analytical variation is expected to be overcome with fully automated systems, such as the novel Elecsys\u00ae CSF immunoassay [29] . Using this system, core AD biomarkers in CSF have been compared to A\u03b2 PET [22, 30, 31] and a CSF cut-off against PET visual read has been established by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and validated against an independent sample. The resulting areas under the curve (AUC) of CSF A\u03b2 42 against A\u03b2 PET visual read ranged from 0.85 to 0.92. Interestingly, in these studies, tau/A\u03b2 42 ratios showed a higher agreement against PET visual reading (AUCs 0.94-0.96) than CSF A\u03b2 42 alone.\nDuring the last years, investigators have started interventions before the onset of clinical symptoms, when A\u03b2 42 changes are detectable using CSF and amyloid PET biomarkers [32] [33] [34] . Amyloid positivity is often recognized as the earliest detectable pathophysiological abnormality in AD. Typically, positivity has been operationalized as a positive visual read in an amyloid PET scan. Accordingly, quantitative cut-offs for PET imaging, but also for CSF biomarkers, have been derived against visual reads. However, the question remains of whether lower quantitative cut-offs can be used to detect more subtle amyloid alterations with higher sensitivity, but which still provide good specificity. Such cut-offs are critical for the operationalization of preventive interventions like recruiting cognitively unimpaired individuals into prevention clinical trials. Therefore, there is a need to establish sensitive, reliable and generalizable cut-off values for amyloid PET to detect early amyloid deposition and operationalize decision-making in preventive intervention. In addition, visual inspection of PET scans can render both positive and negative reads throughout a wide range of CL values.\nInitial studies to find optimal thresholds have been performed in populations recruited from clinical populations. This translates into samples with extreme values of both CSF A\u03b2 42 and amyloid PET, which is AD patients with high amyloid load vs normal cognitive with low amyloid load. This approximation results in defining an optimal cut-off based on a population with low number of individuals with intermediate values around putative threshold values, which may hamper rendering. A critical consideration when deriving such cut-offs is to appropriately populate amyloid values around the cut-offs to derive optimal and robust values. On the other hand, as CSF A\u03b2 42 levels start changing earlier than the PET signal, derivation of CL cut-off values against CSF in populations with initial amyloid abnormalities brings the opportunity to derive more sensitive, yet robust and generalizable, CL values associated to early amyloid accumulation.\nIn this study, we aimed at deriving optimal Centiloid threshold values in amyloid PET that maximize the agreement against established thresholds of CSF core AD biomarkers. To this end, we capitalized on the ALFA+ cohort of cognitively unimpaired individuals enriched for risk factors for AD [35] , and in order to improve the generalizability of our results, analogous data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; http://adni.loni.usc.edu/) was pooled with that originated in the ALFA+ cohort."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "ALFA+ is a nested longitudinal long-term study of the ALFA (for ALzheimer's and FAmilies) cohort [35] .

To be able to directly compare A\u03b2 42 measures from both cohorts, we had to transform ADNI data to account for pre-analytical conditions [30] . This transformation was only used to perform scatter plots but not to perform any other analysis, as each dataset had their own cut-offs for the CSF biomarkers (Additional file 1: Table S1 ).\nOptimal Centiloid cut-offs were calculated as those that maximized the Youden's J Index (YI) or the overall percentage agreement (OPA; \"accuracy\"). YI statistic consists of the summation of the sensitivity and specificity [36] , and the OPA reflects the percentage of cases with concordant binary classification with CSF and PET. Both were calculated on the pooled ALFA+ and ADNI data as a function of Centiloid values for A\u03b2 42 , phosphorylated tau (pTau), total tau (tTau), and pTau/A\u03b2 42 and tTau/A\u03b2 42 ratios. For each CSF biomarker as binary outcome, optimal cut-offs were selected as those showing the maximum value of one of the statistics after minimally smoothing true-positive, true-negative, false-positive and false-negative curves using the 'smooth' function in Matlab (v2018b) with the 'lowess' method and a span value of 0.1.\nOn top of YI and OPA, we also calculated the positive percentage agreement (PPA, \"sensitivity\") and negative percentage agreement (NPA, \"specificity\") and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.

Robustness of the Centiloid cut-offs were assessed by deriving them against more liberal CSF thresholds (higher for A\u03b2 42 and lower for tau, Additional file 1: Table S1 ). With this new CSF categorization, we wanted to include those participants that are close to the threshold but still classified as negative (\"grey zone\", [GZ] ). To calculate these new CSF thresholds, we add (or subtract) the 10% of the original threshold, as this slight variation in the CSF thresholds showed helping to reduce false negatives and to be strongly associated with future A\u03b2 42 positivity [37, 38] ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Demographic characteristics and CSF and amyloid biomarkers Table 1 shows demographics and characteristics of CSF and amyloid PET biomarkers in the two cohorts included, i.e. ALFA+ and ADNI, which have some differences.

By contrast, ADNI participants are in more advanced stages of the disease, with higher number of APOE-\u03b54 carriers and higher frequency of positive core AD CSF biomarkers (Table 1) . This also translates into a significant difference in both the mean and average of amyloid PET CL values between both cohorts.

The analysis against 10% CSF variations resulted in similar cut-offs with similar AUCs except for tTau cut-off resulting from OPA's maximization that lowered up to 15.9 CL (Additional file 1: Table S3 and Figure S2) . Finally, the behaviour of the cut-offs in the two cohorts separately was quite different with respect to tau over A\u03b2 42 ratios and resulted in lower AUCs than the optimal cut-off (Additional file 1: Figure S2 , S3 and, Table S4 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this paper, we sought to calculate the optimal Centiloid cut-off values from amyloid PET data to maximize the agreement against previously established thresholds for positivity on core AD CSF biomarkers. At a first glance, this might be regarded as a circular exercise, since these CSF cut-offs were originally derived to maximally concord with positive visual reading of PET scans. Under this rationale, all resulting Centiloid cut-offs would have be expected to fall in the range that optimally discriminates negative from positive visual reads, which is between 25 and 35 CL [25, 26] . On the contrary, optimal agreement for CSF A\u03b2 42 was observed for a cut-off of 12 CL. This seemingly unexpected result can be explained by the clearly non-linear relationship between amyloid PET Centiloids and CSF A\u03b2 42 , as previously reported [39] . Almost all subjects with CSF A\u03b2 42 over 1000 pg/ml showed Centiloid values below 20, and only for CSF values < 1000 pg/ml, a linear association could be intuited. This nonlinear association makes goodness criteria (both the Youden's Index and the overall percentage agreement) to plateau between 10 and 40 CL (Fig. 2) . Under these circumstances, to derive stable optimal cut-offs, it is critical to make use of a test sample comprising both sufficient concordant positive and negative cases as well as a good representation of individuals falling within intermediate amyloid ranges (10 < CL < 40 and 500 < CSF A\u03b2 42 < 1000 pg/ml). In this study, this was achieved by pooling the ADNI and ALFA+ datasets.\nThe independent derivation of optimal CSF A\u03b2 42 cut-offs in the two cohorts confirmed this rationale. In the ADNI sample, optimal values fell in the expected range of visual reads (between 33 and 36 CL) whereas the optimal threshold in the ALFA+ sample is closer to that in the pooled sample (between 5 and 11 CL). This result confirms that the derivation of optimal cut-offs is very sensitive to the recruitment strategy of the reference sample, with clinical ones rendering higher cut-offs than population based ones with a better representation around the range of values where cut-offs are expected to lay. Previous literature has suggested that CSF A\u03b2 42 values become positive before amyloid PET [21, 22] . This may be related to amyloid PET visual read and SUVRs cut-offs on clinical populations. In these populations, the visual read is performed in patients with either prodromal AD or dementia due to AD; hence, the amyloid load is supposed to have reached its ceiling. By contrast, the ALFA+ population reflects a cohort of early amyloid accumulators at risk for cognitive impairment; therefore, a positive visual read may be reached when amyloid is still not at its peak. Indeed, the threshold of 12 CL is robust against variations in the cut-off for CSF positivity (Additional file 1: Table S3 ) as well as if only the ALFA+ dataset is used for its derivation. Although 12 CL may initially be regarded as a low value for amyloid positivity, it matches recent reports of Centiloid cut-offs against postmortem measures of AD neuropathology showing that 12.2 CL optimally detected Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) moderate-to-frequent neuritic plaques, whereas 24.4 CL identified intermediate-to-high AD neuropathologic change (ADNC) differences [40] . Another similar study showed that a threshold < 10 CL was optimal for ruling out the presence of amyloid plaques, whereas CL > 20 suggests significant amyloid pathology [26] . However, we would like to point out that we did not want to affirm that the CL cut-offs found show amyloid pathology, but only to find those CL values that maximally agree with those of the CSF core AD biomarkers. The fact that the CL cut-offs derived in this study agree with a previous one done with neuropathological data is only a marker that these values might have an actual biological meaning, more than only a practical one. But this hypothesis should be tested in another work, preferably with longitudinal data.\nUnlike CSF A\u03b2 42 , for tau/CSF A\u03b2 42 ratios, the optimal CL cut-offs fell within the expected range (28) (29) (30) given the linear relationship between this biomarker and amyloid PET Centiloids. Indeed, tau/CSF A\u03b2 42 ratios showed higher AUC versus amyloid PET Centiloids than CSF A\u03b2 42 , in agreement with the previous reports [22, 27, 30, 31] . The higher capacity of tau/CSF A\u03b2 42 ratios to predict Centiloids may be accounted for by two different factors. On the one hand, CSF ratios may provide a more stable measurement than absolute values since they provide an inherent normalization against protein production and release to the CSF, between-individual variations in CSF dynamics, and pre-analytical conditions. Therefore, the lower variability in the CSF ratios may account for better AUCs. On the other hand, CSF A\u03b2 42 has been proposed to become abnormal prior to amyloid PET [21, 41] . This fact might stem from the fact that both techniques probe different pools of the amyloid protein. Therefore, the combination of measurements of A\u03b2 with those of tau, a pathological change that is expected to occur later in the AD continuum [41] , might show better agreement with amyloid PET, which is also expected to become abnormal later than CSF A\u03b2 42 .\nTogether with previous studies, the observed thresholds might be useful to flag two different inflection points in preclinical AD stages. A cut-off below 12 CL might be optimal to rule out-amyloid pathology, whereas a cut-off over 29 CL might be denoting established pathology. These kinds of thresholds have typically been used to dichotomize continuous values into two categories for clarity and ease of use. However, alternatives have also been considered and include the score of the severity of each biomarker on a semi-continuous scale as considered, for instance, in the A/T/N scheme [42] . Therefore, an option would be to categorize the full range of variation of biomarker values in three categories: one that excludes any pathology, another intermediate category that would indicate early and developing pathology and a third one that corresponds with established pathology.\nTwo goodness criteria have been used here to derive optimal cut-offs: the Youden's Index, which balances sensitivity and specificity, and the overall percentage agreement, which is sensitive to the percentages of positives versus negatives in the test sample. Both rendered very similar values and the Centiloid cut-offs proposed here are robust against variations in the threshold values for CSF positivity. Still, the Youden's index showed a more noisy behaviour than the overall percentage agreement, particularly in the analysis of the two individual samples. In order to obtain more robust estimates of [22, 30] ), and horizontal lines depict optimal cut-offs derived in this study (YI derived: green, OPA derived: yellow). Two outliers were excluded of this picture for having CL value higher than 200. Second row shows this cut-offs derivation by the maximization of YI (left) and OPA (right). The YI (green) was calculated from PPA (blue) and NPA (red) values. The OPA (green) was calculated from PPV (blue) and NPV (red) values. Derivation was done with participants of both cohorts merged. A\u03b2, amyloid; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; YI, Youden's J index; PPA, positive percentage agreement; NPA, negative percentage agreement; CL, Centiloids classification performance, more subjects across the full AD continuum would be needed. This is a relevant effect because in previous similar works, the Youden's Index has been typically selected as the reference measurement of agreement [22, 30, 31] . Hansson et al. [30] added reliability measures to performance metrics to derive optimal cut-offs. We handled the noisy behaviour of performance metrics by deriving optimal cut-offs after some minimal smoothing of the data. This approach proved to be efficacious to derive stable cut-offs even in the analysis of the individual cohorts.\nIrrespective of the approach to counter the effect of noisy agreement estimates, additional analysis with larger samples might be needed to yield more robust and generalizable cut-offs. To this end, future work will focus on pooling additional samples. In addition to a limited sample size, we rely on the comparability of PET and CSF measures across the two studied samples. While agreement on CSF data is certainly improved with the Elecsys\u00ae tests and with the use of the Centiloid method on PET scans, we cannot rule out the presence of a certain degree of sample-dependent bias in the data analysed. Still, when computing the cut-offs solely using the [22, 30] ), and horizontal line depicts optimal cut-offs derived in this study (YI and OPA derived cut-offs are equal).

The YI (green) was calculated from PPA (blue) and NPA (red) values. The OPA (green) was calculated from PPV (blue) and NPV (red) values. Derivation was done with participants of both cohorts merged. pTau, phosphorylated tau; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; YI, Youden's J index; PPA, positive percentage agreement; NPA, negative percentage agreement; CL, Centiloids ALFA+ cohort results were very similar, thus suggesting that any remaining bias is small and did not have a significant impact on our results. Another limitation may stem from the somewhat limited sample analysed here may not be sufficient to derive robust generalizable cut-off values. Additional analysis with bigger sample sizes and more amyloid PET tracers that the two used here may overcome this limitation.\nIn summary, we have derived optimal Centiloid values to maximize the agreement against core AD CSF biomarkers. Regarding A\u03b2, a relatively low value of 12 CL optimally corresponded to CSF A\u03b2 42 positivity, in line with Centiloid thresholds derived against post-mortem measures of AD neuropathology. On the other hand, CSF tau/A\u03b2 42 ratios were better predicted by a higher Centiloid cut-off of 29 CL, which is in line with those optimally discriminating positive from negative visual reads on PET scans. In agreement with previous reports, CSF tau/A\u03b2 42 ratios showed a higher capacity to predict amyloid PET Centiloids than CSF A\u03b2 42 . Overall, our results provide reference values in the Centiloid scale and suggest two relevant inflection points the development of early AD pathology across the full AD continuum.
