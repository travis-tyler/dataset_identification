The barrier island has continuously evolved in response to major storms, longer-term natural processes, and anthropogenic action (Douglass, 1994;Passeri and others, 2018;appendix 2). Some of the largest-scale changes to the island in recent history occurred following the passages of Hurricanes Ivan and Katrina in September 2004 and August 2005, respectively, when an approximately 2-kilometer (km)-wide breach formed (Froede, 2008;Martinez and others, 2011) and was subsequently closed in 2010 with a rubble rock mound. The 2-km-wide breach is referred to as \"Katrina Cut\" (fig. 1B). The area east of Katrina Cut is inhabited and consists of a narrow barrier island (just east of Katrina Cut) and it broadens to a wide, high-elevation region at the eastern terminus of the island (Douglass, 1994). The area just west of Katrina Cut is lower and narrower than other portions of the island, and broadens out to a wider platform at the western terminus of the island (Douglass, 1994). The area west of Katrina Cut is uninhabited and has evolved in response to natural processes over time, whereas the inhabited area to the east has been the location of beach nourishment and dune restoration actions to protect homes and infrastructure (Froede, 2010). To hindcast the evolution of Dauphin Island over decadal scales, a model framework was developed consisting of three individual models for capturing longshore transport with associated shoreline changes, foredune growth, and storm impacts to the beach and dunes. Longshore transport was modeled with the numerical model Delft3D (D3D; Deltares, 2019), which simulates waves, water levels, and morphologic changes to the entire island during more quiescent periods. Foredune growth for the uninhabited western half of Dauphin Island was modeled with an empirical dune growth model (EDGR), which increases the height and width of the foredune through time based on historical growth rates. Combined, these two models simulated island shoreline change, spit growth, and increase in island height through dune growth on monthly to yearly time scales. The impacts of tropical storm conditions were simulated with the numerical model XBeach (Roelvink and others, 2009). XBeach simulates storm waves, storm surge, and morphological erosion processes on hourly to daily time scales.

The initial configuration of the island, nearshore areas, and offshore bathymetry for the hindcast simulation consisted of topography and bathymetry measurements from the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) Coastal National Elevation Database and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Geophysical Data Center, along with lidar-derived elevations from September 2004 following Hurricane Ivan; the September 2004 survey provided elevation data where available, with the closer dated survey data filling spatial gaps in this post storm survey (Jenkins and others, 2020). Coincident nearshore bathymetry was not available at this time; therefore, the additional bathymetry data was taken from the final bathymetry from validated XBeach simulations of Hurricane Ivan and Hurricane Katrina at Dauphin Island by Passeri and others (2018), which provides more up-to-date nearshore bathymetry for this area (Jenkins and others, 2020).

Information on grid configuration as well as testing and validation of the D3D configuration using deterministic runs over multiple time periods is provided in Jenkins and others (2020). For model simulations in the coupled model framework to be computationally feasible on monthly to yearly time scales, D3D used the mormerge configuration (D3DMM), which simultaneously simulates waves, flow, and sediment transport associated with a wave climatology (Benedet, 2016;Deltares, 2019). The wave climatology for the D3DMM configuration was derived from data produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ReAnalysis-Interim (ERA) model, while the morphological tide was derived from water-level data at the Dauphin Island tide gauge ( fig. 1) and processed following Lesser (2009).

The model process evolved the foredune of each island profile based on empirical growth curves parameterized with terminal dune height and location data (appendix 2). Growth rates for the dune height were based on the sigmoid growth curves of Houser and others (2015) that are derived from foredune changes observed in the lidar elevations over the decadal timespan of the surveys, specifically September 2004 to the beginning of 2015. Growth rates for the foredune width were based on the linear relationship between dune height and width obtained from the Gaussian fits of observed foredune morphologies (appendix 2). EDGR was used to evolve the foredune for each model grid crossshore profile along Dauphin Island from the western spit to the eastern side of the Katrina Cut and along the length of Pelican Island ( fig. 1B). Dune evolution in the inhabited portion of the island has historically been dominated by anthropogenic processes outside the scope of EDGR, so natural dune growth in this region was not modelled in the framework. Due to the orientation and relatively coarse cross-shore resolution of Pelican Island in the D3D/EDGR grid, cross-shore profiles for this location were interpolated to 5-m resolution prior to running EDGR, then interpolated back into the D3D/EDGR model grid after applying dune growth. For the hindcast simulation, EDGR was setup using the same growth rate (0.53 meters per year) and dune growth reset thresholds (0.25 meters [m]) as described in appendix 2. Conversely, the linear-fit slope of dune heights versus dune widths, and the y-intercept for the Dauphin Island portion of the grid (m dWdH and b dWdH in appendix 2) were calculated from the 14 lidar surveys to be 4.2 m and 13.5 m, respectively; for Pelican Island the values were calculated to be 27.56 m and 2.95 m, respectively. These linear-fit values were calibrated for the growth only unlike the case in appendix 2 that calibrated using growth and erosion. The terminal dune heights and distance from shore were selected from the 2015 lidar survey (Thompson and others, 2017)."}, {"section_title": "XBeach Model Operation", "text": "XBeach is a coupled 2DH (two dimensional in the horizontal plane) model that was developed to simulate nearshore, dune and barrier island response to storm events. The model concurrently solves wave-group scale equations for roller energy, time-dependent short-wave action balance, nonlinear shallow water mass and momentum, and sediment transport (Roelvink and others, 2009). XBeach has been validated in previous studies that were aimed at determining erosional responses of barrier islands to major storm events in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Lindemer and others, 2010;McCall and others, 2010;Sherwood and others, 2014). The model grid varied in cross-shore resolution with a minimum of 3 m across the subaerial island and a maximum of 12.5 m offshore, with uniform alongshore resolution of 25 m for the entire domain, with spatially varying bottom friction coefficients. The grid formulation and derivation of bottom friction values are described in Passeri and others (2018)."}, {"section_title": "Model Forcing with Synthetic Storms", "text": "To allow the model framework being developed to also be used to forecast future scenarios, boundary conditions for storm events were not taken from the historical record. Instead, a suite of synthetic storms provided by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and derived using the Joint Probability Method-Optimal Sampling (JPM-OS) approach were used as boundary conditions for XBeach. The JPM-OS set of 295 synthetic storms was originally developed to simulate the flooding impact of tropical storms that made landfall within 200 km of Alabama's barrier islands and mainland coast (FEMA, 2014). More information on the JPM and JPM-OS approaches for storm climatology and how the storm conditions were modeled for flood risk can be found in Slinn (2008), Niedoroda and others (2010), Toro and others (2010), and Nadal-Caraballo and others (2015). Model domain for all XBeach simulations. The DEM here is the pre-Hurricane Ivan (September, 2004) Dauphin Island elevations generated by Passeri and others (2018). Abbreviations: DEM, digital elevation model. For each of the seven tropical storms that made landfall within 200 km of Dauphin Island during the years of 2004 to 2015, the timespan of our decadal hindcast (table 1), a synthetic storm was selected as a best-match to the historic event and used to provide boundary conditions to XBeach for simulation on the model domain shown in figure 3. The total water level (TWL), defined as the combination of storm surge, tide, and wave induced water levels (wave setup and swash excursion, collectively called run-up), was chosen as the best-match comparison parameter because of the established relationship between TWL and barrier island response during storms (Sallenger, 2000). Wave run-up for the historic storms was calculated following Stockdon and others (2006) from ERA wave data using significant wave height (H s ) and dominant (peak) wave period (T p ) that were extracted from a point offshore of Dauphin Island (fig. 4B red circle with asterisk; water depth of ~15 m) and an island-wide mean foreshore beach slope of 0.04 (data from Doran and others [2017]; averaging method from Doran and others [2015]). The still water level, taken from a merged tide/surge record using input from the Dauphin Island, Ala., tide gauge ( fig. 1; NOAA tide station 8735180) and the Pensacola, Fla., tide gauge ( fig. 1; NOAA tide station 8729840) (merging details in Mickey and others [2017]; datum corrected from MSL to NAVD88) was added to the estimated wave run-up. Since the synthetic storms in the database do not include tides, the predicted astronomical tide was removed from the observed TWL timeseries for each storm event. Storm events were isolated in the TWL timeseries based on the landfall date provided from the National Hurricane Center's hurricane database (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Hurricane Research Division, 2018), with each event including 4 days prior to and 2 days after the landfall date. The TWL for each synthetic storm was also calculated following Stockdon and others (2006), using the same beach slope, wave data, and still water-level information from the same location as for the historic storms. Out of the synthetic storms provided, four synthetic storms were removed due to data gaps in the time series. The method for determining which synthetic storm best represented the observed storm events required a two-fold analysis of time series comparisons. First, the best alignment in time of each synthetic storm to a given observed storm was identified by translating the 4-day time series of TWL for each synthetic storm along the 6-day time series of TWL for each observed event until the maximum difference (over all times) between the two time-series was minimized (equation 1): ( 1)where \u03b7 s is the full 4-day synthetic storm TWL; \u03b7 o is the full 6-day observed TWL; t is the time step starting at 0 and increasing to [t max,obs -length of \u03b7 s ]; \u03c4 is the difference in time t 0 to t \u03b7s ; and \u03b7 diff is the lowest absolute maximum difference between \u03b7 s and \u03b7 o with best alignment in time (t 0 = \u03c4). The synthetic storm time series moves along the time axis of the observed event time series one step (t) at a time and the maximum difference for the time series of each step is recorded. After the last functional time-step for matching is reached, the maximum absolute difference of all sections is analyzed to find the minimum value (\u03b7 diff ) for the synthetic storm time series. After each synthetic storm has been aligned in time to the observed time-series, the second step of the matching process calculates the weighted sum of difference (WSD) (equation 2): (2) where TWL Obs is the 4-day window of the observed TWL extracted from step 1; TWL SS is the synthetic storm TWL; and WSD is the sum of differences between the entire TWL time series of the synthetic storm and observed events. The synthetic storm that has the lowest WSD for the observed event is designated the best representative storm for the observed event. This process was repeated for each of the seven storms identified during the hindcast period (table 1). Since the synthetic storms do not include tides, the water level contribution from tidal variability needed to be added. To enable the methodology to be used in future applications (such as forecasts) where observed tides are unavailable, the morphologic tide derived for D3D was aligned in time to the observed time for each event and added to the boundary condition water levels for each synthetic storm. The morphological tide consists of 99 15-minute timesteps that represent 99 possible starting water elevations. For each possible start index into the morphological tide, the sum of the absolute difference between the 4-day observed astronomical tide and a 4-day instance of the morphologic tide sequence was calculated. The timestep within the 99 timestep sequence with the smallest sum of absolute difference was considered the best starting point. For each synthetic storm, water level forcing was applied uniformly to the offshore and bayside boundary."}, {"section_title": "Model Boundary Wave Forcing Configuration", "text": "A suite of deterministic runs for Hurricanes Ivan and Katrina were simulated using boundary conditions extracted from an alternate parent grid with more complete spatial coverage that was developed under the Mississippi Coastal Improvements Program (MsCIP; Walstra and others, 2012). This sensitivity testing used the respective pre-storm DEMs ( fig. 4) and the friction coefficient of Passeri and others (2018). For the sensitivity analysis, simulations were conducted using wave conditions extracted along the full XBeach boundary, representing the best possible prediction with the given inputs. Alternate boundary condition configurations were then extracted from the MsCIP output corresponding to configurations that could be created using the more limited synthetic storm boundary conditions (table 2). Tides and water levels for these deterministic simulations were applied at the four corners of the XBeach model domain and derived from the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM3) model (Luettich and others 1992; Dietrich and others, 2011; Bilskie and others, 2016; described in Passeri and others, 2018). Potential model boundary configurations were evaluated based on the comparison of simulated topographic changes to observed changes derived from lidar surveys for the western half of the island (west of Katrina Cut; west of longitude -88.225\u00ba). The model bias, root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficients of determination (R 2 ) were calculated and are presented in table 2 for each boundary setup simulation. The calculated model bias, RMSE, and R 2 for all the model boundary sensitivity simulations were within a range of less than 0.1 m of each other (table 2).

Dune growth over the concurrent period was then modeled with EDGR using the final DEM from D3DMM as the initial condition, such that the dune growth was in addition to the nearshore changes predicted with D3DMM. After foredunes were increased with EDGR, the D3DMM DEM was interpolated to the XBeach domain and the representative synthetic storm that best-matched the observed storm was simulated. Once the synthetic storm simulation was complete, the final XBeach DEM was interpolated back to the D3DMM domain. In addition, the post-storm EDGR analysis was conducted to identify which, if any, of the crossshore transects had become sub-aerial due to island overwash or if enough erosion of dunes had occurred to reset dune growth (see appendix 2). After the post-storm EDGR analysis, the subsequent quiescent period was simulated with D3DMM and EDGR, with the process continuing until the end of the decadal simulation. In cases where multiple storm events occurred in less than a one-year period, they were modeled consecutively with XBeach, with the EDGR post-storm analysis performed after each individual storm. In October 2007, a berm was built on the east side of Katrina Cut in front of houses along the beach (Froede, 2010). This feature was added to the D3DMM and XBeach model domains at that time in the simulation. Additionally, in May 2011, the rubble mound feature that closed Katrina Cut (Martinez, 2011) was added to both the D3DMM and XBeach model domains as a non-erodible structure and persisted as such throughout the rest of the decadal simulation.

The comparison's statistical analyses were limited to the approximately 7 km section of the island directly west of Katrina Cut (alongshore distance from 4.5 to 12 km; fig. 5), but did not include the spit to exclude uncertainty related to (1) anthropogenic influence that is prevalent on the eastern portion of the barrier island and (2) the extremely dynamic western spit. Shorelines were defined as the location of the mean high-water line at the 0.23 m (NAVD88) contour around the island (Weber and others, 2005). Lidar-derived shorelines and dune locations were interpolated to the D3DMM Dauphin Island grid for comparison. These lidar features were previously extracted as part of the research mission of the National Assessment of Coastal Change Hazards (Doran and others, 2017). If there was a lidar-derived feature (shoreline or dune crest) within 20 m alongshore of any of the model's cross-shore grid lines, the intersection of the alongshore feature line (20 m buffer) and the cross-shore model grid line was taken as the interpolated location.

The average RMSE for Gulf shoreline locations over all surveys was approximately 59 m. The difference in Sound shoreline locations was more variable over the decadal period and 5 of the 14 surveys did not include the back portion of the island; thus, no comparison could be made. The average RMSE for Sound shoreline locations over the decadal period was approximately 70 m. The differences in dune crest locations were also highly variable and the average RMSE was 76 m. The extreme differences in dune crest locations for the model comparison to the second and third lidar surveys, immediately post-Hurricane Katrina (landfall 08/2005 with survey dates 09/2005 and 03/2006), were likely because the highest elevation point in the model DEM was a feature from a remnant dune ridge/ swale system illustrated by the model D hi locations positioned close to the northern side of the island (figs. 1-2 and 1-3 in appendix 1). This also would account for the decreasing RMSEs as survey comparisons progress through the decadal simulation; EDGR only builds up the foredune, while the ridge/swale features do not accrete new sediment, thus the foredune becomes the highest elevation point of each cross-shore profile so that the model and lidar D hi values are both identifying the same feature (table 4). Comparison of dune crest elevations was the least variable over the decadal period with a range of RMSEs between 0.5 m and 1 m, with an average of 0.75 m. This comparison excludes the year 2004 as the initial lidar survey was used to generate the initial model DEM."}, {"section_title": "Model Uncertainty and Sensitivity", "text": "Included below is a discussion of identified sources of model uncertainty contributing to the differences between predicted and observed island evolution. Also included are sensitivity analyses that were conducted to optimize the configuration of individual model components."}, {"section_title": "Coupled Model Framework Uncertainty", "text": "Several simplifications were made to the coupled modeling approach utilized in hindcasting Dauphin Island, primarily due to limitations in capacity of existing models and the need for computational efficiency; the most relevant to the decadal time-scale of the coupled model framework are described here. In the D3DMM application, local winds were not included; this had minimal impact on model prediction accuracy for the Gulf-facing shoreline but limited the accuracy of the model in predicting redistribution of back barrier sediments and storm induced overwash deposits (Jenkins and others, 2020). Exclusion of local winds combined with the north/ south orientation of Little Dauphin and the relatively coarse along-shore resolution of the model grid ( fig. 1B) increased the error at this location, which is relatively sheltered from open-ocean waves. Within the XBeach model domain, waves were only applied to the offshore boundary, thus the north to south orientation of Little Dauphin Island and its proximity to the lateral-boundary limit model accuracy in predicting wave propagation to this area ( fig. 3). Errors in XBeach model predictions are also likely to be greater in low-lying areas of Dauphin Island, such as the low area on the western side of Katrina Cut and the terminal spit at the western end of the island; as elevations approach tipping points for overwash and inundation (Sallenger, 2000), small errors in antecedent morphology or offshore forcing will result in relatively large errors in predictions of post-storm morphology. This may also account for the stark differences in lidar-model comparisons immediately following Hurricane Katrina. Within EDGR, aeolian transport processes are not linked to dune growth; therefore, changes to the island that impact the location or growth rate of dunes, such as the development of a wider beach or vegetation establishment, will not be captured. Additionally, there is no mechanism in this modeling approach for the development of dune ridges and swales on the back barrier of the island."}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity Analysis -Synthetic Storms", "text": "JPM-OS synthetic storm output was provided at a spatial resolution of approximately 4 km in the alongshore and approximately 5.5 km in the cross-shore directions over a region spanning across the northern Gulf of Mexico and Mobile Bay (from -88.25\u00ba to -87.7\u00ba longitude and 30.08\u00ba to 31.1\u00ba latitude). The synthetic storm output provided significant wave height (H s ), peak wave period (T p ), mean wave direction, and storm surge levels over the course of a 4-day period leading up to landfall. This domain does not cover the entirety of the XBeach model domain used in this study, therefore waves could not be prescribed along the full length of the offshore boundary. In addition, due to the hydrodynamic data terminating upon landfall some of the synthetic storms were found to have wave height time series that ended when waves were still high (>2 m) and (or) before the peak of the storm; and some had an abrupt increase from low to high wave heights without a smooth ramp-up period. Sensitivity tests were performed to determine which grid points to extract XBeach wave boundary conditions, to evaluate procedures for applying waves at the offshore boundary, and to identify if wave time-series which lacked a ramp-up or ramp-down period in wave energy needed to be extrapolated in time to include these portions of the storm."}, {"section_title": "Synthetic Storm Time-Series Extension", "text": "The synthetic storm simulations in the northern Gulf of Mexico were available for a 4-day period leading up to storm landfall. Variation in the location of landfall led to differences in the timing of storm peak conditions over the 4-day time series that exists for each storm. Preliminary evaluation of the synthetic storm wave-characteristic time series indicated that some of the storms could potentially lead to unrealistic morphodynamic prediction results; specifically, several of the H s time series were found to end when waves had not returned to pre-storm conditions. A total of 52 storms were observed to have H s at the end of the time series between 2-3 m; 10 storms were observed to end with H s between 3-4 m; and 9 storms were observed to end with H s over 4 m. Of those 71 storms, three were observed to have H s ending before the peak of the storm (wave heights still increasing at the time of landfall). To test the sensitivity of model predictions to these truncated wave time series, simulations were conducted using synthetic storm 189 (SS 189) which had H s time series ending with waves greater than 3 m (fig. 6A). The baseline wave time series for SS 189 was extended by extrapolation using the slope of the line after the peak of the storm for H s , T p , wave direction, and water level until H s reached pre-storm levels. The original SS 189 conditions and the extended version were simulated on the pre-Hurricane Ivan DEM and compared; minimal morphodynamic change was found to have occurred during the post-storm ramp-down added to the baseline simulation ( fig. 7A). Only one synthetic storm with wave heights greater than 3 m at the end of the time series was chosen as a best match to any of the observed storm events; SS 189 best matched to Hurricane Ida (table 1).  Synthetic storms were also identified wherein small waves abruptly increased in wave height, sometimes increasing by roughly 1 m over less than 3 hours before normal storm rampup began. To examine if these abrupt changes in H s would have any effect on island morphology, synthetic storm 115 (SS 115) was simulated, which had an increase in H s of about 1 m over the course of 1 hour ( fig. 6B) with 0 m waves in the first 28 hours (the first 28 hours were removed because XBeach requires some wave input greater than 0 m for simulation). This synthetic storm was also simulated on the pre-Hurricane Ivan DEM.

Hindcast average errors (RMSE) for Gulf shoreline location, Sound shoreline location, dune location, and dune height were 59 m, 70 m, 76 m, and 0.75 m, respectively.

Dauphin Island training data set, the nonlinear fitting algorithm robustly converged on a solution with the island and dunes each approximated by individual Gaussians. Gaussian basis set decomposition is also applied to the initial Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for the time period and site of interest to identify an existing foredune and initialize the model. EDGR then evolves the foredune Gaussian curve using the Houser and others (2015) formulation for dune elevation and newly-derived empirical formulations for dune width and, in the case of incipient dune formation, distance to shore. EDGR can forecast dune change (or hindcast an area with limited historical data) assuming predicted dune evolution is expected to be statistically similar to dune growth in the historical data set used to parameterize the model. The model can run standalone or coupled to an external model predicting dune erosion and (or) the evolution of island characteristics other than the foredune."}, {"section_title": "Model Initialization and Prediction", "text": "At each longshore location (x) in the initial DEM, EDGR decomposes the observed cross-shore profile (Z E (x,y,t)) into a basis set of Gaussian curves (Z G,n (x,y,t 1 ), where \"n\" enumerates each curve defined by their height (G high,n (x,t 1 )), full width at half maximum (G wide,n (x,t 1 )), and location (G Y,n (x,t 1 )) as: ( 1)where 2and \u03b5(x,y) describes the fit deviation (error). Each profile is first approximated with a single Gaussian curve through nonlinear regression. The initial values for curve height, width, and location are chosen as the maximum profile elevation, island width, and halfway between the Gulf and Bay shoreline positions, respectively, such that the fit will converge on the island platform (Z G,Is (x,y); fig. 2-1). Dune or berm features are then identified as local maxima (y peak ) within \u03b5(x,y). Additional Gaussians representing these features are sequentially added at the local peak with maximum fit deviation until the fit deviation at all peaks is below a prescribed threshold (\u03b5(x,y peak ) < \u03b5 max ) or a user-specified maximum number of additional Gaussians has been applied (n max ). The value of n max may be specified to expedite model run-time if site-specific sensitivity testing determines that the foredune can be robustly identified with a fixed number of Gaussians. The Gaussian curve representing the foredune (Z G,D (x,y,t 1 )) is identified as the fitted peak closest to the Gulf shoreline, but may be manually adjusted to a different peak if a berm feature has been incorrectly identified as the foredune. EDGR then calculates the residual island profile (Z R (x,y,t 1 )) by subtracting the identified foredune Gaussian curve from the total elevation profile as: (3) At subsequent time steps (t), equation 3 is reversed such that the cross-shore profile at each longshore location is generated by adding the EDGR-predicted foredune Gaussian curve to the residual profile as: 4The foredune Gaussian evolves through time via growth of its height and width, while dune position is fixed throughout the model run. The model time-step can be set to resolve observational data or meet forecast requirements, and will be monthly or yearly in most cases given typical dune growth rates. Dune height in EDGR follows the sigmoid growth curve of Houser and others (2015, hereafter referred to as \"Houser2015\"), which predicts the total maximum elevation of the foredune (D high ) as a function of the longshore-variable initial dune elevation (D high,0 ), terminal dune elevation (D high,F ), growth rate (r), and time of incipient dune formation (t 0 ) as: 5The height of the Gaussian curve at each longshore location and time is calculated from this predicted total dune elevation by subtracting off the residual elevation profile at the location of dune formation (G Y (x)) as: 6The width of the foredune Gaussian (G wide ) is then calculated as a linear function of the height of the foredune Gaussian (G high ) with prescribed values for slope (m dWdH ) and y-intercept (b dWdH ) as: 7EDGR reconstructs each cross-shore profile after calculating D high , G high , and G wide for the prediction time and adding the dune curve to the residual island profile (equation 4). Because EDGR is formulated as a dune growth model, it is not allowed to reduce the elevation at any location (for example, to predict erosion). Therefore, the last step is to adjust the profile to the initial condition at any location where application of the Gaussian foredune reduced the elevation. Because EDGR independently operates on each cross-shore profile, there are no constraints on the longshore resolution or scale of the model domain. The cross-shore resolution of the DEM must be sufficient to resolve the dune feature (order of meters), and the entire island must be within the domain to allow for Gaussian curve fitting of the island platform. The profile is first modelled with a single Gaussian representing the island platform (Z G,Is (x,y)). Gaussians representing the foredune (Z G,D (x,y,t 1 )) and other dune or berm features, if present, are added sequentially at peaks in the maximum fit deviation until a user-defined threshold for goodness-of-fit is achieved (\u03b5(x,y peak ) < \u03b5 max ). The residual island (Z R (x,y,t 1 )) is the elevation profile excluding the existing foredune, if present (equation 3). B, The foredune height (D high (x,t)) at time t is calculated following Houser2015 (equation 5) and used to calculate the corresponding Gaussian height (G high (x,t); equation 6) based on the initial (D high,0 (x)) and terminal (D high,F (x)) dune height. C, The foredune Gaussian width (G wide (x,t)) is calculated from G high (x,t) (equation 7). D, The updated cross-shore profile (Z E (x,y,t)) is created by adding the updated foredune Gaussian (Z G,D (x,y,t)) to Z R (x,y,t 1 ) at the cross-shore position of the dune Gaussian (G Y ) (equation 4). Abbreviations: DEM, digital elevation model; m, meters."}, {"section_title": "Definition of Model Parameters", "text": "Model parameters (D high,F , G Y , r, m dWdH , b dWdH ) are derived from historical data, where the foredune in each cross-shore profile of a given survey is identified through Gaussian basis set decomposition. Data from the specific site and time period being modelled can be used in cases when EDGR is filling temporal gaps between available surveys. Model parameters may alternately be derived from template (proxy) data under the assumption that growth will be similar for the modelled dunes. EDGR includes two possible options for imposing D high,F . In the first, a known longshore distribution of D high,F values is prescribed. This mode of operation is applicable to hindcasting island evolution over a period of time when the terminal (recovered) dune state is known. In the second method, data for dune growth associated with recovery from a different storm or at another location is used as a template. This method assumes that the forcing mechanisms of dune formation and growth (sediment supply, winds, vegetation types, etc.) for the site and time period of interest are similar to those of the template even as small-scale spatial variation in, for example, vegetation alters the precise longshore distribution of D high,F . In this case, the longshore distribution of D high,F for the template is decomposed into its component wavenumber contributions (for example, spatial harmonics) via fast Fourier transform (FFT) (Brigham, 1998). The phases of the wavenumbers are then randomized and an inverse FFT is applied to reconstruct a new longshore distribution of D high,F . If there are spatial trends or other patterns in the template D high,F that are expected to recur in the modeled case, they may be subtracted prior to FFT application and added back to the final distribution. The FFT randomization mode allows multiple realizations of the longshore pattern of dune height to be generated, each of which preserves the mean, standard deviation, and spatial scales of variability of the template data. When operating in a forecast model, these realizations provide realistic spatial variability as well as uncertainty estimates for model predictions. Similar options are available for imposing cross-shore position of the dune Gaussian (G Y ). Values can be prescribed if dunes have already begun to establish in the initial DEM or in the case of a hindcast where the terminal dune location is known (G Y = D Y ). Dune position may also be estimated from template values using the FFT methodology described for D high,F if, for example, the initial DEM is a post-storm case where dunes have been completely destroyed. Because of the potential for overwash processes to cause island rollover and migration of the barrier island toward the mainland, foredune location in the FFT case is referenced as distance (\u0394 SL,0 ) to the post-storm shoreline (SL Y ) as 8Dune and shoreline position in the template case are smoothed in the longshore with a 100-m Hanning filter to remove high-frequency variation prior to calculating \u0394 SL , 0 . After \u0394 SL , 0 is randomized via the FFT method described above, it is used to calculate G Y from the shoreline location in the initial DEM, also smoothed with a 100-m Hanning filter. Once the dune position is fixed, it remains constant until and unless the dune is subsequently destroyed again at that longshore location. Growth rates (r) are estimated using nonlinear regression of the Houser2015 model onto dune growth within the historical data set. G high and G wide are extracted via identification of the foredune through Gaussian basis set decomposition (equations 3, 4; fig. 2-1) of available cross-shore profiles. The parameters m dWdH and b dWdH are then derived from a linear model fit to these values. D high,0 values are taken as the elevation at G Y at initialization time t 0 (x). Cross-shore profiles may have different initialization times if, for example, only a portion of the island was overwashed during a storm."}, {"section_title": "EDGR in a Coupled Model Framework", "text": "EDGR can be coupled to an external model for updating the island's response to storms, longshore sediment transport, or other processes apart from foredune growth. The information from the external model is incorporated into EDGR in two ways. First, the external model can be used to evolve aspects of the profile that EDGR does not alter, such as changes to the oceanfacing and back barrier shorelines. In this case, the residual island profile becomes time-variant and is updated (following equations 1-3) whenever output is provided from the coupled model. After EDGR modifies the dune and constructs updated profiles (equation 4), the DEM is passed back to the external model. If the external model (or data) captures dune erosion, this information is used to identify if dune growth should be reset to t 0 ( fig. 2-2). EDGR is initialized prior to running the external model in order to identify the location of the foredune at each cross-shore profile. EDGR may also be used to update the DEM if, for example, the available lidar for running a storm-impact model such as XBeach (Roelvink and others, 2009) is outdated. After the eroded DEM is passed back to EDGR, elevation loss at the location of the foredune within each profile is evaluated to determine if it exceeds a user-prescribed threshold (\u0394Z(x,G Y ) > \u0394 Dhigh,max ), which should be chosen as a value larger than the vertical uncertainty in the external dune erosion model. If this occurs, dune growth in EDGR is reset back to t = t 0 and dune location is updated. G Y is set to the location of maximum elevation in the remnant dune if one remains. If the dune was completely destroyed, the dune is repositioned based on distance to the post-storm shoreline (G Y = SL Y + \u0394 SL,0 ), if that location is subaerial. Otherwise, G Y is placed at the location of maximum elevation in the subaerial island. The value of D high,0 is set to the elevation of the profile at G Y . EDGR stops dune growth at any fully subaqueous longshore location and starts dune growth at new subaerial locations (for example, growth of a terminal spit). Figure 2-2. EDGR workflow for each time step when coupled with an external model to predict dune erosion. Examples of models that may be coupled with EDGR include those that can capture dune erosion during storms (for example, XBeach (Roelvink and others, 2009)) or models for predicting shoreline change due to longshore transport (for example, Delft3D (Lesser and others, 2004))."}, {"section_title": "Study Site and Observational Data", "text": "To test EDGR's predictive skill and evaluate how the model can improve understanding of the processes that control dune growth, a data set was required that contained years (to decades) of dune cross-shore elevation profile recovery following a storm event. One location where such data exist is Dauphin Island, Alabama, a barrier island in the northern Gulf of Mexico ( fig. 1B). The eastern half of the island is inhabited and has been the site of multiple coastal restoration projects (nourishment; seawalls and groins at some locations). The current study focused on the uninhabited western portion of the island, extending from the western terminus to the boundary of what is now Katrina Cut (fig. 1B). The study site is characterized by dissipative sandy beaches and 2 to 4 meter (m) high foredunes that have historically overwashed or inundated during major storm events (Watkins, 2011). The coast is wave-dominated and microtidal, with a diurnal cycle and tide range of 0.37 m (Douglass, 1994). The mean annual wind speed in the vicinity of of Dauphin Island is 1.15 meters per second (m/s) toward the southwest (255\u00ba relative to north). There is noticable seasonable variation in wind climate, which will result in similar variability in Aeolian transport. Offshore winds to the southwest tend to dominate in the fall and winter, with dominant winds to the northwest in spring and weaker, onshore winds during the summer (Guti\u00e9rrez de Velasco and Winant, 1996;Dzwonkowski and Park, 2010). The western portion of the island predominantly consists of beach, intertidal flat, meadow, scrub, and dune habitat, with some back barrier marsh areas; dunes are bare or covered in herbaceous vegetation (Enwright and others, 2017). This study focused on the time period of August, 2005, to January, 2015. During this period, a total of 7 tropical storms and hurricanes passed within 200 kilometers (km) of Dauphin Island ( fig. 2-3; https://coast.noaa.gov/hurricanes/). These storms caused dune erosion and, less frequently, overwash and inundation of the island (Douglass, 1994;Sallenger, 2000;Morton, 2008). The largest storm in the study period was Hurricane Katrina, which passed approximately 200 km to the southwest of Dauphin Island in August, 2005, as a major storm (category 5 weakening to a category 3 just prior to landfall). Katrina resulted in widespread total dune loss, in part due to impacts sustained during Hurricane Ivan in September, 2004 (Passeri and others, 2018). The relatively low central portion of the island breached and a 2-km-wide tidal channel opened (Froede, 2006;Froede, 2008). In 2010, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers installed a rock wall to close the breach, and dominant longshore transport (east to west) (Douglass, 1994;Morton and others, 2004) has subsequently rebuilt the island in front of the structure. Since Katrina, total dune loss has been confined to isolated areas of the island. A total of 12 topographic lidar elevation surveys were available for model parameterization and assessment during the study period ( fig. 2-3). Initial evaluation of these surveys revealed systematic vertical offsets that were corrected to a common datum. Thompson and others (2017) contains a detailed description of the offset correction method along with descriptions of the datasets and their corrections through 2013. The 2014 lidar data are available on the NOAA Digital Coast web site at https://coast.noaa.gov/htdata/lidar1_z/geoid12b/data/4966 and were corrected for a -0.23-m offset, and the 2015 lidar data are available at https://nationalmap.gov/ index.html and were corrected for a -0.01-m offset. Corrected data for each survey were interpolated to shore-normal transects with 2.5-m cross-shore resolution and 5-m longshore resolution."}, {"section_title": "Model Application at Dauphin Island", "text": "The study area was split into four analysis regions based on longshore variability in the 2005 and 2015 elevation data. From west to east those regions were R1, the wide western terminus of the island; R2, a somewhat narrower portion of the island associated with overwash fans in 2005 that approached or reached the bay shoreline; R3, a narrow portion of the island that incurred numerous small breaches during Katrina; and R4, the eastern portion of the study domain ( fig. 2-4). . An additional survey of Dauphin Island in July, 2010, was evaluated and excluded from analysis due to sparse coverage. Available first-return lidar surveys from 1998-2004 were excluded since bare earth elevations could not be robustly differentiated from vegetation. Also shown are tropical storms and hurricanes that passed within 200 kilometers of Dauphin Island (black dots). B, Percentage of cross-shore profiles within each analysis region ( fig. 2-4) with D high elevation loss (\u0394D high ) exceeding 0.25 meters (m) compared to the previous survey. EDGR operated standalone with D high,F and G Y taken as dune height and position in the 2015 lidar survey. This configuration tested the skill of the model at capturing the complete cross-shore dune profile, as well as predicting the dune height between the initial and prescribed terminal value. Distance to shore was referenced to the 0.5-m contour in the 2005 lidar survey to allow inclusion of profiles with incomplete coverage of the intertidal zone. Dune height and position were extracted from the 2005 lidar survey as the point of maximum island elevation. EDGR time steps were chosen such that the model generated output at the times of the observed lidar survey ( fig. 2-3, time step of several months to upwards of two years). The longshore and cross-shore resolution of the model matched the gridded lidar (2.5-m cross-shore resolution and 5-m longshore resolution).

Z max toward the eastern end of the study site (R3-R4) was also associated with overwash deposits in 2005, but widespread erosion and a narrower island platform reduced the average distance to shore to 59 to 65 m. By 2015, Z max throughout most of the analysis region was associated with a developed foredune located a relatively consistent distance from the 2005 shoreline (mean \u0394 Zmax,SL0 of 65 to 85 m). At locations where foredune growth was limited or absent (218 profiles, corresponding to 11 percent of the domain), Z max was associated with either a low (1 to 1.5 m) berm near the shoreline or a relic overwash deposit toward the bay side of the island. 75 percent of profiles without a dune in 2015 were located in R3, with the fragmented foredune structure reflected in relatively high longshore variability in both elevation and cross-shore position of Z max compared to the other analysis regions (table 2-1). Table 2-1. Longshore mean and standard deviation of maximum elevation (Z max ) for cross-shore transects within each of the analysis regions (R1-R4; fig. 2-4) for the 2005 and 2015 lidar survey. [D Zmax,SL0 is the distance to the 2005 shoreline, taken as the 0.5-meter (m) contour to allow inclusion of transects with incomplete lidar coverage of the intertidal zone. Also shown for each of the analysis regions are the mean and standard deviation of model parameters (initial elevation, D high,0 ; terminal elevation, D high,F ; growth rate, r; distance to the 2005 shoreline, D SL,0 ; and m dWdH and b dWdH , the slope and y-intercept of the linear model used to estimate foredune Gaussian width from height. Abbreviations: EDGR, empirical dune growth model; m/yr, meters per year] Parameters for the EDGR model were derived using dune growth from 2005 to 2015 (table 2-1). D high,0 , D high,F , and r values were extracted for each cross-shore profile by nonlinear regression of the Houser2015 model (equation 5) to the elevation change at the cross-shore position of D high in the established dunes in 2015. The longshore mean of D high,F for R1-R4 ranged from 2.25 to 3.05 m, noting that these values are higher than for Z max due to the exclusion of profiles lacking an identifiable foredune in the 2015 survey. Mean growth rates were similar across R1-R4 (0.45-0.58 m/yr), but varied considerably within each region (standard deviation of 0.17-0.40 m/yr). In all model configurations, the mean value of r across all regions (0.53 m/yr) was prescribed. The slope of the dune width to height relationship was somewhat steeper for the narrower, eastern regions (R3, R4; m dWdH of 12.66 and 16.92, respectively) compared to areas to the west (R1, R2; m dWdH of 3.54 and 2.91, respectively). A single linear model of G wide as a function of G high (equation 7) was fit to all regions and surveys, with m dWdH and b dWdH equal to 9.5 and 13.9 (root mean square error [RMSE] of 14.7 m and coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.2)."}]
