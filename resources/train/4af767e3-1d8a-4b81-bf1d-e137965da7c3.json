Since neuroimaging plays an important role in characterizing the neurodegenerative process of many brain disease such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1] , the quantitative imaging phenotypes can provide valuable information so that it holds great promise for revealing the complex biological mechanisms of the disease.\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used to identify the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the quantitative traits (QTs) such as neuroimaging measures. To address the high dimensionality of the GWAS data and small effect size of individual SNPs, in recent imaging genetic studies, researchers have developed several generalized multivariate linear regression analysis methods by considering the priori knowledge such as inherent structural information to boost the detection power [2, 3] . Although those methods may have the potential to help discover phenotypic imaging markers related to some candidate risk SNPs [4] , another problem of existing methods in imaging genetics is that the subjects' diagnosis information (e.g., class labels such as patients or healthy controls) is not fully used for revealing disease-specific imaging genetic associations. More recently, some diagnosis induced methods have been proposed to solve the imaging genetics problem [5, 6] . A two-step strategy was adopted by [5] : 1) initially, the authors identified the voxels that could provide an imaging signature of the disease with high classification accuracy using penalized linear discriminant analysis; 2) then they detected the SNPs associated with the multivariate phenotypic markers discovered in the first step. Moreover, a Bayesian framework for detecting genetic variants associated with a disease while exploiting imaging as an intermediate phenotype was proposed in [6] , which was designed to jointly identify relevant imaging and genetic markers simultaneously. In addition, most of imaging genetic studies focus on discovering the associations between single imaging modality (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and SNPs, while ignoring the underlying interacting relationships among multiple modalities.\nWith these observations, our general motivation is to identify multimodal imaging phenotypes serving as intermediate traits between a given AD genetic marker and disease status, where we hope to design a simple and powerful model to maximize disease-relevant imaging genetic associations. Accordingly, the ideas introduced in [7, 8] can be adopted and incorporated into the imaging genetics studies. Specifically in [7, 8] , subjects' similarity has been successfully used for designing more powerful multi-modal models on AD classification and clinical score regression solutions, which are inspired by multi-task modeling integrated with the priori relationship between sample data and the corresponding labels in machine learning community [9] .\nIn this study, we propose a novel diagnosis-guided multi-modality (DGMM) framework that considers robust and common regions of interests (ROIs) as well as diagnosis labels such as patients or healthy controls to handle the multi-modality phenotype associations with an AD genetic risk factor. We evaluate our DGMM method on two modalities of phenotypes, i.e., voxel-based measures extracted from structural MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)) scans, as well as apolipoprotein E (APOE) SNP rs429358 (the best known AD genetic risk factor [10, 11] ) data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. The empirical results show that our method not only yield improved performances under the metrics of correlation coefficient and root mean squared error, but also detect a compact set of consistent and robust ROIs across two imaging modalities which are relevant to the studied genetic risk marker."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Genotype and Phenotype Association", "text": "In this section, we systematically develop our computational models to explore the association between a candidate AD risk SNP and multimodal imaging phenotypes.

We have inserted this information in our revised manuscript. 5-fold cross-validation strategy was adopted to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method. As for parameters of regularization, we determined the values by nested 5-fold cross-validation on the training set.\nIn current studies, we used SM (denoting single modality based method with Lasso [15] to detect a sparse significant subset from imaging phenotypic features (i.e., ROIs)), MC (denoting modalities concatenation with Lasso to detect a sparse subset from imaging phenotypes), MM (denoting multi-modality method to detect imaging phenotypes from a sparse subset of common ROIs), DGSM, DGMC and DGMM (the standard SM, MC and MM with DG, respectively, where DG denotes the diagnosis-guided strategy)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "We compare our proposed diagnosis-guided based methods (including DGSM, DGMC and DGMM) with conventional methods (including SM, MC and MM), respectively. The performance on each dataset is assessed with root mean squared error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (CC) between actual and predicted response values, which are widely used in measuring performances of regression and association analysis. The average results of RMSE and CC among the 5-fold test on MRI-VBM and FDG-PET modalities are calculated respectively as shown in Table 2 and Table 3 . The corresponding values on the whole test data entirety (denoted Ent for short) are included in both tables, where predicted values from all Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing 2016\ncross-validation trials are pulled together for calculating a single RMSE or CC. As shown in Table 2 , the proposed DG based methods consistently outperform their non-DG based methods in the RMSE performance measure. This demonstrates that diagnosisguided information can help improve regression performance from imaging phenotypes to genotype. DGMM and DGMC methods yield the best RMSE values of 0.9097 and 0.9096. Compared with the DG strategy, the joint regularization across multiple modalities showed negative effects on the RMSE performance in some cases (e.g., from SM to MM). Regarding the CC results in Table 3 , our proposed method shows the best CC of 0.1499 with the MRI-VBM modality. The best CC of 0.1471 is obtained by DGMM in terms of the FDG measure while the second best performance is 0.1140 by our DGMM method. These results demonstrate the proposed methods can take advantage of consistent and robust multimodality information to find more important associations. Compared with the joint regularization across multiple modalities, the DG strategy had very limited contributions in most cases except the DGMM on MRI-VBM (compared with MM). We also selected another AD risk SNP CD33 rs386544 and a random SNP rs56283507 as the comparison to evaluate the performance on the proposed model. As shown in Table 4 , the DGMM method with APOE rs429358 yield the best RMSE and CC performance measures, which outperform the same method involved the CD33 rs386544 or the random SNP. This matches our expectation, since the APOE SNP has a larger effect size than the CD33 SNP and the random SNP. The originality of the work is to make full use of the risk genotype and corresponding disease samples to find the intermediate phenotype between an AD genetic marker and the disease status. For evaluation purpose, it is desired to select the top AD risk SNP to demonstrate our proposed model. Besides the improved performances, one major goal of this study is to identify some significant and robust phenotypes that are highly correlated to risk genotype marker to capture imaging genetics associations in AD research. The top 10 selected MRI-VBM imaging features, as well as their average regression coefficients on 5-fold test, are visualized in Fig. 1 by mapping them onto the human brain. The colors of the selected brain regions indicate the regression coefficients of the corresponding MRI-VBM markers. As expected, Hippocampus_Left, Hippocampus_Right and Amygdala_Left have been detected on top 10 ROIs associated with risk genotype biomarker by the proposed DGMM method. It's worth noting that these stable markers are in accordance with the existing findings. For example, the reduction of hippocampal gray matter has been correlated with APOE SNP rs429358 [16] . The APOE polymorphism is the best established genetic risk factor for pathological changes that is also associated with anatomical brain changes. The weights of the top 20 ROIs by every fold DGMM test on the heat map are plotted in Fig. 2 . Our proposed method tends to select the stable ROIs such as Vermis_7, Vermis_10, Hippocampus_Left, Hippocampus_Right and Frontal_Inf_Oper_Left that span across five crossvalidation trials. The APOE SNP is the best established genetic risk factor for pathological changes that is also associated with reductions of hippocampal gray matter and glucose metabolism [10, 16, 17] . It also demonstrates the robust and consistent ROIs should be selected among the independent and different modalities, which discovers the imaging genetic associations through biological interpretation. Although reduced volume of cerebellar vermis has been associated with dementia [18] , the imaging genetic finding of Vermis_7 warrants further investigation."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this study, we have developed a diagnosis-guided multi-modality (DGMM) framework for identifying neuroimaging phenotype associations with risk genetic biomarkers.

The similar model can be also extended to the investigation of association analyses between multi-modal brain imaging measures and any other biomarkers such as those in cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, the DGMM framework can be applied to other genetic associated diseases to investigate the complex biological mechanisms from genetics to intermediate traits to diagnostic outcome. An interesting future direction is to improve the efficiency of our implementation and apply it to larger scale studies such as analyzing high dimensional voxel based imaging data as well as a comprehensive set of genetic risk factors.\nsupported by NIH R01 LM011360, U01 AG024904, RC2 AG036535, R01 AG19771, P30 AG10133, UL1 TR001108, R01 AG 042437, and R01 AG046171; NSF IIS-1117335; DOD W81XWH-14-2-0151, W81XWH-13-1-0259, and W81XWH-12-2-0012; NCAA 14132004; and CTSI SPARC Program."}]
