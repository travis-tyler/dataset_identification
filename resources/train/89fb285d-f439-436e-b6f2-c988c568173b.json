Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a quantitative MRI disease progression measurement for clinical trials. Methods: The authors performed a fully automated quantitative MRI analysis employing atlas-based volumetry and provide sample size calculations based on data collected in 99 PSP patients assigned to placebo in these trials. Based on individual volumes of 44 brain compartments and structures at baseline and 52 weeks of follow-up, means and standard deviations of annualized percentage volume changes were used to estimate standardized effect sizes and the required sample sizes per group for future 2-armed, placebo-controlled therapeutic trials. Results: The highest standardized effect sizes were found for midbrain, frontal lobes, and the third ventricle.\nUsing the annualized percentage volume change of these structures to detect a 50% change in the 1-year progression (80% power, significance level 5%) required lower numbers of patients per group (third ventricle, n 5 32; midbrain, n 5 37; frontal lobe, n 5 43) than the best clinical scale (PSP rating scale total score, n 5 58). A combination of volume changes in these 3 structures reduced the number of required patients to only 20 and correlated best with the progression in the clinical scales. Conclusions: We propose the 1-year change in the volumes of third ventricle, midbrain, and frontal lobe as combined imaging read-out for clinical trials in PSP that require the least number of patients for detecting efficacy to reduce brain atrophy.

There is currently no treatment approved. 1 However, several compounds are awaiting clinical evaluation. A rational trial design is therefore important to allow clear conclusions while saving resources.\nThe randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II/III trials of davunetide and tideglusib (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01110720, NCT01049399) studied patients according to similar protocols for 12 months. [2] [3] [4] Their placebo data provided the needed information to identify rating scales suited to measure disease progression and to estimate sample sizes for future trials. 5 These trials also generated prospective highresolution T1-weighted three-dimensional (3D) MRI data. A recent study analyzed the atrophy rate of 4 selected volumes (whole brain, ventricles, superior cerebellar peduncle, and midbrain) using label propagation with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) 5 software (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK, www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) in all (ie, placebo and verum) patients from the davunetide trial and concluded that the midbrain volumetry as an outcome measure in a 1-year, parallel group trial would require comparable numbers of patients 6 as the best performing clinical scale, the PSP Rating Scale (PSPRS). 5, 7 Another study 8 proposed that annual midbrain volume change measured with SPM12 would require 44% fewer patients than the PSPRS.\nUnbiased by a priori hypotheses, we analyzed which volumetric parameters perform best as outcome measures, allowing trials with fewer patients despite comparable power to detect efficacy to slow brain atrophy. We used fully automated atlas-based volumetry (ABV) to quantify structural changes in individual patients with an intrascanner variability of <1%. 9, 10 In the tideglusib study, this method revealed lower cerebral atrophy rates in verum-versus placebo-treated patients. 4 Furthermore, in conjunction with support vector machine classification, this method reliably identified PSP patients in a large mixture of parkinsonian syndromes. 11 Here, we performed ABV using SPM12 on 44 brain structures of 99 placebo patients from the davunetide and tideglusib trials at baseline and 1-year followup, calculated annualized volume changes, and estimated standardized effect sizes and sample sizes for 2-armed, placebo-controlled therapeutic trials.

Volumetric measures of brain structures were calculated by voxel-by-voxel multiplication and subsequent integration of normalized and modulated component images (GM, WM, or CSF) with predefined masks in the same space. Masks were derived from different probabilistic brain atlases because not all regions of interest are comprised in a single atlas: the Harvard-Oxford atlas of subcortical structures distributed with the Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain Software Library (FSL) package [17] [18] [19] [20] for the hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, pallidum, and thalamus; the Hammers_mith atlas n30r83 21 for the third and lateral ventricles; the LONI Probabilistic Brain Atlas 22 for all other structures.

The annualized percentage volume changes of these structures were summed up for each individual patient, with negative signs for the third ventricle because the enlargement of the CSF space runs counter to the atrophy of the brain parenchyma. This approach further increased the effect size and reduced the required sample size for detecting a 50% treatment effect to 20, that is, 65% less than the PSPRS total score (Table 2) .\nFor completeness, we also present the demographic and clinical data (Supplementary Table 1 ) and ABV analyses (Supplementary Table 2 ) of the total PSP cohort (N 5 106 patients) without exclusion of technically compromised MRIs, which only marginally decreased the standardized effect sizes and increased the required sample sizes, demonstrating the strong reliability of this approach.

There is evidence that nonparametric approaches may be advantageous in certain instances. [40] [41] [42] With only 2 measurements (baseline, follow-up) in the present study, we decided to calculate a simple volume difference for each patient (corresponding to a linear fit) and to determine the mean volume change in the cohort by averaging the patients' results. We deliberately refrained from applying more sophisticated nonlinear models for fitting volume changes because they would only be sufficiently supported by more than 2 measurements in time. The MRIs of different patients in this study were acquired in various centers and on different scanners. These scanners may differ from each other by imaging quality, signal homogeneity, and contrast. Although regular phantom scans have ascertained quality standards in the tideglusib and davunetide studies, interscanner variability can be regarded as a disadvantage. However, in the davunetide dataset, no significant effect of the MRI scanner on longitudinal atrophy rates was identified. 6 Furthermore, recruitment at multiple sites and imaging at different scanners reflects the realistic scenario for future clinical trials and should be seen as advantage because such multicenter analyses have better generalizability, the feasibility of which is demonstrated in the current work.\nAlthough imaging-based outcome measures are not accepted as primary endpoints in phase III trials aimed at demonstration of clinical efficacy to improve the feeling, functioning, and survival of patients, they might still be of high relevance in small-scale, proofof-concept studies as interim read-out in longer efficacy studies or as secondary outcome measures in efficacy studies with a primary clinical read-out. 33 In conclusion, we propose the 1-year change in the volumes of third ventricle, frontal lobe, and midbrain as combined imaging read-out for clinical trials in PSP, requiring the least number of patients for detecting biological evidence for efficacy to slow disease progression."}, {"section_title": "Correlation Analysis", "text": "First, we analyzed if the degree of regional atrophy at baseline would predict the rate of longitudinal atrophy in PSP patients during the follow-up period. Therefore, we calculated on a group level the correlation of (1) the mean cross-sectional difference at baseline between the 99 patients versus all 50 controls with (2) the mean longitudinal annualized change in all patients. The correlation was moderate when including all structures as data points (n 5 44, r 5 0.69, P < .01), strong when including CSF structures only (n 5 3, r 5 0.99, P < .05), absent when including parenchymal structures only (n 5 41, r 5 0.08, not significant), and absent when including frontal lobe, midbrain, and third ventricle only (n 5 3, r 5 0.97, not significant). These data demonstrate that on a group level, the baseline atrophy of parenchymal structures in PSP does not predict the atrophy rate in the following 1-year period.\nAlso, when using the individual patients' values as data points (N 5 99), there was no significant correlation between (1) the cross-sectional percentage of differences to controls at baseline with (2) the longitudinal annualized percentage of change for the frontal lobe, midbrain, and third ventricle and for their combination (Frontal Lobe 1 Midbrain 2 Third Ventricle). These data demonstrate that the degree of atrophy in individual PSP patients at baseline does not predict the ensuing atrophy in these regions of interest. However, the percentage of difference versus controls at baseline in the CSF volumes in individual patients significantly correlated with their longitudinal percentage of changes (r 5 0.31, P < .01).\nFinally, we analyzed if the rate of regional brain atrophy during the follow-up period would predict the clinical disease progression. Therefore, we correlated the annualized change of the 3 structures with the highest individual effect sizes (and their combination) with the annualized change in the 3 most relevant clinical scales (Table 3) . SEADL and PSPRS total scores significantly correlated with the volume change in the third ventricle, frontal lobe, and midbrain individually. The highest correlation of SEADL, CGIDS, and PSPRS total scores was observed with the combined volume change of these 3 structures."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The study evaluated the 1-year change in brain structures by ABV on prospectively acquired 3D MRI datasets of 99 placebo-treated PSP patients from the davunetide and tideglusib trials. We found that the annualized percentage of volume change of 1 single structure (third ventricle) required 45% fewer patients than the clinical scale with the best effect size (PSPRS total score) to detect a 50% treatment effect (32 vs 58), when including only patients with excellent MRIs. Combined analysis of the 3 nonoverlapping compartments with the highest individual effect sizes (third ventricle, frontal lobe, midbrain) even allowed to reduce the required sample size to 20 (65% fewer than the PSPRS total score), demonstrating low variability in the atrophy pattern in our cohort. Furthermore, the combined volume changes of these 3 structures significantly correlated with the score changes in the relevant clinical scales (SEADL, CGIDS, PSPRS total scores), suggesting this imaging parameter to have clinical relevance as a biomarker of disease progression. Thus, we propose the combined analysis of volume change within 1 year in the third ventricle, frontal lobe, and midbrain as an outcome measure for clinical trials aimed at determining disease modification in PSP.\nOne prior monocentric prospective study in 17 PSP patients analyzed MRI volumetric changes in 7 brain structures (brain, pons, midbrain, superior cerebellar peduncle, cerebellum, lateral ventricles, third ventricle) at baseline and at 1-year follow-up 30 and determined the midbrain volume as the parameter requiring the smallest sample size (147 for a presumed treatment effect of 30% and power of 90%). Another monocentric prospective study in 16 PSP patients analyzed MRI volumetric changes in 5 brain structures (brain, ventricles, superior frontal lobe, thalamus, midbrain) after a 1-year interval 31 and also identified the midbrain volume as the parameter requiring the smallest sample size (84 for a treatment effect of 30% and power of 90%). A recent study 6 analyzed the change rate in 4 brain volumes (whole brain, ventricles, superior cerebellar peduncle, midbrain) in 189 placebo and verum patients from the davunetide trial and again .

The numbers in the studies including both possible and probable PSP patients 6, 30 compare well with our results for midbrain volume (100 for a treatment effect of 30% and power of 80%) and thus suggest the reliability of this parameter across different populations and methods of volumetric analyses. The smaller numbers reported by Whitwell and colleagues 31 may result from the fact that they only included patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable PSP (NINDS-SPSP criteria), whereas the other studies 6, 30 and our study also included patients with possible PSP or modified diagnostic criteria, which may affect the variability in disease progression markers. Finally, a more recent study 8 used SPM12-based longitudinal morphometric analysis and found that the annual change in midbrain volume as outcome measure requires only 56% of patients as the PSPRS. This rate compares well with the 63% observed in our study, which also used SPM12. The different absolute case numbers resulting from the power calculations between the former 8 and the current work were most probably the result from differences in the study populations.\nThe regions analyzed in these prior studies 6, 8, 30, 31 have been selected on the basis of preceding imaging and pathological studies, which had demonstrated atrophy in PSP patients versus healthy controls. Measurements of these regions, and ratios thereof (eg, midbrain-pons ratio, MR-Parkinson index) proved, therefore, helpful as markers for the cross-sectional differential diagnosis of Parkinson syndromes 24, 25 ; however, only limited data addressed the utility of these ratios as progression measurements. 8 In contrast to these studies, we hypothesized here that the cross-sectional degree of atrophy at baseline in patients versus controls might not be reliable predictors for the ensuing longitudinal atrophy rate in PSP patients because regional atrophy rates might change during the course of the disease. Particularly, regions showing already marked atrophy at baseline might have lower atrophy rates during follow-up. Consistently, we did not find significant correlations of baseline atrophy rates with the longitudinal changes in the 41 parenchymal structures analyzed. Moreover, regions with similar degrees of baseline atrophy (about 15%-16%) showed surprisingly high divergence in the 1-year volume change in our cohort (eg, cerebellum WM 10.1%, pallidum 21.5%, midbrain 22.3%). Furthermore, longitudinal atrophy rates do not translate linearly into sample sizes because the latter incorporate both the atrophy rate and the variability of the measurement, which again depends on both interindividual and methodological variability.\nTherefore, we undertook for the first time an unbiased approach to identify the MRI measurement providing the highest effect size by starting our analysis with 44 brain structures or compartments and identified unexpectedly the third ventricle as best individual structure. Also, the approach to combine the annualized volume change in 3 nonredundant brain structures had not been attempted in any prior study in PSP to our knowledge. This approach seems promising because it allows further reducing the required sample sizes for clinical trials.\nThe observation that outcome measures based on neuroimaging can translate into small sample sizes for clinical studies has already been described for Alzheimer's or Huntington's diseases or multiple sclerosis. [32] [33] [34] [35] Advantages of imaging above clinical parameters, which have been reported previously 36 and was also recognized in our study, are probably a result of the higher variability of clinical ratings, which reduces effect sizes. Among the neuroimaging parameters, ventricular volumes often achieve highest effect sizes, perhaps because of the more distinct boundaries than in other structures. 32, 33 Consequently, also in our study the highest effect size was determined for a CSF compartment, that is, the third ventricle. However, combining several measures has been proposed to further increase effect sizes 37 and also in our study turned out to be the optimal approach.\nLimitations of our study concern the study population, intra-scanner variability, longitudinal fitting models, inter-scanner variability, and the generalizability of the results. All patients included in our study fulfilled the MDS criteria for probable PSP-Richardson syndrome (vertical supranuclear gaze palsy or slow vertical saccades with repeated unprovoked falls within 3 years or a tendency to fall on the pull-test within 3 years) 38 and had an annualized PSP-Richardson progression consistent with prior cohorts 5 ; however, they were not consecutively referred, but volunteers participating in clinical trials, and might therefore differ from other PSP patients.\nControls were only scanned once, which did not allow accurately correcting for the influence of aging on ABV. The calculation of longitudinal volume changes in individual patients was mainly affected by intra-scanner variability because baseline and followup MRIs were acquired on the same scanner using the same sequences for each patient. Intra-scanner variability of ABV was less than 1% for most structures in a prior study comparing 2 MRIs in single participants. 39 In the present study, atrophy rates (and subsequently effect sizes and sample sizes) are based on the average of 99 patients. Consequently, intra-scanner variability influenced the results by a factor of 99 less, that is, in the range of 0.01% of the measured volumes. When compared with atrophy rates of the relevant structures (2.6%-7.6%), this influence can be regarded as negligible. The ideal modeling of"}]
