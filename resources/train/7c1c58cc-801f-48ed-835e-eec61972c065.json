[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Viruses of the family Coronaviridae possess a singlestrand, positive-sense RNA genome ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases in length. 1 Coronaviruses have been identified in several avian hosts, 2,3 as well as in various mammals, including camels, bats, masked palm civets, mice, dogs, and cats. Novel mammalian coronaviruses are now regularly identified. 1 For example, an HKU2related coronavirus of bat origin was responsible for a fatal acute diarrhoea syndrome in pigs in 2018. 4 for 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection and 858 fatalities since September, 2012, including 38 deaths following a single introduction into South Korea. 8, 9 In late December, 2019, several patients with viral pneumonia were found to be epidemiologically associated with the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China, where a number of non-aquatic animals such as birds and rabbits were also on sale before the outbreak. A novel, human-infecting coronavirus, 10, 11 provisionally named 2019 novel corona virus (2019-nCoV), was identified with use of next-generation sequencing. As of Jan 28, 2020, China has reported more than 5900 confirmed and more than 9000 suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection across 33 Chinese provinces or municipalities, with 106 fatalities. In addition, 2019-nCoV has now been reported in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and the USA. Infections in medical workers and family clusters were also reported and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. 12 Most of the infected patients had a high fever and some had dyspnoea, with chest radiographs revealing invasive lesions in both lungs. 12, 13 We report the epidemiological data of nine inpatients, from at least three hospitals in Wuhan, who were diagnosed with viral pneumonia of unidentified cause. Using next-generation sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples and cultured isolates from these patients, 2019-nCoV was found.

These data have been deposited in the China National Microbiological Data Center (accession number NMDC10013002 and genome accession numbers NMDC60013002-01 to NMDC60013002-10) and the data from BGI have been deposited in the China National GeneBank (acces sion numbers CNA0007332-35).\nBased on these genomes, we developed a real-time PCR assay and tested the original clinical samples from the BGI (WH01, WH02, WH03, and WH04) again to determine their threshold cycle (Ct) values (table) . The remaining samples were tested by a different real-time PCR assay developed by the Chinese CDC, with Ct values ranging from 22\u00b785 to 32\u00b741 (table) . These results confirmed the presence of 2019-nCoV in the patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples or cultured viruses of nine patients were used for next-generation sequencing. After removing host (human) reads, de novo assembly was done and the contigs obtained used as queries to search the non-redundant protein database. Some contigs identified in all the samples were closely related to the bat SARS-like betacoronavirus bat-SL-CoVZC45 betacoronavirus. 23 Bat-SL-CoVZC45 was then used as the reference genome and reads from each pool were mapped to it, generating consensus sequences corresponding to all the pools. These consensus sequences were then used as new reference genomes. Eight complete genomes and two partial genomes (from samples WH19002 and WH02; table) were obtained. The de novo assembly of the clean reads from all the pools did not identify any other long contigs that corresponded to other viruses at high abundance.\nThe eight complete genomes were nearly identical across the whole genome, with sequence identity above 99\u00b798%, indicative of a very recent emergence into the human population ( figure 1A) . The largest nucleotide difference was four mutations. Notably, the sequence identity between the two virus genomes from the same patient (WH19001, from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and WH19005, from cell culture) was more than 99\u00b799%, \n3'"}, {"section_title": "3'", "text": "3'\n3' Base pairs with 100% identity at the amino acid level. In addition, the partial genomes from samples WH02 and WH19002 also had nearly 100% identity to the complete genomes across the aligned gene regions. A Blastn search of the complete genomes of 2019-nCoV revealed that the most closely related viruses available on GenBank were bat-SL-CoVZC45 (sequence identity 87\u00b799%; query coverage 99%) and another SARS-like betacoronavirus of bat origin, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (accession number MG772934; 23 87\u00b723%; query coverage 98%). In five gene regions (E, M, 7, N, and 14) , the sequence identities were greater than 90%, with the highest being 98\u00b77% in the E gene ( figure 2A) . The S gene of 2019-nCoV exhibited the lowest sequence identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, at only around 75%. In addition, the sequence identity in 1b (about 86%) was lower than that in 1a (about 90%; figure 2A) . Most of the encoded proteins exhibited high sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and the related bat-derived coronaviruses ( figure 2a) . The notable exception was the spike protein, with only around 80% sequence identity, and protein 13, with 73\u00b72% sequence identity. Notably, the 2019-nCoV strains were less genetically similar to SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). The similarity between 2019-nCoV and related viruses was visualised using SimPlot software, with the 2019-nCoV consensus sequence employed as the query ( figure 2B) .\nComparison of the predicted coding regions of 2019-nCoV showed that they possessed a similar genomic organisation to bat-SL-CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and SARS-CoV Phylogenetic analysis of 2019-nCoV and its closely related reference genomes, as well as representative betacoronaviruses, revealed that the five subgenera formed five well supported branches ( figure 3) . The subgenus Sarbecovirus could be classified into three well supported clades: two SARS-CoV-related strains from Rhinolophus sp from Bulgaria (accession number GU190215) and Kenya (KY352407) formed clade 1; the ten 2019-nCoV from Wuhan and the two bat-derived SARS-like strains from Zhoushan in eastern China (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) formed clade 2, which was notable for the long branch separating the human and bat viruses; and SARS-CoV strains from humans and many genetically similar SARS-like corona viruses from bats collected from southwestern China formed clade 3, with bat-derived coronaviruses also falling in the basal positions ( figure 3 ). In addition, 2019-nCoV was distinct from SARS-CoV in a phylogeny of the complete RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene (appendix p 2). This evidence indicates that 2019-nCoV is a novel beta coronavirus from the subgenus Sarbecovirus.\nAs the sequence similarity plot revealed changes in genetic distances among viruses across the 2019-nCoV genome, we did additional phylogenetic analyses of the major encoding regions of representative members of the subgenus Sarbecovirus. Consistent with the genome phylogeny, 2019-nCoV, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 clustered together in trees of the 1a and spike genes (appendix p 3). By contrast, 2019-nCoV did not cluster with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 in the 1b tree, but instead formed a distinct clade with SARS-CoV, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (appendix p 3), indicative of potential recombination events in 1b, although these probably occurred in the bat coronaviruses rather than 2019-nCoV. Phylogenetic analysis of the 2019-nCoV genome excluding 1b revealed similar evolutionary relationships as the full-length viral genome (appendix p 3).\nThe envelope spike (S) protein mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion 24 and is crucial for determining host tropism and transmission capacity. 25, 26 Generally, the spike protein of coronaviruses is functionally divided into the S1 domain (especially positions 318-510 of SARS-CoV), responsible for receptor binding, and the S2 domain, responsible for cell membrane fusion. 27 The 2019-nCoV S2 protein showed around 93% sequence identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21-much higher than that of the S1 domain, which had only around 68% identity with these bat-derived viruses. Both the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain of the S1 domain can bind to host receptors. 28 We inspected amino acid variation in the spike protein among the Sarbecovirus coronaviruses The receptor-binding domain of betacoronaviruses, which directly engages the receptor, is commonly located in the C-terminal domain of S1, as in SARS-CoV 29 for lineage B, and MERS-CoV 30,31 and BatCoV HKU4, 32 for lineage C (figure 5). Through phylogenetic analysis of the receptor-binding domain of four different lineages of betacoronaviruses (appendix p 4), we found that, although 2019-nCoV was closer to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 at the whole-genome level, the receptor-binding domain of 2019-nCoV fell within lineage B and was closer to that of SARS-CoV (figure 5A). The three-dimensional structure of 2019-nCoV receptorbinding domain was modelled using the Swiss-Model program 33 with the SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain structure (Protein Data Bank ID 2DD8) 34 as a template. This analysis suggested that, like other betacoronaviruses, the receptor-binding domain was composed of a core and an external subdomain ( figure 5B-D) .\nNotably, the external subdomain of the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain was more similar to that of SARS-CoV. This result suggests that 2019-nCoV might also use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor. However, we also observed that several key residues responsible for the binding of the SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain to the ACE2 receptor were variable in the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain (including Asn439, Asn501, Gln493, Gly485 and Phe486; 2019-nCoV numbering)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "From genomic surveillance of clinical samples from patients with viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, a novel coronavirus (termed 2019-nCoV) has been identified. 10, 11 Our phylogenetic analysis of 2019-nCoV, sequenced from nine patients' samples, showed that the virus belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus. 2019-nCoV was more similar to two bat-derived coronavirus strains, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, than to known human-infecting coronaviruses, including the virus that caused the SARS outbreak of 2003.\nEpidemiologically, eight of the nine patients in our study had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, suggesting that they might have been in close contact with the infection source at the market. However, one patient had never visited the market, although he had stayed in a hotel near the market before the onset of their illness. This finding suggests either possible droplet transmission or that the patient was infected by a currently unknown source. Evidence of clusters of infected family members and medical workers has now confirmed the presence of human-to-human transmission. 12 Clearly, this infection is a major public health concern, particularly as this outbreak coincides with the peak of the Chinese Spring Festival travel rush, during which hundreds of millions of people will travel through China. As a typical RNA virus, the average evolutionary rate for coronaviruses is roughly 10 -\u2074 nucleotide substitutions per site per year, 1 with mutations arising during every replication cycle. It is, therefore, striking that the sequences of 2019-nCoV from different patients described here were almost identical, with greater than 99\u00b79% sequence identity. This finding suggests that 2019-nCoV originated from one source within a very short period and was detected relatively rapidly. However, as the virus transmits to more individuals, constant surveillance of mutations arising is needed."}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV", "text": "Phylogenetic analysis showed that bat-derived coronaviruses fell within all five subgenera of the genus Betacoronavirus. Moreover, bat-derived coronaviruses fell in basal positions in the subgenus Sarbecovirus, with 2019-nCoV most closely related to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, which were also sampled from bats. 23 These data are consistent with a bat reservoir for coronaviruses in general and for 2019-nCoV in particular. However, despite the importance of bats, several facts suggest that another animal is acting as an intermediate host between bats and humans. First, the outbreak was first reported in late December, 2019, when most bat species in Wuhan are hibernating. Second, no bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market, whereas various non-aquatic animals (including mammals) were available for purchase. Third, the sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and its close relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 was less than 90%, which is reflected in the relatively long branch between them. Hence, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 are not direct ancestors of 2019-nCoV. Fourth, in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, bats acted as the natural reservoir, with another animal (masked palm civet for SARS-CoV 35 and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV) 36 acting as an intermediate host, with humans as terminal hosts. Therefore, on the basis of current data, it seems likely that the 2019-nCoV causing the Wuhan outbreak might also be initially hosted by bats, and might have been transmitted to humans via currently unknown wild animal(s) sold at the Huanan seafood market.\nPrevious studies have uncovered several receptors that different coronaviruses bind to, such as ACE2 for SARS-CoV 29 and CD26 for MERS-CoV. 30 Our molecular modelling showed structural similarity between the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. Therefore, we suggest that 2019-nCoV might use ACE2 as the receptor, despite the presence of amino acid mutations in the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain. Although a previous study using HeLa cells expressing ACE2 proteins showed that 2019-nCoV could employ the ACE2 receptor, 37 whether these mutations affect ACE2 binding or change receptor tropism requires further study.\nRecombination has been seen frequently in coronaviruses. 1 As expected, we detected recombination in the Sarbecoviruses analysed here. Our results suggest that recombination events are complex and are more likely occurring in bat coronaviruses than in 2019-nCoV. Hence, despite its occurrence, recombination is probably not the reason for emergence of this virus, although this inference might change if more closely related animal viruses are identified.\nIn conclusion, we have described the genomic structure of a seventh human coronavirus that can cause severe pneumonia and have shed light on its origin and "}, {"section_title": "Declaration of interests", "text": "We declare no competing interests."}, {"section_title": "Data sharing", "text": "Data are available on various websites and have been made publicly available (more information can be found in the first paragraph of the Results section)."}]
