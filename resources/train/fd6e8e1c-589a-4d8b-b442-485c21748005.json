Apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 carriers and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition proposes that recruitment of additional frontal brain regions can protect cognition against aging. This thesis has yet to be fully tested in older adults at high risk for AD. In the present study, 75 older participants (mean age: 74 years) were included. Applying a voxel-wise approach, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in resting-state functional neuroimaging data were analyzed as a function of APOE\u03b54 status (carrier versus noncarrier) and clinical status (healthy control [HC] versus MCI) using a 2 \u00d7 2 analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Measures of cognition and cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid-\u2424 were also obtained. Three frontal regions were identified with significant interaction effects using ANCOVA (corrected p < 0.01): left-insula, left-inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and right-precentral gyrus. The HC/APOE\u03b5 4 carrier group had significantly higher fALFF in all three regions than other groups. In the entire sample, for two regions (left insula and left IFG), a significant positive relationship between amyloid-\u2424 and memory was only observed among individuals with low fALFF.

A recent postmortem study suggests a discrepancy between clinically defined AD and brain pathological alterations [6] .\nFactors explaining the discrepancy are mainly behavioral. For example, higher cognitive reserve, indexed by higher levels of education, or activity engagement, helps protect cognitive performance against AD pathology [7, 8] . While this may be so, the underlying neural mechanism linking reserve to cognitive protection is not clear. The Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition (STAC) posits that cognitive protection against aging or neurodegeneration is regulated through compensatory neural reconfigurations that rely heavily on recruitment of frontal regions [9] . The STAC has been widely tested in the normal aging process [10] [11] [12] , but relatively few in the context of AD-associated neurodegeneration among older adults at high risk for AD [13, 14] , or understanding the frontal regions' role in AD pathology, such as amyloid deposition [15] .\nThe fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) measures the power within a specific frequency range (0.01-0.08 Hz) divided by the total power in the entire detectable frequency range (0.009-0.25 Hz) of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), reflecting selective brain regions' oscillatory activity [16] . fALFF is considered a sensitive index for detecting AD-associated neurodegeneration, such that MCI and AD patients have lower fALFF in multiple frontal brain regions [17, 18] .\nIn the present study, we hypothesize that the activity of frontal circuits, indexed by relevant areas' fALFF, is critical in explaining the differential associations between AD pathology and cognition across older adults with high risk for AD. Two steps were conducted to test the hypothesis: first, we used a voxel-wise approach and employed a 2 (APOE \u03b54 status) \u00d7 2 (clinical status) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to identify relevant frontal regions; and second, we examined whether fALFF in these regions would explain the differential associations between cognitive function (i.e., memory and executive function) and AD pathology (i.e., cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid-\u2424 and tau)."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI data", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni. loni.usc.edu).

Then the square root of the power spectrum was calculated and averaged across 0.01-0.08 Hz at each voxel.

To control for the potential difference in age, sex, and education, these factors were controlled when examining APOE \u03b54 and clinical status.

There are two main findings: first, higher activity within three frontal regions (the L-insula, L-IFG, and R-PG) differentiated the HC/APOE\u03b54(+) group from other groups; second, higher activity and stronger functional connectivity seen in the L-insula and L-IFG might reduce the impact of amyloid-\u2424 on memory in older adults. Additionally, this effect was particularly evident in those who were in the HC group, APOE\u03b54 non-carriers, relatively younger (<75 years), female, and had higher levels of education (\u226516 years). Our findings further one of the central hypotheses of the STAC regarding the protective role that recruitment of frontal regions appears to play against AD pathology.\nWe found that higher fALFF in the insula and IFG occurred in the group with genetic risk of AD but who also showed cognitively intact status (HC/APOE\u03b54(+)), relative to other groups. Fur- , and functional connectivity between L-insula and L-IFG (C)) and amyloid-\u2424 on memory. The fALFF and functional connectivity was subdivided into high versus low groups using the median value, respectively. The results were adjusted for age, sex, education, APOE\u03b54, and clinical status.\nthermore, regardless of clinical, APOE\u03b54 status, or demographic characteristics, the significant effect of amyloid-\u2424 deposition on memory was only found among individuals with low fALFF or functional connectivity of the insula and IFG. These two lines of findings suggest that greater activation or additional recruitment of frontal regions may provide protection against the neural challenges arising from AD pathology (genetic risk or amyloid-\u2424 deposition, which are highly correlated). There is a known positive link between cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u2424 deposition and memory performance in AD-related neurodegeneration [15, 25] . Noticeably, executive functioning was not affected in the process although frontal regions, in general, are known to attend the regulation. A potential explanation may be further validated; that is, APOE\u03b54 that was used in brain region identification was AD-neurodegeneration related. Executive functioning is known to be more relevant to other genetic risk, such as TOMM40 [26] . An expansion of the STAC model might consider how the insula or IFG may counteract amyloid-\u2424 deposition. This might result through multiple pathways. The IFG is known to participate in the maintenance of memory [27, 28] . In a recent longitudinal study, older adults with more IFG activity tended to succeed in the memory task regardless of brain volume or white matter integrity [29] . In parallel, the insula is known to direct the regulation of cerebral circulation, which in turn helps with the maintenance of memory [30] . It is also noteworthy that the left lateral aspect of the frontal regions seemed to be more relevant for neural protection. Previous studies found neural disruptions of both regions to be pronounced in the right side in ADassociated neurodegeneration [31, 32] , suggesting that the recruitment of homologous regions in the contralateral (left) hemisphere may act as a compensatory mechanism [33, 34] .\nAlthough the protective effect of the IFG and the insula was found among older adults across various clinical and APOE\u03b54 statuses, the effect seemed more robust in females who were healthier, younger, and more educated. Of note, we did not find a direct relationship between the function of frontal regions and demographic and health characteristics. The more efficient protection of the IFG and insula among those displaying better health, more education, relatively less advanced age, and who are women may be due to various mechanisms. For example, there may be a nonlinear relationship between age and amyloid-\u2424 deposition such that in individuals 70 years and older (especially in APOE\u03b54 carriers) a steeper increase in amyloid-\u2424 deposition might be expected. This could, in turn, make it difficult for frontal regions to achieve their compensatory role [35, 36] . Additionally, even among individuals without evident amyloid pathology, APOE\u03b54 carriers still tend to have more neural functional disruption related to memory than noncarriers [37] . Also, the cognitive reserve that is typically found in those with higher levels of education may interact with this process [38] . However, such findings need to be interpreted cautiously due to the relatively small sample size of the subgroups, and these proposed mechanisms will clearly require further direct testing.\nAdditionally, our findings of similarly low levels of fALFF in frontal regions in both the HC/APOE\u03b54(-) and the MCI/APOE\u03b54(+) groups, relative to the other two groups, are intriguing and perhaps could be considered counterintuitive. However, a key feature of successful aging is, prima facie, the absence of agerelated pathology. As such, one might well predict relatively minimal additional frontal brain activation in the healthy normal brain [39] , as observed here in the HC/APOE\u03b54(-) group. On the other hand, in the group with both genetic and clinical predisposition (i.e., MCI/APOE\u03b54[+]), one would expect accelerated amyloid-\u2424 deposition, which could in turn lead to premature interruption of the recruitment of compensatory frontal processes, consistent with the relatively low frontal activation patterns observed here [36] . Along with the subgroup analysis of clinical status in the compensatory frontal processes, these findings together suggests that the compensatory frontal mechanism may be more effective in the very early stage of neurodegeneration-those with genetic risk but being cognitively intact. Therefore, compensation may be a strategy worthwhile for emphasis in maintaining cognitively healthy aging against genetic risk for AD.\nSeveral limitations need to be acknowledged. First, although the literature has consistently identified patients with MCI or AD as having low fALFF values in frontal regions, a clinically meaningful cut-off score for fALFF values is not available. For the present analysis, we used the median score from the sample, which may not be applicable to samples with other demographic characteristics. Second, due to the nature of a dementia study, we have a relatively high prevalence of APOE\u03b54[+] (42.7%) compared to the general population with similar ancestry characteristics [40] . This may affect the generalization of the conclusion. Third, the relatively small sample size in the secondary subgroup analysis clearly limits interpretation of these findings, which are solely intended to generate avenues for follow-up work and will require further validation. Finally, fALFF and functional connectivity of the frontal regions may relate to other variables that may positively impact cognitive performance but were not measured in the present study.\nIn conclusion, frontal regions play a critical role in protecting against the negative impact of neurodegeneration among people at risk for AD. The left insula and IFG may be particularly important in the maintenance of memory performance in the face of AD-related pathology, at least in the very early stage. Future studies should focus on the development of relevant modification strategies to enhance compensatory scaffolding and ultimately cognitive function."}]
