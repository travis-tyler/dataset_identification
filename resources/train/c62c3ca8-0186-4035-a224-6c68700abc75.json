[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "A child's language development starts at birth and continues to grow through 12 years of age, but the acquisition of new vocabularies would continue throughout a lifetime (de Villiers & de Villiers, 1979;Krashen, 2004). A child learns what words are and how to recognize sounds and talk about them way before he can read. He also uses language to communicate about things that are not present (Harris, Aycicegi, & Gleason, 2003). The volume of vocabulary in a young child has a significant impact on growing his reading skills. If a child develops a large vocabulary, his path to reading is easier. With a small vocabulary, he would be at risk of learning to read, when he begins elementary school (Cunningham & Allington, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "Three factors, gender, socioeconomic status, and home language, often make a difference in children's language and reading development."}, {"section_title": "Gender", "text": "Although in general intelligence, there is no gender difference. Studies have found that some differences occur in learning reading and math between the genders. Females have slightly better verbal skills than males (Galambos, Berenbaum, & McHale, 2009), while male students tend to have better math performance outcomes than females. For example, two national report cards in 2005 and 2007 have shown that girls did better than boys in reading and writing, however, males had higher average math scores than females in fourth and eighth grades (Perie, Grigg, & Donahue, 2005;Lee, Grigg, & Dion, 2007). A recent study using k-8 national longitudinal data also found the similar trend that females did better than males in reading (Robinson & Lubienski, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Socioeconomic status", "text": "Children from low-income families performed less well than middle-income and high-income families on most measures of academics success. These measures include standardized test scores, school grades, high school completion rates, college enrollment, and college completion rates (Reardon, 2013). There are many reasons that lead to this disparity between the children from low and middle income. Low-income families, compared to the high-income families, have less access to the resources to raise their children (Wadsworth, Evans, Grant, Carter, & Duffy 2016). A study showed that persistent economic hardship and early poverty link to lower cognitive function in young children (Schoon, Jones, Cheng, & Maughan, 2012). In addition, research findings revealed that family's socioeconomic status and the type of talk that parents use with children have impact on the child's vocabulary development (Pan & Uccelli, 2009). Studies from the NICHD Early Child Care Research Network (2005) showed that poverty and early speech input affect a child's language development. Compared to the parents from welfare programs, parents from professional families talked more with their young children. As a result, children whose parents were professionals had double the amount of vocabulary than those from welfare families. By the time, children go to preschool, the disparities among the socioeconomic status contexts on language inputs in the homes and the children's levels of vocabulary have been widened (Hart &Risley1995)."}, {"section_title": "Home language", "text": "Students who have learned and used English from early childhood are often called the English Only Learners (EOLs), while other students whose first languages are not English and speak English only as a second language are English Language Learners (ELLs). There are also students who have used more than one language at home and use these languages equally. They are multilingual learners (MLs). Acquiring a second language often is a challenge. Some people believe for young children, it is easier. However, researchers who study second language acquisition argue such a development is a very complex process and lasts a long period of time (Cummins, 2008;Krashen, 2003;McLaughlin, 1984). Because of limited language capability, the ELL students might not be able to communicate fluently or learn effectively in English. ELL students often face two challenges of becoming fluent in English and keeping up the academic achievement with peers. Results from a recent study showed that there were differences between the EOLs and ELLs groups on children's learning outcomes in reading performance and proficiencies. During the kindergarten year, the EOL children did better than ELL children in the development of reading proficiencies such as \"letter recognition\", \"beginning sounds\", \"ending sounds\", and \"sight words.\" In the first grade, the EOL children performed better on \"work in context\" and \"literal inference.\" The reading gap seemed to widen between the groups as the children finished first grade (Lin, Wei, & Wang, 2017). The trend of the ELL students falling behind non-ELL students remains steady. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) analyzed the students' records from 2002 to 2017andfound that ELL students had lower reading scores than non-ELL students. In 2017, the achievement gap between non-ELL and ELL students was 37 points at4 th -grade and 43 points at the 8 th -grade level (McFarland et al., 2018).NAEP used three levels to categorize students' reading skills: (1) basic level indicates partial mastery of fundamental skills, (2) proficient level indicates demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter, and (3) advanced level indicates superior performance beyond proficient. The NAEP 2005 report indicated that in the 4 th grade, nearly 73% of ELL students scored below basic requirements in reading. This percentage is much higher than their white counterparts who had 47% of the students were behind in reading (Fry, 2007). The 4 th grade is the earliest point at which the National Report Card tracks students' academic performance. Additionally, under the United States federal \"No Child Left Behind Act,\" the U.S. Department of Education requires each state set a standard for accountability and determine the methods and procedures for measuring students' adequate yearly progress (AYP). Reading and math are the two main content areas. The earliest grade level on the state test is the third grade. Understanding how young children develop reading abilities, researchers should take a more comprehensive approach by exploring the effects of gender, family income levels and home languages on young children's reading development. Furthermore, the reading development in kindergarten has a great impact on students' reading achievement. When children fell behind in early grades, such as kindergarten, students became further and further behind throughout grade school (Grossen, 1997). Thus, using students' third-grade reading AYP results to monitor students' reading development is not effective but also puts them at a greater risk for academic failures. Children's reading development starts in kindergarten or even earlier. It is important to track in the earliest stage of how ELLs develop English language skills."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of the Study", "text": "It was not clear how much progress ELL students made in reading development in the early elementary school years.

Furthermore, all these differences can be influenced through education. Teachers should be advised against perceiving and acting differently toward boys than girls because of gender stereotyping. Instead, effective teachers expect boys and girls to have similar cognitive and academic abilities, excel in all skills and subjects, display similar potential, and strive to be sensitive to the unique needs of all students.

In 2010, more than 15,000 students started kindergarten that year. Among those students, nearly17% of them were English language learners. Overall, children showed various growth in reading development during the year of kindergarten. There is a gender difference in children's reading performance, with female students doing slightly better than male over a 1-point difference. It seems to have confirmed the long-held belief in gender differences that girls are stronger than boys in verbal abilities, however, in the meantime, it has also shown that such differences are very small, which has been concluded by many previous studies (Halpern & LaMay, 2000;Linn & Hyde, 1989). Children's performance in reading IRT scores has shown differences among the three groups: English Only Learners (EOL) had the highest mean scores, followed by the group of multilingual learners (ML) English language learner (ELL) group had the lowest scores for both semesters. The gaps between the EOL and ELL group were a 4-point difference in the fall semester and near 6-point difference in the spring semester. The ELL children's lower reading achievement has been distinctly illuminated in this study. The literature has shown that not only in reading development but also on many measures of academic achievement, ELLs fall behind English-speaking peers (Arends, 2015, p. 76). Cummins estimated that ELLs need two years to attain basic communication skills and five to seven years to develop academic language proficiency (Cummins, 2006). ELL children might be able to do well on the playground and in social situations, but need much more time to become skillful in learning academic content in English and in learning the English language to build reading competence. ISSN 2162-6952 2018 The family income levels also show differences in children's reading performance. The higher the family income was, the better students performed in mean reading scores. The performances from highest to the lowest were high, middle, and low family income groups. The discrepancies between the high and low-income students were 7-points in the fall semester and 8-points in the spring semester. This finding has corroborated with many research studies that illustrated the achievement gap between low and high-SES children (Eamon, 2002;Noguera, 2011). It provides more evidence indicating that family wealth, status, and power exert a deep influence on children's school learning, and reading development in particular. Children from different socioeconomic backgrounds vary in the amounts of language and vocabulary exposed to in the home environment, as well as the utterance lengths in different contexts. Low-SES children speak longer during informal, out-of-school conversations while high-SES children tend to speak more extensively during a formal, story-retelling situation (Cazden, 1972). In addition, teachers' differential treatment to students from different familial backgrounds explains the lower achievement of low-SES children, including poor reading proficiency. \"Teachers may hold low expectations for these children and stereotype abilities because of the clothes worn or the use of language\" (Arends, 2015, p. 84). Teachers' low expectations lead to children's low self-esteem and low expectations for academic achievement, through which, a vicious cycle of expectations and behaviors on the part of both teachers and ELL students."}, {"section_title": "Future Studies & Implications", "text": "To help young children develop literacy skills, parents and teachers should provide them with a supportive environment. Children benefit most when actively participating and immersed in a wide range of interesting activities, such as listening, talking, writing, and reading experiences. Although gender, family income, and home language, all have impacts on students' reading development, family income showed the strongest impact on students' progress in reading development. For families above the poverty line, students regardless of home language, the reading performance remained similar, while ELL and ML students from low-income families showed less growth. It is critical to provide a rich reading environment for ELL and ML children during the early elementary school years. Having well-trained ELL teachers to teach young children is a necessity for this country. The results of this study indicate that ELL training for teachers throughout each school district in every state is highly recommended. A qualified ELL teacher should know the English language system well; how to teach phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon, and semantics. From specific ELL training teachers gain a deep ISSN 2162-6952 2018 understanding of second language acquisition what is involved in acquiring a second language, and how this process happens. In addition, to teach ELLs effectively, it is important to provide modifications and support such as adopting materials that are familiar to students, using ELLs' primary languages to support learning, helping ELLs build vocabulary, and providing scaffolds to link learners' prior knowledge to the new materials. ELL teachers can serve as the advocates for language-minority students, respect students' languages and cultures, and facilitate students' families and communities to be involved in ELL's education."}]
