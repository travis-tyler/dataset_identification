[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Ventriculomegaly (expansion of the brain's fluid-filled ventricles), a condition commonly found in the aging brain, results in areas of gliosis where the ependymal cells are replaced with dense astrocytic patches. Loss of ependymal cells would compromise trans-ependymal bulk flow mechanisms required for clearance of proteins and metabolites from the brain parenchyma. However, little is known about the interplay between age-related ventricle expansion, the decline in ependymal integrity, altered periventricular fluid homeostasis, abnormal protein accumulation and cognitive impairment. In collaboration with the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we analyzed longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subject-matched fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI and periventricular biospecimens to map spatiotemporally the progression of ventricle expansion and associated periventricular edema and loss of transependymal exchange functions in healthy aging individuals and those with varying degrees of cognitive impairment. We found that the trajectory of ventricle expansion and periventricular edema progression correlated with degree of cognitive impairment in both speed and severity, and confirmed that areas of expansion showed ventricle surface gliosis accompanied by edema and periventricular accumulation of protein aggregates, suggesting impaired clearance mechanisms in these regions. These findings reveal pathophysiological outcomes associated with normal brain aging and cognitive impairment, and indicate that a multifactorial analysis is best suited to predict and monitor cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The human brain's ventricular system is essential for the movement of nutrient-rich cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) throughout the central nervous system, providing trophic support of brain function via a wide array of vitamins, growth factors, peptides and nucleosides (Johanson et al., 2008) . A special epithelial lining along the ventricle walls composed of multiciliated ependymal cells allows for the movement of CSF nutrients into the brain parenchyma as well as clearance of proteins and metabolites from the interstitial fluid (ISF; Johanson et al., 2008 Johanson et al., , 2011 Del Bigio, 2010) . This ependyma-mediated bidirectional CSF-ISF exchange, as well as the formation of a cell barrier to prevent movement of proteins and metabolites from the CSF back into the ISF, relies on the presence of an intact ependymal cell monolayer with motile cilia, microvilli, and tight and adherens junctions (Del Bigio, 1995) . Pathological conditions in humans that are characterized by ependymal cell stretching and/or loss, including hydrocephalus, typically result in decreased CSF turnover rates and impaired clearance of proteins and metabolites resulting in a harmful buildup of these substances in brain parenchymal tissue (Silverberg et al., 2001 (Silverberg et al., , 2003 Pratic\u00f2 et al., 2004; Redzic et al., 2005; Johanson et al., 2008) .\nLongitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based studies have established that expansion of the brain's fluidfilled lateral ventricles (LVs), or ventriculomegaly, is a defining feature of the aging brain (Matsumae et al., 1996; Resnick et al., 2000 Resnick et al., , 2003 Scahill et al., 2003; Preul et al., 2006; Shook et al., 2014) . Ventricle expansion rates correlate strongly with declining cognitive performance (Carmichael et al., 2007; Nestor et al., 2008; Grimm et al., 2012; Madsen et al., 2015) and the rate of ventricle volume increase has been linked to an increase in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles (Silbert et al., 2003) , as well as alterations in CSF biomarker composition. Together, these point towards defective CSF-ISF exchange and impaired clearance mechanisms that are characteristic of AD (Ott et al., 2010; van Waalwijk van Doorn et al., 2017) . In previous studies, we found that enlarged ventricles from aging humans exhibited regional gliosis in the place of functional ependymal cell coverage (Shook et al., 2014) . We predict that replacement of the ependymal lining with stratified layers of astrocytes at the ventricle surface adversely affects transependymal CSF/ISF bulk flow mechanisms, leading to fluid accumulation or edema and harmful buildup of proteins and metabolites in the periventricular space. Due to the rarity of longitudinal MRI data sets and associated subject-matched periventricular tissue biospecimens, this has never been directly demonstrated.\nDegeneration of periventricular brain tissue and declines in associated white matter tract integrity are common with normal aging and the extent of periventricular tissue abnormalities has been linked to dementia and AD (Teipel et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2017; Mayo et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2017) . Periventricular hyperintensities (PVH), as measured using T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI, are indicative of fluid accumulation, or edema, often located in the parenchymal tissue directly adjacent to the frontal and occipital horns of the LV (DeCarli et al., 2005; Maillard et al., 2013; Shim et al., 2015) . The precise etiology of PVH is not clear; however, studies have implicated impaired drainage of ISF from the periventricular white matter resulting in aberrant fluid accumulation (Weller et al., 2015) , potentially related to impaired transependymal bulk flow mechanisms. The presence of PVH has been linked to deterioration of the periventricular white matter tracts as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), specifically showing increased water diffusion (mean diffusivity, MD) and decreased organized and directed water movement along tracts (fractional anisotropy, FA) in regions of PVH (Zhan et al., 2009) . Although ventricle expansion, PVH and white matter tract deterioration have been shown individually to be prevalent in the aging brain and even more so with cognitive impairment, the physiological links and histological correlates between these brain changes in normal aging and cognitive impairment, as well as the potential use of these combined measures as predictive tools, have not been fully investigated.\nUsing data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), we investigated the relationships among the following variables: ventricle expansion, PVH, periventricular white matter tract integrity and degree of cognitive impairment. We also investigated the histopathological correlates of these measures, including LV wall gliosis and periventricular protein accumulation. We found that both LV and PVH volumes increase with age, and this expansion is more rapid and dramatic in cognitively impaired (CI) subjects. We also found a direct relationship between LV volume and PVH volume increase. Case studies from the BLSA allowed us to link ventricle expansion with regional gliosis, where an intact ependymal cell monolayer was replaced with stratified layers of astrocytes in regions of LV expansion. Additionally, adjacent parenchymal regions exhibited edema (as indicated by PVH), white matter deterioration (as evident by DTI measures), decreased vascular integrity, and harmful buildup of proteins including A\u03b2 and tau. Our studies paired longitudinal MR imaging with subject-matched biospecimens to reveal important connections among ventricle volume, periventricular pathology and cognitive impairment that better define the ventricular system's contributions to brain health in aging, and could potentially serve as tools for predicting and monitoring age-related cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subject Selection", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

The ''diff-prep'' command was run with default registration parameters. This consisted of using the T1 and T2 images as structural models to correct for common defects in the DWI, including motion and eddy current correction and elimination of echo-planar imaging (EPI) distortions. Using the ''diff-calc'' command, tensors were then fit using a non-linear function and adjusted for image noise. This generated tensor derived quantities and diffusion tensor images (DTI) that were exported in a format easily integrated with further analysis in FreeSurfer (Dale et al., 1999; Fischl and Dale, 2000) 5 .\nSimultaneously, structural T1 images were used in the cortical reconstruction process of FreeSurfer using all of the included steps of the ''recon-all'' command. Tractography of DTI images was completed using the FreeSurfer tool TRACULA (Tracts Constrained by Underlying Anatomy 6 ). TRACULA (Yendiki et al., 2011) uses global tractography to analyze a set of 18 major white-matter pathways automatically. These tracts include the corticospinal tract, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinated fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiation, cingulum-cingulate gyrus bundle, cingulumangular bundle, superior longitudinal fasciculus-parietal bundle, superior longitudinal fasciculus-temporal bundle and corpus callosum forceps major and forceps minor. Within TRACUALA, manual tractography of training participants, 34 schizophrenic and 33 normal individuals, was used in order to generate anatomical maps for automation for this program (Gold et al., 2014) . DTIs and cortical surfaces generated by FreeSurfer were input into TRACULA. Using the ''trac-all'' command, the program combines information from these images with anatomical knowledge from the training participants to create accurate reconstructions of the white matter tracts. TRACULA was used to generate probabilistic tractography and extract tensor-based measures including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) for the 18 white matter tracts.\nAs an additional analysis, the DWI images cleaned using TORTOISE were also further analyzed in AFNI (Cox, 1996) 7 . Tensors were fit using a non-linear fit algorithm to generate DTI images. In AFNI, these masks were overlaid on T1 images to visualize changes in FA values. A threshold of 0.40 was used for the most accurate depictions. Next, seed points (Regions of Interest, ROIs) were placed in order to gather more precise, localized data.

These individuals exhibited a range of cognitive performance, falling into ''normal'', ''mild'', ''moderate'' or ''severe'' impairment categories as determined by the AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS), MMSE, or CDR ( Table 1) .

This increase in LV volume was significantly higher (unpaired t-test with Welch's correction; P < 0.0001, df = 135.1) in CI (any level) vs. normal subjects as determined by ADAS score at the second time point (Figure 1A, bottom left) . Two-year change in ADAS score also correlated with PVH volume increase, albeit to a lesser degree (slope 7.72 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ) than LV volume, and increase in PVH volume was significantly higher (unpaired t-test with Welch's correction; P = 0.0018, df = 174.5) in those deemed CI by ADAS score at the second time point (Figure 1A, top and bottom  right) .\nDecrease in MMSE score (worsening cognition; shown as a positive value for ease of interpretation) also correlated with an increase in LV volume (slope 1.83 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) and PVH volume increase (slope 5.39 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ) over a 2-year period ( Figure 1B , top left and right).

Due to the categorical nature of the CDR scale, we divided all subjects into groups: those who maintained a stable score and those who had an increase in score, and therefore worsening cognitive performance, during the 2-year analysis interval. Those who exhibited an increase in score had a larger increase in LV volume, but this was non-significant (n.s.; unpaired t-test with Welch's correction; P = 0.1114, df = 94.75) and PVH volume (unpaired t-test with Welch's correction; P = 0.0306, df = 73.64) than those who maintained a stable score (Figure 1C , top left and right).

It is important to note that subject CI1 transitioned from CN to CI. Final pathological diagnosis also included consideration of postmortem histological evaluation of Alzheimer's and other neuropathology. For each subject, the first available T1 scan was used to create a 3D model of the LVs, and the last available scan (either antemortem or postmortem, as indicated in Table 2 ) was overlaid onto the first scan to identify areas of LV expansion. CN1 (Figure 2A) showed very little LV expansion between the ages of 65-69, and large areas of the lateral and medial walls of the LV frontal and occipital horns were covered by intact ependymal cells, as indicated by aquaporin-4 (Figures 2Aa-d, AQP4 , blue) which outlines the ependymal cell membrane. Ependymal cells appeared cuboidal in shape and not stretched or distorted. We also observed some regional LV wall gliosis, indicated by glial fibrillary acidic protein (Figures 2Aa-d , GFAP, red) staining of astrocyte patches, in areas that exhibited little to no LV expansion based on MRI modeling; however, it is important to note the relatively long gap (15 months, 16 days) between the last scan and collection of postmortem tissue for analysis, an adequate amount of time for additional expansion to have occurred. CN2 ( Figure 2B) , with overlays of scans at ages 83 and 99, showed more LV expansion. The regions of the frontal and occipital horns analyzed exhibited large spans of gliosis with ''islands'' of intact ependymal cell coverage that correlated with LV areas lacking expansion (Figures 2Ba-d) .\nCI1 ( Figure 3A) , with scans at ages 63 and 82, showed a large amount of LV expansion particularly in the superior and lateral aspects. This correlated with large regions of gliosis along the lateral frontal as well as medial frontal and occipital LV wall (Figures 3Aa,b,d) . The medial wall generally retained intact ependymal cell coverage, and this coincided with a lack of expansion in this area (Figure 3Ac) . A similar pattern of LV expansion was seen in CI2 ( Figure 3B, ages 83 and 85 years) . This individual exhibited complete replacement of ependymal cells with gliosis in all areas examined (Figures 3Ba,b,d) , with the exception of a small region of intact ependymal cell coverage in the medial wall of the frontal horn (Figure 3Bc) . These findings show that in areas of LV expansion, ependymal cells are replaced with glial cells, representing scarring on the ventricle surface.

For each subject, a 3D representation of PVH at the second time point (red) is overlaid onto PVH volume the first time point (blue), and these are both then overlaid on a translucent 3D representation of the LV (gray; Figure 4A ). CN1 had minimal PVH and expansion which localized mainly to the frontal and inferior horns of the LV. CI2 had more PVH and greater expansion which was present mainly in the frontal and occipital horns as well as the cingulum region-areas that also exhibited marked ventricle expansion ( Figure 3B) .\nTo investigate the integrity of the vasculature in areas of PVH, we performed immunolabeling for albumin on periventricular tissue from the regions denoted by the small white boxes in Figure 4A . The regions selected were representative of PVH severity in each subject. The region examined in CN1 showed some edema as shown by FLAIR-MRI and this correlated with mostly intact vessels, as indicated by punctate, localized albumin immunostaining ( Figure 4B) . In contrast, the periventricular region examined in CI2 had a large area of PVH that expanded, and this was linked to very diffuse albumin staining with no readily apparent intact blood vessels ( Figure 4B ). These findings, representative of a limited survey, point to a breakdown of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and increased leakiness of the vasculature in regions of LV expansion and PVH volume increase.\nUsing tissue from the same regions as indicated in Figure 4A , we assessed abnormal accumulation of proteins, namely hyperphosphorylated tau and amyloid-beta 1-42 (A\u03b242), in regions of PVH. We found that the region examined in CN1 did exhibit some tau accumulation; however, levels of accumulated tau were much higher in CI2 (Figure 4C) . Similarly, CN1 showed almost no buildup of A\u03b242, while CI2 had significant A\u03b242 accumulation in the form of compact and diffuse plaques as highlighted by white and black arrows, respectively ( Figure 4D) . Taken together, these findings lend support to the notion that LV expansion coupled with the existence of PVH and ensuing edema are linked to the abnormal accumulation of proteins and metabolites in the periventricular region.\nWe next investigated functional movement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) along periventricular white matter tracts located in the regions we examined histologically. Using DTI, we examined fractional anisotropy (FA) in CN1 and CI2 at the same time points as in Figure 4A . When overlaying FA values at the two ages analyzed for each subject, we found that CN1 had almost no visible change in FA. CI2, however, showed a decrease in FA specifically in the frontal and occipital periventricular regions ( Figure 4E ). These findings indicated that CI2 had decreased FA, reflecting deterioration of the white matter tract integrity in these regions, thereby suggesting decreased and/or impaired directional CSF flow in areas of LV expansion and PVH.\nThis was further explored in specific regions of interest (ROIs) along major periventricular white matter tracts (Figure 5 ). In the frontal region ( Figure 5A ; forceps minor, anterior thalamic radiation), the cingulum ( Figure 5B ; cingulum-cingulate gyrus bundle), and along the inferior region ( Figure 5D ; uncinate fasciculus, corticospinal tract), CI2 displayed lower FA values than CN1, indicating more unrestricted, isotropic CSF flow in these areas in contrast to the controlled movement of CSF along white matter tracts typically seen. These findings suggest a link between ventricle expansion, gliosis, edema, and decreased white matter integrity in our case studies."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "It is known that ventricle expansion occurs with normal aging and is accelerated with cognitive impairment (Carmichael et al., 2007; Nestor et al., 2008; Grimm et al., 2012; Madsen et al., 2015) ; however, the underlying pathophysiological causes and consequences of this finding are unclear. Additionally, the direct relationships among LV volume changes, PVH, and white matter integrity have not been fully investigated. Our longitudinal studies showed that LV volume and cognitive function share a consistently linear relationship, with LV expansion correlating with worsening cognitive performance over a 2-year period as determined by three independent cognitive tests. We also found a strong correlation between 2-year increase in LV volume and 2-year increase in PVH volume. LV volume analysis provides a robust, noninvasive physiological parameter that could potentially be used, with other imaging and cognitive testing, to identify and follow the progression of cognitive impairment. The sharp contrast of CSF to surrounding brain tissue on T1-weighted MRI makes the LV especially amenable to automated segmentation using a number of widely available and accessible programs, allowing for consistent and rapid analysis. Additionally, multiple studies have shown that LV volumes correlate more strongly with cognitive decline and are more sensitive to varying degrees of cognitive impairment than medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy rates, which are currently being used as a diagnostic and monitoring tool (Bradley et al., 2002; Jack et al., 2004; Ferrarini et al., 2006) . Using a similarly reproducible and rapid segmentation technique, PVH can be analyzed alongside LV volume to generate relationships and ratios that could be clinically informative. Our studies provide support for the use of multimodal neuroimaging, including both T1 structural and T2-FLAIR, combined with comprehensive cognitive testing to better determine and follow the progression of age-related cognitive impairment.\nUsing CN and CI case studies, we showed that in areas of ventricle expansion the ependymal cell monolayer that typically lines the LV wall is replaced by dense astrocytic patches. This was accelerated and more widespread in CI compared to normal subjects. Our group and others have shown previously that gliosis occurs along the walls of expanded ventricles (Del Bigio, 1993 Fazekas et al., 1993 Fazekas et al., , 1998 Dom\u00ednguez-Pinos et al., 2005; P\u00e1ez et al., 2007; Shook et al., 2014) ; however, the present study is the first to show location-specific volumetric analysis with subject-matched biospecimens to pinpoint the cellular changes found in regions of LV expansion in human. It is not entirely clear what sequence of events leads to the replacement of ependymal cells by gliosis; however, it has been shown that ependymal cell stretching/tearing that occurs during the process of expansion can cause ependymal cell loss and reactive changes in the subependymal astroglial layer of the subventricular zone (Del Bigio, 1993 Fazekas et al., 1993 Fazekas et al., , 1998 Shook et al., 2014) and infection or traumatic brain injury can lead to loss of ependymal cells at the ventricle surface and subsequent ventricle expansion (Johnson, 1975; Mori and Kimura, 2001; Goldstein et al., 2012; McKee et al., 2013) . Since ependymal cells form a selective barrier that allows for the transport of CSF nutrients into the brain parenchyma and simultaneous clearance of toxins from the ISF (Del Bigio, 1995 Johanson et al., 2008 Johanson et al., , 2011 , replacement of portions of the ependyma with astrocytes would contribute to defective CSF-ISF exchange along the ventricle walls (Miller and McAllister, 2007; McAllister and Miller, 2010; Roales-Buj\u00e1n et al., 2012) . In our case studies, we found that regional ventricle expansion in normal aging and cognitive impairment and related compromise of ventricle wall fluid exchange are linked to localized edema, as visualized by FLAIR-MRI. Fluid accumulation was more pronounced and advanced more rapidly in our CI case study. Interestingly, edema was localized mainly to the LV occipital horns, the region with the most LV expansion in this particular case study.\nWe found abnormal accumulation of proteins, specifically A\u03b2 and tau, in periventricular tissue regions exhibiting PVH and directly adjacent to areas in which ependymal cells were replaced by astrocytes, potentially indicating a consequence of impaired CSF-ISF exchange related to ventricle expansion and LV wall compromise. This indicates that without intact ependymal cell function, these harmful proteins are not properly cleared from parenchymal tissue, or they are leaking back into the parenchymal tissue from the CSF as a result of defective LV wall barrier functions in the wake of ependymal cell loss. Increased A\u03b2 production via enhanced cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) could also be contributing to this abnormal protein accumulation (Glabe, 2005) . Regardless of mechanism, the presence of these toxins in periventricular tissue has the potential to contribute to cognitive decline in a number of ways. Aggregates and oligomeric forms of A\u03b2, specifically A\u03b242, are highly neurotoxic and strongly associated with AD pathological progression and memory loss (Naslund et al., 2000; Lesn\u00e9 et al., 2006; Walsh and Selkoe, 2007; Querfurth and LaFerla, 2010) . Similarly, aggregated forms of hyperphosphorylated tau are cytotoxic and linked to impaired cognition (Querfurth and LaFerla, 2010) . A\u03b2 is also toxic to endothelial cells, which could contribute to BBB breakdown and further fluid accumulation/edema (Zlokovic, 2011; Koizumi et al., 2016) , as was seen in our CI case study.\nBased on the location of periventricular fluid and abnormal protein accumulation, we hypothesized that the integrity of certain white matter tracts in this region could be affected (Li et al., 2013 (Li et al., , 2014 . Studies involving DTI of aging individuals report a general decrease in organized CSF flow along white matter (decreased FA) tracts and an increase in disorganized water diffusion (increased MD; Sullivan and Pfefferbaum, 2006; Bastin et al., 2010; Madden et al., 2012; Coutu et al., 2014) . With cognitive impairment and AD, there is an even more pronounced decrease in FA and increase in MD (Teipel et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2017; Mayo et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2017) . The functional consequences of these measures include decreased white matter tract integrity, with direct links to cognitive decline (Charlton et al., 2006; Gold et al., 2012; Teipel et al., 2014) . Our findings of decreased FA in regions of periventricular edema and directly adjacent to areas of ventricle expansion provide evidence of a functional change associated with ventriculomegaly and related changes in the LV wall cytoarchitecture in the aging and CI brain. Although there are studies correlating periventricular edema to abnormal cerebral deposition (Polvikoski et al., 2010; Gordon et al., 2015; Shim et al., 2015) and abnormal levels of A\u03b2 and tau in CSF (Stenset et al., 2011; Li et al., 2014) , ours is the first study to link periventricular edema, abnormal protein deposition, and functional decline of periventricular white matter tracts.\nOur longitudinal MRI-based studies provide support for the use of LV volumetric analysis, coupled with FLAIR PVH analysis, in the identification and monitoring of cognitive impairment with aging. Moreover, our comprehensive analysis of longitudinal TI structural and FLAIR MRI, DTI, and subjectmatched biospecimens allowed us to link specific regions of LV expansion with gliosis, periventricular edema, abnormal protein deposition and declines in white matter tract integrity. Together, these findings support the importance of an intact LV wall barrier and its critical clearance functions, and provide insight into the pathophysiological consequences of LV expansion and ependymal cell loss potentially contributing to cognitive decline in the aging brain."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "KLT and JCC designed the research.
