[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) collects statistics on the condition of education in the United States, analyzes and reports the meaning and significance of these statistics, and assists states and local education agencies in improving their statistical systems. NCES supports a wide range of activities. It provides policy-relevant data on issues such as access of minorities to postsecondary education and the impact of enrollment changes on institutions and the outcomes of education. NCES also provides current data on vocational education, and it produces longitudinal data on various cohorts of students from elementary through postsecondary education and into the work force. The Center's programs are directed toward: 1. Maintaining and analyzing the following major cross-sectional databases: at the elementary-secondary level the Common Core of Data, the Schools and Staffing Survey, and the Private School Survey; and, at the postsecondary levelthe Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, the Recent College Graduates Study, the National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty, and the Survey of Earned Doctorates Awarded in the United States. In addition, a new, wide-ranging study, the National Household Education Survey, was conducted in 1991 with additional supplements planned for the future. It contains information on all levels of education from preschool to postsecondary. These data bases are the principal sources for the Center's most widely used publicationsThe Condition of Education, Digest of Education Statistics, and Projections of Education Statistics. 3.

The basic program includes national, state, and local data collection systems on public and private elementary and secondary education. Important recent additions to the Center's data collection programs include the Schools and Staffing Survey and the National Household Education Survey. Together with the Common Core of Data, and a number of other surveys, they supply a wealth of information about elementary and secondary education in the Nation. An important part of the elementary and secondary program is the publication of an annual report titled Dropout Rates in the United States. Mandated by law, this publication reports numbers of dropouts as well as retention and graduation rates to the appropriate committees of Congress on the second Tuesday after Labor Day. The Current Population Survey (conducted by the Bureau of the Census) is the primary source of data for this report."}, {"section_title": "Data Uses:", "text": "The statistics collected from state education agencies and from other special surveys are used extensively by people outside of NCES. They are used for testimony before Congressional committees, for planning in various federal executive departments, and for projects developed by professional organizations. They are also used by state executive and legislative staffs, by state and local education agencies, and by associations of local school systems. Other users are colleges, universities, and other facilities that do education research; various businesses that sell to educational institutions; and the media in reporting on educational issues and events. Examples of data uses during this past year are reviewed below. In 1992, federal, state, and local governments made numerous requests for data. For example, a Congressman requested data on the characteristics of high schools in his state; a federal agency requested data on numbers of teachers by school level and type; a major newspaper requested data on the number of public school districts with only one school; state governments requested data on high school dropouts and teacher attrition rates; and local governments requested analyses of teacher demographics. The media also needed data on elementary and secondary education. A newspaper requested analyses of first-time teachers in the U.S. A Canadian province requested data on the number of hours/days teachers spend teaching per week, and numerous colleges and universities requested copies of data tapes on NELS 8th grade cohort and SASS teacher files. Other requests came from colleges and universities needing data on newly hired teachers and analyses of rural schools; an education association requesting data and analyses on large urban school districts; a foundation asking for figures on private school special education students; and an individual researcher asking for specific information on high school geometry students. Common Core of Data: The Common Core of Data (CCD) is the Center's primary database on elementary and secondary public education in the United States. CCD is a comprehensive, annual, national statistical database of all public elementary and secondary schools and school districts, which contains data that are comparable across all states. The objectives of the CCD are twofold: first, to provide an official listing of public elementary and secondary schools and school districts in the nation, which can be used to select samples for other NCES surveys. And second, to provide basic information and descriptive statistics on public elementary and secondary schools and schooling in general.\nThe NCES higher education data systems provide such information as trends in enrollment and degree completion; patterns of expenditures and revenues of institutions; patterns of student financial aid; workload of faculty; and the relationship between educational experience and labor market outcomes. These data are used to describe the condition of postsecondary education and to monitor changes. Federal program staff have used IPEDS and student aid survey data to address policy issues on financial aid programs. Policymakers at the state and institutional level have used IPEDS data for planning purposes. Government commissions have used these data to monitor compliance with federal legislation. Thousands of requests for information, based on the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), and other postsecondary programs, are received by the Center each year. Those requesting data fall roughly into seven categories: 1) federal agencies; 2) state agencies; 3) national and regional education associations; 4) individual institutions; 5) the media; 6) the business community; and 7) the general public. Members of the executive branch, Congress or Congressional Committees and a number of independent federal agencies use information from the Center on a regular basis. For example, an office of the legislative branch used IPEDS information to develop a profile of proprietary, less-than-2-year institutions. Several executive branch offices use the information to track baccalaureate and higher degree data by selected fields of study and minority status of degree recipients. An independent federal agency uses the information to track degree completions in engineering and scientific fields of study. State higher education agencies regularly use the data to help determine salary and fringe benefit packages for their full-time instructional staff. Other state agencies use the completions and institutional data on an annual basis to evaluate the availability of specific career training programs. Several state agencies have used the residence and migration data to determine where their high school graduates enroll in postsecondary education institutions. National and regional education associations annually request tabulations to determine enrollment patterns by racial/ethnic categories and fields of study, and finance data to review the economic health of postsecondary education institutions. Individual institutions use similar information at an institutional level for peer analyses and institutional planning purposes. These peer analyses range from comparing selected financial ratios to comparing proportions of minority student enrollments. The media, business community and the general public use the informa ion in a variety of ways. For example, one newspaper used the data to develop a major article that compares public 4-year institutions across selected states. Members of the business community have used degree completion data to target minority recruitment efforts in selected fields of study. The general public regularly requests information on which institutions offer degrees in specific fields of study.\nNAEP data have been employed in numerous ways by researchers, educators, policymakers, and the general public. Researchers have used NAEP data to describe performance trends in all subject areas, especially basic skills; to study achievement in the arts; and to analyze instructional practices and to conduct other research projects. Policymakers cite NAEP data to illustrate the state of the American educational system. Educators have used the results to develop standards for improved mathematics and science curricula. Elected officials have used NAEP data to call for educational reform. NCES receives many requests for information about education in other countries such as school achievement levels, school completion rates, school expenditure levels, and higher education enrollment rates. Policymakers, such as chief state school officers, governors, and local school officials, also want to know the average level of achievement in other countries. Most requests are for data concerning highly developed countries (e.g., Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, and Japan). High school transcript data have been used for a variety of assessment purposes. In its paper has related the course-taking patterns of students in 1982 to selected characteristics of their schools. The 1990 High School Transcript Study is being developed to compare the coursetaking patterns of students in 1990 with similar patterns in 1987 and 1982. Extensive analyses of vocational education enrollments and of course-taking patterns of handicapped high school students have been conducted through the National Assessment of Vocational Education (NAVE).\nThe National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72) data have been widely used for investigating educational policy issues. For example, in the early 1980s, a congressional agency turned to these data to develop a model for estimating the costs of tuition tax credits. More recently, capsule descriptions of this cohort have been produced and attrition rates from college have been studied, as have transitions from high school and college into the work place. Postsecondary attainment, access, and financial aid studies have all used NLS-72. Studies have noted that the NLS-72 studies have produced data which yield significant insights into contemporary America. The enlarged scope of High School and Beyond (HS&B) has provided even more data than NLS-72 for examining a wide variety of education policy issues. Like NLS-72, HS&B has produced a number of capsule descriptions of high school students. Additionally, HS&B data have been used to study the achievement of Hispanic students, discipline and order in high schools, economic issues such as students working while in school, comparisons of public and private schools, and course-taking patterns of American high school students. They also make it possible to compare the students of 1980 with those of 1972. The National Assessment of Vocational Education (NAVE) utilized the findings from the HS&B study in a number of their reports. For example, NAVE used HS&B data for studies which attempted to measure high school curricular experiences as they relate to vocational education; course enrollment patterns; and student financial a;d as it relates to postsecondary vocational education. The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) completed the second followup data collection in 1992. Data from this survey are being used to study transition patterns of 8th grade students as they move through school (e.g., moving from public to private school, dropping out of school, transitioning into high school). Other research issues being addressed include: 1) students' academic growth over time and the family, community, and classroom factors that promote or inhibit such growth; 2) the process of dropping out of school; 3) the role of the school in helping the disadvantaged; 4) the school experiences and academic performance of language minority students; and 5) the process of attracting students to the study of mathematics and science. Young people's success in making the transition from high school or college to the work force varies enormously for reasons only partially understood. Some cling to dependency; others move into self-determination smoothly. The National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72) base year study together with the five followup surveys attempted to provide data to allow researchers to study how these transitions evolve.\nThe primary use of the DOVE system is to report on the status of vocational education. NCES has published a considerable number of reports on a range of vocational topics, including students, teachers, and institutions. These publications are listed in the section on selected publications in this chapter. These publications include Vocational Education in the United States: 1969 1990, a recent NCES publication that synthesizes NCES vocational education data at both the secondary and postsecondary levels. In addition, the DOVE system was the primary data source for the National Assessment of Vocational Education (NAVE), a congressionally mandated evaluation of federal vocational education programs. For example, NAVE used the High School and Beyond data for studies which attempted to measure high school curricular experiences as they relate to vocational education; vocational education course enrollment patterns; and student financial aid for postsecondary vocational education.\nToday these data provide the only current, national descriptive data on the status of libraries. These data are used by federal, state, and local officials, professional associations, and local practitioners for planning, evaluation, and policymaking. These data are also valuable to researchers and educators for developing conclusions concerning the state and best use of libraries and their resources."}, {"section_title": "DESIGN:", "text": "The CCD survey collects data about all public elementary and secondary schools, all local education agencies, and all state education agencies throughout the United States. CCD contains three categories of information: general descriptive information on schools and school districts; data on students and staff; and fiscal data. The general descriptive information includes name, address, phone number, and type of locale; the data on students and staff include demographic characteristics; and the fiscal data cover revenues and current expenditures. The CCD is made up of a set of five surveys sent to state education departments. Most of the data are obtained from administrative records maintained by the state education agencies (SEAs). Statistical information is collected annually from public elementary and secondary schools (approximately 87,000) public school districts (approximately 16,000) and the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas. The SEAS compile CCD requested data into prescribed formats and transmit the information to NCES.\nSchools are the primary sampling unit for SASS, and a sample of teachers is selected in each school. Public school districts are included in the sample when one or more of their schools is selected. The 1990-91 SASS, like the 1987-88 SASS, drew a stratified probability sample of approximately 12,800 schools (9,300 public and 3,500 private), 65,000 teachers (52,00G public and 13,000 private), and 5,600 public school districts. The survey is conducted by mail with telephone fol!owup. The 1990-91 public school sample was selected from the Common Core of Data public school universe list maintained by NCES. All public schools in the file were stratified by the 50 states and the District of Columbia, and then by three grade levels (elementary, secondary, and combined). A special sample of schools serving large numbers of American Indian or Alaskan Native students was also drawn to provide national estimates of their schools, teachers, and principals. The private school sample was selected in 1990-91 from the NCES 1989-90 private school universe file which consisted of a list frame of schools and a geographic area frame designed to improve coverage of schools. All private schools on the universe file were stratified by the four census regions, and within each region, schools were further stratified by three grade levels (elementary, secondary, and combined), and by 18 types of religious affiliation as well as those not affiliated. The SASS sample has been designed to support the following types of estimates and comparisons: national and state estimates for public schools and teachers; estimates for private schools and teachers at the national level and for selected groupings; national comparisons of elementary, secondary, and combined schools and teachers.\nTwo questionnaires comprise the IFS: a) the Teacher Followup Survey Questionnaire for Former Teachers; and b) the Teacher Followup Survey Questionnaire for Continuing Teachers (those who remained in the same school as well as those who moved to another school). These questionnaires ask teachers about their current status, occupational changes and plans, reasons for staying in (or leaving) teaching, and attitudes about the teaching profession. The TFS was first conducted in the 1988-89 school year with a sample from the 1987-88 SASS of about 2,500 teachers who had left teaching and 5,000 who were still in teaching. The Center next collected teacher followup data during the school year 1991-92. Future followups will be 1 year after the administration of SASS, which is conducted every 3 years. The TFS provides information on the characteristics of those who leave teaching, their reasons for leaving, and their current occupational status. For those persons who remain in teaching, information is gathered on their career paths. Comparisons can be made among \"leavers,\" \"stayers,\" and \"movers\" (i.e., those teachers who remain in teaching but move to another school). Sampled teachers can be linked to the SASS data to determine relationships between local district and school policies/practices, teacher characteristics, and teacher attrition and retention.\nThe target population for the universe survey consists of all private schools in the United States that meet NCES criteria of a school. The survey universe is composed of schools from a variety of sources. The main source is a list frame, initially developed for the 1989-90 Private School Survey. This frame is based on a commercial list purchased from Quality Education Data (QED), Inc. The list is updated periodically by matching it with lists provided by nationwide private school associations, state departments of education, and other national guides and sources which list private schools. The other sources are area frame searches conducted by the Bureau of the Census.\nThe NHES is designed as a mechanism for collecting detailed information on educational issues from a relatively large and targeted sample of households in a timely fashion. Data for the NHES are collected through telephone interviews, a relatively new approach for gathering data related to education issues. The NHES uses Random Digit Dialing (RDD) to select households and Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) to collect information from household members. The sample for the NHES is drawn from the non-institutionalized civilian population in households having a telephone in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In each NHES, between 60,000 and 75,000 households are screened to identify persons eligible for one of the topical components. Generally, each collection covers two topical components, and between 12,000 and 15,000 interviews are obtained for each component. During the spring of 1991, NCES fielded an NHES on early childhood program participation. Approximately 60,000 households were screened to identify a sample of about 14,000 children 3 to 8 years old. The parents of these children were interviewed in order to collect information about their children's educational activities and the role of the family in children's learning. At the same time, an adult education component was fielded (see separate description in chapter 3). Adult household members were sampled and questioned about their participation in adult education. The two topical components planned for the spring of 1993 are early childhood/school readiness and school safety and discipline. In the school readiness component, parents of children 3 to 7 years old will be asked about their children's experiences in early childhood programs, developmental level, school adjustment and related problems, early primary school experiences, general health and nutrition status, home activities, and family characteristics including stability and economic risk factors. In the school safety and discipline component, parents of children in grades 3 through 12 will be interviewed about their children's school environment, exposure to criminal behavior in the school, school discipline policy and alcohol/drug education provided by the school. A sample of students in grades 6 through 12 will also be interviewed on the same topics.\nThe Current Population Survey is a nationally representative probability sample survey of households. A multi-stage stratified sampling scheme is used to select sample households. The survey is conducted in approximately 60,000 dwelling units monthly in 729 primary sampling units. Dwelling units are in-sample for 4 successive months, out-of-sample for the next 8 months, and then returned to the sample for the following 4 months. An adult member of each household provides information for all members of the household.\nPostsecondary education is defined within IPEDS as the provision of formal instructional programs the curriculum of which is designed primarily for students who have completed the requirements for a high school diploma or its equivalent. This includes academic, vocational, and continuing professional education programs, and excludes avocational and adult basic education programs. The following types of institutions are included within IPEDS: baccalaureate or higher degree granting institutions, 2-year award institutions, and less-than -2year institutions (i.e., institutions whose awards usually result in terminal occupational awards or are creditable toward a formal 2-year or higher award). Each of these three categories is further disaggregated by control (public, private nonprofit, and private for-profit) resulting in nine institutional categories or sectors. Several new concepts are employed for the IPEDS collection of postsecondary institutional education data. Data element definitions that have been formulated and tested are relevant to all providers of postsecondary education and consistent among components of the system. A set of data elements has been established to identify characteristics common to all providers of postsecondary education. Specific data elements have been established to define unique characteristics of different types of providers of postsecondary education. Interrelationships among various components of IPEDS have been established to avoid duplicative reporting and to enhance the policy relevance and analytic potential of the data. With IPEDS, it is possible to take into account the problems involved in trying to make inter-state and inter-institutional comparisons using the NCES postsecondary data and to address many of these problems through the use of the clarifying questionsquestions that ask what was or was not included in a reported count or total. Finally, specialized, but compatible, reporting formats have been developed for the different sectors of postsecondary education providers. In general, the reports developed for postsecondary institutions granting baccalaureate and higher degrees are the most extensive; forms for the 2-year and less-than-2-year award granting sectors request less data. This design feature accommodates the varied operating characteristics, program offerings, and reporting capabilities that differentiate postsecondary institutional sectors while yielding comparable statistics for some common parameters of all postsecondary sectors. Data are collected from approximately 11,000 postsecondary institutions. IPEDS has been designed to produce national-, state-, and institutional-level data for most postsecondary institutions. However, only national-level estimates from a sample of institutions are available for the private, less-than-2-year institutions. Early estimates of fall enrollment and prior year completions have been produced from a sample at the national level, but will be discontinued after the 1992-93 academic year.\nThe adult education component in the 1991 NHES was adapted from the previous Current Population Survey (CPS) adult education supplements. A knowledgeable adult was asked a series of questions to screen all household members for adult education participation. Altogether interviews were obtained from approximately 9,800 adult education participants and 2,750 nonparticipants. At present, NCES plans to field the adult education component again in 1994.\nData from the RCG study are representative at the national level. The sample is drawn from the universe of students within 1 year of attaining a bachelor's or master's degree. The 1991 RCG study used a two-stage sampling design. The first stage consisted of drawing a sample of 400 bachelor's and master's degree-granting institutions from 1,978 institutions in the 1988-89 IPEDS completions file. Institutions were stratified by c'ntrol (public or private) and by degrees awarded in the field of education (over or under a specified number). Within each of these four strata, institutions were selected according to size (size being measured by the sum of bachelor's and master's degrees awr.rded that year). The size measure also gave additional weight to institutions according to the proportion of degrees awarded to blacks. Institution Sampling. The frame for first stage selection, consisted of institutions from the 1988-89 IPEDS Completions tape that satisfied the following criteria: 1) the institution had a FICE code (i.e., was a \"higher education institution\": an institution accredited at the college level by an agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education); 2) the institution was in one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia; and 3) the institution was a 4-year (or above) institution that awarded bachelor's or master's degrees. Graduate Sampling. The second stage of the 1991 RCG design called for the selection of a core sample of 18,000 graduates (16,000 bachelor's degree recipients and 2,000 master's degree recipients who graduated during the 1989-90 academic year (July 1, 1989 and June 30, 1990) from the 400 sampled institutions. Simple random samples of graduates were selected from each defined subgroup (i.e., by field of study). The graduates included in the sample were selected in proportion to the institution's number of graduates. Graduates whose major fields of study were education, mathematics, and the physical sciences were sampled at a higher rate as were minority graduates to provide a sufficient number of these graduates for analysis purposes. Graduates were surveyed 1 year after receiving a degree. For sampling, each graduate was classified into one of seven strata. All master's degree recipients were in one stratum, and bachelor's degree recipients were divided into the following strata: 1) rack graduates; 2) Hispanic graduates; 3) education majors who were not black or Hispanic; 4) math majors wl were not black or Hispanic; 5) physical science majors who were not black or Hispanic; and 6) all other graduates. A systematic sample of graduates was selected by stratum. The base rates for bachelor's and master's degree graduates were derived by taking the desired sample size and dividing by the number of graduates from all institutions in the universe. Oversampling was done to ensure adequate sample sizes for groups of interest. Black and Hispanic bachelor's degree recipients were oversampled at three times the base rate. Math and physical science bachelor's degree majors were oversampled at two times the base rate. Finally, education majors were oversampled at two and one-half times the base rate. The RCG studies are designed to meet certain objectives: a) to determine how many graduates become eligible or qualified to teach for the first time and how many were employed as teachers in the year following graduation, by teaching fields; and b) to examine the relationship between courses taken, student achievement, and occupational outcomes. The 1987 study also obtained information from college transcripts regarding types and patterns of courses taken by all baccalaureate degree recipients that year in their major field of study. NCES plans to collect transcripts from the graduating institution of the 1989-90 graduates.\nThe NSOPF was conducted by NCES for the first time in the 1987-88 academic year. There were three major components of the study: a survey of institutional-level respondents in a stratified random sample of 480 institutions; a survey of a stratified random sample of 11,013 eligible faculty members within the participating institutions; and a survey of a stratified random sample of 3,029 eligible department chairpersons (or their equivalent) within the participating institutions. Response rates to the three surveys were 88 percent, 76 percent, and 80 percent respectively. The universe from which the institutions were selected included all nonproprietary U.S. postsecondary institutions that grant a 2-year (A.A.) or higher degree and whose accreditation at the higher education level is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. This includes religious, medical, and other specialized postsecondary institutions, as well as 2-and 4-year nonspecialized institutions. In 1987, according to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), this universe comprised 3,159 institutions. The 1988 NSOPF gathered information regarding the backgrounds, responsibilities, workloads, salaries, benefits, and attitudes of both full-and part-time faculty in their postsecondary institutions. In addition, information was gathered from institutional and department-level respondents on such issues as faculty composition turnover, recruitment, retention, and tenure policies. The survey is being repeated in the 1992-93 academic year so that changes over time in institutional policies and faculty characteristics, behaviors, and attitudes can be assessed. At this time, the program has been renamed the National Study of Postsecondary benefits and compensation. The NSOPF contains data which can be applied to policy and research issues related to postsecondary faculty. For example, NSOPF can be used to analyze whether the postsecondary labor force is declining or increasing. NSOPF data also can be used to analyze faculty job satisfaction and how it correlates with an area of specialization; and how background and specialization skills relate to present assignments. Comparisons can be made on academic rank and outside employment. Benefits and compensation can also be studied across institutions, and faculty can be aggregated by sociodemographic characteristics. For more information on the National Survey of Postsecondary This survey has collected basic statistics from the universe of doctoral recipients in the United States each year since the 1920s. It has been supported by five federal agencies: The National Center for Education Statistics in conjunction with the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Department of Agriculture, and the National Institutes of Health.\nSurvey forms are mailed to graduate deans each May for distribution to individuals receiving their doctorates between July 1 and June 30 of the next year. The data are collected, edited, and published by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). By the end of the summer, the NAS publishes general survey results in a summary report and in a four-page flyer. NAS also provides detailed tabulations to each sponsoring agency.\nPEQIS employs a standing sample (panel) of approximately 1,500 postsecondary education institutions and a panel of 51 state higher education agencies. The first two PEQIS surveys were initiated in the fall of 1992. PEQIS number 1, requested by the Office of Policy and Planning/ED, is a study of the financial climate at colleges and universities and its effect on their institutional missions. PEQIS number 2, requested by the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services/ED, augments a congressionally mandated study of deaf and hard of hearing students in postsecondary education. NCES will continue to collect data for all IPEDS components, except the Early Estimates System which has been discontinued. However, the forms used to collect the data will be modified starting in 1993. State and institutional representatives will review and discuss these changes at an IPEDS workshop in FY 1993. IPEDS will continue to provide a sampling frame for other postsecondary surveys such as the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study. The Postsecondary Education Quick Information System will be used to collect data for addressing emerging and focused issues that the ongoing data collection systems are unable to provide. Other plans call for NPSAS to serve as the base for two new postsecondary longitudinal surveys: Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) and Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B). The BPS survey began in 1990 and is described in chapter 5. B&B will study the educational and work-related achievements of a postsecondary graduating cohort as the members continue on to graduate or professional education, or enter the work force. Since this new study will be a longitudinal survey and will not begin until 1993, it is discussed in the \"Plans\" section of chapter 5. In the October 1991 CPS School Enrollment Supplement, some questions were added on student mobility in postsecondary education. For example, \"Has the student changed from one school to another and why?\" A feasibility study is being conducted to produce an automated data system for a nationwide electronic records transfer system. The \"Standardization of Postsecondary Education Electronic Data Exchange (SPEEDE)\" is being designed for the development of a set of data elements and definitions in American National Standards Institute format to be used in the pilot electronic transfer of student records between districts and from districts to postsecondary institutions. Data elements are included in five different areas: demographics, academic history, special programs and services, health, and test information. Also, the Student-Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act (SRK) of 1990 (P.L. 101-542), originally required postsecondary institutions (starting in July 1993) to make available to students and prospective students the institutions' graduation and/or completion rates for full-time, degreeseeking undergraduates. It also requires institutions that award athletically-related student aid to report rates for athletes and other students. As required by P.L. 101-542, a report was completed in FY 92 by the Secretary of Education to address institutions' ability to report graduation/completion rates by academic major, schools within institutions, and a variety of student characteristics. An analysis of institutions' ability to report other outcome measures of completers, such as employment in a related field was included in this report. This report Postsecondary Student Outcomes: A Feasibility Study was published by NCES in February, 1992. In response to the legislation, and based on the findings from the feasibility study, NCES is planning to collect, compile, and report graduation/completion rates of postsecondary institutions beginning in 1994 or 1995.\nTo implement the first phase of this activity in the summer of 1992, NCES established a survey development working group to advise NCES in the design of a reporting format for institutional graduation / completion rate data. Based on input from the working group, as well as on specifications contained in the proposed regulations for the SRK, initial design issues have been resolved. The basic methodology is for institutions to track a cohort of students from initial entrance into the institution through, at minimum, 150 percent of the time it normally takes to complete the longest degree program at the institution. Institutions will be asked to report separately the percentage of the cohort completing, continuing, or transferring over a three-year period. The graduation/completion rates will be collected by level (e.g., associate, bachelor's), race/ethnicity, and gender. The graduation/completion data will be evaluated for consistency and comparability across institutional sectors. Institutional graduation/completion rate data will eventually be collected from the universe of all postsecondary institutions in the United States eligible for Title IV financial aid. The universe of postsecondary institutions is determined by the 1992 Integrated Postsecondary Data System (IPEDS) Institutional Characteristics (IC) survey.\nData from the common core of data and Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System will be used to draw a sample of school districts and postsecondary institutions. The information from these data bases will be used to stratify school districts and postsecondary institutions in the selection of a sample. Approximately 260 school districts and postsecondary institutions will participate in the study.  1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 Integrated Salaries, Tenure, and National Postsecondary Student Aid Study Year of Data Collection 1987198919901991199319941995  Educational Assessment Assessing the educational outcomes of American students is a major concern of NCES. This is achieved primarily through the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). For 2 decades, NAEP has regularly collected and reported information on the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of a national sample of both age-and grade-representative populations in a variety of school subjects. Insights into the educational practices and outcomes of the United States are also obtained by comparing them with other countries. This is achieved through the International Education Statistics program at NCES, which provides systematic statistical data on the educational experiences and trends in other countries. Information comparing the public expenditures for schooling, participation rates of school-age children, and education achievement levels of the various national populations are disseminated in the major reports of NCES. Another way to study the outcomes of education is to investigate the courses of study that students have taken. Three NCES surveys have collected data on courses of study in high school: the 1982 High School and Beyond (HS&B) transcript study, the 1987 High School Transcript Study, and a 1990 High School Transcript Study. The information gathered from the transcript studies has proven quite useful and such studies will be continued in the future. Also postsecondary transcripts are part of longitudinal studies at NCES, and the recent College Graduate Study. NCES has a new program to assess educational outcomes among adults through the National Adult Literacy Survey. In 1992 NCES conducted a full-scale, household-based literacy survey of adults age 16 and over.\nNAEP was begun in 1969 and has periodically assessed students aged 9, 13, and 17 and at various grade levels. In 1983, a number of changes were made to the design to improve its utility to policymakers. The student samples were expanded to include both age-and graderepresentative populations. The sample, since 1988, has been drawn from the universe of 4th, 8th, and 12th graders for the elementary and secondary school students survey; from the teachers of those students for the teacher survey; and from the school administrators at those elementary and secondary schools for the school characteristics and policy survey. A variation of matrix sampling (balanced incomplete block spiraling) was begun in packaging and administering assessment booklets. This method was used so that the results from a large number of items could be generalized to an entire population. Approximately 2,600 students respond to each block of items. The subject seas assessed have included: reading, writing, mathematics, science, citizenship, U.S. history, geography, social studies, art, music, literature, computer competence and career and occupational development. From time to time, NAEP has conducted special assessments in other educational areas such as health, energy, consumer math, and young adult literacy. NAEP also has collected background information from students, teachers, and administrators, and has related these data to student achievement. Cognitive performance data and non-cognitive data are reported for the nation, and for various subgroups categorized by variables such as region, gender, race/ethnicity, parental education type of school, and type and size of community. Also initiated in 1983 was the reporting of performance data by scaled proficiency levels (see \"scale scores\" below). In 1993, NAEP will begin the practice of reporting achievement levels in subjects as the levels are developed. All questions undergo extensive reviews by subject-area and measurement specialists, as well as careful scrutiny to eliminate any potential bias or lack of sensitivity to particular groups. They are then field tested, revised, and administered to a stratified, multi-stage probability sample. The individuals sampled are selected so that their results may be generalized to the entire country. Once the data have been collected, scored, and analyzed, NAEP publishes and disseminates the results. In recent years when reporting results, NAEP has utilized \"scale scores.\" These scores are a device summarizing both the proficiency or level of understanding of a subject, and the nature of that understanding into a single number, reflecting a mean score, with corresponding standard deviation. For example, in mathematics, the levels of proficiency are described as Over the past three assessment cycles NAEP has developed scales for mathematics, reading, writing, science, civics, history, and geography. These scales allow NAEP to report comparable results across ages and across assessments. In addition, the scale scores allow NAEP to report the proportion of students at different proficiency levels in the various subject areas. This permits educators, policymakers, and the general public to see the types of skills and knowledge American students demonstrate at different levels of proficiency in a subject area. Currently, NAEP is conducted every other year in even-numbered years. In 1988, NAEP assessed student performance in reading, writing, civics, and U.S. history and conducted a small special interest assessment in geography; in 1990, reading, writing, science, and mathematics were assessed, and in 1992, reading, mathematics, and writing were. assessed. NAEP has been designed to produce a representative sample at the national level. In the 1990 assessment, data were collected from a national probability sample of over 45,000 students per age/grade or a total of about 146,000 students in nearly 2,100 schools. Data were also collected from these students' principals and a sample of their teachers. Representative state-level data were produced for the first time for participating states from the trial state assessment in 1990 for mathematics at the 8th-grade level. In 1992, state level data were collected in fourth grade reading and mathematics and eighth grade mathematics.\nThe 1990 High School Transcript Study consisted of systematically transcribing about 23,000 transcript records to determine the course-taking patterns of 12th grade high school students selected from the 1990 NAEP assessment sample. With this connection, test results will be linkable to course-taking patterns. All transcript information was collected by field personnel; no person..., contacts were made with students. For the 1990 study, the following three summary tables were developed: I) the percentage of high school graduates earning minimum credits in new basics courses in 1990 and the comparison of the totals to 1982 and 1987; 2) the mean number of credits (Carnegie units) that graduates earned in each major subject field in 1990; and 3) the number of students receiving credit in 1990 in secondary subjects for courses in the NCES' Classification of Secondary School Courses (CSSC). The coded data were compatible with the data produced in the 1982 HS&B Transcript Study and the 1987 High School Transcript Study. This standardization and comparability will be useful in later analyses to compare the results of the three studies. It also has the cost advantage of avoiding unnecessary duplication of design work that has already been performed.\nThe 1992 National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS) defines literacy as \"using printed and written information to function in society, to achieve one's goals, and to develop one's knowledge and potential.\" Literacy is be measured along three dimensions: 1) prose literacythe ability to understand and use information from connected texts that include editorials, news stories, poems, and the like; 2) document literacythe ability to locate and use information contained in documents, such as job applications or payroll forms, bus schedules, maps, tables, indexes, and so forth; 3) quantitative literacythe ability to apply arithmetic operations to numbers embedded in printed materials, such as balancing a checkbook, figuring a tip, completing an order form, or determining the amount of interest from a loan advertisement. Because policymakers need to assess a broad range of abilities in the population, but do not need to diagnose literacy problems of individuals, the 1992 assessment has been designed to cover a broad range of skills. It would take any one individual about 4 hours to complete the entire assessment. To keep the burden on any one individual to less than an hour, the assessment was cut into 13 pieces, with only 3 pieces given to each respondent. The designs used balanced incomplete block spiraling, as in NAEP, to assign systematically the parts of the assessment to individuals in a way that maximizes the information yield and permits generalizing the sample results to the U.S. population. The responses to the items are pooled and reported by proficiency scales on the three dimensions of literacy. All questions underwent extensive review by subject area and measurement specialists, as well as scrutiny to eliminate any bias or lack of sensitivity to particular groups. The National Adult Literacy Survey was administered in the summer of 1992 in person by trained interviewers to a nationally representative probability sample of about 15,000 individuals aged 16 and older and to 1,000 adults incarcerated in federal and state prisons. In addition, 12 states funded sample supplements in order to obtain literacy estimates for their state populations. Once the data have been scored and analyzed, the results will be published and the data made available to the public by the end of January 1994. This is the first national study of literacy for all adults since the Adult Performance Level surveys of the early 1970s. The next NALS will be conducted in 1997.\nNLS-72 was designed to produce representative data at the national level on the cohort of students who were in the 12th grade in 1972. The sample for the base year NLS-72 was a stratified, two-stage probability sample of students from all schools, public and private, in the 50 states and the District of Columbia with a 12th-grade enrollment during the 1971-72 school year. A sample of schools was selected in the first stage. In the second stage, a random sample of 18 high school seniors was selected within each participating school. Data were collected by mail, telephone, and personal interviews. In addition, the survey obtained school transcript data on high school curriculum, credit hours in major courses, grade point average, standardized test scores, and related information for each senior. To conduct intensive studies of disadvantaged students, NCES ovetsampled schools in low income areas and schools with significant minority enrollments. The size of the student sample was increased during the first followup survey because base year nonrespondents were recontacted at that time. Those who provided base year information were retained and included in later followup efforts. Consequently, in 1972 there were 16,683 respondents, but in the first followup in 1973 the number jumped to 21,350. The number of respondents in subsequent followups in 1974, 1976, 1979, and 1986 were 20,872; 20,092; 18,630; and 12,841 respectively (only a subsample of the original sample was contacted in 1986). In addition to the followups, a number of supplemental data collection efforts were undertaken. For example, a Postsecondary Education Transcript Study was undertaken in 1984, and the fifth followup survey in 1986 included a supplement for those who become teachers.\nThe study design provided for a highly stratified national probability sample of over 1,100 secondary schools as the first stage units of selection. Certain types of schools were oversampled to make the study more useful for policy analyses: public schools with a high percentage of Hispanic students; Catholic schools with a high percentage of minority group students; alternative public schools; and private schools with high achieving students. The initial national sample for High School and Beyond was considerably larger than that employed in NLS-72. In this stage, 36 seniors and 36 sophomores were selected in each school. Parents of these students were also sampled. In schools with fewer than 36 students in either of these groups, all eligible students were selected. The base year of this survey, which was conducted early in 1980, collected data from over 30,000 seniors and 28,000 sophomores. The longitudinal design of the study called for followup surveys of substantial subsets of the two cohorts at 2-year intervals. Data collection for the first followup began in spring 1982. Subsequent followups were also undertaken in 1984 and 1986, and another followup was conducted in 1992. The first followup survey conducted in 1982 sampled almost 40,000 students (12,000 seniors and 27,000 sophomores), the second in 1984 sampled approximately 27,000 students (12,000 seniors and 15,000 sophomores), and the third in 1986 sampled almost 27,000 students (also 12,000 seniors and 15,000 sophomores). The 1992 followup collected data from almost 15,000 sophomores. In 1993 a new Postsecondary Education Transcript Study will be conducted for the sophomore cohort. Data collection instruments in the base-year survey included: 1) sophomore and senior student questionnaires with a series of cognitive tests, 2) school questionnaires filled out by an official in each participating school, 3) teacher comment checklists filled out by a teacher of the sampled student, 4) second language questionnaires, and 5) parent questionnaires filled out by a sample of parents from both cohorts. The student questionnaires focused on individual and family background, high school experiences, work experiences, and future plans. Cognitive tests administered to students measured both verbal and quantitative abilities. Sophomore tests included brief achievement measures in science, writing, and civics, while seniors were asked to respond to tests measuring abstract and nonverbal abilities. The parent questionnaire elicited information about how family attitudes and financial planning affect educational goals. The school questionnaire gathered information about enrollnmt, staff, educational programs, facilities and services, dropout rates, and special programs for handicapped and disadvantaged students. The teacher comment checklist provided teacher observations on students participating in the survey. The first followup of sophomores provided insights into the school dropout problem and into the influence of the last 2 years of high school on student attitudes and aspirations. The second followup in 1984 included a Postsecondary Education Transcript Study of the senior cohort. The later followups of the sophomore cohort made it possible to trace the consequences of dropping out, and the extent to which dropouts later return and comp:,:te high school. In brief, HS&B provides information on the educational, vocational, and personal development of young people as they move from high school into postsecondary education or the work force into and then into adult life. The initial study (NLS-72) laid the groundwork for comparison with HS&B. It recorded the economic and social conditions surrounding high school seniors in that year and, within that context, their hopes and plans. It has since measured the outcomes while also observing the intervening processes. High School and Beyond allows researchers to monitor changes by retaining the same goals, measuring the economic returns of postsecondary education for minorities, delineating the need for financial aid, etc. By comparing the results of the two studies, researchers can determine how hopes, plans, and outcomes differ in response to changing conditions or remain the same despite such changes. Additional concerns of HS&B encompass issues that surfaced since NLS-72 began: How did the availability (or lack thereof) of student financial aid alter student plans for further education? Did middle-income families alter their attitude toward postsczondary education? These questions, as well as concerns about declining test scores, youth employment, and bilingual education are addressed, along with a host of others.\nThe base year sample of 1988 eighth graders was constructed to be repizsentative at the national level. Two-stage probability sampling was used to select schools and students. The first stage involved stratified sampling of some 1,000 public and private schools from a universe of approximately 40,000 schools containing 8th grade students. The second stage included random samples of approximately 24-26 students per school. Some 25,000 8th graders and their parents, their teachers, and their school principals were surveyed. When the student sample was selected, one parent, one school principal, and two teachers of each student were also selected as subsamples. Hispanic and Asian students were oversampled to permit analysis of the performance of language minority students. NELS:88 is designed to provide trend data about critical transitions experienced by young people as they develop, attend school, and embark on their careers. It will complement and strengthen state and local efforts by furnishing new information on how school policies, teacher practices, and family involvement affect student educational outcomes (i.e., academic achievement, persistence in school, and participation in postsecondary education). In the base year, four cognitive tests (i.e., reading, scieme, history/government, and math) were administered in addition to the student questionnaire, a parent questionnaire, a teacher questionnaire, and a school administrator questionnaire. The design for the NELS:88 First Followup Survey included student, school administrator, teacher, and dropout questionnaires. Students took cognitive tests in reading, science, history/government, and math. The tests were designed to reflect 10th grade course work, but also had enough overlapping items with the 8th and 12th grade tests to permit measurement of academic growth. Selected teachers of each sampled student provided information about the student's study habits and performance and about instructional practices in the student's classes. Family background items; interaction with parents regarding inand out-of-school activities; educational and occupational goals; perceptions about self and school; participation in classes and activities; and self-reported grades. Four cognitive tests: reading, math, sc:znce, and history/government. Socio-demographic characteristics; participation in student course selection; long-range educational planning; in-and out-of-school activities; establishing home discipline and interaction with the school; family educational expenses; and sources of income for children's education.\nThe BPS is based on the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS). NPSAS is a large, nationally representative sample of institutions, students, and parents (see NPSAS description i.. chapter 3 for further information). As such, it provides a highly efficient and costeffective way of identifying a nationally representative sample of beginning students in PSE. In addition, data from all components of NPSAS (the Student Record Abstract, the Student Interview, and the Parent Survey) are available as base year data for the BPS sample. BPS will follow NPSAS beginning students at 2-year intervals beginning with NPSAS:90. About 7,000 students who began their PSE career in the 1989-90 academic year responded to NPSAS:90 and were included in the first BPS (BPS:90/92) in the spring of 1992 and will be in the second BPS (BPS: 90/94) in the spring of 1994. NPSAS:90 collected data for over 6,000 parents of those students. In addition to the student data which will be collected every 2 years, BPS will collect postsecondary transcripts and financial aid records covering the entire undergraduate period to provide complete information on progress and persistence. Data release from the first BPS is anticipated by the fall of 1993. New BPS cohorts will be selected from alternating NPSAS surveys. BPS Followup Surveys (every 2 years): 100 Year in school; persistence in enrollment; academic progress; change in field of study; institution transfer; education-related experiences; current family status; expenses and financial aid; employment and income; employment-related training; community service; political participation; graduate school plans; entry and progress in graduate school; future expectations.\nThe B&B is based on the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) described previously. NPSAS is a large, nationally representative sample of institutions, students, and parents. As such, it provides a highly efficient and cost-effective way of identifying a nationally representative sample of baccalaureate degree completers in PSE. By using NPSAS as the base year for B&B longitudinal studies, two additional advantages are realized: 1) there is coordination between the recurring cross-sectional studies and the longitudinal studies; and 2) there is coordination among the postsecondary longitudinal studies. The information collected through NPSAS allows the accurate identification of baccalaureate degree completers. Further, data from all components of NPSAS (the Student Record Abstract, the Student Interview, and the Parent Survey) are available as base year data for the B&B sample. B&B will follow NPSAS baccalaureate degree completers at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 years after completion, beginning with NPSAS:93. About 16,000 students who completed their degree in the 1992-93 academic year will be included in the first B&B (B&B:93/94). NPSAS:93 will also provide data for over 10,000 of their parents. In addition to the student data which will be collected every two years, B&B will collect postsecondary transcripts and financial aid records covering the undergraduate period, providing complete information on progress and persistence at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. New BPS cohorts will be selected from alternating NPSAS surveys. Major field of study; type and control of institution; financial aid; cost of attendance; family income; sex, race /ethnicity. Undergraduate and major OPA; date of first enrollment; financial aid; loan burden for undergraduate education; activities related to selection and entry into graduate school; activities related to obtaining employment after graduation; qualifications to teach; current marital status; employment and income; demographic information; college experiences; future expectations. Parent's race/ethnicity; marital status; age; level of education achieved; income; occupation; financial support provided to children; methods of financing student's PSE expenses; involvement in student's selection of graduate school; involvement in student obtaining job after graduation. Entry into graduate school; persistence in enrollment; periods of attendance; graduate loan burden; academic progress; change in field of study; education-related experiences; financial aid; current family status; entry into the work force; employment related training; entry and persistence in teaching; community service; political participation; further education plans; future expectations. B&B will greatly expand the knowledge about persistence, progress, and attainment after entry into graduate education. It will also directly address issues concerning entry into the work force and rates of return. Its unique contribution will be the longitudinal perspective on the graduate education/work interaction and the longer range information concerning newly qualified teachers and their entry into and continuation in the field. Questions which B&B can address concerning access to graduate or professional programs concern timing, the application process, and entry into the program. Attainment/Outcome questions include completion time of BA, timing of entry into the work force, and relationship of education to area of employment. B&B will also be able to inform the rate of return questions, particularly those associated with immediate entry into the work force after completion of the bachelors degree, issues concerning the interaction between education and work, and issues associated with entry into public service areas such as teaching and relative career advancement. The third followup for NELS:88 is scheduled for 1994 when most of the cohort will be in the work force or participating in postsecondary education. A new Postsecondary Education Transcript Study of the High School and Beyond survey (HS&B) sophomore cohort is planned for 1993. The Beginning Postsecondary Student Longitudinal Survey (BPS), initiated in 1990, will continue to follow the student sample at 2-year intervals.\nBeginning its fifth year of electronic data collection, FSCS is an example of the synergy that can result from combining federal and state cooperation with state-of-the-art technology. FSCS was the first national NCES data collection in which the respondents supplied the information electronically and in which data were also edited and tabulated completely in machine-readable form. The software (the most recent version is called DECPLUS) is costeffective and has improved data quality. The respondents are the over 9,000 public libraries identified in the 50 states and the District of Columbia by state library agencies. At the state level, FSCS is administered by State Data Coordinators, appointed by the chief officer of each state library agency. The State Data Coordinator collects the requested data from local public libraries and submits these data to NCES. An annual training conference sponsored by NCES is provided for the State Data Coordinators, and a steering committee representing State Data Coordinators and other public library constituents is active in the development of FSCS data elements and software. Technical assistance to states is provided by phone and in person by the FSCS Steering Committee and by NCES staff and contractors. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have submitted their annual 1989, 1990 and 1991 data. Data are available for individual public libraries and are also aggregated to state and national levels. NCES has also developed the first comprehensive, public library universe file. This automated file, to be updated annually, is part of DECPLUS. It includes identifying information an all known public libraries (including outlets), all state libraries, and some library systems and cooperatives. Beginning in 1994 this resource will be available for drawing samples for special surveys on such topics as literacy, access for the disabled, and library construction, etc. Staffing; service outlets; operating income and expenditures; size of collection; and service measures, such as reference transactions, interlibrary loans, circulation, and public service hours. Outlet name; address; city; county; ZIP code; telephone number, library system relationship; legal basis code; population of legal service area; outlet type; metropolitan status code; population served by outlet; and number of bookmobiles. Libraries provide essential learning resources that strengthen and perpetuate formal and informal education. Valid, reliable, and timely statistics are essential for effective use by policymakers in determining the investment of public resources in library development and operations. Library and information science covers a diverse and rapidly changing field. Data collection activity which seeks to inform decisionmaking must be sensitive to the changes taking place within the library community, and its policymakers and researchers. In November 1991, NCES initiated an effort to promote the use of public library statistics among researchers and policymakers by holding a public library statistics seminar for these groups. Also, the new universe file, PLUS, will make it possible to do surveys on topics of policy and research importance such as access for Americans with disabilities, networks and cooperatives, and library construction. Further information on public library statistics may be obtained from: The last national survey exclusively on school library media centers was conducted in school year 1985-1986. NCES started asking questions on libraries in public and private schools as part of the Schools and Stafting Survey (SASS, see chapter 2). In thP. 1990-91 SASS, NCES field-tested two new questionnaires for school libraries.\nThe most recent information on school libraries has been collected from a sample of public and private elementary and secondary schools in SASS. A few questions on school libraries were included in the 1990-91 SASS questionnaires. In addition, new questionnaires on the school library media center and on the school library media specialist were field-tested in the 1990-91 SASS. See the plans section of this chapter for information on the implementation of these questionnaires. Plans for the Library Statistics Program: NCES plans to continue collecting public library data through FSCS and to update the public library universe file annually. Efforts will be made to improve data quality, for example, by developing clearer definitions and improving state and local training. As data quality improves, NCES also hopes to do more sophisticated analyses of FSCS data including measuring changes, making regional, size, and input/output comparisons, and mapping data. Beginning in 1993, data collection efficiency will be improved by collecting PLUS data as part of the annual data collection for public libraries with enhanced software called DECPLUS. Improved dissemination of data is also planned. The collection of academic library data through IPEDS will be continued also. NCES plans to improve the quality of the data by promoting the use of IDEALS software for data collection. New data elements focusing on electronic access and other new technologies may be added to the survey. The ALS reports will contain more detailed analyses of the data. NCES will continue school library data collection through SASS. In addition, a followup survey of turnover and retention issues among school librarians may be conducted. Full-scale implementation of the public and private school library media questionnaires is planned for the 1994 SASS. A sample of about 7,000 public and private elementary and secondary schools will be surveyed. Data from one of the questionnaires will provide a national picture of school library media center facilities, collecticas, equipment, technology, staffing, income, expenditures, and services. The data from the other questionnaire will profile the school library media specialist work force, including demographic characteristics, academic background, work load, career histories and plans, compensation, and perceptions of the school library media specialist profession and workplace. There will also be data on cooperative activities between librarians and teaching staff in developing course materials. Several topical surveys are also planned. In 1993, under the sponsorship of Library Programs, NCES will conduct a fast response survey on public library services to children and young adults. NCES plans to pretest 2 additional surveys in 1993, one on state library agencies and the other on federal libraries. The state library survey is a cooperative effort between NCES and COSLA and the federal library survey is a cooperative effort between NCES and the staff of the Federal Library and Information Center Committee (Library of Congress)."}, {"section_title": "COMPONENTS: Public School Universe:", "text": "Information on all public elementary and secondary schools in operation during a school year including school location and type; enrollment by grade and student characteristics; and the number of classroom teachers."}, {"section_title": "Local Education Agency Universe:", "text": "Information for the universe of LEAs including phone number; location and type of agency; current number of students; and number of high school graduates and completers in the previous year.

Examples of CCD data that could be used to address important education issues are: a) size of school and pupil/teacher ratio; b) size of school district and region of the country; c) locale of school and racial/ethnic composition for selected states; d) racial/ethnic composition and pupil/teacher ratio for selected states; e) locale of school and percent of free-lunch eligible students for selected states; f) grade level and pupil/teacher ratio, g) size of school district and number of special education students; h) graduates; and i) state share of expenditure for education and expenditure per pupil. Further information on CCD may be obtained from: School work force and teacher supply and demand information is fundamental to America's public and private schools. Yet, until 1988, there was a lack of data on characteristics of teachers and administrators and their work places. The Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) was designed to meet this need. It is a comprehensive public and private education database that combines and expands other surveys NCES has conducted in the past. SASS was conducted in the 1987-88 school year, again in 1990-91, and will be conducted at 3-year intervals hereafter. In addition, one year after each SASS, a subsample of SASS teachers is selected for the SASS Teacher Followup Survey (see description elsewhere in this chapter).\nThe TFS can be used to address a number of issues related to teacher turnover, shortages, and availability of an adequate supply of qualified teaching personnel. Leavers, movers, and stayers will be profiled and compared in terms of teaching qualifications, working conditions, attitudes toward teaching, salaries, benefits and other incentives and disincentives for remaining in or leaving the teaching profession. Further information on TFS may be obtained from: With increasing concern about alternatives in education, the interest and need for data on private education has also increased. NCES has made the collection of data on private elementary and secondary schools, which is comparable the Common Core of Data universe survey for public schools, a priority. The purposes of this data collection activity are; a) to build an accurate and complete list of private schools to serve as a sampling frame for NCES surveys of private schools; and b) to generate data on the total number of private schools, teachers, and students in the universe (the next survey will be in 1993-94) and every 2 years thereafter.\nThe NHES is expected to provide data on a wide range of current education issues. Among the topics that may be addressed through the survey are: early childhood education; school-aged children's participation in before-and after-school programs; access and plans to finance postsecondary education; adult and continuing education; family support for and parental involvement in education; school safety and discipline; citizenship; grade retention; extra-school learning; and home-based education. The Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) was established in to collect issueoriented data quickly and with minimum response burden. FRSS was designed to meet the data needs of Department of Education analysts, planners, and decisionmakers when information could not be collected quickly through traditional NCES surveys. The data collected through FRSS are representative at the national level, drawing from a universe that is appropriate for the study. FRSS ce:iects data from state education agencies rid national samples of other educational sectors, including: Local education agencies; Public and private elementary and secondary schools; Institutions of higher education; Noncollegiate postsecondary schools with occupational programs; Public school teachers; Public library systems; and Adult literacy programs. In order to present high quality data in a timely fashion, FRSS provides the following services: research on the survey topic and instrument design; pretest of the survey instrument; quality control of the survey data; national estimates within 1 year of survey mail-out; response rates of 90 percent or higher; tabulations and other analysis of data; and preparation and dissemination of survey reports. FRSS now has the capability of conducting brief surveys of households using Random Digit Dialing (RDD) telephone techniques.\nThe adult education component of the NHES can be used to address many questions about the patterns of participation by demographic and labor force characteristics. It includes data on reasons for taking courses, on the providers of the courses, and the co;.' of the courses. Information was also collected from non-participants concerning barriers to their participation. The General Education Provisions Act, 20 USC 1221e-1, Section 406(b)(5) states that NCES shall \"conduct a continuing survey...to determine the demands for and availability of qualified teachers...in critical areas within education.\" The Recent College Graduates Study (RCG) estimates the potential supply of newly qualified teachers. It is a study of the immediate post-degree employment and education experiences of people who obtained a bachelor's or master's degree from an American college or university. It focuses on those graduates qualified to teach at the elementary and secondary levels. The RCG has been conducted periodically since 1976. In 1993, NCES will establish a longitudinal survey of graduating college seniors, which will replace the RCG Study. This survey, Baccalaureate and Beyond, will follow an oversample of graduating seniors from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study.\nThe supply of new teachers and the demand for their teaching services has changed dramatically over the past 2 decades. Because the RCG provides estimates of one source of teachers, the data from this survey of interest not only federal policymakers, but also many elementary and secondary schools throughout the country. The RCG studies can be used to obtain data on: a) the number and percent of recent graduates who are qualified to teach and who enter the teaching profession; b) the kinds of jobs recent college graduates are getting by program area or major field; c) the extent to which graduates get jobs in the area of their major field; d) the extent to which jobs differ for men and women who graduate in the same program or major field; e) unemployment of graduates; and f) jobs obtained by baccalaureate or master's degree recipients that do not require a 4-year college degree. The U.S. Department of Education provides some type of financial assistance to about one in every three students attending a postsecondary institution. During the 1991-92 school year, federal and state governments and postsecondary institutions awarded more than $30 billion in grants, loans, and work-study aid. Yet, until recently, relatively little information was available about students who benefit from federal aid, how financial aid is distributed, or the effects of financial aid on students who receive aid. The National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) is a comprehensive nationwide study of students enrolled in less-than-2-year institutions, community and junior colleges, 4-year colleges, and major universities located in the United States and Puerto Rico. Undergraduate, graduate, and first-professional students who receive financial aid, as well as those who do not receive aid, participate in NPSAS. The study is conducted under contract for NCES once every 3 years. The National Postsecondary Student Aid Study collects information on student demographics, family income, education expenses, employment, education aspirations, parental demographic characteristics, parental support, and how students and their families meet the costs of postsecondary education. In addition to describing characteristics of students enrolled in postsecondary education, the results are used in part to help determine future federal policy regarding student financial aid. The first NPSAS was conducted during the 1986-87 school year. Data were gathered from institutional records on about 60,000 students at 1,100 colleges, universities, and other postsecondary institutions. About 43,000 of these students and 13,000 parents also completed questionnaires. During 1989-90, information from institutional records on about 69,000 students at 1,130 postsecondary institutions was collected. About 51,400 students and 16,000 parents also completed computer-assisted telephone interviews. These data provided information on the cost of postsecondary education, the distribution of financial aid, and the characteristics of both aided and nonaided students and their families. The design for the NPSAS sample involves geographic areas, institutions within geographic areas, and students within institutions. To be eligible for inclusion in the institutional sample, an institution must have satisfied the following conditions: 1) offered an education program designed for persons who have completed secondary education; 2) offered an academic, occupational, or vocational program of study; 3) offered access to persons other than those employed by the institution; 4) offered more than just correspondence courses; 5) offered at least one program lasting 3 months or longer; and 6) was located in the 50 States, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico. From the sampled institutions, 1,074 schools participated in 1987; and 1,130 participated in 1990. The 1993 NPSAS sample will include about 78,000 students at 1,200 institutions and about 25,000 parents. NPSAS data come from multiple sources, including institutional records and student and parent interviews. Detailed data concerning participation in student financial aid programs are extracted from institutional records. In 1986-87, family circumstances, background demographic data, and plans and aspirations were collected using student and parent questionnaires. Beginning with the 1990 NPSAS, student and parent data were collected using a computer-assisted telephone interview. The 1987 NPSAS sampled students enrolled in the fall of 1986. Beginning with the 1990 NPSAS, students enrolled at any time during the year were eligible for the study. This design change provided the data necessary to estimate full-year financial aid awards. Beginning with the 1989-90 survey, NPSAS includes a longitudinal component and collects baseline data for a specified cohort of students. Students who began their postsecondary education during 1989-90 will be followed over time to examine such issues as persistence and effects of financial aid on subsequent enrollment, Students who graduate during 1992-93 will be followed over time to examine issues such as the transition from college to work and access to graduate school. These two surveys, known as the Beginning Postsecondary Survey and the Baccalaureate and Beyond Survey, are described more thoroughly in chapter 5. NPSAS covers a number of topics of interest to policymakers, educators, and researchers. For example, NPSAS analyzes the participation of students in financial aid programs. The goal is to identify institutional, student, and family characteristics and others related to program participation. Special population enrollment in postsecondary education is also analyzed. These populations include students with disabilities, racial and ethnic minorities, students taking remedial /developmental courses, students from families with low incomes, and older students. Another component of NPSAS is the study of the distribution of students by major field of study. Major fields of particular interest include mathematics, science, engineering, as well as teacher preparation and health studies. NPSAS generates data on factors associated with choice of postsecondary institution, participation in postsecondary vocational education, parental support for postsecondary education, and occupational and educational aspirations. National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty: The quality of postsecondary education is directly affected by faculty and instructors in postsecondary institutions. However, there has been little comprehensive current information on this professional body and the major issues that face them as educators, researchers, and members of the work force. The National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF) was designed to remedy this situation. This study, which is cosponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities, provides reli?' data in a variety of areas for postsecondary education researchers, planners, and policymakers. NSOPF is the most comprehensive study of faculty in postsecondary educational institutions ever undertaken.\nFrom the Survey of Earned Doctorates data, it is possible to determine whether the number of doctoral recipients is increasing or decreasing, by field of study. The various sources of financial aid for doctoral students can be assessed, as can the average time it takes to complete the degree. Future or present employment can be studied, which is useful to postsecondary institutions and research facilities. Trend data on who is receiving doctorates, by sex and race/ethnicity and other characteristics also can be analyzed. Policy analysts, program planners, and decisionmakers in postsecondary education frequently need data on emerging issues quickly. It is not always feasible for NCES to use its large, recurring surveys to provide such data quickly due to the length of time required to implement large-scale data collection efforts. NCES has established PEQIS to collect timely data on focused issues needed for program planning and policy development with a minimum burden on respondents. In addition to obtaining information on emerging issues quickly, PEQIS surveys are also used to assess the feasibility of developing large-scale data collection efforts on a given topic or to supplement other NCES postsecondary surveys.\nThe passage of the SRK legislation is a clear indication that there is serious concern ove. outcomes for students in postsecondary education, as well as the overall effectiveness of postsecondary institutions. Because of the widespread interest in this area, the collection of graduation/completion rate data will be included as a component of the IPEDS once it is demonstrated that the component will yield consistent, comparable, and valid data, and will be routinized sufficiently so it will not be a major disruption for on-going IPEDS surveys. Education leaders and a study of the reliability and validity of education facilities data collection policymakers recognize that there is a need to assess the state of education facilities of both elementary and secondary school districts and postsecondary institutions. Facilities data are required to assess the need for renovation, new buildings, room utilization, etc.. Before such an assessment can take place, however, facilities definitions, coding conventions, and data forms must be available and tested. The purpose of this study is to assess the extent to which data providers are able to provide complete, accurate, and reliable facilities data. To this end data providers at the school district and postsecondary institution levels will fill out the facilities survey form using a recently developed manual that is designed to insure standard definitions and coding conventions. These data will be evaluated for inter-and intra-rater consistency and validity by comparisons with experts' and other standardized ratings. The results of this exercise will be used to determine: 1) changes needed in the data collection instrument; 2) changes needed in the manual; and 3) training needed for the data provider.\nA study group of policymakers was formed by the Secretary of Education in 1986 to examine NAEP. This study group produced the publication, The Nation's Report Card. It stated that policymakers were keenly interested in NAEP student assessment data because the data address the outcomes of education, specifically, the level of educational achievement. The group emphasized, however, that NAEP should produce data that are representative not only at the national level, but also at the state level. New legislation enabled NAEP to begin pilot testing assessments at the state level during 1990. Such state-level results promise to make NAEP more useful for policymakers and the public. (See the \"Plans\" section of this chapter for a further explanation.) In addition to performance resifts in subject areas, NAEP collects basic descriptive information about students, teachers, administrators, schools, and communities. This information can be used to address the following four educational policy issues that are of concern to educators, policymakers, and researchers: a) Instructional practiceWhat instructional methods are being used and how do these relate to achievement? b) Students-at-riskHow many students appear to be at-risk, in terms of achievement, and what are their characteristics? c) Teacher work forceWhat are the characteristics of teachers of various subjects? d) Education reformWhat, if any, policy changes are being made by our nation's schools? Over the past 20 years, NAEP has generated more than 200 reports spanning 11 instructional areas. It is the nation's only ongoing, comparable, and representative assessment of what American students know and can do. A summary of NAEP findings since its inception through 1990 is available in the publication, Trends :n Academic Progress, released in January 1992. International Education Statistics: NCES carries out a variety of activities to provide statistical data for cross-national comparisons on education. Through comparisons with other countries, it is possible to learn more about the status of education in the United States and to generate new ideas for improving American education.\nThere is a great deal of interest in the findings of international student assessment studies and in the development of education indicators which facilitate comparisons among national systems of education. This interest has been spurred by increased concern about global economic competition and the role education plays in ensuring economic power. The assessment studies provide answers to the question of how other countries educate their children and with what success. Such comparisons lead to re-examinations of our own teaching practices and challenge the conventional wisdom underlying them. The impetus for much of the educational reform movement of the 1980s came from the international comparisons reported in A Nation At Risk. The assessments not only compare the performance of American students with that of their peers in other nations, but also provide insights into the factors that influence performance. The OECD educational indicators data will provide more comparable information about the activities and outcomes of educational systems and institutions in member countries. Such data can lead to improvements in accountability and policymaking. These data are increasingly relevant to policy formulation due to the growing political, economic, and cultural ties among Three high school transcript studies have been conducted since 1980. The first was part of the High School and Beyond (HS&B) first followup survey in 1982 (see chapter 5 for more information on HS&B). About 12,000 transcripts were collected from school records for HS&B sophomore cohort students who were seniors in 1982. In 1983, the National Commission on Excellence in Education recommended a specific minimal course of study in high school. In 1988, the U.S. Department of Education evaluated the way the nation responded to the call for school reform. In its report, American Education: Making It Work, the recommended curriculum was compared with the actual course-taking patterns of 12th-grade students. The data came from the 1987 High School Transcript Study which surveyed approximately 22,700 seniors who had participated (as 11th graders) in the 1986 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The 1990 High School Transcript Study, done in conjunction with NAEP, will continue to track changes in the curricular patterns of high school students. Data files and documentation will be released early in 1993. To ensure maximum compatibility, the procedures and formats used in previous studies for editing, coding, error resolution, and documentation were also used for the 1990 transcript data. This consistency will enable users to compare cohorts with a minimum of effort. The 1990 study will reflect modifications in course-taking over the last 3 years.\nHigh school transcript data inform researchers and policymakers about the course-taking patterns of students. Since the report, A Nation At Risk, there have been a number of other critics advocating the strengthening of the high school core curriculum. Students have been encouraged to increase their academic load with courses in English, mathematics, science, social studies, computers, and foreign languages. As NCES conducts more transcript studies, overall trends in course-taking patterns can be traced. Transcript data are measures of exposure, rather than measures of learning. More research is needed to determine what effect this content exposure has on student achievement. The current study will allow investigation of the relationship between course-taking patterns and performance on the 1990 NAEP. For more information on the high school transcript studies, contact: National Adult Literacy Survey: Literacy assessments inform policymakers about the extent of basic skills in using printed information that the adult population needs to function in society, to achieve one's goals, and to develop one's knowledge and potential. Recently, concern has mounted that inadequacies in the literacy of American workers are reducing the competitiveness of the American economy and preventing some Americans from exercising the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. The National Adult Literacy Survey will provide an accurate benchmark for measuring the literacy capabilities of adults.\nThere has been serious concern about the literacy level of the American work force, as described in a number of national reports published since 1980, including A Nation At Risk, Toward a More Perfect Union, The Subtle Danger, Work Force 2000, The Bottom Line, and Literacy: Profiles of America's Young Adults. These reports have emphasized the need to increase our nation's standard of literacy in order to maintain our standard of living and to compete in global markets. This concern about literacy culminated in 1990, when President Bush and the governors adopted six national education goals, including: \"By the year 2000, every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.\" National programs to improve adult skills need to be based on knowledge about the nature and severity of the deficits in literacy. The role of the National Adult Literacy Survey is to provide the elementary facts needed to begin understanding our nation's literacy problem. At the time this publication went to press, national assessments in NAEP had not been reauthorized beyond 1994 and state-level assessments beyond 1992. Therefore, the exact timing and content of future NAEP assessments is uncertain. Current plans are for an assessment in 1994 of three subjects at the national level and one at the state level pending authorization of a state assessment. NAEP has been evaluating the national performance of students on achievement tests in specific subject areas since 1969. However, since the curricula are changing, NAEP must also change. A consensus process was used to develop 1994 assessments in mathematics, reading, and science. NAEP is also incorporating new assessment techniques. In 1990, about 2.5 million open-ended items were scored in connection with the mathematics assessment. In addition, the 1992 writing assessment, an assessment consisting totally of open-ended items, will be scored with primary trait, holistic, and writing mechanics scoring procedures. Other new assessment techniques have included the use of calculators in the 1990 mathematics assessment and a special study on the use of timed mathematics items to measure students' ability to estimate the correct answer. NAEP is a national assessment program; however, it has been expanded to include voluntary trial state assessments. The first state-level assessment collected data in 1990 from 37 participating states, two territories, and the District of Columbia. In 1992, NAEP conducted a trial state mathematics assessment for the 4th and 8th grades, as well as a trial state reading assessment for the 4th grade. NCES will provide continuing reviews of NAEP through an independent evaluation of the trial state assessments, a NAEP technical review panel, and validation studies. Additionally, NCES will solicit public comment on the conduct and usefulness of NAEP by holding open meetings across the country. NCES is currently participating in the development of another IEA study, the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). The first phase of TIMSS will be conducted in 1995. The second phase is planned for the end of the decade. About 50 countries are involved in the planning effort. The purpose of TIMSS is to assess mathematics and science achievement and to provide background information about how the characteristics of different educational systems and learning environments relate to achievement. Cognitive tests will be administered to three populations: 9-year-olds, 13-year-olds, and students in the last year of secondary education. TIMSS will also collect information on educational system characteristics, classroom processes, curriculum content, the school environment including teacher and student characteristics, and other topics from national ministries, schools, and teachers. The final design is expected to include problem-solving tasks and laboratory experiments, classroom observations, and case studies of key educational policy issues.\nNLS-72 can provide information about quality, equity, and diversity of educational opportunity and the effect of those factors on cognitive growth, individual development, and educational outcomes. It can also provide information about changes in educational and career outcomes and other transitions over time. The NLS-72 data cover the sampled cohort from 1972- New education issues arose after NCES began its longitudinal study of the 1972 senior class. Declining test scores and minimum competency testing, for example, caused concern among parents and educators alike. The rate at which many students dropped out of high school before graduation was also a concern. Increased opportunities in secondary school vocational education opened new vistas for youths attentive to their futures. And, anxiety over access to postsecondary and vocational education sharpened the focus on the education expriences of Hispanic and other minority youths. To examine these and other issues, NCES initiated a second longitudinal study, High School and Beyond (HS&B), to complement the first. HS&B studied the high school students of 1980. It attempted to collect the same types of data gathered in the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. However, the second study differed from the first in two significant ways. First, it addressed many newer elements of the educational process. Second, it included a sophomore cohort as well as a senior cohort. Adding the sophomore cohort made it possible to address the issue of high school dropouts and to study changes and processes during high school.\nThe base year survey of HS&B and the followup surveys have addressed the issues of educational attainment, employment, family formation, personal values, and community activities since 1980. For example, a major study on high school dropouts used HS&B data to demonstrate that a large number of dropouts return to school and earn a high school diploma or an equivalency certificate. Other examples of issues and questions that can be addressed with HS&B data are: a) How, when, and why do students enroll in postsecondary education institutions? b) Did those who (while in high school) expected to complete the baccalaureate (BA) degree actually do so? c) How has the percentage of recent graduates from a given cohort who enter the work force in their field changed over the past years? d) What are the long-term effects of not completing high school in the tradi tional way? How do employment and earnings event histories of traditional high school graduates differ from those who did not finish high school in the traditional manner? e) Do individuals who attend college earn more than those who do not attend college? What is the effect of student financial aid? f) What 90 percentage of college graduates are eligible or qualified to enter a public service profession such as teaching? g) How many enter the work force full time in the area for which they are National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988: The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) was the third major longitudinal study sponsored by the NCES. The two studies that preceded NELS:88 (the National Longitudinal Study of 1972/NLS-72 and High School and Beyond/HS&B) surveyed high school seniors (and sophomores in HS&B) through high school, postsecondary education, and work and family formation experiences. Taken together, the longitudinal studies provide not only measures of educational attainment, but also rich resources in determining the reasons for and consequences of academic success and failure. NELS:88 seeks to expand on this base of knowledge by following children starting at an earlier age (8th grade) and by updating information throughout the 1990s.\nThe longitudinal design of this study permits the examination of change in young people's lives and the role of schools in promoting growth and positive life outcomes. For example, NELS:88 data can be used to investigate: The transition from elementary to secondary school. The survey will permit the investigation of ways students are assigned to curricular programs and courses and how such assignments affect their academic performance as well as future career and postsecondary education choices. The students' academic growth over time. Family, community, school, and classroom factors that promote such growth can be studied. The goal is to identify school and classroom characteristics and practices that promote student learning. The effects of changing composition of the family, which is evidenced by increasing numbers of working mothers and families headed by single parents, also can be studied. The features of effective schools. By surveying students, teachers, and school administrators, NELS:88 will enable an assessment of student educational outcomes. It will be possible to identify those school attributes that are associated with student academic achievement and other selected student behavior. For those researchers interested in school effects analyses, NCES is also sponsoring a School Effects Supplement. In 250 of the NELS:88 schools, additional students and teachers have been added. This file should be available in the fall of 1993. The process of dropping out of school, as it occurs from 8th grade on. NELS:88 provides the unprecedented opportunity to study young dropouts on a national scale; to examine the contextual factors associated with dropping out, especially those related to the school; and to profile the movement of students in and out of school, including alternative high school programs. The role of the school in helping the disadvantaged. Given the factors of increasing teenage pregnancy rates, increasing poverty among children, and the growing proportion of language minority students, there is a need for research on the school experiences of the disadvantaged and the approaches that hold the greatest promise for assisting them. By design, the NELS:88 sample contains an ample number of disadvantaged students to study this issue.\nBPS will greatly expand the knowledge about persistence, progress, and attainment after entry into PSE. It will also directly address issues concerning access to graduate school, entry into the work force, and rates of return. Its unique contribution will be the inclusion of nontraditional (or older) students at the same rate as occurs in PSE today. This will provide the ability to identify better the differences (if any) between traditional (recent high school graduates) and non-traditional (older) students in aspirations, progress, persistence, and attainment. Among the questions BPS can address related to persistence are: Do students who are part-time or discontinuous attenders have the same educational goals as full-time, consistent attenders? Are they as likely to attain similar educational goals? Are students who change majors more or less likely to persist? Are nontraditional students more or less likely to persist than their more traditional counterparts? In the area of progress and curriculum, questions addressed by BPS could include: What is the \"normal\" rate of academic progress? How has that changed over time? What educational experiences are related to \"normal\" and consistent progress? Is likelihood of transfer related to academic major? Attainment/outcome questions include: At what rate do those who intend to complete an educational program at or below the baccalaureate level do so? What educational experiences encourage completion? How long does it take to complete the program? Questions which BPS can address about access to graduate and professional programs concern timing, the application process, and entry into the program. BPS will also be able to provide information on rate of return questions, particularly those associated with immediate entry into the work force after completion of a program of less than 4 years. The Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B) will provide information concerning education and work experiences after the bachelor's degree. It will continue to provide cross-sectional information 1 year after bachelor's degree completion (comparable to the Recent College Graduate survey), while at the same time providing longitudinal data concerning entry into and progress through graduate level education, and the work force. A special emphasis of B&B will be on those entering public service areas, particularly teaching. B&B will provide information on entry into, persistence and progress through, and completion of graduate level education information not available through followups involving high school cohorts or even college entry cohorts, both of which are restricted in the number who actually complete the bachelor's degree and continue their education. B&B will follow each cohort over a 12-year period, allowing a unique opportunity to gather information concerning delayed entry into graduate level education, times to completion of graduate education, and the interactions between work and education at the graduate level."}, {"section_title": "SASS Teacher Followup Survey:", "text": "Another component of the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) is the Teacher Followup Survey (TFS). It is treated separately here because it consists of a subsample of SASS and is implemented one year after SASS. The survey identifies and collects national-level data from public and private school teachers who have remained in the same school as the previous year, as well as those who have changed schools, and those who have left the teaching profession. These data are used to provide information about teacher attrition and retention in the public and private schools and to project teacher demand."}, {"section_title": "COMPONENTS:", "text": "Questionnaire for Former Teachers: Primary occupational status; type of business; primary activity; full-time, part-time; time planning to spend in current job; new earned degrees, by type and field; plans for returning to teaching; reasons for leaving teaching; possible areas of dissatisfaction; salary; and changes in marital and family status or income.\n1991-92 Private School Survey: Religious orientation; level of school; size of school; length of school year, length of school day; total enrollment (K -12); number of high school graduates; number of teachers employed; schools operated in private homes; year school began operating; program emphasis.\nEarly Childhood: Program Participation Component (NHES: 91) Household members; household characteristics; educational participation and attainment; early childhood education; detailed demographic characteristics.\nBasic CPS: October Supplement: The CPS October Supplement provides important education data on enrollment, educational attainment, high school dropouts, retention, completion, and graduation rates. It also has provided policy-relevant data on private school tuition, adult education, vocational education, early childhood education, high school dropouts, and student mobility. The School District Mapping project aggregates demographic data acquired by the Bureau of the Census in the decennial census to totals for local education agencies and the states. The decennial census data are collected by census blocks which vary in size from less than a whole city block to a large portion of the state, depending upon the density of the population in the area. In the School District Mapping project, the location of each census block is identified with reference to the local education agency in which it appears, either in whole or part. The census data for these blocks or parts of these blocks are then totalled to create local education agency totals. NCES has conducted such a program for the decennial ce-suses of 1970of , 1980of . For 1990, the Bureau of the Census developed the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) System, in which 10,000,000 census blocks' boundaries are digitally encoded (to six decimal places) on computer tape. The boundaries of approximately 16,000 local education agencies, plus such education-related geographic entities as special education districts, Indian reservations and military installations which have education activities within their boundaries, were similarly digitized and encoded in the TIGER system, thus making it possible to convert the data from census blocks to education entities and produce requested tabulations. In Public Law 100-297, the Congress mandated that NCES should provide a report on these data on April 1, 1993. The data will also be used by the Department of Education for the allocation of various federal grant programs such as Chapter 1. NCES and education researchers and associations will use this very rich database to produce a series of analytic publications. NCES will provide more than 200 tabulations of state and district totals tc each of the 16,000 education entities, and each state. Additionally, each state will receive a TIGER line file fith digitized district boundaries. Cooperative System Fellows Program: As part of its ongoing effort to increase cooperation among federal, state, and local data collectors and to improve the overall quality and timeliness of education statistics, NCES initiated the Cooperative System Fellows Program in 1990. Fellows are selected from state and local education agencies across the country and convene in Washington, D.C., for 1 week. During their stay, the Fellows take part in a series of planned activities including presentations by NCES staff on the Center's major data collections, reports and dissemination practices, projects to automate state and local data systems, and efforts to integrate. existing data collections. In addition, Fellows explore their own professional interests and objectives. During the week, mentors selected from the Center's staff work with the Fellows to lead discussions on various topics, answer questions, and offer guidance and advice. An effort is made to help the Fellows achieve their individual program objectives. The Fellows Program is held twice a year for up to 30 people from elementary/secondary and postsecondary education. \nInstitutional Characteristics: Address; congressional district; county; telephone number; tuition; control or affiliation; calendar system; levels of degrees and awards offered; types of programs; credit and contact hour data; and accreditation.

National Household Education Survey: The National Household Education Survey (NHES) is the first major attempt by NCES to collect education data from a household survey. Historically, NCES has collected data from teachers, students, and schools through school-based surveys and from administrative records data through surveys of school districts and state education agencies. The NHES has the potential to address many issues in education that have not been addressed previously by NCES data collection activities. The NHES was field tested in 1989; and the first full-scale NHES was conducted in 1991. Plans call for an annual collection beginning in 1993. Topical components will be repeated on a 3-to 4-year cycle so that educational activities can be monitored over time."}, {"section_title": "Adult Education Component (NHES: 91)", "text": "See separate description in chapter 3.

The Forum's primary mission is to work with NCES to improve the overall quality, timeliness, and comparability of education statistics across the Nation, as mandated by the Hawkins-Stafford Education Improvement Amendments of 1988 (Public Law 100-297). Under the direction of its Steering Committee, the Forum maintains four standing committees: the National Education Statistics Agenda Committee; the Technology, Dissemination, and Communication Committee; the Policies, Programs, and Implementation Committee; and the Evaluation Committee. At present, the forum is addressing such important issues as facilitating uniform development in state automated data systems; developing strategies for improving federal, state, and local data collection and reporting capability; and discussing with NCES options for new and innovative projects aimed at improving the quality of education statistics. In addition to these efforts, the Forum is available to respond to specific requests from the Commissioner of NCES, and to raise issues and make recommendations of its own. By bringing federal and state representatives together to work cooperatively toward improving the quality of education statistics, the Forum p:Ays an important role in determining the future of our nation's education statistics system. In 1990, the National Forum issued its first publication, the Guide To Improving the National Education Data System. The Guide contaiiis 36 recommendations for improving the nation's elementary and secondary education statistics system. This proposed national education data agenda is the product of a broad-based, consensus-building process that brought together representatives of state and federal education agencies and of organizations with a major interest in education data. In 1992, the forum completed a feasibility study preliminary to addressing recommendations. The group also accepted the Standards for Education Data Collection and Reporting, a set of best-practice principles to be disseminated widely in order to improve data quality and comparability. Researchers and others may ask the Data Center to perform specific tabulations or analyses, or they may work on-site directly with confidential data files upon signing a confidentiality pledge. The Data Center has developed strict procedures, including computerized tests, to ensure that individuals in surveys cannot be identified from NCES data files. No data which could be used to identify an individual who supplied that data will be released. Among the services provided by the Data Center are limited programming and analysis, as well as other support services. The Data Center also develops its own statistical tables, graphic materials, and analyses in anticipation of major data needs of education policymakers, researchers, and others. Currently, the Data Center has files available from the Common Core of Data, the 1988 National Educational Longitudinal Study, the Schools and Staffing Survey, the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, the National Household Education Survey, and the National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (see descriptions of these surveys elsewhere in this publication). In the future, the Data Center plans to add additional databases to its inventory and to link several of these files, enabling researchers to perform higher level analyses. The core surveys of the NCES elementary and secondary program are: the Common Core of Data (CCD), the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (described in chapter 5), the National Household Education Survey (NHES), the Fast Response Survey System (FRSS), the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), and the Private School Survey (PSS). Additional topical supplements may be attached to these continuing surveys so that current data on key issues can be produced. Other changes may also be made to improve the data. One innovation underway in the CCD is the redesign and expansion of the fiscal collection component. The new state survey, entitled the National Public Education Financial Survey, greatly expanded the financial information reported by states, beginning in fiscal year 1990. NCES envisions this more comprehensive and policy-relevant information about state public education spending to be published by May 1993. A second component of the CCD fiscal redesign is to collect and report school district financial information. In September 1990, NCES conducted a joint NCES/Bureau of the Census school district fiscal collection from state administrative records of all 16,000 school districts. The joint 1990 collection only slightly expanded the Census Bureau's traditional school district financial survey form to collect core instructional expenditures as recommended by the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO). NCES and the Census Bureau conducted a major expansion of the Census Bureau's Survey of Local Government Finances in September 1992. This ambitious collection effort added more than 30 items to the survey, many for the first time. Consensus-building steps used for the state-level CCD survey, such as having items reviewed by state education associations and academic task forces, have contributed to the first 1992 joint school district collection. The school district financial data set from the 1990 joint NCES/Census collection, when completed, will be combined with community characteristics from the decennial census when the NCES school district mapping project is complete. Some of the items to be included on the combined data set are: at-risk students, community characteristics, occupation, and income. The initial release of the 1990 s-hool district level financial data by the Census Bureau was in July 1992, and will be combined with decennial census information in 1993. Under the umbrella of the National Cooperative Education Statistics System, all states have worked with NCES to increase the comparability and uniformity of elementary and secondary education data. Several items of particular interest have been dropout, school completer, and school staff data. In 1992-93, states will begin reporting on the CCD counts of dropouts, using specifications determined through the 1989-90 field test of a dropout definition and data collection procedure. The CCD will also collect and report more detailed breakouts of the number of school and school district staff providing instructional, support, and administrative services. School completer data will be uniformly reported across states so that the numbers of students receiving traditional and alternative graduation credentials can be easily assessed. Over the next 3 years, the National Cooperative Education Statistics System will also assist the states in conducting feasibility studies and developing plans for automating their data systems. The focus will be on improving the quality and comparability of state data systems so that information can be shared and aggregated at the national level. During this period, extra resources will be provided to the outlying areas to enable them to bring their systems up to par with the states. One component of the feasibility studies for automating data systems is a nationwide electronic records transfer system. The \"Exchange of Permanent Records Electronically for Students and Schools\" (EXPRESS) is being designed to promote state/local information system capacity and comparability in support of the National Cooperative Education Statistics System. Some of the anticipated benefits of the proposed national system include promotion of greater compatibility and standardization of student information across state and local information systems; more timely request and receipt of student records through an electronic network as opposed to mail; more timely availability of data for use in determining the educational placement and the initiation of support services required for enrolling student; and increased reliability and consistency in the interpretation of student records. Project activities include the development of a set of data elements and definitions in Atrmican National Standards Institute format to be used in the pilot electronic transfer of student records between districts and from districts to postsecondary institutions. Beginning in the spring of 1993, the NHES will be conducted on an annual basis. Each data collection will include at least two topical components, one of which will be an early childhood component. The concept of \"school readiness\" will be emphasized in the 1993 early childhood component. To monitor change over time, current plans call for repeating other topical components every third year. Other topical components planned for inclusion in NHES are: adult and continuing education (1994); school safety and discipline (1993 and 1996); and citizenship (1995 and 1998). In the future, data collected by NHES may be enhanced by a longitudinal component, a second annual survey in the fall, or a sample to provide state-level estimates. Data collected by NHES may also be combined with data from other household surveys such as the Current Population Survey (conducted by the Census Bureau). In an attempt to be responsive to the information needs of the many education constituency groups below the postsecondary level, NCES is currently planning two new longitudinal studies. For more information on the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1998 (NELS:98), see the section on Plans for Longitudinal Studies in Chapter 5. In addition, a longitudinal component will be added to the SASS Teacher Follow-up Survey. The teachers selected for the followup in the 1994-95 school year will be contacted for additional information at 2-year intervals at least three times. In the summer of 1991, staff working on SASS began a process that will lead to a more focused program of survey evaluation and research. SASS staff working with Census Bureau staff and the academic community will develop a research plan and begin work in a number of areas such as the development of sampling frames and the evaluation of their completeness, research into sampling issues associated with student samples in SASS, and an exploration of alternative weighing schemes for SASS. Other research topics to be explored include reviewing ways to increase survey response rates, characterizing various classes of nonrespondents, and improving questionnaire concepts and wording. Finally, the program will encourage substantive analysis and data evaluation by the research and academic communities and will develop a SASS Quality Profile, a review of what is known about sampling and nonsampling errors in SASS.  , 1989-90 (April 1991) The Tested Achievement of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (  Drug-Free Schools (November 1991) Directory of Public Elementary /Secondary Education Agencies, 1989-90 (November 1991) Diversity of Private Schools (December 1991) NHES Findings: Experiences in Child Care and Early Childhood Programs of 1st and 2nd Graders (January 1992) NHES Findings: Home Activities of 3-to 8-Year-Olds  Year of Data Collection 199019911993199419951996 Common Core of Data"}, {"section_title": "Schools and Staffing Survey", "text": "Teacher Demand and Shortage Questionnaire 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 Private Social, demographic, educational, and economic issues challenge postsecondary education today. Among the most critical are questions pertaining to access to postsecondary education for various populations, the effects of shifting enrollment patterns, the cost of postsecondary education, student financing of postsecondary education, education outcomes, the long range financial outlook for colleges and universities, demand for and supply of qualified faculty and staff, and job opportunities for graduates. The NCES program in postsecondary education provides statistical information used by planners, policymakers, and educators in addressing these issues. One major source of this information is the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), an annual series of surveys conducted by NCES that provides a variety of data on the Nation's 10,500 public and private postsecondary institutions. Special studies of recent college graduates, student financial aid, postsecondary faculty, and doctorates complement IPEDS. In addition, postsecondary education transcript studies have been conducted in conjunction with the National Longitudinal Study of 1972, the High School and Beyond Study, and the Beginning Postsecondary Study (descriptions of these studies are in Chapter 5). Another postsecondary longitudinal survey system, Baccalaureate and Beyond, is being developed to collect institutional and student data from postsecondary students over a period of several years (see the \"Plans\" section of chapter 5)."}, {"section_title": "37", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Surveys and Studies:", "text": "Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System: NCES has established the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) as its core postsecondary education data collection program.

Under this legislation, NAEP is required to provide objective data about student performance at national and regional levels. In 1988, Congress amended this legislation to establish the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB). The purpose of NAGB is to provide policy guidance for the execution of NAEP. The Board is composed of national and local elected officials, chief state school officers, classroom teachers, local school board members, and leaders of the business community, among others. Specifically, it has been charged by Congress to perform the following duties: select subject areas to be assessed; identify appropriate achievement goals for each age group; develop assessment objectives; design a methodology of assessment; and produce guidelines and standards for national, regional, and state comparisons. Prior to 1990, NAEP was required to assess reading, mathematics, and writing at least once every 5 years. The current legislation requires assessments in reading and mathematics at least every 2 years, in science and writing at least every 4 years, and in history or geography and other subjects selected by the Board at least every 6 years."}, {"section_title": "Fall Enrollment:", "text": "Fall Enrollment in Occupationally-Specific Programs:"}, {"section_title": "Completions:", "text": "Full-and part-time enrollment by racial/ethnic category and sex for undergraduates, first professional, and graduate students.

(Discontinued after 1992-93.) A wealth of institutional-level data for analyzing the state of postsecondary education institutions is provided by the IPEDS data. For example, IPEDS data can be used (with HEGIS data) to describe long-term trends in higher education. The data necessary for conducting and interpreting special studies of postsecondary students, faculty, and staff are available within IPEDS. Using IPEDS data, policymakers and researchers can analyze postsecondary data on the number of students, graduates, first-time freshmen, and graduate and professional students by race/ethnicity and sex; the status of postsecondary vocational education programs; the number of individuals trained in certain occupational and vocational fields by sex, race/ethnicity, and level; the resources generated by postsecondary education; completions by type of program, level of award, race/ethnicity, and sex; and many other issues of interest. Beginning in 1993, all institutions eligible for funding under Title IV, Higher Education Act Amendment of 1987 (Public law 100-50) will be surveyed using IPEDS. Other institutions will receive only an Institutional Characteristics survey. Within the group of institutions eligible under Title IV, those accredited at the college level by an agency recognized by the Secretary, U.S. Department of Education (formerly surveyed under HEGIS) will receive a full package of IPEDS forms each year. All other institutions will receive a shortened version of the surveys consolidated into one form; however, data items will be comparable and, thus, national data will be available for all such institutions. National Household Education Survey (Adult Education Component): With increased attention being paid to adult learning, as a result of the national education goals and the concern about America's ability to compete in a global economy, there has been a heightened interest in more complete data on the educational activities of the adult population. The National Household Education Survey (NHES) provides the opportunity to collect information on a wide range of adult education experiences. The adult education component of NHES was implemented in the spring of 1991.

SASS will be conducted every 3 years with the next collection scheduled for 1994. At the postsecondary level, IPEDS, NPSAS, and the longitudinal studies are the primary sources for vocational education data. Most of the IPEDS surveys will be conducted annually, while NPSAS will be conducted every 3 years, with the next survey occurring in 1993. As noted above, NELS:88 will continue with followup studies, as will Beginning Postsecondary Students. NCES has contracted for analyses of these data sets to provide new comparisons of vocational and nonvocational activities. Upcoming reports include a comparison of participation rates in secondary vocational education among 1982, 1987, and 1990 graduates.

NCES collects and disseminates statistical information on public, academic, and elementary and secondary school libraries. The role played by libraries of all types in education has not been adequately measured, as evidenced by: 1) the ad hoc nature of past data collection efforts in terms of frequency of collection and library components surveyed and 2) the lack of extant descriptive and outcome data.

These publications present statistics on a wide array of education topics. They are used in a number of diverse ways by policymakers, researchers, and the general public."}, {"section_title": "The Condition of Education:", "text": "NCES gathers and publishes information on the status and progress of education in the United States. The federal authorization (enacted in 1974, but with antecedents to 1867) for these activities states that the Center will \"collect, collate, and from time to time, report full and complete statistics on the condition of education in the United States.\" This legislation mandated an annual statistical report from the Secretary of Education. In 1988, the Hawkins-Stafford Elementary/Secondary School Improvement Amendments delegated that reporting responsibility to the Commissioner of Education Statistics. In 1975, The Condition of Education was created in response to this mandate. The publication attempted to present, in a single volume, an overview of education in the United States. The format of The Condition of Education was designed to present statistical information in an accessible manner for a general audience. The Condition, by analyzing statistical studies and data, investigated the context of education in this country, educational attainment, financing of education, enrollments, attitudes about school, the supply of teachers, and other related undertakings. The Condition also presented statistics on postsecondary education in the United States, which focused on educational attainment, the financing of postsecondary education, enrollments, age, and data on persistence in postsecondary education. Tables and required technical notes were also included. In the late 1980s, the Condition became an \"indicators\" publication which includes data on a limited number of topics of interest and concern in education today. All possible indicators are not published in a given edition of the Condition. No more than 60 indicators are presented in each year's report. The indicators include a basic core that can be repeated with information every year, supplemented by a more limited set of indicators based on periodic or one-time studies. In contrast, the Center's other major compendium, the Digest of Education Statistics (see separate description in this chapter), includes more than 395 statistical tables, plus figures and appendices. The indicators, therefore, represent a consensus of professional judgement on the most significant national measures of the condition and progress of education at the time, but tempered, necessarily, by the availability of current and valid information. The concept of education indicators has gained the attention of the U.S. Congress, national organizations, states, and localities. To assist the Center in conceptualizing and developing a set of education indicators useful to policymakers and researchers, the Congress mandated that NCES 130 141. convene a special study panel of experts to \"make recommendations concerning the determination of education indicators for study.\" The report of the panel was transmitted to Congress in August 1991. Its recommendations may result in structural or content changes for future editions of the Condition. The utility of this report should also increase as more diverse, high quality data become available, especially as new time series can be constructed. Elementary and secondary education data will be enhanced by revisions in the basic data collected about public schools in the Common Core of Data and by continuation and expansion of the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS, see chapter 2) which covers both public and private schools. Also, more postsecondary data will become available from new surveys such as the Adult Education component of the National Household Education Survey and the postsecondary longitudinal surveys (see chapters 3 and 5)."}, {"section_title": "Digest of Education Statistics:", "text": "The Digest of Education Statistics (Digest) is the primary resource publication on education statistics. It contains a wealth of information on all levels of education from preprimary through graduate education. This reference volume is intended for use by researchers, policy analysts, business, media, students, educators, and the general public. The Digest has expanded through its long history, as NCES has adopted a policy of continuous development without sacrificing important trend information. The development of the Digest occurred over an extended period of time. For 40 years, from 1916-18 to 1956-58, the statistical component of the Office of Education prepared and published the Biennial Survey of Education in the United States. Most of the important data collected by the Office was placed in the Biennial Survey, which was a resource used by researchers, planners, and others interested in the field of education statistics. After 1958, publication of the Biennial Survey ceased, but the need for a document summarizing the various types of data collected by the C dice of Education continued. Thus, in 1962, the first edition of the Digest was issued. The 1992 Digest is the 28th in this series of publications. (The Digest has been issued annually except for combined editions for the years 1977-78, 1983-84, and 1985-86.) Its primary purpose is to provide a compilation of statistical information covering the broad field of American education from preprimary through graduate school. The Digest includes a selection of data from many sources, both government and private, and draws especially on the results of surveys and activities carried out by NCES. It contains a considerable amount of material tabulated exclusively for the Digest such as summaries of federal funds for education and detailed tabulations on degrees conferred by colleges and universities. The publication contains information on schools, teachers, enrollments, graduates, educational attainment, finances, federal funds for education, employment and income of graduates, libraries, and international education. Supplemental information on population trends, attitudes on education, education characteristics of the labor force, government finances, and economic trends provides background for evaluating education data. The Digest is divided into seven chapters: \"All Levels of Education,\" \"Elementary and Secondary Education,\" \"Postsecondary Education,\" \"Federal Programs for Education and Related Activities,\" \"Outcomes of Education,\" \"International Comparisons of Education,\" and \"Learning and Technology.\" To qualify for inclusion in this publication, material must be nationwide in scope and of current interest and value. The introductory sections supplement the tabular materials in chapters 1 through 7 by providing brief overviews of current trends in American education. Each chapter contains an introduction to statistical materials describing that sector of education, as well as a series of short paragraphs that describe the most significant data in the chapter. Charts are provided to further illuminate important data. Recently, NCES has begun a program to make the Digest even more comprehensive. To make data analysis more convenient, a machine-readable version has been developed. The diskette version of the Digest is now being expanded to include other NCES publications such as The Condition of Education, Youth Indicators and Historical Trends: State Education Facts. The data are packaged with software that allows computerized search and retrieval of specific data. NCES has also created Education Statistics: A Pocket Digest to make basic education 132 statistics available in a two-page flyer. The Pocket Digest includes statistics on enrollments, expenditures, faculty, degrees, and population characteristics in an abbreviated form. The Digest strives for clarity, consistency, and comparability. It places high value on the major recurring surveys with the objective of providing trend data that researchers and policymakers can use to measure changes over time. It seeks to preserve the major series of education statistics originating with NCES and elsewhere and to make them readily available to a wide audience of users. For more information on the Digest of Education Projections of Education Statistics: The National Center for Education Statistics is the official federal source of education projections at the national level. Projections are made in the areas of: enrollments; graduates and earned degrees conferred; instructional staff; and expenditures in elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher education. The principal publication dealing with projections is the Projections of Education Statistics (Projections). The report provides national projections of statistics about elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher education. Included are data on enrollments, graduates, degrees, instructional staff, and expenditures for the past 15 years, and projections for the next 12 years. The report also contains a methodology section that describes models and assumptions used to develop these projections. Most of the projections are based on three alternative sets of assumptions. Although the middle alternative is the preferred set of projections, the other (high and low) alternatives provide a range of possible outcomes. A summary of these projections is _available in a pocket-sized folder called Pocket Projections. This brochure is a quick reference for projections of key education statistics. The information provided in the report is used by researchers and policy planners in education and related areas. The projections are particularly targeted for individuals in business, industry, government, the-'media, and educators whose work requires information on projected developments and trends affecting American education.
