[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Storm surge is \"an abnormal rise of water generated by a storm, over and above the predicted astronomical tide\" (NOAA, 2015). It is historically a big threat to life and properties in coastal communities in the United States. In a storm event, strong wind and water surge waves can cause massive destruction and interrupt the operation of urban infrastructure and other environmental assets. Flooding from storm surge can also inundate low-lying terrain, affect coastal hydrology, and impact water quality in estuaries. Hurricane Sandy and associated coastal flooding in 2012 is a recent example of the damages that can result (Kunz et al., 2013). For coastal risk assessment and adaptation planning, the impacts of storm surge in combination with accelerated sea level rise are a core consideration. Storm surge is a complicated process controlled by many factors. Although wind strength and atmospheric depression in the hurricane eye are the primary driving force of a storm surge, many other factors can influence the magnitude of the surge that a given storm produces at a given location. These factors include landfall location, storm track, angle of approach to the coast, shape and orientation of the coastline, and local topographic features. Storm surge can occur before, during, and after the center of a storm passes an area, and under non-tropical storm wind as well. For example, in the hurricane Ike, a significant coastal flooding occurred near Mandeville, Louisiana, a location far from the hurricane landfall at Galveston, TX. This was despite the fact that the highest sustained wind was only 19.2 m/s (43 mph), much lower than wind speeds for a category 1 hurricane. (NOAA, 2015;NWS, 2014) Because of these complexities, it is difficult to predict precisely storm surge occurrence and magnitude at one specific location. The prediction is nonetheless necessary for local adaptation and preparation against storm surge. Coastline orientation has received less attention compared with other factors such as coastline geomorphology and bathymetry. Yet it is a primary planning factor for barrier islands and estuary wetland systems. Here we hypothesized that coastline orientation may act together with wind direction to play an indirect but import role in the storm surge occurrence and magnitude. In this initial investigation, we mathematically defined and calculated wind angle between coastline orientation and wind direction. Then we investigated semi-quantitatively the effects of wind angle on storm surge height in order to reveal the role of coastline orientation on the formation of storm surge. We anticipate that our results will inform future modeling efforts of flood risk to coastal systems to improve risk management and adaptation planning."}, {"section_title": "Methodology 2.1. Site and historical Water level and Wind Observations", "text": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tide gauge network collects water level and meteorological conditions along the U.S. coasts. In this study, we chose two tide gauges at the eastern and western side of the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, Virginia. Figure 1 shows the locations for the Sewells Point (SP) station, and the Kiptopeke station. The SP station is in the harbor area between Norfolk and Hampton Road, and is surrounded by low-lying land surface. The Kiptopeke station is located at the western shore of a peninsula. Hourly water levels (predicted tide level and actual sea level observation) and wind measurements (speed and direction) are obtained from the NOAA tide and current website (http://www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/map/). Wind direction is measured clockwise in degree starting from due North (0\u00b0), showing the direction from where the wind blows. Wind direction ranges from 0\u00ba to 360\u00ba. The data available for the SP and Kiptopeke stations include historical water levels and wind measurement records from 1995 to 2015 and 1999 to 2015, respectively, which is a total of 36-years of observation records available for the statistical analysis."}, {"section_title": "Coastline Orientation", "text": "Although the curvature of a coastline is complicated and changes in short distance, the overall orientation can still be estimated approximately for a coastline segment. In this study, coastline orientation is measured clockwise in degree starting from the due North. Figure 1 shows the measurement of coastline orientation and angles at the SP and Kiptopeke stations."}, {"section_title": "Wind Angle", "text": "We postulate that the storm surge occurrence and magnitude depend on the geometric relationship between coastline orientation and wind direction rather than on coastal orientation itself. For quantification, we define the wind angle as the acute or right angle between coastline orientation and wind direction. In addition, we assign offshore wind (wind that blows from land to sea) a negative wind angle and onshore wind (wind that blows from sea to land) a positive value. By definition, a wind angle, , ranges from -90\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. Figure 2 schematically illustrates how a wind angle is defined. 1 is constructed by the coastline orientation and offshore wind, thus giving it a negative value. As a comparison, 2 has a positive wind angle showing onshore wind in relationship to the coastline orientation. "}, {"section_title": "Storm Surge Height", "text": "By definition, storm surge is the rise in water level above the predicted astronomical tide. Thus, storm surge height is the difference between the actual water level observed and the tide level predicted by NOAA (NOAA, 2015). The following equation expresses this calculation. where , \u210e . , and \u210e . are surge height, water level observation, and predicted tide level, respectively. Since surge height should be the difference between two sets of data based on the same tidal datum, it does not matter which tidal datum is used to measure the absolute local sea level. However, caution is needed when using sea level observations reported in different sources for comparison and discussion, because different tidal datum can produce different water levels that may give misleading results."}, {"section_title": "The Interaction Among Wind Angle, Wind Speed, and Surge Height", "text": "Wind angle between coastline orientation and wind direction, as defined in Section 2.3, was determined from wind measurement records. Resulting data are used to reveal the interaction among wind angle, wind speed, and surge height, and thus to determine the roles played by coastline orientation in the surge height. Among the 36-year records, a total of 58 surge events (5500 hours of observations) were selected for further detailed analysis. The criteria for selection were based on surge height and/or wind speed measurements. Because storm surge can be caused by non-storm winds, and large wind do not necessarily produce high water level above tidal effects, we selected those events that have a maximum surge height > 0.6 m (2 feet) and/or the maximum sustained wind speed > 10.3 m/s (20 kn) for the focus of this analysis."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Using the obtained storm surge and wind data at these two stations, we examined: 1) the process of surge formation and its relationship with the wind switching from offshore to onshore, and 2) the effect of wind angle with the coastline on maximum surge height. The implications of our results for barrier island and estuary wetland systems are then discussed."}, {"section_title": "Covariation of surge height and wind speed", "text": "Surge formation consists of an accumulation phase followed by a retreat phase. In the accumulation period, storm surge height increases until it reaches the maximum height. Then the storm surge height decreases in the retreat period, and water levels retreat to a depressed level before recovering to be a part of the normal tidal cycle. Figure 3 illustrates the temporal changes in surge height, wind speed, and wind angle during the 2011 hurricane Irene at the SP station. Figure 3a shows covariation between wind speed and surge level. During this wind-surge event, surge height reached its maximum as wind speed increased in accumulation period, and then decreased as wind speed declined in the retreat period. Meanwhile, wind direction changed over time from offshore winds in the beginning to onshore winds at the end (Figure 3b). The vertical dashed line in Figure 3a shows where the shift occurred in wind angle, from negative wind domination to positive wind domination. The vertical dashed line in Figure 3b separates the accumulation period from the retreat-period of the storm surge formation. This offshore wind direction in the surge accumulation phase occurred mostly in the 58 studied surge periods for both the SP and Kiptopeke stations. In a typical case, wind angle changed from negative values to positive after the surge peaked. For those wind-surge events that had dominant negative winds in the accumulation phase (such as Figure 3b), we observed a strong linear correlation between surge height and wind speed. This correlation is shown in Figure 4 for a single wind-surge event that occurred in 2000 at the Kiptopeke station. For 12 other similar events, R 2 value for the linear regression ranges from 0.628 to 0.894. Worthy to note is that this strong correlation is present only for the period (1) being dominated by negative winds and (2) with persistently increasing wind speed. For instance, when the 2011 hurricane Irene occurred, the offshore wind increased steadily to nearly 20 m/s during the storm surge accumulation period (see Figure 3a and 3b)."}, {"section_title": "The effects of wind angle", "text": "In addition to wind speed, wind angle is found to affect the maximum surge height. For the 58 events we studied at the two stations, the larger the percentage of negative winds in the surge accumulation period, the greater maximum a surge height. Figure 5a plot this relationship including all 58 studied storm surge and wind events. Comparatively, the maximum surge height observed is relatively small, < 0.3m, when the period is dominated by positive wind (e.g., ~ 20% negative winds). This is true despite the maximum wind speed reached >18m/s (35kn) in the analyzed events. Figure 5b provides further insights into the coastline orientation and its effects on maximum surge height. To isolate the effect of wind angle and eliminate the effect of wind speed, the maximum surge height is normalized by the corresponding wind speed. Among the 58 windsurge events, the wind-normalized maximum surge height is negatively correlated with the average wind angle in the surge accumulation period (Figure 5b). Overall, very small normalized surge height occurred for winds parallel to the shore (\uf071\uf020~ 0) or under onshore winds (\uf071\uf020> 0). The normalized maximum surge height increases as the offshore winds turned toward the perpendicular angle, or \uf071 \uf0e090 o . We did not quantitatively analyze the surge height response to the wind angle and shoreline orientation. Simulation using storm surge modeling tools such as the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model (Jelesnianski et al., 1984) may provide a way to confirm the causative relations that are found here in our statistical analysis of storm surge height. "}, {"section_title": "Summary and Implications", "text": "Our preliminary analysis revealed the role that coastline orientation plays in wind-surge events. A total of 36-years of historical measurements on sea level and wind direction and speed were investigated at three tide gauges located in the Chesapeake Bay, Virginia. We identified and analyzed 58 wind-surge events (5500 hours of records) to test our hypothesis that coastline orientation in relation to wind direction affects the storm surge height. Major conclusions are the following: \uf0b7 In the surge accumulation period, when negative wind angle dominates, the storm surge is proportional to the wind speed. The higher the wind speed, the higher the storm surge until it reaches the maximum. This strong correlation is only significant when (1) offshore winds dominates, and (2) wind speed increases persistently until reaching to the maximum. \uf0b7 A high percentage of offshore winds during the accumulation period is a strong indication of greater maximum surge at the near-shore monitoring station. On the other hand, onshore winds yield small maximum surge height (e.g., <0.3m [1ft] in our case study, even when the maximum wind speed reached above 18m/s [35kn])."}, {"section_title": "\uf0b7", "text": "There is a strong negative correlation between the average wind angle and the wind-speednormalized maximum surge height. Offshore winds with right angle to the shoreline are associated with higher surge height. We have noted that many meteorological and topographic factors can affect the storm surge height and wind conditions. Coastline orientation is one of the secondary factors. Our results are based on statistical analysis of historical measurement data on wind and surge height. These localized observations can be further investigated using quantitative model simulations at high spatial and temporal resolutions in order to understand the causative relationship between surge height and wind/shore orientation. What our study shows clearly is that shoreline orientation and wind direction matter to storm surge height. This has several implications for risk assessment and storm surge preparedness. First, for regions with dominant and frequent storm tracks, shoreline protection measures such as storm sea walls and barrier islands could be designed to protect against surge-related foundation erosion and other physical damages. Second, the covariance of wind speed and surge wave height is noteworthy, indicating that this relationship should be incorporated in risk analyses of ecological assets in coastal areas, such as tidal wetlands (Kirwan et al., 2013;Tiner, 1984). Finally, the angle created by wind direction and coastline orientation, rather than wind direction alone, can significantly affect the occurrence and extent of storm surge. Thus this factor is relevant to the analysis of flood risk and to adaptation planning for critical infrastructure such as transportation and hazardous waste storage in low-lying coastal areas."}]
