Methodology and Technical Notes", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Data Collection and Editing Procedures", "text": "The EDFacts data collection system is the primary collection tool for the CCD nonfiscal data. The CCD team works collaboratively with the EDFacts team to develop and monitor the CCD nonfiscal collection. Coordinators from SEAs submit the CCD data at different levels (school, agency, and state) to the EDFacts submission system. Prior to submitting CCD files to EDFacts, SEAs must collect and compile information from their respective LEAs via established administrative records systems within their state or jurisdiction. Once SEAs complete their submissions, CCD survey analysts review and verify the CCD for quality assurance. CCD survey analysts routinely verify data through SEA coordinators and do not contact LEAs or individual schools to verify data except in unusual circumstances. In some cases, CCD survey staff use SEAs', LEAs', or schools' public web sites to verify data. After performing edit and consistency checks, CCD analysts work cooperatively with SEA coordinators to resolve inconsistencies or possible errors. Editing procedures are described in more detail later in this section. For the purposes of data submissions to EDFacts/CCD, an LEA is a governmental administrative unit at the local level which exists primarily to operate schools or to contract for educational services. These units may or may not be coterminous with county, city, or town boundaries. Not all LEAs operate schools; some provide support to other agencies and do not have teachers or students permanently assigned to them. CCD asks states to report a headcount of students, not an FTE student count. To avoid double counting in those cases where a student is served by more than one LEA, a student is counted in the LEA that is financially responsible for him or her. States report data throughout the year to the EDFacts collection system through multiple file groups that include related variables. NCES and EDFacts request that SEAs submit data on a reporting schedule at different dates throughout the year; there is wide variation on how well SEAs are able to comply with the requested schedule due to varying resource and data system constraints among SEAs and the LEAs within the SEA. SEAs may also submit revisions to their NCES applies multiple types of editing procedures to ensure data quality. For example NCES performs an extensive matching procedure on the directory of LEAs to the directory from the prior year to ensure that the coverage of LEAs included in the directory is complete and accurate. NCES reviews the categorical variables for LEAs and changes in operating statuses to ensure that these meet the business rules and data definitions established for reporting LEA data. Beginning with SY 2009-10 NCES implemented a revised editing methodology that more accurately identified school and LEA data that were likely to have errors. This methodology was initially applied to key data items such as school and school district enrollment, grade 12 enrollment, and free and reduced price lunch variables and related ratios such as pupil/teacher ratio, percent of enrollment from grade 12, and percent of students eligible for free and reduced price lunch. In the past data items were only compared to the reported data from the prior year for each school or LEA. The revised methodology used available data from multiple prior years and was applied to both the reported data items and related ratios. Specifically, an average variation over the prior 4 years was computed based on the differences between each year and the other 3 years. Then, the average variation between the target year and the four preceding years was computed based on the differences between target year and each of the 4 prior years. The average variation for the target year was compared to the average variation among the prior years; cases with large differences were flagged as potential errors. Additionally, a requirement was added that in order for an item to be identified as a potential error, both the count and a related ratio must be identified as potential errors. For example, for total student membership to be flagged as a potential error, both total membership and a related ratio, such as pupil/teacher ratio, must be flagged. At multiple points throughout the collection CCD survey staff contact EDFacts and CCD coordinators within each SEA and provide them targeted feedback about their data submissions. NCES asks state coordinators to address any data that appear to be in error or that suggest anomalies in the data. Most often SEAs will submit corrected data or explain why the data are accurate. If an SEA provides no correction or adequate explanations for data anomalies, NCES may provide a logical correction to a data value (for example, replace a reported value with the sum of detailed component values) or suppress the data. For example, if a state reported enrollment of 12 th grade students that was substantially larger than the enrollment of 11 th grade students in the previous year, and the state could not explain the discrepancy or correct the data, NCES suppressed the reported number of 12 th grade students. NCES also applied additional edits across the school, LEA, and state-level data to reduce data anomalies and ensure consistency among the levels of data. For example, for a given LEA the teacher FTE counts at the school level may have summed to more than what was reported at the LEA level. If the SEA was unable to verify that this was accurate, explain the discrepancy, or resubmit a corrected data, NCES edited the FTE data at the school level to match the data at the LEA level by proportionally adjusting the counts. The EDFacts collection system accepted blank responses in SY 2011-12 reports and did not require that states distinguish among missing, not applicable, and \"zero\" values. NCES used statistical editing procedures to identify and edit responses as missing, not applicable, or zero, wherever appropriate with available information; however, it is possible that some blank responses were categorized incorrectly. For example, blank staff counts may have been categorized as missing when the actual count was zero. Once CCD survey staff complete the collection and review of the CCD directory data, Census Bureau staff clean and standardize the reported physical location addresses for schools and LEAs and then assign geographic elements (latitude, longitude, locale, congressional district, and county) based on the LEAs' location addresses."}, {"section_title": "B. Sources of Error and Technical Details about the SY 2011-12 file", "text": "Nonsampling error. Nonsampling error is the error in an estimate arising at any stage in the survey from sources exclusive of sampling error. Nonsampling error includes nonresponse error, data processing or data entry errors, or reporting error because respondents misinterpret survey questions, do not follow survey instructions, or do not follow the item definitions correctly. State education policies may differ in a way that does not allow the SEA staff to map their data exactly to the CCD definitions. For example, some states issue several kinds of high school credentials, while other states issue a regular diploma to every student who meets requirements (which may also vary). Another source of nonsampling error may be variations in the reference period for the reported data. For example, CCD requests data for October 1 of each school year, but a state may report their information for another date because they were not able to capture the data for October 1. If specific discrepancies are known, these are provided in appendix D, State Notes. NCES attempts to minimize nonsampling error through the use of annual training of SEA coordinators, extensive quality reviews, and survey editing procedures. Universe Scope. The scope of the LEA Universe Survey includes all public agencies providing education services to prekindergarten, kindergarten, grade 1-12, and ungraded students. In the 2011-12 CCD LEA Universe Survey, there are 18,541 records, one for each public elementary and secondary education agency in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the DoDEA, the BIE, and the four U.S. Island Areas. Agencies that were coded as open in the 2010-11 file, but coded as closed for SY 2011-12 (163 agencies), are kept in the file for one year and then removed (i.e., they do not appear in files for subsequent years). Closed agencies are indicated by a value of \"2\" for the variable BOUND. Excluding closed agencies there are 18,378 agencies on the 2011-12 file. Of the 18,378 agencies, 13,793 are regular local school districts, 1,567 are supervisory unions or regional educational centers, 280 are state-operated agencies, 2,602 are charter school agencies, and 136 are federally operated or other agencies. For a count of all agency types, including closed agencies, see Table B-3. The DoDEA, BIE, and American Samoa did not report data for SY 2011-12. Their agency directory information was brought forward from the prior year and all the other data items were left as missing. Coverage error. Coverage error is a source of nonsampling error that occurs when the measured universe of schools and agencies varies from the actual target universe; for example, the same agency or school could be reported twice (i.e. overcoverage) or an agency or school could be omitted (i.e. undercoverage). To minimize coverage error CCD survey analysts conduct an extensive review of the LEAs submitted by SEAs by matching to the universe reported in the prior year and ensuring that each LEA is only counted once and each LEA is accounted for with the appropriate operational status. Although longitudinal consistency is a key principle of the CCD, it is impossible for NCES to guarantee that state data coordinators follow CCD conventions regarding the deletion of closed schools or agencies and the addition of new ones. Errors may be more likely when there are cases of redistricting where the district boundaries change or if LEAs merge or split or re-organize because these types of change make it more difficult to compare information for a given school or agency over time. The CCD asks states to report all free elementary/secondary public education in their state regardless of who administers the schools or districts. CCD coverage of traditional public schools and school districts is very complete (close to 100 percent). However, coverage of publicly funded education outside of traditional school districts have varying levels of coverage by state or jurisdiction. Some states do not report schools that are administered by state organizations other than SEAs. Examples include charter schools authorized by an organization that is not a school district, schools sponsored by health and human services agencies within a state, and juvenile justice facilities. These schools may include schools for the deaf and blind, university lab schools, and other schools not covered by the authority of the SEA. In recent years EDFacts/CCD has increased efforts to work with other Department of Education offices as well as other federal agencies to use additional administrative data sources to identify schools that may be underreported by SEAs. Response. The DoDEA, BIE, and American Samoa did not report data for SY 2011-12; however, NCES used historical CCD information and more current information from public websites for these education agencies to minimally include the LEAs from these entities in the LEA universe directory. Item response is described in appendix B: Value Distribution and Field Frequencies. This appendix lists the minimum, maximum, and mean value of each numeric variable as well as the total number of units and the number of units with missing data. Appendix B: Value Distribution also lists the frequency of each response category by option for all of the categorical values. Handling of data items without a positive reported data value. All data elements are either completed by the state or have been filled with a \"0,\" \"-1,\" \"-2,\" \"-9,\" \"M,\" or \"N.\" \uf0b7 0 -There are no occurrences of this data element. A value was expected and measured, but there were no cases in the category. (For example, a high school having no 12 th graders would report 0.) \uf0b7 M (or -1 for numeric values) -Data are missing. A value was expected and none was measured. (For example, a school that has at least one 12 th grader but cannot measure the number of 12 th graders would report -1.) \uf0b7 N (or -2 for numeric values) -Data are not applicable. A value was neither expected nor measured. (For example, an elementary school would report -2 for 12 th graders.) \uf0b7 -9 -The submitted data item does not meet NCES data quality standards. This value would only occur with numeric values. \uf0b7 In addition schools that have not able to assign a geographic longitude/latitude assigned were assigned a value of 0.000000 Note that starting with the SY 2002-03 CCD; all numeric fields contain a -1 to indicate \"missing\" and a -2 to indicate \"not applicable.\" Previously, numeric fields contained an \"M\" for missing and an \"N\" for not applicable. Character fields continue to use \"M\" for missing and \"N\" for not applicable. Starting with SY 2009-10, the numeric fields contain a -9 to indicate that the reported data were suppressed because they do not meet NCES data quality standards. Since negative numeric values represent missing, nonapplicable or suppressed data and not actual data values, users may want to recode these before performing data analysis. The following SAS code can be used to convert negative values to \"missing\" in the SAS data file: data new; set ag111a_supp; array remove (*) _numeric_; do i = 1 to dim (remove); if remove (i) < 0 then remove (i) = .; end; drop i; run; BIE agencies. There are 7 agencies (6 operating; 1 closed) that contain schools that are reported by both the Bureau of Indian Education and state education agencies, leading to duplicate records on the data file. These schools are run by BIE, but they also receive federal funds or federally funded services through the state. To avoid double counting of students, NCES created the BIEA flag. This flag has a value of either '1' or '2'; a value of '1' indicates an agency that contains a school that was reported by both a state and by BIE. All other agencies, including all BIE agencies, have a value of '2' in this field. New York City Schools. New York City is shown in NCES reports as a single school district. However, \"New York City Public Schools\" is reported in CCD as a supervisory union comprising multiple \"geographic districts\" and an additional \"special schools\" district. To aggregate NYC school data to the supervisory union, researchers must select schools with a state ANSI code equal to 36 and a supervisory union ID (UNION) equal to 300. See table D-1 for a list of geographic districts associated with the New York City Public School district."}, {"section_title": "C. Detailed Information about File Variables", "text": "This section includes detailed information specific to each variable on the file. The code in parentheses before the variable description indicates the variable name, which is also referenced in appendix A: Record Layout. Counts exclude closed, inactive or future LEAs (BOUND=2,6, or 7), and do not match counts in appendix B, Value Distribution and Field Frequencies, which include all LEAs. Operational status codes are defined below. (NAME) Name of Education Agency. Each record contains the name of the local education agency. CCD survey staff reviewed any record filling the 60 characters assigned and may have adjusted the agency name to improve readability (i.e., applied standard abbreviations). (PHONE) Area Code + Telephone Number. This field contains the telephone number of the education agency. (MSTREE) Mailing Address. This field contains the mailing address of the agency. This field may contain a street address or a P.O. Box number. If the mailing street, city, state, and ZIP Code fields were left blank, data from the corresponding location address fields were inserted. (MCITY) Mailing City Name. There may be some valid cases in which an agency may be located in one city and have a mailing address in another city. Each record contains a mailing city. (MSTATE) Mailing State (P.O. Abbreviation). Every record contains a two-letter U.S. Postal Service abbreviation for the state where the mailing address is located. Each record contains a mailing state. There are valid cases in which an agency may be located in one state and have a mailing address in another state. A list of agencies that have a mailing state code different from their ANSI state code is included at the end of this section in table 3. (MZIP, MZIP4) Mailing ZIP Code + 4. Each record contains a mailing ZIP Code. The last four digits may be left blank if unknown. (LSTREE) Location Street. This is the location address of the agency. If the location street, city, state, and ZIP Code fields were left blank, data from the corresponding mailing address fields were inserted. (TYPE) Education Agency Type Code. This is the NCES code for type of agency. Each record has an education agency type code. Agencies classified as supervisory union administrative centers (TYPE = 3) generally do not report student membership, although Virginia is an exception and reports students in membership for such agencies. The agency type codes are as follows: 1 = Local school district that is not a component of a supervisory union."}, {"section_title": "= Local school district component of a supervisory union sharing a superintendent and", "text": "administrative services with other local school districts. 3 = Supervisory union administrative center, or a county superintendent serving the same purpose. 4 = Regional education services agency, or a county superintendent serving the same purpose. 5 = State-operated institution charged, at least in part, with providing elementary and/or secondary instruction or services to a special-needs population. 6 = Federally operated institution charged, at least in part, with providing elementary and/or secondary instruction or services to a special-needs population. 7 = Agencies for which all associated schools are charter schools. 8 = Other education agencies that do not fit into the first seven categories. The code \"7\" response option for the TYPE field was changed for the agency file starting in 2007-08, and the code \"8\" response option was added to the file. In prior years, \"7\" represented other education agencies, including charter school agencies; in 2007-08, this code was changed to represent charter school agencies only, which did not have their own response option in prior years. Code \"8\" now represents other education agencies, excluding charter school agencies. (UNION) Supervisory Union Number. This field contains the ID number assigned by the state to the supervisory unit and component agencies. (CONAME) County Name. This field contains the name of the county in which the agency is located. Data users should note that starting with 2006-07 CCD, a different methodology was used to assign local education agency counties. In 2006-07, the county assignment is based on the physical location address of the local education agency. In prior years, counties were assigned to local education agencies based on the counties of the schools associated with the local education agency, weighted by student enrollment. (CONUM) ANSI County Code. This field contains the ANSI County Code for the county in which agency is located. Data users should note that starting in 2006-07 CCD, a different methodology was used to assign local education agency counties. In 2006-07, the county assignment is based on the physical location address of the local education agency. In prior years, counties were assigned to local education agencies based on the counties of the schools associated with the local education agency, weighted by student enrollment. In order to distinguish between the two methodologies, the older system of locale codes is referred to as \"metro-centric\" and the current system is referred to as \"urban-centric.\" LEA locale codes are derived from the locale codes of their associated schools, weighted by the number of students in membership for each school. The methodology used to assign locale codes is in the next section labeled \"Locale Code Methodology.\" The 12 urban-centric locale code categories are defined below. Locale codes are divided into four main locale types (city, suburb, town, and rural) and each of the four locale types has three subtypes (large, midsize, and small for city and suburb locale types and fringe, distant, and remote for town and rural locale types). 23 = Suburb, Small: Territory outside a principal city and inside an urbanized area with population less than 100,000. 31 = Town, Fringe: Territory inside an urban cluster that is less than or equal to 10 miles from an urbanized area. 32 = Town, Distant: Territory inside an urban cluster that is more than 10 miles and less than or equal to 35 miles from an urbanized area. 43 = Rural, Remote: Census-defined rural territory that is more than 25 miles from an urbanized area and is also more than 10 miles from an urban cluster. 2 = Education agency has closed with no effect on another agency's boundaries. 3 = New agency formed with no effect on another agency's boundaries. 4 = Agency was in existence, but not reported in previous year's CCD Agency Universe Survey, and is now being added. 5 = Agency has undergone a significant change in geographic boundaries or instructional responsibility. 6 = Agency is temporarily closed and may reopen within 3 years. 7 = Agency is scheduled to be operational within 2 years. 8 = Agency was closed on previous year's file but has reopened. Agencies with an operational status code of \"2\" remain in the file for one year for historical purposes. Code \"6\" and \"7\" response options for the BOUND field were added to the agency file starting in 2002-03. Code \"8\" response option for the BOUND field was added to the agency file starting in 2005-06. (BIEA) Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) Agency Flag. This field indicates whether or not the agency contains or operates schools that are also reported by the Bureau of Indian Education in their submission of school data. This field was added to the agency file in 2009-10. 1 = Yes."}, {"section_title": "= No.", "text": "Only agencies operated by states or jurisdictions other than the BIE can contain a value of \"1\" (\"Yes\") for this flag. (GSLO, GSHI) Low/High Grade span offered. These fields indicate the lowest grade and highest grade offered by the agency. These grades were calculated by NCES using two types of information reported by states: (a) binary 'grade offered' flags that indicate whether a given grade (e.g., prekindergarten, kindergarten, grade 1, etc.) was offered by the schools associated with the district; and (b) reports of enrollment by grade for schools associated with the districts. (PKOFFRD, KGOFFRD, \u2026, UGOFFRD) Grade Offered. These flags indicate whether an individual grade is offered. For example, PKOFFRD indicates whether prekindergarten is offered and KGOFFRD indicates whether kindergarten is offered. Not all states are able to report each of these items. Because teacher counts are collected at all three levels of the CCD files (school, agency, and state), one data anomaly is that the sum of teacher counts aggregated from the lower level to the state level may exceed the sum of teacher counts from a higher level aggregated to the state level (i.e., agency FTE data aggregated to the state level may exceed state-level FTE data) . Beginning with SY 2008-09, if the sum of teacher FTE aggregated to the state level reported on the school file exceeded the sum of teacher FTE aggregated to the state on the agency file or exceeded state file reports, teacher FTE may have been edited on one or more of the three levels. School-level FTE aggregated to the agency level is allowed to exceed agency-level FTE reports. (RACECAT) Race/ethnicities category indicator. The data item RACECAT is a race/ethnicities category indicator that indicates whether the state reported student enrollment counts by five race/ethnicity categories or seven race/ethnicity categories. Prior to SY 2008-09, NCES asked states to report student enrollment counts by five racial/ethnic categories. In SYs 2008-09 and 2009-10, NCES gave SEAs the option to choose between 5-category reporting and 7-category reporting For SY 2008-09, five states reported their race/ethnicity data in the seven categories and in SY 2009-10, fourteen states reported data in the 7-category reporting. Since SY 2010-11, NCES asked that all SEAs report race/ethnicity data in seven categories. All states and jurisdictions that responded to the EDFacts collection system reported data in the 7-category reporting. DoDEA, BIE, and American Samoa did not respond to the EDFacts collection. The data item RACECAT contains two values: In the current file, for the states that reported five race/ethnicity categories (i.e., RACECAT=5), the variables related to the Asian race category include students who are Asian, Hawaiian Native, or Pacific Islander; for the states that reported seven race/ethnicity categories (i.e., RACECAT=7), the variables related to the Asian race category include Asian students only. In appendix A, Record Layout, the race/ethnicity categories represented by the five and seven reporting categories are followed by a notation of \"(5)\" or \"(7),\" respectively. For more information on this change, please refer to the October 19, 2007 Federal Register notice, \"Final Guidance from the Secretary on Maintaining, Collecting and Reporting Racial and Ethnic Data to the U.S. Department of Education,\" located at http://www2.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/other/2007-4/101907c.html. Student membership (MEMBER), students by Grade (PK-12), by Race/Ethnicity, and by Sex. Membership is the count of students enrolled on October 1st of the school year. CCD collects membership counts at three levels: school, agency, and state. The total student membership reported by states at one level may often be different from what was reported at one or both of the other levels. In general, the total student membership on lower level file should be less than or equal to the total membership on higher level files. A common reason for these differences is that SEAs report a student membership in the school the student attends, but report a student's membership in the LEA that is financially responsible for the student. For example, a regular school district may not be able to provide services to students with special needs and may instead pay tuition for students to attend private schools that provide services to students with special needs. These students are then counted in the regular school district, but not in any of the schools in CCD school file. For states with membership discrepancies that exceed five percent of the lower level membership, CCD survey staff routinely follows up with SEAs and asks SEAs to verify the reported membership and provide explanations of the differences. In SY 2008-09, CCD began implementing editing procedures to correct for cross file inconsistencies on a case by case basis. If an SEA could not provide a plausible explanation for why there were inconsistencies across the SEA, LEA, and school files, CCD survey analysts applied cross file adjustments to student membership at one or more levels to ensure that the sum of the lower level membership does not exceed the sum of the higher level membership. Ungraded Students by Race/Ethnicity and by Sex. The classification of \"ungraded\" is not used for students in Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, American Samoa, the Bureau of Indian Education, Department of Defense Education Activity, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands."}, {"section_title": "District Locale Code Methodology", "text": "Locale code is a variable that NCES has created for general description, sampling, and other statistical purposes. It is based upon the location of the school buildings in the district and in some cases may not reflect the entire attendance area or residences of enrolled students. The district urban-centric locale codes were derived from the locale codes of schools within the district, weighted by the number of students in each locale type. District locale codes were assigned using the following rules. 1. If 50 percent or more of students attend schools with the same locale and locale subtype, that code is assigned to the district. For example, if 50 percent of the students in a district were in schools with the locale code of \"town, fringe,\" the district would be assigned a locale code of \"town, fringe.\" 2. For those districts where the majority of students do not fall into one of the 12 locale and subtype groupings, the student counts are aggregated into the 4 main locale types (city, suburb, town, or rural). The main locale type with the largest number of students is then examined to determine which subtype had the greatest number of students. That locale code and subtype is assigned to the district. For example, if 40 percent of students were in schools with a \"town\" locale code, 30 percent were in schools with a \"suburb\" locale code, and 30 percent were in schools with a \"rural\" locale code, the district would be assigned one of the subtypes of the \"town\" locale code. If 80 percent of the students in schools with \"town\" locale codes were in \"town, remote\" schools, the district would be assigned a locale code of \"town, remote.\" 3. If the number of students for two or more locale codes is the same, then the highest (i.e., most rural) locale code is assigned. 4. Districts with no schools or students were given a locale code of \"N\" (not applicable).

For an entity with a nonvoting delegate-the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico (whose delegate is referred to as a \"resident commissioner\"), and the U.S. Virgin Islands-the representational area is designated as \"98.\" Those entities with no representation in the Congress-the Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, and the several U.S. minor outlying islands are designated as \"99.\" Although congressional district codes are unique within each state and equivalent entity, and for each Congress, the congressional districts in different states may have the same code. For example, the First Congressional District of Alabama and of Arizona are both coded \"01.\" Since the Common Core of Data (CCD) requires the identification of congressional districts in more than one state, the congressional district code is preceded by the ANSI State numeric code. For example, the First Congressional District of Arizona is coded \"0401,\" with the first two digits (04) representing the ANSI State numeric code."}, {"section_title": "Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA)", "text": "If an area that qualifies as a metropolitan area (MA) has more than one million people, two or more core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) may be defined within it.
